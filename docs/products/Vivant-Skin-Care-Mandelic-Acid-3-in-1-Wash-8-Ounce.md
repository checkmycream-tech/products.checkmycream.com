### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Its a wonderful prodcut</li>
      <li>This is a great wash and that review doesn&#x27;t reflect the opinion of someone who has used it.</li>
      <li>Great product, I use it on shaving area to prevent scars</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this stuff has changed my life.</li>
      <li>This soap is so nice on my skin.</li>
      <li>It suds up nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a cure, but it is the best wash I&#x27;ve found thus far for my ongoing fight with hormonal acne.</li>
      <li>The 3 in 1 wash is great though and will give you a fresh, smooth, clean complexion that will leave people complimenting your &amp;#34;natually beautiful skin&amp;#34;...</li>
      <li>Very impressed with this product, had worked better than anything else to keep my skin and scalp clear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been to my dermatologist for many years.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very much in love with the product, i have recomended to my friends</li>
      <li>Where most medicated shampoos did not relieve scalp itch, this product did.</li>
      <li>I liked how gentle this wash was</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very drying which is perfect for my extra oily skin.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I started using it in my normal regime and was happy with the results since it was making my skin so clear and smooth like I had from the facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I got this compliment I laughed because before this I had sensitive acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>This is my ultimate favorite from this line!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
      <li>originally bought it at my local spa for quite a bit more.</li>
      <li>I used 3% at first and then switched to 9%.</li>
      <li>the mandelic acid is a gentle acid  that is derived from almonds, and I am convinced it is a miracle!</li>
      <li>The serum, I reccomend using once every 3-7 days just because it is higher concentration</li>
      <li>The antioxidant wash does crazy good things to your skin that honestly I don’t even know how to describe.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great too, just too harsh for daily use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As a bonus, it also assists with acne prone skin; which I normally deal with once a month. ;)</li>
      <li>Beware this product can be very drying to the skin.  </li>
      <li>It also is gentle on your hair.</li>
      <li>and you really shouldn&#x27;t be putting that much of any acid on your face.</li>
      <li>I first went on my hunt for mandelic acid after having a facial at a spa with it, on my seach and after reading many reviews I foud this product line and actually bought the 15% mandellic acid serum first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  really effective but also really harsh to sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t use a really intense moisturizer, my skin dries out completely.</li>
      <li>Nothing has worked to clear it up until now!</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this wash--just bought my third bottle--my skin has consistently improved.</li>
      <li>I have always had problems with my skin and this soap has completely changed my skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super careful to use just a drop</li>
      <li>It helps, but I have not found anything to totally clear my acne.</li>
      <li>If you have any type of razor burn it will clear that up as well.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve tried everything to clear up your skin, give this product a shot.</li>
      <li>Then I found this face wash and it completely changed my life.</li>
      <li>The only thing that really cleared my skin was taking antibiotics.</li>
      <li>and my old scars didn&#x27;t fade.</li>
      <li>This product actually does make a difference, and I&#x27;m really thankful.</li>
      <li>I think within another 6 weeks that acne scars will be completely gone.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the Mandelic 3-in-1 Wash, I can now take my long showers, during the fall and winter, and not worry about my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not drying at all, but has done wonders to clear up existing breakouts and prevents them from coming back.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very much in love with the product, i have recomended to my friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 bottles of this and it works for my skin!</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it on shaving area to prevent scars</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate favorite from this line! the mandelic acid is a gentle acid  that is derived from almonds, and I am convinced it is a miracle! I first went on my hunt for mandelic acid after having a facial at a spa with it, on my seach and after reading many reviews I foud this product line and actually bought the 15% mandellic acid serum first. I started using it in my normal regime and was happy with the results since it was making my skin so clear and smooth like I had from the facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 in 1 wash is different from the serum... you can use it every day. The serum, I reccomend using once every 3-7 days just because it is higher concentration and you really shouldn&#x27;t be putting that much of any acid on your face. The 3 in 1 wash is great though and will give you a fresh, smooth, clean complexion that will leave people complimenting your &amp;#34;natually beautiful skin&amp;#34;... The first time I got this compliment I laughed because before this I had sensitive acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> This product has helped fade acne scars but I also used mandelic facial serum, mandelic toner and mandelic acid peel 30% for 6 weeks. I think within another 6 weeks that acne scars will be completely gone. All 4 products were needed for results. I use the serum every night, use the peel once a week, wash and use the toner twice a day. I had previously tried Murad, hydroquione with no results for 4 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product together with the exfoliating cleanser to try to treat my recalcitrant acne.  It works well in getting the oil deep down in my skin.  Beware this product can be very drying to the skin.  Start by using once a week to once a month.  It helps, but I have not found anything to totally clear my acne.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this stuff has changed my life. I had suffered from horrible skin for 20 years. This stuff allows any problem area to lose redness in less than 24 hours. Its a wonderful prodcut and I recommend it to anyone who has skin issues</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  really effective but also really harsh to sensitive skin. If I don&#x27;t use a really intense moisturizer, my skin dries out completely. It&#x27;s still 5 stars because I have seen noticeable improvement of my acne and my SFs.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris which gives me red bumps on my skin and I read that this would help. Sadly it hasn&#x27;t shown any results, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using it wrong or what. For the price I was hoping it&#x27;d work.</li>
    <li> Struggled with acne for 10+ years, even 2 rounds of accutane. Then I found this face wash and it completely changed my life. I dare you to give it a try -- I hope it works as well for you as it does for me!</li>
    <li> Vivant Skin Care has created a body wash and shampoo that has become a game changer. Thanks to the Mandelic 3-in-1 Wash, I can now take my long showers, during the fall and winter, and not worry about my skin. My hands, legs, feet, and yes, even my scalp, have never been softer. The 3-in-1 Wash helps to hydrate even the driest of skin. As a bonus, it also assists with acne prone skin; which I normally deal with once a month. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we are putting it all out there on the table, there are also times when I get ingrown hairs under my arms from shaving. At the ripe old age of 33, I have even found a few in my chin/neck area … talk about nightmare! BUT, no more! The antioxidant wash does crazy good things to your skin that honestly I don’t even know how to describe. Now, I am not a doctor or dermatologist but I know what I like. I am considering getting my sister a bottle when I place my next order. I don’t know a woman or man, for that matter, who would not want softer, smoother skin and the Vivant Skin Care Mandelic 3-in-1 Wash can help!</li>
    <li> Where most medicated shampoos did not relieve scalp itch, this product did. It also is gentle on your hair. Will be ordering again. Packaged well. Received on time. Good price.</li>
    <li> I liked how gentle this wash was but  I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin. I continued to get acne and my old scars didn&#x27;t fade. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne for as long as I can remember! I&#x27;ve been to my dermatologist for many years. The only thing that really cleared my skin was taking antibiotics. I didnt want to be on antibiotics for a long period of time so I stopped. I&#x27;ve been trying Acanya and Differin gel with a separate bleaching cream. This has not helped by any means. The bleaching cream does clear my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this 3 n 1 wash and the toner &amp;#60;3%&amp;#62; from Hautelook. It&#x27;s been 3 days since I&#x27;ve received my order. My pimples that were visible are drying up.!  There are a few that are coming to the surface. So far so good. It&#x27;s also very drying which is perfect for my extra oily skin. My face stays matte longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this on my back or scalp &amp;#60;severe dandruff&amp;#62; as of late. But I&#x27;ll try to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demographics: Black, 27YO female, resides in Louisiana, combination, oily skin, and suffered with acne for 15 years.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with my skin and this soap has completely changed my skin! If you have any type of razor burn it will clear that up as well. It does cost quite a bit but you only use a tiny amount at a time and it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a cure, but it is the best wash I&#x27;ve found thus far for my ongoing fight with hormonal acne.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have had troublesome acne for a few years now. Nothing has worked to clear it up until now! This product actually does make a difference, and I&#x27;m really thankful. A little too expensive but I&#x27;ll spend the few extra dollars for clearer skin.</li>
    <li> It was the wrong type but I do thank you for letting me return it.  I found the one that I like and ordered it instead.  It has a type of granule in it that exfoliates the skin.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product, had worked better than anything else to keep my skin and scalp clear.</li>
    <li> If you have never heard of Mandelic Acid, you are missing out! This soap is so nice on my skin. It&#x27;s not drying at all, but has done wonders to clear up existing breakouts and prevents them from coming back. Since I&#x27;ve started using this wash--just bought my third bottle--my skin has consistently improved. Someone gave this product a low review because she was sent the wrong item. I hate when people do that! This is a great wash and that review doesn&#x27;t reflect the opinion of someone who has used it. For the record, I&#x27;ve bought the other wash she was talking about and it&#x27;s great too, just too harsh for daily use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Mandelic Acid toner. I used 3% at first and then switched to 9%. I didn&#x27;t do as well on 9%--too drying for me. If you&#x27;ve tried everything to clear up your skin, give this product a shot. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but so worth it. I&#x27;m super careful to use just a drop and that&#x27;s all I need. It suds up nice. You can also use it as a shampoo, but I&#x27;ve never tried it that way. I LOVE THIS STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought it at my local spa for quite a bit more.</li>
