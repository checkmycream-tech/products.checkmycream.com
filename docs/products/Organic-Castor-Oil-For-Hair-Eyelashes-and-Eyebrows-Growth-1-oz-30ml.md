<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loving this product! Ordered this about a month ago for my eyebrows and saw results about 2 weeks in! You just have to be consistent and remember to massage it through ! I also have been trying it on my scalp, I recently had a child so my hair started to fall off drastically , this item helped a lot!!! Try it ! I highly recommend this item!!!!  Joann Hoang</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!! I use it at night on my eyebrows and have noticed remarkable growth! The scent is subtle and the packaging is adorable. I will re purchase when I am out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Ive always heard that castor oil helps with hair growth and I have been using it on my eyebrows for about 2 weeks now and I am already seeing great results! Customer service was excellent and shipping was fast. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Delivery date was as promised Just started using the product</li>
    <li> I have been using g this for a while and I don&#x27;t see any difference. ..... I have not grown any of my eye brows yet. Shame, I thought it really worked, now my heart is broken.....</li>
    <li> Good, viscous oil that stays put. It does not put out a strong odor, so it&#x27;s very pleasant to use on the face. It very much seems like exactly what is advertised, so I was very pleased with the product. Additionally, I appreciate that the seller was very prompt in processing my order.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! My daughter was born with these little bald spot that wouldn&#x27;t grow hair! I started to apply it twice a week. So it worked for her so I&#x27;m super happy! :)  I thought hair would grow on my fingertips it worked so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gustavo G.</li>
    <li> Great results for my lashes... I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Was not a believer in thinking this will help my lashes grow... Although, I had an accident with my eyelash curler one morning and my arm slipped and I pulled out a good chunk of the upper corner of my eyelashes. I freaked out because my wedding was 3 months away!! This is why I originally wanted to try this out. I would apply this thick oil with a clean mascara wand on my lashes before bed to hydrate it from the daily mascara use to strengthen them. I don&#x27;t know if it has lengthen my lashes but they seem slightly longer when I apply my mascara. Aside from seeing if it lengthen my lashes my eyelashes did grown back in time... That was the most important part of me writing this review. The empty patches on my eyebrows are fuller and it worked for that issue as well!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, I have used it to grow out my eyebrows and it took some time but it works nicely</li>
    <li> This product does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Robert B.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Shipped fast and easy to order!</li>
    <li> Works really fast! Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great Product got on on time and was properly packet. Now I will see if it really works for my hair</li>
    <li> Trying to use it to grow out my eyebrows and eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and friendly customer service.  Great product, actually noticing my eyebrow hairs growing thicker. I use once daily. Will purchase again!  LINDA U. - Texas</li>
    <li> The quality of the Castor Oil is great...but I do believe this is a long term treatment...so its way too soon to notice any specific results as of yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my edges and I have seen some improvement.  I also get breakouts in my scalp and I&#x27;ve been using this whenever I get a breakout and by the next day it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using a blend of Castor oil and coconut oil a facial cleaning method.  This is great high quality Oil and I have been extremely happy.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I thought by now I would have seen some results  by now.  It supposedly is used to make your eyelashes grow. Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> Loved the product!! works wonderful , eyebrows and lashes grew.</li>
    <li> Great product I used on my and as well as my daughter.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair soft. The dropper keeps me from using too much. Too soon to tell if the temple hair is growing but my scalp definitely loves the moisture.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my eyelashes and eyebrows grow out evenly.</li>
    <li> I have seen great results in my eyelashes. They look more full and beautiful and my eyebrows look more full as well. This product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am really liking the results so far. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is great. I got it to help with hair growth and I feel like it really does the trick! I also really like the packaging and it is great for travel.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Nice thick consistency, only need a drop for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> When my friend told me about this product , at first I didn&#x27;t believe her. I later decided to give it a try and omg ! It works ! I been using this product almost a month now and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in my lashes like crazy especially when I apply my mascara.  I love love this product and I actually order my second bottle. Castor oil is a secret to my beauty and worlds can&#x27;t explain how crazy this product works !&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to everyone and please just be patient you will your result soon.</li>
    <li> Will this work for facial hair ?</li>
    <li> It shipped and arrive rarely fast I love this and I pray I see results while my hair is braided</li>
    <li> i feel like it&#x27;s actually working and it&#x27;s easy to use! love it - R.G</li>
    <li> Love using on my eyelashes nightly to moisturize and help them grow.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil based on online reviews. I read that it is great for eyelashes and brows. I have been using on both as well as on my nail cuticles. Love it . Andrea F.</li>
    <li> Based on the review (hundreds reviews I have had read) this oil works for hair growing. So I ordered 2 of these. I am using it for three weeks now and I can see the difference in my hair. It gets thicker. Remember to massage itnon your scalp. I ised it overnight. Apply it before I go to bed and shower in the morning. My hair gets moisturized as bonus! Fast and Reliable effectiveness. I am going to this again once I finished my stock. The best Castor Oil I have ever tried as a beginner. If I am where you. I&#x27;d rather get this one. Also Organic and no Chemical ingredients. Fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I just got mine recently! I love it.</li>
    <li> AmaZing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I lost my lashes when I got eye lash extensions and I ordered this and my lashes grew back.I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews on this, and was curious how well this product was going to work for me. And guess what??? It HAS WORKED. I use it on my scalp, my beard and eyebrows! It makes them fuller and manageable. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this Organic Castor Oil. Will be ordering more, because my son and mother have been dipping into lately!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for providing us with this product.  The product is great, we have been using it since we received it.  The service was excellent and very prompt.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on days where my hair has it&#x27;s back and forth &amp;#34;episodes&amp;#34; to make sure it doesn&#x27;t loose track of essential healthiness, i&#x27;ve noticed also with the 2 days in a row that I used it, it seemed to have a definite overall shine and natural kind of look and feel to it, I HIGHLY recommend this to someone who is shying away from silicone and sulfate shampoo&#x27;s because this oil may conflict back and forth resulting in a situation of drying hair.(Meaning just make home remedies that match up with this oil)Overall a 5 star product for sure.</li>
    <li> This product is really helping with my hair growth.  Steven S.</li>
    <li> I have noticed such an improvement in my hair growth! I put in a couple drops almost everyday to my conditioner. Im not sure if my hair is just super damaged from all dying I do, but it DOES NOT leave my hair greasy what so ever and I love it! I put some on my eyebrows for about two hours then wash it off and I have noticed a MAJOR improvement with my eyebrows. Ive always just had thin hair so I was dying to get my hands on this! Plus I just chopped my hair in January to an A-LINE and now its almost to my collarbone and my hair has NEVER grown this fast! Ive only been using it about a month maybe. I LOVE THIS! I even got my boyfriends mom hooked cause she has thin hair as well. So ladies, if you want to grow your hair, or eyebrows DO IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I would like to add that I have some redness around my nose (genetic, thanks dad)&lt;br /&gt;And if I dab a little bit on there a couple times a week, I have noticed it has almost vanished!&lt;br /&gt;I can not wait to see the major difference when I compare at the end of the year!</li>
    <li> Loved this product!  A little bit goes a long way and It has really helped to fill in my eyebrows and make my eyelashes longer and thicker. Emily C.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Company personally called me to see if I was happy. When does that ever happen? Would highly recommend this Organic Castor Oil to anyone 👍🏽</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it works yet</li>
    <li> I use this product every night on my hair and eye lashes and it really helps hair grow. I&#x27;m a happy customer</li>
    <li> Really helping with eyebrow growth</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it to help my lashes grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Z.P</li>
    <li> It is a very good product, fast delivery and the results are true. Jenifer Valente.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> Excellent Oil! A few drops and it does what. It claims. It is viscous. I&#x27;d recommend it being mixed with a lighter oil for the perfect result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apurva.H</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product which requires little discipline. I am using it on my eyebrows and sure enough, they are beginning to thicken!&lt;br /&gt;Give thanks!!!</li>
    <li> My friend told me about Castor Oil after an eyebrow incident lol. I needed to regrow my eyebrows and withing 4 to 6 weeks, my eyebrows were back to normal using the castor oil every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Giovanna T.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my eye brows, edges and the nape fell out because of stress and eczema. I applied the castor oil on my eye brows, edges, and nape area every night. After a couple of weeks my eye brows were thick and full again. The eczema cleared up on neck and the hair started to grow back around my edge. I am on my 3rd bottle and I also purchased a bottle for my mom.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Great product. Works well and stays on.</li>
    <li> a little thicker than I thought, but still what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised about Castor Oil. I have tried many things for dry skin, but this seems to even have a residual effect. I am using it on my face, lashes and brows ... so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Moisturizers well &amp; helps with dermatitis on face. My face doesn&#x27;t like too many products out there but it likes this one.</li>
    <li> Good product, does help tighten my skin, reduce blemishes and scarring.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Has been great on my eyelashes and brows--several people have told me how great my lashes and brows are looking/growing</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any difference or New hair growth, maybe a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipping! Recommended ten fold. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I never used castor oil to grow my eyebrows but have read many articles about it, so decided to give a try. I like this that is is organic and the service and delivery was great. Will give  a review in about a month to post if it made a difference on me. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. I will give it two more months to confirm.</li>
    <li> Am so happy about this product.i lost my edges to braids and I purchased this to grow them back.&lt;br /&gt;I received it promptly and the seller was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency- not too thick or runny.its smell is not so fantastic however it&#x27;s not horrible.i added some scented oil to it and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product cos even though I have only used it for about a month, I have started seeing some significant growth. I also use it for my eyelashes with a mascara wand&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural and cold pressed which is amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered castor oil for my hair, eyebrows and lashes because a dear old friend of mine told me Castor oil helps in growth of hair. She also told me to keep applying it as it doesn&#x27;t work immediately, which made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;I found the oil helped but I also don&#x27;t apply it as often as I should, but I believe my eyebrows are filling in.&lt;br /&gt;The huge thing I like about this oil is in the dry winter, I get nasty cuts on my fingertips close to the nails. These cuts are painful, kind of like getting a paper cut. I would put on other oils &amp; lotions, then a bandaid at night to try and heal these cuts. That never worked well.&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this oil, I again got one of those open cuts on my thumb. I decided to put this Castor Oil on it one night. The next morning, and this is TRUE, the cut was closed up! No more pain! This oil is amazing. I IS thick and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any oher way. Now, about once a week, I massage it on my hands in the evening and take care to rub my fingertips, nails and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, do you have any skin tabs? I had one under my right eye and dabbed on a bit of this oil, 3-4 times. I also had a bigger skin tab on my hip that I applied the oil to, 3-4 times. They simply fell off.&lt;br /&gt;For these reasons I very much like this oil.</li>
    <li> I had been buying much more expensive products for my brows and lashes.  This product is a fraction of the cost and I&#x27;m seeing better results than ever!</li>
    <li> After a month of daily use, my eyebrows became thicker.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal!  I&#x27;ve been applying it to my eyelashes for a week and my girlfriend even noticed that they were longer and thicker without me even mentioning it OR mentioning the fact that I had been using castor oil on them!  This stuff WORKS!</li>
    <li> It arrived fast . This stuff really works.I bought it for my eyelashes and they feel stronger and look better.</li>
    <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my lashes works great.</li>
    <li> Great on the skin. I use about a pea-sized amount on my face and neck before bed. I&#x27;ve been using it on my fried ends also. Doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells. A small amount goes a long way. I bought this a couple months ago and I&#x27;ve still got over half a bottle.</li>
    <li> this actually worked on my eyebrows! definitely will invest in more once I run out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for over a year. I recently order a new one and I&#x27;m so mad , it irritates my eyes . I can even use this product anymore because as soon as I apply the product to my eyelid my eyes start watering . So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value. Perfect for skin and eyelashes.</li>
    <li> My hair grew so my h using this product</li>
    <li> I have a lot of problems with my scalp and hair. My hair tends to be dry and frizzy and I have tried all different kinds of hair treatments and oils to overcome that. This Castor Oil leaves my hair feeling soft and really does help reduce frizziness. I will probably keep testing other things, but this is one of the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product. I use it on my eyebrows to make them more full and it has been about a month since i first used this product and i can already see results. It is quicker and more efficient than the previous caster oil i purchased for sure.</li>
    <li> Great oil &amp; customer service!  I liked the smaller bottle with dropper, it&#x27;s easy to travel with and use.  The oil is a nice, thick quality and you only need one or two droops at a time.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but I like how it makes my eyelashes and eyebrows feel in the morning after night-use and I have noticed that less hairs fall out.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my eyebrows and lashes for a month now.  The product works great.  Not only are my brows and lashes growing, but I&#x27;m also losing far fewer hairs.  I would highly recommend this product.  I will buy it again for myself.</li>
    <li> I am a person with super sensitive skin. I love hair care, I use a drop or two in my conditioner and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product and if you use only the recommended amounts as suggested, it actually last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ma Donna M</li>
    <li> It was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I can see the difference growing on my eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;Im super happy about this !</li>
    <li> My order of Cammile Q organic castor oil was shipped on time and in excellent condition. I am pleased with the product, It conditions my eyelashes, and I no longer experience breakage. I use it on my eyebrows, and have noticed  that they seem a bit fuller. I will continue to use this product to see if I can obtain the results I am looking for. In all, I am happy with this product, especially because it is pure and natural. I would recommend it to any one who wants to condition their eyebrows and lashes.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> The oil is good and thick and light in color, like pure, cold-pressed castor oil is supposed to be. I use it on my fingernails and cuticles - my nails are longer and stronger. I use it on my eyelashes - my lashes are definitely thicker and darker, and I lose fewer when I remove eye makeup. I use it in my hair (only before a wash or in tiny quantities on the ends) - my hair is growing nicely, and I experience less hair fall. After letting a mexture of castor oil, vitamin E oil, sweet almond oil, and coconut oil set in my hair for a couple of hours and then THOROUGHLY washing it out, my hair is super soft. This is good stuff, and even though it is a small bottle, it lasts a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I love how it makes my hands feel so soft and smooth.  Although it is obviously an oil, as in castor oil, it does not have an odor and very quickly the oil is absorbed and does not leave a greasy residue on your hands.  Added bonus is the organic!</li>
    <li> Thank you! I am in love with the product. It arrived safely and on time. Works great as a moisturizer and for my eyebrows and lashes regrowth. It was an amazing experience and I will use the oil in the future for sure.</li>
    <li> I have heard so many positive comments about castor oil that I just had to have one in hand! I want to use it mainly on my hair and whatever else it may help with. The smell is pretty unique, it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great but it doesn&#x27;t badly smell niether. As of now I can&#x27; t say how this is working because am a newbie to this, but i&#x27; ll keep posting. I would use this on my eyelashes as I heard it helps them grow but am skeptical on that one since I know it&#x27; ll probably burn my eyes badly if applied incorrectly. I can&#x27;t wait for some results though! One other thing, this oil is thick so when applying to the hair make sure not to pour to much of it just 2 drops at most.</li>
    <li> WOW-several benefits in one product!! I purchased the product to aid with malasma. Not only did it help fade the discoloration on my face, I noticed my skin looked younger and clearer--even the clogged pores on my nose that I&#x27;ve always had disappeared. Now I&#x27;m a believer and don&#x27;t use any lotion on my face. I used to use heavily researched eye creams, light moisturizers, and heavy moisturizers where needed. This product keeps it simple, inexpensive, and frankly much more effective than anything I&#x27;ve used.  My regimen is now vitamin c gel face wash, aloe Vera, and castor oil at night, replacing the castor oil with sunscreen during the day. I bought it for one reason but saw multiple unexpected benefits as well-my eyelashes are also longer as I rub the oil on them too.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for my skin and hear. I am using it every day and I already started seeing good results. I love it.</li>
    <li> So Happy with my Castor Oil..have been using it on my eyebrows for 3 weeks ..and can see new hair growth</li>
    <li> Great product. I wanted longer and fuller eyelashes along with better eyebrows. I have had the oil for about a month now and I&#x27;m already seeing the results. I will continue to use this product till it is empty!!! Strongly recommend this to anyone wanting better eyelashes and eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Got this for thinning eyelashes! The smell is a bit strong but once you put it on it dissipates quickly. No worries about that. The oil is thick but blends in quickly when warmed up by your touch. Great size bottle, very carefully packaged, and arrived very quickly. I have used several products from this brand before and the quality was great- hence why I chose this one for my castor oil. As a makeup and beauty product junkie I was excited to get this to try out!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it around my eyes and on my lips before bed.  Really helps with winter dryness, keeping your skin healthy.  Will be reordering.  Kathy C</li>
    <li> Quality Oil. Very nourishing for my scalp and hair. Used it almost everyday for 2 months while I had braided extensions. I did not experience any drying of the scalp or itching. Will continue to use once I take my braided extensions out for my natural hair upkeep. A must purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully thick and clear oil. I purchased to help regrow my eyebrows after years of plucking and it works well. I typically use 2x per week. Product arrived quickly and as described. I would definitely re-buy.</li>
    <li> The best quality oil.</li>
    <li> This product helped me grow a little patch of hair in about a month but I did use it everyday. I used it once around my eyes at night and I am a women who spends money on anti aging stuff (Meaningful Beauty and Dr, D). No more this stuff with my skin is perfect and the other products are great but I now am saving hundreds. Do yourself a favor and buy.....FYI I have fair sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> Still currently testing but so far its ok. I heard one of my favorite youtube bloggers mention this as part of her beauty routine. She says its good for the growth of eyelashes and eyebrows. I want to grow and get more eyelashes and my sister who has really small ones would like to grow hers longer. We have been using it for a few days and they still look the same but like when you add a moisturizer to your hair. I will be back to update my review after a few more days.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Definitely works. My hair in two months has grown a lot. In addition it looks healthier, even with the whole styling I do!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are longer! I thought to try this and it did actually work. Not only are they longer but they are stronger as well. I&#x27;ve never used it in my hair so i don&#x27;t know about that but i put some on my eyelashes every few days and it really does work!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!perfect for eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;Rn</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and well packaged. I really like the glass dropper. I made up a batch of castor oil mixed with cedarwood essential oil for an in home treatment of thinning hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last month a couple of times a week. My hair is definitely shinier and softer. Time will tell if this is a good combo for me with respect to regrowth. Overall, an excellent product.FazirM</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the castor oil, it lasts a long time &amp; it came in good condition and at the schedule date. I would recommend this to a friend &amp; already have. I really enjoy this product</li>
    <li> So far, I have had little change in my hair somewhat disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to repair and grow my damaged eyelashes after having extensions on them for a while. So far it has helped to grow my lashes in a short amout of time. I will have to wait and see how effective it is overall once more time has passed. So far - so good.</li>
    <li> Really thick...not sure it works</li>
    <li> All I say is too greasy!</li>
    <li> Excellent experience!</li>
    <li> Small bottle, big results. The small bottle goes a long way. Used it for dryness of skin and on my scalp. Very soothing and better results than all those other over the counter creams and ointments. Sometimes &#x27;old school&#x27; is just better!&lt;br /&gt;John W</li>
    <li> I really like the way that this product makes my hair and scalp feel. It seems to last a lot longer than the others.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Judy B.</li>
    <li> Product works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Hooked!!</li>
    <li> Really it did nothing for my hair.my hair is still the same,no growth no thickness.can i get a refund?</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my scalp to strengthen my hair and for hopes of thickening it. It leaves my scalp feels moisturized. I will update when I have time to test for any additional growth. Highly recommend for it&#x27;s moisturizing properties.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. Appears to be a good product.  This is the first I&#x27;ve used it for a new skin cleansing routine (mixed with EVOO) and it appears to be working.&lt;br /&gt;-Mona S.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a reasonable time and the product is gr8!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. The dropper makes application very easy and mess free. The bottle seals tightly. Very happy with product and customer service. I will definitely be buying this again in the future</li>
    <li> Great Product! I like how it moisturizes my hair.</li>
    <li> Smelled new (not rancid) as it is mostly odorless and clear colored. I use it on my face at night although it does not absorb quickly, I live in a dry cold climate and castor oil keeps my skin glowing and without wrinkles. I do not use any other moisturizer except a base of coconut or olive oil to help disperse the castor oil as it is too thick and sticky otherwise.</li>
    <li> Great product,after about 4 weeks of use,I can definitely see a difference in my lashes. They are fuller and longer....</li>
    <li> Make my hair so soft . this stuff is amazing and most of all, it came very fast. If you want to grow your eyelashes and also  soften your hair , this is definitely the way to go. I cant not say enough great things about this product. I am so happy with the outcome of softer skin, hair and most of all a great misturizer that does not leave my skin feeling clogged. Its also  great to get longer  , beautiful eyelashes, thank you, What excited you about the product in the first place was the anticipation that i could get longer  fuller eyelashes. -I currently use the product twice a day. once in the morning, and 1 hour before I go to bed. My eyelashes are fuller, longer and in only a short time , like 21 days , and most of all I have been using the product for 2 months. I am very happy overall. Leixy K.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free for my 100% honest review. So here it goes. I was a bit worried about try this on my colored hair. but I went a head and added a few drops to my roots and a little bit to my tips. I did not put it all the way through my hair. and I love what it has done for my hair. my hair that is going by my roots looks so healthy and I have seen a little bit more rapid growth. My hair grows pretty fast on it&#x27;s own so I can see that it is growing fast with the use of this amazing oil.. I have also been using it on my eyelashes and on my eye brows. I apply just a little bit every night after washing my face to my eyebrows and eyelashes with a q-tip. and I sleep with it on. I wash my face in the morning I have noticed that the little bald spots on my eyebrows are filling in  I can&#x27;t wait to see what longer use brings. my eyelashes I am not sure if they are growing but they are a lot stronger than they were before and thicker. I want to by a clear mascara and  see what that looks like. but all in all I am completely happy with the organic castor oil. I have to admit I was a bit hesitate to use it at first and now it has be add to my products I need to keep in my beauty regiment.&lt;br /&gt; I also once a week put 2 drops in my hands and putting a light layer of it all over my face, I take two more drops and put it on my shoulders and neck area, I put it pretty much every where for 10 minutes and then I go take a show and wash normally and it has help my skin have a nice glow to it...summer is coming everyone and once a week to have nice looking healthy skin is so worth it to me. I will be adding photos of my hair and every thing soon. I just haven&#x27;t taken any yet but to show the great things that castor oil has done for my hair and body.</li>
    <li> I am speechless on what to say about this product. It&#x27;s WONDERFUL. My hair is much more fuller and thicker!! I&#x27;ve grown so much hair in just 2 weeks of using this. Definitely worth buying. Castor Oil is apart of me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Can&#x27;t wait for 2-3 months before seeing denser hair. Like the thick consistency. It doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a short time  and I already notice longer lashes and hair. I have less fall when I comb and blow dry also. I will continue to use this product!  Sarah L.</li>
    <li> Really good. Seeing good results in my temples.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have seen any changes in my hair. I sometimes use it right before showering in my hair as a treatment. It is very thick and heavy. A little does go a long way but it didn&#x27;t do much to my hair. You can leave out the conditioner when using this product since it&#x27;s so thick!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! I use it on  my hair and on my skin. (Not my face but many people use it on their face)  it is very thick and a little goes a long way. They say it helps hair grow. I&#x27;m not sure if that is true but my hair looks so healthy now! It&#x27;s organic too which is always a plus!</li>
    <li> Eyebrows have definitely grown , they on fleek , I don&#x27;t have to color fill it , I use maybeline brow drama.</li>
    <li> Dropper bottle means you won&#x27;t get the oil contaminated like when you buy a big bottle.  Castor oil is great for dry eyes.  My eyes get very dry.  Sometimes I put a little in my eyes(a fraction of a small drop) before showering.  Then after a while, I put my contact lenses on.  Sometimes my &amp;#34;moist, daily disposable&amp;#34; EXPENSIVE(!)contact lenses will literally pop off of my eyeballs because my eyes are that hot and dry.  This really helps.  I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different eyedrops and they don&#x27;t work.  But the oil will help all day.  I don&#x27;t use it every day on my eyeballs though, that could give you a nasty sinus cold.  I also use the oil on my brows and eyelashes.  It grows your brows and lashes, it really does and keeps them shiny and moisturized.  If your body gets overheated, gently rub a drop on your navel and underbelly area.  This can help if you have heat cramps, diarrhea, menstrual cramps or related problems that heat causes, especially in the summertime or unventilated places.  Castor oil has a wonder cooling power.  Not just a sensation or feeling of cooling you, it physically cools your body wherever you apply it.  You don&#x27;t really need more than one to a few drops whenever you use it so this little bottle should last a long time.  You can also use it lightly on your hairline area or areas where your hair is sparse.  Your hair will love it!</li>
    <li> Good product in on time</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly because it is so thick and rich. I put drops on my scalp and massage it in and let my hair drink it in for a couple hours. I then wash my hair with organic shampoo and I end up with the softest and shiniest hair ever!</li>
    <li> Since I went through menopause I have had extremely dry eyes to the point where I had to stop wearing my contact lenses, regular eye drops did not help at all. Doing some research I found that eyes have an &amp;#34;oily layer&amp;#34; and castor oil was suggested as a natural remedy. I chose this oil because it is 100% organic and safe for use around the eyes. The oil is thick, clear and no odor. I would rather have a small bottle of the best oil, than a bigger bottle of a lesser quality. It comes with a dropper and a little goes a long way. I have been applying a generous amount to my eyelashes every night for the last few weeks, and letting it ooze down into my eyes. My eyelashes are in better condition and my eyes feel so much better. The dryness and irritation are gone and I was able to wear my contacts without discomfort for the first time in months!</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if it is working.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe it.  My brows were thinning - and I mean, really thinning.  I even developed a gap in one of them.  I figured it was age and likely no good solution then read about this on-line and figured I&#x27;d try it but was skeptical.  One month later, my brows are back to normal.  No gap and they look beautiful.  I&#x27;m so happy!  Worth every penny.  I use so little, this jar will likely last forever although now I am thinking of trying it on my lashes and hair.</li>
    <li> after years of plucking my brows have thinned out sooooo much ! i thought they would never grow back .. i used a few different brow serums but none that i noticed any difference .. ive been using this stuff for about a month now , i apply it every night with a clean mascara brush &amp; OMGGGG !! HUGEEE difference !! there so much fuller !!! this stuff is really thick so a little bit really does go along way. but i recommend it for anyhone looking for fuller brows</li>
    <li> I received my second bottle today.  Beautiful product!  When I opened the bottle it smelled fresh and not rancid.  I have been buying castor oil for over 25 years and for the first time I can actually smell the purity of real castor oil.  Fine product and  outstanding service,  I will order again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Perfect for eyelashes and weak edges</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Working pretty good love it ❤️</li>
    <li> My name is Cynthia Mina. I am Justin&#x27;s mom. I was the one who ordered the Castor Oil and it is very effective. I used it everyday for my eye brows and I can see the difference. I recommend this oil to a friend of mine. I will keep on using this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> So when I was in high school, I over plucked my eyebrows and they have never grown back since. I&#x27;ve tried hair growth pills, not plucking for months, eating really well, nothing worked. I started putting this on about a month ago and while they haven&#x27;t grown back completely, I am noticing a huge change in my brows. There is definitely a lot more hair</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this purchase . It&#x27;s thicker and better from other castor oil. I have used it on my daughters hair as she was suffering from very bad dandruff and just using it for three weeks can see a huge difference.I will definitely buy it again the only reason Iam giving it four star is that the bottle is really very tiny for the price .Nihal m</li>
    <li> I started to use the 100% organic castor oil the moment I received it in the mail about 3 months ago. The reason I wanted this product was to help with my scalp itching and breakage of my hair, and the organic castor oil did help with my problem and continue to do just what I wanted it to do. I use it to oil my hair every other day to keep my hair moisturized, so far the oil is all I use in my hair and it is great for my scalp. I am a satisfied customer !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn G.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my eyebrows, eyelashes and under my eyes but I&#x27;ve only done so for a couple of weeks.  I apply it every night right before going to bed.  So far the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the last three nights or so, I seem to loose two or three eyelashes per eye every evening.  Kind of the opposite effect of what I was hoping for.  But I do know we lose our eyelashes regularly, so it might just be a coincidence.  I&#x27;m going to not do it for a couple of night and then try again and see if it makes a difference.  I want it to work but so far I don&#x27;t know yet.  It&#x27;s a thicker oil and it&#x27;s nice to work with.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this organic caster oil and mixed in essential oils to make me a beard oil. I absolutely love it. Though I have only been using it for a short time I feel it is the perfect oil I needed for my beard. The castor oil is a great base. It&#x27;s thick and has a nice aroma to it as well.</li>
    <li> great product have seen from new growth</li>
    <li> I use this regularly and definitely notice a difference. I had scarring from a eyebrow piercing from around 8 years ago, and I had a gap in my eyebrows. It was noticeable. No hair would grow there, not even 1. After around two weeks it was nicely filled in! :)</li>
    <li> It do not work like I thought it was</li>
    <li> Was looking for some organic castor oil and stumbled on this! Very good product! Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like the usual castor oils and easy to use. I use it twice every week and must say it works well for hair! Very good product for the price!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been using it to grow in my eyebrows more and I can see some noticeable growth starting to happen. I used it 2x per day and leave it on over night.</li>
    <li> Its my first time using castor oil. I liked it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It helped bring back growth to my eyebrows. It also helped my natural hair in thickness and volume. Being consistent with this product really shows results. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> This product is really great!  I have some thinness at the top of my hair.  I applied this oil to the thinning spot and it made my hair thicker.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Great price! Delivered quick and does what I want it to.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!  I use it for my eyebrows and eyelashes for better growth and it&#x27;s perfect as a lip gloss!  I even lather on my back and hips because of arthritis and it actually takes the pain away!  I never thought castor oil would have so many uses and I can&#x27;t imagine not having it.</li>
    <li> Its work i use it formy hair to stop hair lose &amp; grow its great</li>
    <li> Loved it worked excellent</li>
    <li> Love it works really good used it for eyelashes. 😄😄</li>
    <li> Works great! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> i love Cammile Castor Oil. i use it for my hair and i have seen improvement. like the texture of my hair. i will recommend it anybody who wants to grow natural hair. Marian A.</li>
    <li> Sucks. Too thick and smells. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> must say i really noticed a difference as far as skin difference. this oil has really evened my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love it this castor oil I use around of my ayes i ts a very good product I recomend</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Can tell the difference in my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Great quality, not very greasy like other Castor oils, doesn&#x27;t smell, and grows my eyebrows back very fast.</li>
    <li> great product! actually help with the hair growth and it does not hurt in the eyes. you just hv to be patient. apply day and night. thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the castor oil for a month and i noticed my eyelashes and eyebrows get fuller! :)</li>
    <li> Bought it to make my eyebrows and lashes grow. It really works!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this castor oil for several weeks now and can tell that my eyebrow hair is growing in better than it was before.  I&#x27;d been trying coconut oil but wasn&#x27;t seeing any results.  I had also purchased a less expensive castor oil at a local pharmacy but this one is worth spending the money on - much better results!  I use it at night and in the mornings.  I put it on with a q-tip.  In the mornings, I use it right after my shower and let it set a bit before applying makeup.  I use an eyebrow pencil and by the time I use it and a bit of powder, the oil doesn&#x27;t show up.  Worth the money for me!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and love it!  Great customer service as well!</li>
    <li> I really like it , my hear is groing</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this is organic.  I had a traumatic accident and my eyebrows almost stopped growing so I began using this castor oil.  I rub a tiny amount into my eyebrows in the evening and on weekends, then wipe it off before going to bed.  When I rub it in, it feels nourishing.  The long stray hairs have stopped and I noticed minor but definite growth.  I expect more growth over the next months.  I&#x27;ll submit another review then !</li>
    <li> Super excited to receive this product after I heard from my esthetician that castor oil is a natural way to grow your eye lashes, unlike Latisse or Revitalash which could cause eye color change or redness to the eyelids. Unfortunately getting eye lash extensions I ruined my lashes, this product saved my lashes! Every night I use a Q tip and apply it to my lashes I&#x27;ve seen a noticeably great difference! Super pleased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for almost a month now and I really like it. Even though I&#x27;ve only used it for a short amount of time my eyelashes seem to have grown a little. So far I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about 3-4 weeks on my eyelashes and eyebrows. I was using prescription strenght latise but it is costly and it did burn my eyes. Since using the Organic Castor Oil, my eyelashes do continue to stay full so I would say this does do the job just as well as latise.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying this product, but after reading some of the reviews, decided to give it a go...and boy am I glad I did! I have been using for 2 weeks on my eyebrows (every night before bed - applied with a clean eye shadow brush) and there is a pretty dramatic difference in my brows thickness and I have new hairs everyday. Gonna try on my lashes next!</li>
    <li> First time buying this product.. I want to have a long eyeslash.. so all I do is put it on my lash every night befor I go to bed.. I noticed after I been doing that for a few days my lash getting long.. I just love it. Maybe soon I&#x27;m going to try on my hair see how it&#x27;s work.. Thx for making good product I be sure buy it again when this run out.&lt;br /&gt;Daneth</li>
    <li> This has worked wonderfully! I would highly recommend it. I use it for eyelash and eye brow  growth and for my home made mascara. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.H.</li>
    <li> It hadn&#x27;t done a thing in one month</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It performed as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This product works great 👍🏼 -Abraham O.</li>
    <li> I purchased the castor oil to use on my eyelashes. I apply it on my eyelashes at night, using a q-tip. Within the first week, I already saw a difference. My eyelashes filled in, and they look thicker. My daughter asked if I had on mascara. In the morning after cleaning my face, I just use an eyelash curler, no mascara. I love it! - Anita F</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I totally see a difference in my eyebrows and lashes! I also use it on my hair. Such a great and affordable product!!</li>
    <li> Got this product for my sister and she was so happy with her results. Both her eyebrows and eyelashes became thicker in just 2 weeks of use. She applied it 3-4 times a week before bed and washed off in the morning. Her eyebrows and eyelashes are both notably thicker to the point where I thought she was wearing makeup (her eyebrows and eyelashes are black)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;d been researching natural remedies for fuller lashes.  I was skeptical and thought that Castor Oil would only condition my lashes but wouldn&#x27;t aid in helping them grow longer and/or become fuller.  I was wrong!  I did, however, add a couple drops of pure Rosemary Oil (Organic as well) because I&#x27;d read that rosemary oil stimulates the follicles.  I have no idea whether it was each individual oil or the combination of the two, but after a few weeks of regimented usage (morning and night), my lashes are noticeably longer and thicker.  I also purchased the little disposable mascara wands to help me apply, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re necessary.  I just dab a tiny drop onto clean fingertips after washing my face, distribute the drop between both index fingers and then gently wipe the oil on my lashes.  When my lashes are drenched, I lightly massage the rest of the oil onto the lash line to get into the follicles.  Note: the oil has a thick consistency, so by a tiny drop, I mean I dab my finger on the dropper and smear some off.  I&#x27;m having great success and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife since she loves the tamanu oil from Cammile Q. The castor oil is 100% organic and cold pressed. So far she loves how it tames the frizzy hair. It&#x27;s a really thick product so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use one my eyebrows &amp; eyelashes &amp; so far it&#x27;s been good! It is a bit sticky &amp; the dropper can be a bit messy but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The oil is very thick and rich unlike those other watery &amp;#34;Castor oils&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve bought in the pass. The oil can be used for many things, I used it to grow and thicken the hair around my hair line. I use it about twice a week before bed and I can already see an improvement. As a nurse I also use it on my hands because I constantly wash my hands and they can become very dry, but castor oil also improves that dryness. All you need it a little dap of oil which is great because the bottle comes with a little Doppler for easy use. This product is overall great and the shipping was on time and my package was in a great condition. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I put it in my shampoo and I have noticed a difference in a week.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used enough but it is excellent for your hair put it in your shampoo it works wonders old recipes are always the best give them a try you&#x27;ll find out just be patient !</li>
    <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.   I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.  I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I massage the Oil on my scalp, and I noticed the difference in my hair.  I&#x27;ve been putting it on my eyebrows (suppose to help them grow), it indicates it will be a while to see anything (I&#x27;m glad I have patience).&lt;br /&gt;Donna N.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well for dry spots. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and my skin definitely shows signs of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;speedy shipment.  I love the fact this is an organic product.&lt;br /&gt;Paris K</li>
    <li> i love using it... easy to apply, just use the dropper.  it&#x27;s quite think, so add a little bit of coconut oil or olive oil just so it&#x27;s not too thick.  it has no odor.  the liquid is fairly clear.  a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use for my hair - just started using it, so not sure about the benefits, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the vendor was great!  the packaging arrived in good condition and timely.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, very happy :)</li>
    <li> This castor oil arrived in timely manor, only 4 stars because I have not had enough time using product to test results, however I will definitely be back with an update and possible 5 star result!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived really fast! I&#x27;m losing a little bit of hair near the hairline and I read that castor oil helps with hair growth. I bought this one because of high reviews. I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and my baby hair is starting to grow. Even my hubby mentioned it to me that I have little hairs growing. I am happy with this organic castor oil. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I mix a little castor oil with argan oil due to the thickness of the oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased it solely for use on my thinning hair. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough&lt;br /&gt;to form an opinion on how well it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Still Using It But So Far I&#x27;m Starting To See Some Progress...I Would Buy It Again...</li>
    <li> Organic Castor Oil has helped fill in my eyebrows and around my hairline, both of which had become rather sparse.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Oil is a little thick ....but good , used it for scalp massage, body massage ,normally mixed together with rosehip oil, applying it 2-3x a week</li>
    <li> Really great product, I use it to encourage my eyebrow hair growth and it&#x27;s working! Will purchase again, thanks! Leanne B</li>
    <li> I have some health issues that have caused thinning hair, since I am in my mid 20&#x27;s I want to prolong that as long as possible and have been looking for natural ways to restimulate hair growth.  I came across information regarding castor oil and its ability to help regrow hair.  I have been making oil packs with it and applying it to the crown of my head and it has worked!  I am noticing hair regrowth and my hair is becoming thicker.  This is a huge deal for me because my hair loss was really affecting me and now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it as much.  I received this item for testing purposes, in exchange for a true and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just using this Product saw some changes in my skin just in 10 days.I loved it...</li>
    <li> I like that this castor oil is cold pressed because that means all the vitamins and good stuff are preserved. I haven&#x27;t seen incredible results right away, but if you&#x27;re consistent you will see results.  Also a little goes a long way. Just make sure when you wash it off, you wash it off well because it&#x27;s not good to let oil accumulate in your pores, especially if you&#x27;re acne prone and break out easily. You could also stimulate hair growth before putting on the oil with a little brush to get faster results on your eyebrows. Patience and consistency are key :)</li>
    <li> I used this for a week, and I&#x27;ve noticed that it did work for my eyebrows. It has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s promising I don&#x27;t see result yet but I like it</li>
    <li> Amazing product, really works &amp; helps to grow my eyebrows out! I would definitely purchase it again!&lt;br /&gt;- Ramona D.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using as often as I should. When I was , I was seeing results</li>
    <li> I just want to say amazing things about the Organic Castor Oil. I purchased this product a month ago (shipping was fast) and I have been using this product since.  Every single night I put some oil with a small brush over my eyelashes and eyebrows and I had seen amazing results. My eyelashes had growth faster and thicker same with my eyebrows. If you want full, thick and dark eyelashes this is the product you have to choose! I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Indira T</li>
    <li> So I liked it a lot it worked and it was a very good product. I use it all the time. And I see results.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my order</li>
    <li> The oil was very thick but it was a great product I saw a difference in my lashes. I should have used it consistently but for the little time I used it my lashes felt healthier - gia t.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Slowly but surely</li>
    <li> I used the castor oil on my eye brows and it worked wonders, I&#x27;m a very inpatient person and it did take a few weeks to see results but using the product every night it was just a routine and the results were amazing .. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I used it for my scalp massages earlier when I had problems with my hairline. It really helped.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I put it on my eyebrows on and off for about two weeks and the parts that I wanted to grow back, grew back so quick. I would deff recommend to others ! :)</li>
    <li> This item is extraordinary.  I initially purchased it to combine it with other oils to use as a means to make my eyelashes thicker. I also began massaging just a few drops of the castor oil alone in the scalp of my head before bedtime and my hair after washing is so full of body and shine. It looks and feels healthy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. No smell, arrived quickly and it WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil for two reasons. 1. I was looking for help growing my eyebrows out faster and 2. It&#x27;s organic. I am very pleased with the quality of this item. I use it overnight before bed. I would recommend this to anyone looking to grow hair faster.</li>
    <li> I Love this oil it has worked wonders for my eyelashes.....I will buy again thats for sure.</li>
    <li> Great product and on time delivery.👍😀</li>
    <li> The castor oil is great for hair. I love the appilcator that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I read that castor oil helps to promote hair growth &amp; was excited to give it a try. I put it on my brows &amp; lashes once a day. I have definitely noticed that my brows &amp; lashes are fuller!! It has been a couple of months now &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product! Melissa N</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon V.</li>
    <li> Jon l. Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It is 100%. I like it.  It makes my strands stronger, so I probably would order this again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it every night on my eyelashes and I have noticed that my lashes are longer and thicker. I would totally recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair grew half an inch in just a few days of use.</li>
    <li> DID NOT LIKE, FORMULA TOO THICK, RETURNING IT.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This is definitely the highest quality castor oil I have used and the dropper makes the product less messy and easy to apply.  The customer service is also phenomenal, so I will definitely continue to purchase from them.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it a lot yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any improvement in eyebrow/eyelash growth/thickness.</li>
    <li> Just amazing used it on my eyebrows to grow added to moisture made my skin like silk. Thank you mary jane m</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my lashes before bedtime.  Thick and high quality.  No scent. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Great for healing scabs and cuts. Even great for thickening my facial hair, which I was not expecting. I&#x27;m finally all out, months later, but this was quite the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use it on my eyelashes and they are definitely longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks now, every night, and I have definitely seen a difference in my lashes and eyebrows. In fact I&#x27;ve noticed that there has been some growth in a spot on my eyebrows that has always been very stubborn.  I am also very impressed with the company and how, once I ordered, they sent me their own personal confirmation email. This is my first time experimenting with castor oil and I am very glad that I went the organic route, so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Tiffany G</li>
    <li> A friend recommended castor oil to me as a hair growth/moisturizing supplement, so I tried this bottle! This is also the first type of oil I&#x27;ve tried so far, and it seems worth sticking with. A few drops really do go a long way; I only need a few every night to massage into my hair and sometimes to seal in facial moisturizer. I think it&#x27;s really improved my dry skin over the past three months, and even filled in my thin eyebrows! My one bottle has a ways to go but I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another once it&#x27;s run dry.</li>
    <li> excellent product. arrived here on time, and works great!</li>
    <li> This oil was delivered promptly and I had no problems. I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now on my eyebrows and eyelashes. I use a disposable mascara wand to apply the oil. The oil is SUPER thick, a little definitely goes a long way. It&#x27;s a bit too early to say if it works for hair growth, but I feel like it&#x27;s promising. My eyelashes were stubs from taking off my extensions. I can see that this oil would help strengthen what little I have left. It feels like a deep conditioning treatment. Oh, and I have pretty sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t broken out so that&#x27;s another plus.</li>
    <li> I used it on my lashes and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Using product to blend with a natural leave in hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> been useing  bbut noting happy yet</li>
    <li> First thing i love about this oil is its organic. Second i have an issue of my hair shredding and not growing. When i started putting this oil i started noticing a little difference that my hair wouldnt shred and they grew at least 2/3 inches. I have been using it on my eyelashes too and i see a BIG difference. My lashes are thicker now before they kept falling off. Now, they look thicker and healthier . Thanks so much. the only sucky part is that its only avaible in 1 ounce not a bigger bottle :/. other than that i love it!</li>
    <li> I first read about the product from a friend. It has been a couple of weeks and have been using the oil on my eyelashes! They have already started growing in thicker. I use the product once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t normally post reviews, but I had a wonderful experience with this company. Package arrived very promptly, and I would recommend this to all!</li>
    <li> I found this to be a very good quality castor oil.</li>
    <li> I had read that castor oil helps grow hair.....especially the eyebrows and eyelashes. My eyebrows have been thinning over the years. I ordered this one because it said it was 100% pure and cold pressed.  I have been using it for a few weeks and I do notice a difference . I just apply at night before bed. I was very pleased with the the texture of the oil. It has a very light scent. Not noticeable at all. I am excited about how it will do and I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait to review this until I used the product for a while. I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks and it&#x27;s has helped my bald sides grow back in. The side was completely bald and thinned when I started use and now you can clearly see the hair growing in. My hair thinned really bad with my 2nd pregnancy and this has been a gem. I will be buying again for sure!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is organic...&lt;br /&gt;As a first time user of castor oil I saw somewhat of a difference after a month or so of using it inconsistently. I applied it both to my thin brows and eyelashes, as well as my face. As a face oil not too crazy about it for any possible beauty properties other than a deep moisturizer. As for my brows and lashes, I did see a bit of length but nothing crazy (almost as if i just let them grow out naturally?). Who knows... Give it a go - won&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed great results!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results. Putting on eyebrows. May take longer for results. could take up to 3 months.</li>
    <li> Great product my eyebrows are thicker and beautiful. Now im going to try it on my hair. So far so good!!</li>
    <li> The 4 star review is for the product itself, the instructions I received after purchasing, not for its intentions. It did not grow my eyebrow hair back. After 3 months - I saw increased acne from the oils (from it spreading on my pillow) and my eyebrows looked the same. Not saying it won&#x27;t work for someone else, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Love it, been using it for hair growth and I believe it works. Love that it comes with the dropper so that you do not over apply or over take out of the bottle since you only need a little. PLUS ITS ORGANIC</li>
    <li> Great product would definitely recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;DY</li>
    <li> This really works.  I have been using this for 1.5 months.  I now have to get my eyebrows waxed on a more frequent basis.  My friends have noticed that my eyelashes are longer too.</li>
    <li> I just go this product and so far I like it, my only issue is that the bottle is super small for $14, I ordered a 16oz bottle of Castor Oil for $10.99 because I know I will run out of this product soon.</li>
    <li> So far I like this oil. Seems practical for what I use it  and seems to have a good conscistancy.</li>
    <li> It works good and it&#x27;s super easy to place in scalp</li>
    <li> Love it!  I lke that  it&#x27;s organic, first of all, and it&#x27;s the smoothest, cleanest, most viscous castor oil ever.  I use it sparingly on my eyelashes and on my hands.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product after reading about it. My hair grew a lot since I started using this and it also got thicker. I recommend this product to anyone who want thicker and healthier hair:))</li>
    <li> Love it.So far,so good!!!!! Got here fast and it is working so far!!!!!!!!! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Great product very happy thanks.</li>
    <li> Awesome price and product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product that fits description.  Arrived quickly and on time! I would recommend this oil over others sold here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use these everyday on my hair and my son&#x27;s hair. It is a great product and has helpled thicken my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;Tedra P</li>
    <li> What excited you about the product in the first place? The fact that it is cold pressed&#x3D;NO SMELL!! YES!&lt;br /&gt;- How often do you use it, as in the number of times a day? I use it one to two times a day on my eyebrows and eyelashes for about a month and already I am seeing results</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were getting very dry/itchy and thinning so I decided to try Castor oil since I had heard it promoted growth and would help with the dryness. A week after I started using it I noticed a huge difference. No more itchiness or dryness, and now they are fuller than what they used to be. I also started to use Castor oil on my eyelashes at night because they were very getting brittle and also a little thinner. They are now fuller and stronger. I have bangs so I was afraid that the oil I put on my eyebrows and lashes would make my hair greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. The eyebrows just feel soft and not coarse as they use to.&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product &amp; most definitely will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I love this product.I use it twice a week in my hair and it works great..Before my was so thin and now my is thick and looks beautiful..</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil! Through out the winter I kept getting dandruff and I heard of castor oil being a cure and it&#x27;s true! After I wash my hair I would put a few drops into my fingers and massage it into my scalp after a couple of times my dandruff was completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie L.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Helped eyebrows grow fuller.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Works GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for lashes and under eye area.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple weeks now and have actually seen improvement in the growth of my eyebrows. Earlier this year I had some hair loss in my eyebrows and eyelashes, started applying this product everyday and have seen the hair begin to grow back in the places that have been bare for so long. It has also helped clear up ache around my nose and has made my skin a lot softer. Definitely recommend this to anyone who has trouble growing eyelashes or eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Been a month and I must say it&#x27;s really really good! Love the fact that it makes my hair smoother... Just few drops!&lt;br /&gt;Magic elixir! :)</li>
    <li> It stopped my Husband&#x27;s hair from falling.</li>
    <li> This is great! I use it for my eyebrows and lashes, it&#x27;s been 4 days and my eyebrows and already looking fuller and my eyelashes longer.</li>
    <li> Overall I would say this product is worth a try.  I did start to notice a difference with my hair and eyelashes. However I do think it takes some time to see a difference so a second purchase might be necessary.</li>
    <li> I used this for less than a month and my lashes are a little longer. Being Asian, I&#x27;m not lucky to have long eyelashes but I can definitely tell there&#x27;s a difference in my lashes after I used castor oil.</li>
    <li> Great Vendor.  Great product Loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! Would buy again!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil worth every penny</li>
    <li> it did absolutely nothing that it was supposed to do...I followed the directions to the tee and nothing changed...nothing</li>
    <li> Very expensive I did not see the results</li>
    <li> Its really thick. I dont really like the smell,but its not very strong,so its bad only if you sniff it from the bottle. I bought it for my eyelashes and eyebrows, and Im happy with the results. My eyelashes are longer and thicker!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I mixed it with a little almond oil and warmed it slightly.  I use it to massage my mother&#x27;s scalp (which she loves).  She is 89 and has very thin hair, so we are hoping to enhance some hair growth. I also use it mixed with a little almond oil and brush my eyelashes at night before bed.  It helps keep my lashes long, thick and easy to manage. I compliment my Latisse use in the morning with the castor oil at night.  Love it!</li>
