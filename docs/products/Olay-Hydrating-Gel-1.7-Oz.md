<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> feels great  gives you a dewy look  I bet it would be great keeping it in the fridge in the summer time!!!!!</li>
    <li> Loved the coolness of the moisturizer but not a big fan of it being scented.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is delightfully fresh; its effects last for a long time.  I first purchased it thinking I would give it a try, have since bought two more jars and will buy again for my daughters and when mine are in need of replacement.  Haven&#x27;t seen it in the stores, only on Amazon.</li>
    <li> it leaves face feeling a lil sticky.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels and smells!!</li>
    <li> AM LIKING THIS VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> Probably the best facial moisturizer for this price and I couldn&#x27;t wish for anything more.</li>
    <li> Very good but do not know why Olay do not sell it in u.k. saving the postage from the states!!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin. It was moisturizing without being greasy and I don&#x27;t think n it cause any breakouts. Smells fresh. Great product.</li>
    <li> the most delightful moisturizer EVER.  Makes you skin like silk!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  Smells great and fresh.  Keeps my face hydrated throughout the day.  Always bought expensive ones and  decided to try this. .... I&#x27;m glad I did..highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product dries and the finish it leaves. The best use however I found for it is under the eyes AFTER you have applied your under eye concealer. I struggle with a bit of creasing and some fine lines under my eyes that concealer sometimes makes seem worse. Adding a small dab under the eyes after I have applied my makeup makes a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also mixed this with BB cream for a great finish.</li>
    <li> So satisfied with it! Shipping fast, smell good, oil free. Love the gel feeling.</li>
    <li> I have a bit of an unhealthy obsession with skin care and my bathroom is littered with discarded bottles, ointments, creams, liquids, etc. It&#x27;s not often that I find something that I like enough to repurchase bit this is one of them. But this Olay gel moisturizer is a keeper!  I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a decent daytime gel moisturizer that would wear well under makeup and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. I tried the Simple gel moisturizer, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisture Gel, MAC, Garnier...none of them moisturized well and/or burned my sensitive skin or felt really sticky and balled up into little clumps like elmer&#x27;s glue. The Olay gel moisturizer goes on smoothly, offers light to medium moisture (if you have really dry skin you might want something else) doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my dry/eczema prone skin and dries to a beautiful matte finish. No balling up, no clumps, no sticky film. I pair it with a moisturizing toner and my skin is comfortable and matte all day.   As an added bonus it has niacinimide as the 4th ingredient so it helps treat redness and discoloration. Even the fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me, it&#x27;s mild and fades almost immediately.</li>
    <li> A little overrated.  For me it seems to only last a couple hours, then would reapply.  I do have dry skin and it did not make a difference in complexion.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I have come across. My skin breaks out easily and I have tried many different stuff in the past. They all seemed to either break me out or just not very effective. I give this my full endorsement. It feels great on the face and when waking up after putting it on before bed you will notice the difference the next morning. This is the only moisturizer I will ever use.</li>
    <li> To preface, I have extremely dry skin right now from winter. I was disappointed that this product did not help much. It also flakes off my skin after I put it on and touch my face. Not sure if my skin is just too dry or the product isn&#x27;t all that great. I will try it again once my skin is less dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like a heavy scent so was happy that this had a very light fragrance. I applied it to a few dry spots on my face and it took care of them overnight. I&#x27;ve also used it on my knees and elbows with great results. A little goes a long way so it should last quite a while. I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this product ain&#x27;t for you. After two weeks, I noticed that my face and neck were developing horrible rashes. As a dark skin African-American, this product made my skin turn red. Not good for your skin at all. My face and neck hurt and I look abnormal. I have yet to see that this product does it what is says it would do. Hate it, Hate it, and Hate it.</li>
    <li> I actually like Olay products, and use one of their moisturizers for sensitive skin. Daily. So I thought I&#x27;d like to try this. It&#x27;s decent enough. It does feel dew-y at first. But as I get older, my skin is getting drier. I&#x27;m not seeing the &amp;#34;over hydrating&amp;#34; piece of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, smooth, and feels cooling on the skin. But I prefer something with sunscreen in it for daily use. It works in a pinch, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Lately, it seems that moisturizers are moving more and more to a gel formula. Personally, I like it. I think gel moisturizers work a lot better on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay Fresh Effects moisturizer is a very nice one. It has a very pleasant smell. Goes on smoothly and seems to last just about all day. The only downside and complaint I have about this moisturizer is that it feels a little sticky. It is not a deal breaker, but just a little annoying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what differentiating factors there are in a market filled chock full of options for all things moisturizer.  Calling it &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; or saying &amp;#34;Dew Over!&amp;#34; seem like re-packaging the same old, same old in a new package.  But there is a little uniqueness to this gel.  It goes on smooth (not creamy) and feels refreshing.  The scent is light and clean smelling.  Results on the &amp;#34;hydrating goodness&amp;#34; are on par with most other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried so I&#x27;ll have to see if the feel and scent of this win me over for a repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it claims. Offers a nice refreshing does of moisture, while avoiding that dreaded shiny/greasy feel. Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, this works well for me on dry days, or just before bed time. Has a mild floral scent that I found pleasant, though I&#x27;m generally not fond of odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a reasonable price, too.</li>
    <li> Very light fragrance, and kept my hands feeling moisturized until I washed my hands again (3 hours later).  It is not totally dry up on application, but it is hardly noticeable.  I love the cream for my face, especially for the daytime. I love Olay creams.</li>
    <li> This is a gel, not a cream. It&#x27;s ideal for applying at night. It goes on a little tacky/sticky, but once it dries it&#x27;s fine. And you don&#x27;t have to apply as much as you would a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant -- not too strong, but very nice. I&#x27;d still look at other moisturizers whenever they&#x27;re sale-priced as this Olay Fresh isn&#x27;t the least-expensive option out there. Still, for what it does it is a solid product.</li>
    <li> I love this gel moisturizer so much. It&#x27;s affordable, isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy, and I see an immediate improvement in the tone of my skin. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming fragrance and dries quickly. This is something I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> It seems like gel moisturizers suddenly showed up a few years back, when I&#x27;d never heard of them before. I like the combo of a powder-like, mostly matte finish, without the cakey feel or look of powder. And, especially when the weather is hot, I am addicted to the cooling sensation on my face. My favorite gel moisturizer is The Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Sorbet... But when I heard this Olay Fresh Dew Over was nearly a dupe - at about 1/3 the cost - I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of Dew Over is nice, light, similar to Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line, but a bit, uh, fresher - brighter, lighter, younger. It fades fairly quickly, which I like. It has a nice cool, almost wet and watery feeling - good for a hot day! - and no greasiness. But I found it a little harsh on my skin (which is more stressed than normal due to a mild sunburn), and it&#x27;s not nearly as hydrating as The Body Shop&#x27;s gel, nor other Olay offerings. The lack of any SPF also means this isn&#x27;t a stand-alone daytime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, although I liked Olay&#x27;s Fresh Dew Over, I am unlikely to repurchase it because I prefer a different product. However, I do think it&#x27;s a steal if you&#x27;re in the market for a lightly moisturizing product that mattifies and you don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer! Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and very refreshing!</li>
    <li> My daughter is using this as well as the 1-2-3 Acne Solution System  She really likes this because it is a gel formula.  This is the best part of what she does for her face.</li>
    <li> A great moisture product for the summer months. I love the light cooling you feel.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT...HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO EVAPORATE VERY QUICKLY IN THE JAR.</li>
    <li> This is an item my wife requested and her review is 5 stars. She notes that it works well, hydrates well, and is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommended product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky about what I put on my face. Partly because it is prone to breakouts and also because it is on the oily side. Because my face is combination, I need something that will accommodate the oily and dryness of my skin. I am always reluctant to moisturize because I feel like it is adding to that problem. This leaves me skin feeling clean and refreshed while it is giving it the much needed moisture it deserves. There is a slight cucumber scent and it is not at all overwhelming. I am sensitive to smells and I really like this because it is &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scented.  The only improvement I would make on this is that I would like to see it with an SPF protection. Other than that, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> Living in Minnesota, my skin gets very dry during the winter months, so I really wanted to try out this product. My first impression when opening the box was that the container is on the small side, the appearance of the cr&amp;egrave;me is light green, and it has a very nice smells which makes me think of the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few weeks in the morning, before I apply make-up, I can say that my skin feels wonderful and, moist.&lt;br /&gt;The cr&amp;egrave;me does not leave an oily residue, which is important when I apply my foundation and rouge.&lt;br /&gt;The small size of the container does not matter as much since the container is still almost full after two weeks. A little goes far.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice light texture and pleasant slightly strong smell, but it did make my skin break out. I had to toss it.</li>
    <li> The Olay Fresh Effects moisturizer offers excellent hydration at a reasonable price.  It has a light scent and it goes on without an oily residue.  It does not clog your pores like a lot of other hydrating moisturizers do so you wont have to worry about acne forming after you use this.  The price is reasonable (especially for an Olay product) but it is by no means a bargain for its 1.7 oz size.  This is why it earns 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pale blue gel has a light fragrance and feels much like aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not feel much in the hydration and I didn&#x27;t like the filmy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is affordable, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Dew Over Hydrating Gel Moisturizer is a very light moisturizer but is just enough to keep your skin hydrated. The moisturizer is not heavy but it stills refreshes your skin and doesn&#x27;t clog your skin like some of the much heavier creams. I like the way that the Olay Moisturizer is light and that is perfect for me because I live in Florida and the humidity can really cause you to sweat if you are using a heavy moisturizer and that&#x27;s why the Olay Fresh Effects Dew is perfect for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is light and not overly scented which causes less breakouts. I just love that this Olay moisturizer is perfect for my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores like other moisturizers have done.  A perfect wake-up to your skin and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great, lightweight moisturizer if your skin doesn&#x27;t need a heavy duty skin care for more mature skin care. It glides on really smooth and flawlessly. Your foundation, be it liquid or powder will go on without any problem and lasts through the day without any touchup. The real test will be the summer which is coming up, but for winter and spring its been great. Would highly recommend for skin in the late 20&#x27;s to mid 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go near shops like bath and body works, or perfume aisles. The scent on this is really light and hasn&#x27;t broke n me out. (I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month.)&lt;br /&gt;It has a really light texture. It goes on really wet, which takes a little getting used to but my face feels very good after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels smoother and it doesn&#x27;t sting like a lot of other moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> Nice scent but a bit sticky. Left my skin a tad dry. (needed to use an additional moisturizer when used).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay moisturizers for years and have been very happy with them.  They are consistently good for the price.  This one is about half the price of what I normally pay for the Olay product that I&#x27;ve used for years.  I actually got this for my mother who complains about dry facial skin all of the time.  She&#x27;s older, and using Olay daily lotion, but after reading the description I thought that maybe this might be good for her to put on at night.  For her it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it at night, since it says you&#x27;ll wake up with refreshed skin.  I thought it felt a bit sticky going on and took longer to absorb than the other lotions that I use.  After it dried I did feel that my skin was a bit tight, almost like it was a very thin mask on my skin.  I don&#x27;t know if I used to much or what, either way I didn&#x27;t really feel like it did much for me either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly I think this is marketed to younger women (teens-twenties) who are looking for a product that is a light moisturizer that won&#x27;t make your skin breakout and will hydrate it a bit.  It&#x27;s packaging, marketing and pricing are geared towards this market...of which I am not one, LOL.  I like Olay products, but I think that the Olay Fresh Effects Dew Over is only for fresh faced lovelies that are under 25 :)</li>
    <li> I was using Neutrogena oil-free moisturizer but I didn&#x27;t like how it sat on top of my skin and made it oily/shiny. I found this stuff on sale at Target so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, and I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was confused about the whole &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; aspect of it. It&#x27;s kind of like that slime they sell to kids, but don&#x27;t think it is the texture of jelly because it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s like the texture of mayo but without the greasy/oily look or feel...if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells marvelous! It&#x27;s the best smelling moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. It isn&#x27;t too strong and it lasts for quite a while (I enjoy that because I smell &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; all day!) I wish I could find this smell in a body spray or perfume, it smells that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, as well. The gel soaks into your skin and makes it feel very even and smooth. I haven&#x27;t had my skin feel this way in a very long time, in fact I can&#x27;t even remember but it is probably similar to before I went through puberty. It keeps my skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s just sitting on my skin or creating an oily face. And it takes just a tiny bit to cover my whole face and neck, so I like that I won&#x27;t have to shell out $15 a month but maybe every 2 or 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is naturally oily and I have a few break outs once a month (catch my drift) and I have a problem with blackheads on my T zone. But this stuff feels like it is cleaning and clearing my skin and just aiding it along with the fresh effects bead up face wash I use. It tightens my skin and just all around is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else I can say really but I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying IMHO.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and really does have a cooling effect.  My wife likes to put the jar in the fridge and use it before we go outside.  Says it helps keep her hydrated.  Also, important to her is that it has just a hint of scent to it and doesn&#x27;t affect her sensitive skin.  Olay makes excellent skin care products and this is one of them.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the jar, I liked this gel moisturizer.  Everything about it is pleasant and refreshing.  It&#x27;s a good consistency, thick but not overly so, and it glides on smoothly.  It feels cool going on and my skin just soaks it up so there&#x27;s no greasy or oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle but agreeable, fresh and I think, citrusy, although it&#x27;s infused with essence of honeysuckle and white tea with no mention of citrus.  I look forward to its cooling moisture in the dog days of summer.</li>
    <li> This gel moisturizer goes on with such a cool, refreshing feel!  I know it is going to be one of my favorites when our miserable , humid summer kicks in.  It has a nice, subtle fragrance and absorbs quickly leaving  a matte finish. Best one I&#x27;ve used lately.</li>
    <li> it was like putting hair gel on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i have oily acne prone skin so i thought maybe this only works on dry skin and maybe my face is too oily. so i decided to use it as a hand moisturizer instead since my hands are dry and they are tolerant to every lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. still too sticky! maybe i need just a little amount...still too sticky! maybe i need to slather it on or maybe rub it...? nope it was still icky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I resorted to using it as a hair gel instead but it doesn&#x27;t have any hold to it, it seals in the moisture I guess like a hair conditioner. I&#x27;m reluctant to throw something away I paid 10 dollars for but I might have to since it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> I have used the entire jar of the Fresh Effects Dew Over moisturizing gel.  Overall, I think the hype (for vibrant, beautiful skin...) is way overplayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good part is that even with applying the Fresh Effects liberally to my face, the ingredients did not make my skin break out.  However, the bad part is that even with applying the Fresh Effects liberally to my face, upon drying, my face felt tight &amp; dry - I felt like I needed to add more moisturizer (which I did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not impressed with the results of the product. The product has nice packaging &amp; great marketing, but the end result is a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have questioned whether to use Fresh Effects at night or daytime - the packaging says &amp;#34;beauty sleep never looked so good&amp;#34;, so it seems that the product is intended to be used at bedtime.  I tried both day &amp; night &amp; saw no difference in effect.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness it is available on line - I love this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good and the skin is not oily</li>
    <li> This is working ready well for me. I have very oily skin and have been trying moisturizers left n right. Everything felt oily on and my skin then broke out. This is a gel n doesn&#x27;t do that at all. I am happy with this one n it won&#x27;t go into the &amp;#34;graveyard&amp;#34; of skin supplements.t-shirt that didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Refreshing Scent, light gel, feels great in the palm of your hands and then like heaven on your face. Sometimes I use it before a nap, light layer at bedtime or in the morning if I am home and just want a little more hydration. Feels amazing just try it once and this product will become a staple during this dry hot summer~</li>
    <li> My wife is thrilled with this product, had to order from the states as not available in UK</li>
    <li> I live in sunny Arizona, and decided to replant a desert garden in the middle of the day...on the spur of the moment.  I am fair skinned, blond, and very sensitive to both heat and sun.  I was only outside for about 30 - 45 minutes...without any sunscreen and hardly any shade, but knew immediately I was in for a very painful sunburn as the heat radiating off my skin would not abate even after an hour with a cool wet wash cloth.  I remembered that I had sprayed some hydrating Derma E spray on my husband recently when he complained of a mild sunburn and it was gone within hours after using the spray.  I decided to try rehydrating skin products as the first line of defense instead of using lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first took an extended, cool water shower to stop/slow the burning, then immediately sprayed the Derma E product over my face, neck, and chest area but I knew I needed something different for my arms, legs, and upper back.  I have a bag of sample products and I ran across this gel.  It&#x27;s from Olay, a name I generally trust (love the regenerist serum) and I thought, what do I have to lose?  I have gotten burned so many times in my life that I KNOW when I am doomed!  I applied this gel liberally on my crimson skin and prayed that it would rehydrate my skin and cool it down at least.  Within 2 hours of the initial application, my skin was not beet red anymore and I decided to use it on my cheeks and nose as well.  The skin was noticeably cooler and a lot less painful.  While the next day, I was still slightly pink, it would have been soooo much worse if I hadn&#x27;t used this product.  Thank you Olay for this Hydrating Gel Moisturizer!  I just bought a full bottle so I don&#x27;t run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I hate oily/filmy/heavy moisturizers and this one was light and just right!</li>
    <li> hydrating non greasy.. perfect under primer and pre make up... love it</li>
    <li> Your skin might break out for the first few tries, but it&#x27;s SO worth waiting for. Fantastic moisturizer, y&#x27;all.</li>
    <li> Great deal....Love the product</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer for summer. Too light for winter.</li>
    <li> Olay products are used regularly in our household, but this one left me wondering when exactly I should it.  The packaging simply said to apply to face and neck.  Should I use it just at night?  Under my makeup?  After sun exposure?  I am not entirely sure. I started with just using it at night.  It definitely has a nice cooling effect on the skin, and initially made my skin look quite oily.  This did dry fairly quickly though.  I have sensitive skin but thankfully have not noticed a worse reaction post use.  I have not tried it under makeup yet as it feels too thick of a moisturizer for that.  It has a pleasant scent, though I am not sure I really want a scent in my face lotion.  A little goes a long way with this product so for the price it is a bargain compared to so many other moisturizers out there.  I am just not sure the best way to use it yet.</li>
    <li> WOW, I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It moisturizes without being super heavy/oily and it smells soooo good. I love the whole Fresh Effects line.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Shipping was great. The scent is AMAZING! Girly smell but not too overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, gooey or gross on your face. It almost just feels like slashing water on your face. It&#x27;s well worth it in my opinion, I love it!</li>
    <li> Maybe in the summer would be better, this below zero is not good for my skin its still dry.  Any solutions please let me know.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a moisturizer for my upper eyelids.  It was perfect and felt great, now I use it as my daily all around eye moisturizer and it&#x27;s much cheaper than the Caudalie product I was using.  I haven&#x27;t seen this in drugstores yet.  I&#x27;ve been looking for it.</li>
    <li> I love this hydrating gel! I have combination skin and this is the first moisturizer I have found that helps throughout the day! It&#x27;s hard to find in stores around my area, so I will be purchasing from this seller a lot.  Updated review: I have ordered this lotion about 8 times with no problem, but then today it arrived half open. I figured it was fine, but when I opened it all the way, I can see the bottom of the jar. Literally 3/4 of the lotion is gone. Very unhappy and not sure I can continue to trust this seller/product. I will be returning.</li>
    <li> REFRESHING LIGHT WEIGHT GEL MOISTURIZER.  VERY DELICATE FRAGRANCE.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but leaves a sticky feeling</li>
    <li> I have always loved Olay products and when I first began using this, I thought this would be no different.  Loved the way it felt, loved the way it went on my skin.  Loved the way my skin felt after application.  Unfortunately, my skin didn&#x27;t love it as much as I did.  Within three days, my cheeks, chin and forehead were beginning to break out.  So I stopped using it for a week or so until my face returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried again, and three days later had the same problem.  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to one of the ingredients and it is just my skin type - but this product is simply not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not at all saying that others shouldn&#x27;t try this.  Like I said, loved the way it felt - just wasn&#x27;t overall happy with the results of its use.  But, for younger, maybe less sensitive skin, I think it would probably be a fine product.</li>
    <li> Being in my 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;m used to wearing thicker, heavier creams but I noticed that I was starting to break out where I tend to sweat the most.  I had read an article that recommended gel moisturizers to women with acne so I thought I would give it a try.  I must say, that I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel has a fresh scent and a light texture that seems to melt into my skin.  While it does seem to melt into my skin quickly, it does feel a little tacky for a couple of minutes until it dries completely.  I also have not noticed any breakouts or dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone prone to breakouts whether year round or just during the summer.</li>
    <li> Felt kind of sticky when I first applied it, but it kept my skin well hydrated through out the day.</li>
    <li> this is the only face lotion I can find that isnt too thick or oily, but it is pretty chemical-y.  Strong perfume and synthetic smell and kind of burning on senstive skin.  (I have very oily skin, for comparison)</li>
    <li> My skin is just way too sensitive, and I have not been able to use any of the moisturizing / hydrating products out there. The entire line of Fresh Effects has been an excellent find for me. Easy to use, feels great on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to get red, itchy, flaky, or too dry.</li>
    <li> One of the lightest most subtle fragrances you can get so if you&#x27;re not looking for something overpowering or perfumy, this is it. Love the honeydew white-tea scent. Also is reasonably priced and actually delivers instead of being overpriced. It moisturizes and has a unique feel to it when applied to skin. It&#x27;s made of a lightweight gel and hydrates for 24 hours to awaken your skin with a well rested look. You can also mix, match, and layer with other Olay products. Plus it&#x27;s oil free and non-comedogenic, so it won&#x27;t block your pores. Also, I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t adversely effect me. With this you get cooling hydration, a lot of moisturizer and results at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a gel moisturizer, the texture is a bit gooey.  It is extremely refreshing if your skin is suffering from too much exposure to the elements, it has a cooling effect.  But as my moisturizer, I expect it to do a lot.  Reduce puffiness, make my skin silky soft, protect it from the sun....I guess I&#x27;m just not a fan of the gel texture.  My face feels sticky for a little while after putting it on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used gel moisturizers before and creamy ones and the gels just seem more lightweight to me.  They go on with a little more wet feeling so if you&#x27;re not used to them it can feel a little different.  This provides good moisture but not too much and I&#x27;d recommend for those who have oily to normal skin.  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this was the fragrance.  I prefer not to have fragrance in my face creams.  It seemed pretty strong to me but I am sensitive to fragrances.  The smell is actually very nice.  I just don&#x27;t want it on my face.  I realize that is personal preference though.  So if you like having a fresh scent smell in a gel moisturizer, give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have many lotions...I buy them, and they are fine...but they don&#x27;t impress me enough for me to really be especially loyal to one kind. I don&#x27;t usually spend an excessive amount on lotions/moisturizers as I haven&#x27;t tried many where they have performed so well that a high price has been justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a very nice texture. Almost gelatinous. It reminds me a lot of pudding or yogurt. But shiny. If fruit juice was made thick enough to be pudding, it would look like this! What is nice about it, is that it feels really nice and cool putting it on. And the thickness of it helps it stay where you put it. Sometimes I put a thick smear on and just let it take its time and soak into my skin while I am doing something else. It does seem to keep my under-eye area nice for longer than a thinner lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance...which is good for me. I don&#x27;t like overly perfumed lotions for my face. And sometimes they can smell medicine-y or just plain yucky. This one isn&#x27;t that. This may be one I actually buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of this product but it has lots of potential.  I have dry skin and currently am dedicated to another moisturizer and in comparing it to this I notice that upon application this gel has a wet feel and then it dries.  When it dries, my face feels even dryer so I&#x27;m not sure a gel moisturizer would be for me.  However, it you have somewhat oily skin, I could see this working.</li>
    <li> One product that is guaranteed to make your spouse smile. It is a powerful hydration formula that will make her skin silky smooth. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For me it caused dry itchy skin and red cheeks.  I  developed a light rash and a few blemishes after two days of use.  I&#x27;m 30 years old so the blemishes aren&#x27;t so common these days.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It&#x27;s like and easy to carry everywhere. It definitely refreshes my face after washing it and feels nice and smooth. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my face gets less grease throughout the day. Really like and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and absorbs quickly, but if you have really dry skin, it won&#x27;t do much good.  It would probably work well for normal skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, as I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Philosophy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Take a deep Breath&amp;#34;, but alas, this was not to be.  They look the same (even the color, which I suspect is not a coincidence), but there the similarities end.  This has a very strong floral scent that I didn&#x27;t like at all.  More importantly though, 5 minutes after applying it, I felt like I needed more.  This did not keep my face feeling moisturized at all.  I&#x27;ve gone back to Philosophy, the price is completely worth it for a quality product that works.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had time to use it much.From what I see it really helps the dryness</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell and feel of this lotion. I am addicted. It makes me feel clean and fresh and leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated and awake without an oily or thick feeling. It is light and wonderful. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on my skin, and is not greasy.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this product.It is so refreshing.It makes my skin look nice.</li>
</ol>
