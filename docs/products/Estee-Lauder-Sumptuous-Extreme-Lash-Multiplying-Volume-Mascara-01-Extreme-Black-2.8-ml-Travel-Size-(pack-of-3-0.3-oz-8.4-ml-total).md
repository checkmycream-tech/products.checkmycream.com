      <li>I have always had very long and full eyelashes, but after having breast cancer and taking Chemo treatments they are not like they used to be.</li>
      <li>I like the travel size as they don&#x27;t dry out as quick.  </li>
      <li>No matter what brand it eventually gets old and aired out.  </li>
      <li>By far I&#x27;m not a make up</li>
      <li>I just open a new tube and use it about 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only going to give 3 stars on this because I feel like the mascara may have been old.</li>

    <li> Love this mascara. I received this package much earlier than was expected.Definitely will use it again.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this mascara months ago and it finally dried up.  I like that there are 3 sample sizes in the order, they fit nicely into my makeup bag.  The product really does give the illusion of longer lashes.</li>
    <li> More than satisfied lies well , lengthens , do not stick together , no additional special means for washing , good goods</li>
    <li> I am a picky mascara wearer and this one meets the need. I went through chemotherapy and lost eyelashes along with my hair. This product made my eyelashes seem more than I know I have.</li>
    <li> Gift for friend- she loved it!</li>
    <li> Although it does clump a bit, it still gives good results as far as the lashes each are caught nicely with the brush and it doesn&#x27;t flake off. This is especially helpful with my lower eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Doesnt make lashes any longer, dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!  Not easy to put on!!!!!  I can find better ones on the dollar stores&amp;#60;LOL!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only going to give 3 stars on this because I feel like the mascara may have been old. I&#x27;ve been using this brand/type for years. I absolutely love it and haven&#x27;t found anything better. Lashes are separated, full, long, and never clumpy. Doesn&#x27;t run or smear. Easy to wash off as well. I just think I got an old lot because it is not as &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as it usually is when I opened it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product - it gives me the fullest lashes EVER!  I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  The product also was delivered quickly.  :-)</li>
    <li> Love this mascera. I like this size for traveling and it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast. Would recommend to everyone!</li>

    <li> This was not my favorite mascara...I should have gotten the blue one. HOWEVER, if you need mascara, this certainly will do the trick! I was concerned that they would be old or dry, but these little mascaras are fresh and happy alternatives to full size tubes that take up valuable space in my makeup bag. Good purchase.</li>
