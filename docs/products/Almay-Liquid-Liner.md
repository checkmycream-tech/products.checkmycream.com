<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Timely delivery, and was as expected.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. Only one I will use. Been using it for years and occasionally try others and end up wasting my money. This product goes on perfectly. The tip is firm so it goes where u want it. I usually find it cheaper on amazon then in walmart or target ext. Prices change occasionally though.</li>
    <li> CANNOT live without this stuff.  It is waterproof and the application is so easy.  A very small amount goes a long way.  I have black eyelashes so this just enhances the lash line.  Love this eyeliner, it is better than all of the others, plus it is very mild --- it&#x27;s Almay!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT NUMER ONE LIQUID EYELINER ! Matte finish perfect for winged eyeliner!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is fantastic. I have an oily face and this is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve found that stays exactly where I put it.</li>
    <li> Great liner. I really like the control....</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner bought it twice already gives putting eyeliner so much easier</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner. It is easy to apply - and I am not particularly steady-handed at all. The thing I love most is it truly does stay put for the entire day without smudging. Amazing! I have used other very expensive liners and this is by far my favorite. So glad to have found this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10-yrs+. Love this eye liner, the key is to have a wet Q-tip on hand for any mistakes. Once it is on eyes there is no need to reapply throughout the day.</li>
    <li> YES! I&#x27;ve found my perfect liner. I&#x27;ve gone through a few liquid liner brands, and this one is by far the best—at a killer price, too. Great, dark black color, and doesn&#x27;t blur or fade after hours of wear like a lot of liners. (It will rub off, though, especially as the skin around your eye produces oil throughout the day, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend much eye-touching.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the brush is good for medium-to-thick applications. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t mastered it yet (always takes a little while to get the hang of a new brush), but I can&#x27;t see anyone getting really thin lines with this one, if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews online, but this eyeliner is just too bad. It does apply easily and the color is pretty intense, which is good. BUT it smudges like heck!!! After one hour of putting it on I&#x27;d look like a panda. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, lasts long and washes off easily. I would purchase again. The fine point on applicator is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am allergic to nickel.  Almay&#x27;s liner is gentle on my skin and my eyes never itch using it.  The liner is highly pigmented so you only need one sweep across your lid to achieve the color.  The applicator brush is tapered to a point allowing for thin lines and the eyeliner is creamy and easy to apply.  A word of caution for first time users, keep your lid closed until it&#x27;s dry to stop it from smudging. Once it&#x27;s dry it stays well.  I do use NYX eye primer on my eyes before applying anything. Then a little eye shadow; it keeps the liner in place throughout the day much better than just leaving it on a natural lid.  Just use pale colors if you are going for a natural look.  Thank You Amazon for carrying it.  My local stores use to have it but don&#x27;t any more and it is my absolute favorite.</li>
    <li> Worst than I thought it burns my eyelid so bad won&#x27;t use it ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 now and I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for 12 years. I loved it because it was generally inexpensive and lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT HAPPENED???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I would apply it to my eyelids, then a couple hours later, somehow it would smudge to under my eyes and on top of my eyelids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this again. I used to recommend it to my friends but i noticed they changed the formula and cheapened it</li>
    <li> like the color, formula, felt tip&lt;br /&gt;but it is waterproof, just not warm water proof. especially after about 5 hours, my tears could wash it away and leave terrible black tears</li>
    <li> Best liquid eyeliner around.  Smooth lines and stays on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Almay&#x27;s liquid eyeliner since I was a teenager. I prefer the felt tip to get a perfect cat eye. The color is very black and rich. Even though the pot looks tiny it has so much liquid in there. It takes me about 2-3 months to use one bottle when I wore eyeliner everyday. I&#x27;ve tried some other popular brands but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t peel off like some cheaper ones. I sprung for this one because all my girlfriends use it. it goes on well, i like that it is kind of a matte. Love it! will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> i like a very cat lined eye..with the wing.  This eye liner is the best i have found for this look.  I use eye primer by elf and then do my shadows, which are dramatic and then go over the top and do my lining...with the type of &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34; style brush, the liner glides on beautifully and it stays ALL day..even after 10 plus hours, my eyeliner is perfect when i get home from work.  The elf eye primer is a must to keep eyeshadows from creasing too....fabulous liner! i will never buy another..</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner out there without spending a ton of money.  It has a great applicator to get thin or thick lines. It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t stain, and looks great all the time.I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for years. It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all. It stays on all day and comes off easy when you want to remove it with an eye make up remover.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. Dark, simple, it works.</li>
    <li> didnt like the applicator...it clumps</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I ordered this liner in hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I felt a burning sensation as I applied it, and it irritated my eyelids throughout the day. It is also the least forgiving liquid eyeliner that I&#x27;ve ever used- every mistake is very visible because it is so dark. I usually​ like Almay makeup products, but this is not one that I&#x27;ll be using again.</li>
    <li> the line is not very black and you have to reapply it over and over to get an opaque line</li>
    <li> I bought this because MAC Liquidlast became a ripoff (they decreased the quantity but kept the price). This liner lasts all day but won&#x27;t last through oil or sweat as well as MAC. You may have to reapply at the end of the day if you&#x27;re going out, but it&#x27;s a good value considering it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush tends to create quite thick lines and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of &amp;#34;give.&amp;#34; Not great if you want a very thin line.</li>
    <li> I wear contacts, and I have very oily skin. Most eyeliners smudge on me, but this stays put for all day wear. It is a dark, jet black, and it is easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Stays most of the day, I sometimes touch-up at the end of a long busy day.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner for sharp lines!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Almay Liquid Eyeliner after running out of my super slim liner. I am very pleased with the color of the eyeliner. It does not look like a expo marker as I&#x27;ve seen others do. The lines are very crisp and bold. The liner does not irritate my skin and is very easy to wash away with simply soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;I received compliments the first day of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is very useful with the bottle so that you can keep the tip from getting dry (a problem I experienced with my last liquid liner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback of the eyeliner is that the applicator takes a little time to learn to control. I have had to wipe off and redo my eyeliner a few times because I applied too much of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller over packaged the product which isn&#x27;t a bad thing because it was well protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love this eyeliner and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is very easy to put on. I can clean up my line with a damp q-tip with speed and ease. It&#x27;s also easy to remove. No tugging to get it off or raccoon eyes the next morning. My eyes are very sensitive, and I&#x27;ve had no problem with this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> If you get a rash on your eyelid from Loreal Lineur Intense liquid liner, then this is an almost perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other brands in an attempt to find something better. Money wasted.  Even the expensive ones don&#x27;t outperform Almay.  I always end up going back to this one. Matte finish, easy to apply, long staying power (with Urban decay potion)</li>
    <li> Terrible... comes off with very little water!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is nice, but my only qualm is that it&#x27;s very liquidy and the color often sticks to my upper eyelid right after i apply it and blink once.</li>
    <li> Been using it since high school. Good applicator only wish is its water proof</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Nice eyeliner if you have the patience to let it dry. I hated that it took so long.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the only liquid eyeliner that does not burn my eyelids.  It would be easier to apply if the applicator was thinner--more like a fine paintbrush....but, I like a very fine line.  This is an excellent product...I repeatedly buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t smudge (if dry) the liner itself is strong and precise. The black color is truly black. Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and is very easy yo wash off. Last all day</li>
    <li> worst eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> This eye liner is even better then I expected it to be. It is great and dries pretty quickly. It is very easy to use. I expected the bottle to be bigger, but that is my only complaint. It has already lasted me a few months, so I&#x27;m happy!!! I&#x27;d definitely consider buying it again!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite eye liner for the last 20+ years.</li>
    <li> The line it creates is dark and pretty but I have two problems with this product. One is that even if I sweat a little bit, or my eye waters a little the line will smudge worse than other liners I have used. The other weird thing is that a ton of black gunk ends up in my eyes. I understand that a little bit might bleed into your eyes when it is right next to your eye, but I&#x27;ve never had this much from another eyeliner. When I use this I have to get a ton of black out of my eye and it kind of worries me to have this much bleed into my eye (especially when I try to clean it off at night).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye liner for years and I have yet to find one that is comparable to it! The applicator is really nice because it&#x27;s not too brush-like (so you have a little more control over it), but it&#x27;s also not stiff to the point where it hurts your eye to apply it or you can&#x27;t get a natural application. The eyeliner itself is also a really good formula. It goes on nice and black and I rarely ever have patchy spots that I need to touch up. The only downsides are that after a while the applicator tends to lose its shape a little bit and the end gets a little stringy (it&#x27;s almost like using a marker too much and the end starts to lose its fine point), and also it dries out a little around the edge and sometimes clumps fall off when you take the applicator out. Those are really very minor things though since you can usually use cuticle scissors to clean up the brush and the clumping is bound to happen after a while anyway. Like I said, I&#x27;ve been buying this for years and I don&#x27;t see myself changing any time soon! I would definitely recommend this to those who are looking for a good liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> For some reason this brand stings my eyes when I get too close. Been wearing liquid eyeliner for ten years never had that happen before.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, it stays on for a long time and is hypo-allergenic.</li>
    <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t expect my eyeliner to hurt when I applied it! I have sensitive skin, and that includes my eyelids. Sometimes they have dry skin on them. I&#x27;m very choosy about eye cream, etc. I used this Almay Liquid Eyeliner and it stung like crazy. I read the box and the second/third ingredient is alcohol. No wonder! Aside from that, it created such a dark line that looked harsh and like it was drawn with a crayon. I like a softer look. It was hard to fix when you mess up, too. I&#x27;m hoping the store will take it back.</li>
    <li> This Almay liner is the ONLY liner that meets my two eyeliner requirements: doesn&#x27;t make my look like I have bags under my eyes by the end of the day, and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive eyes red. The felt tip applicator makes it so easy to apply whether you want a very thin line, a thick line, or a tapered line. (I find the brush applicators to difficult to control because the bristles spread out). If after you apply, you decide to go over it again (whether to thicken the line, darken it, or fix mistakes), it reapplies right on top of the other layer, rather than erasing what was previously there or turning flakey. You can also easily apply it over eyeshadow, something not all liners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day, even in the hot sweaty summer. But since it washes off with just water, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to a pool or funeral or anything wear it would get wet. I actually love that it washes off with water so I don&#x27;t have any leftover the next day staining under my eyes or have to mess with eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer the look of a pencil liner, but every single one I&#x27;ve ever tried smudges (to make me look like I have bags under my eyes-people actually tell me I look tired!), from the $0.49 drug store pencil liners to the $30 special order catalog liners, no matter how I prep my eyes/face, whether they are waterproof, I&#x27;ve tried them all. There&#x27;s just something about my face!! And most, even the hypoallergenic ones, also make my eyes red. But this makes my face and eyes look nice and clean. I&#x27;ve tried so many different liners and this is the one I always come back to.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE liner fan, so when I say this deal, I had to get it! This product is easy to use (if you are used to liquid eyeliner) and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Great liner. It&#x27;s easy to put on and the lines are always straight.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily, nice black color. Isn&#x27;t water proof so be careful not to rub eyes</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and am an absolute fan. very pigmented, long lasting. brush is a bit stiff in the beginning but softens up after a couple of uses. what i love most is that it does NOT remove any product if you go over it a second time. alot of liquid eyeliners do that and it drives me insane, almay liquid eyeliner is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t. it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all if you use just a tiny amount of powder or eyeshadow underneath. great product.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I have been using it for about 8 years. I have sensitive skin and this is the only eyeliner that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much , pleased with everything</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I love the applicator, and i got it in a few more shades. Best liquid liner out there. Washes off easy too.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst eyeliner I have ever used and I am sad to say it was a complete waste of money. It&#x27;s important to me that eyeliner is water resistant because I have sensitive eyes that water quite a bit especially in the winter time. Within 5 minutes of stepping outside it looked like I had applied a dark coat of black eyeshadow to my lids. My mother also had the exact same problem. A sad disappointment after hearing so many great reviews about it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s hard brush very much. I think soft head is much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I have to say I hate this eye liner.  It does not stay on and does not go on evenly.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is really good product, it stays for a long time. It is darker than other product. I love the brush of the liner and very easy to wear.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner because it runs smooth along my lashline and stays throughout the day. No smear unless you intend to right away for a smokey eye.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for a long time. It makes a fish tail eye look so dramatic and sexy. Try it, I promise you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> simple black liner thats easy to apply with its felt tip...i like it... its not waterproof though..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fairly average eyeliner. I have oily and somewhat hooded lids. It flaked and chipped on me after a few hours of wearing it.</li>
    <li> I like this liquid eye liner.  It goes on smoothly and stays on all day.  It doesn&#x27;t run or smudge.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! stays on till you take it off. I wore mine for 2 days even after showering and going to the gym; the second day it blended more naturally with my skin rather then looking like a harsh bold make-up and gets in good between the lashes which is a plus for me since my lashes are light due to being a blond!! Ladies don&#x27;t miss out on this product!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for more than 10 years. I love this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have been using this for over 10years and it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hell of a time recently, finding the right liquid liner for me. The reviews of this excited me so much, that the disappointment of what I received was extra frustrating. Now, I prefer a brush to a &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t mind it if it&#x27;s well designed. To me, the one attached to this one seemed stumpy and unforgiving. The formula flaked liked crazy on me. The weirdest thing is that it actually BURNS my eyelids for about 10 minutes every other time I apply it. I do not have sensitive skin to makeup, and have never experienced it before. I really hope I just had a third party send me a very old version of it, because this just.... sucked.</li>
    <li> was okay I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
    <li> The best liquid eyeliner on the market. I refuse to buy anything else. There is literally nothing that compares. Not even high-end brands, I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything and nothing outshines this product!</li>
    <li> For about 10 years this has been my favorite eyeliner. I always get compliments when I wear it and it is easy to put on (but I have a lot of practice). I am totally impressed with the look and feel of this eyeliner and will use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I was at a convention with my friends and this ended up in my make-up bag after all our make-up was everywhere, and honestly I&#x27;m glad it did. It goes on really clean, it dries pretty well, it stays on really well, and it looks amazing. I was looking up to see if I could buy more because I believe it&#x27;s slowly running out, so I haven&#x27;t actually bought it online yet, but from what I have it&#x27;s just great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This is the only liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve found that actually stays put!</li>
    <li> I really like almay as it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyelids as other liquid eyeliners can.  This product also seems to last a long time and not crack.  It will smear if you rub your eyes, but I prefer this over other brands.</li>
    <li> Best liquid liner ever</li>
    <li> This eye liner is amazing for creating dramatic looking eyes. I love that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for quick swipes to freshen up after work before heading out on the town.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner. I have been using this product for 2 years, and each bottle lasts for a pretty long time. The applicator is just thick enough so that I don&#x27;t have to do too many strokes to get the thickness I want, and it stays on all day. The only issue I have is that the applicator, which seems to be some kind of sponge material, breaks apart after a while. What I mean by this is that a little bit of the sponge starts to detach at the tip, and I have to pull it off. This is slightly annoying, but I prefer it to a really thin brush that takes forever to apply liquid eyeliner with. Also, the price point is very reasonable, especially if you sign up for a subscription.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. So stiff that it will not hold the liquid liner. I needed a hypo-allergenic eyeliner since my eyes are sensitive, but you can&#x27;t even apply this. I prefer a brush or movable tip. This is so hard that you cannot apply it.</li>
    <li> This product works well but it burns my eyes. The first few times it was a temporary burning that went away after a minute. This last time I applied it, I was shocked at how with my upper and lower lids lined I was crying from the burning. That was the tenth time I used it and the worst. I washed it all off and my eye is still sore an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;-Brielle</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, you apply it in the morning and it stays put ...end of story . No flaking, no smearing, no running, I&#x27;ve found my eyeliner for life ! It&#x27;s a little difficult to remove some people say but I don&#x27;t have any trouble . Update-3/6/15 after using it for a month or so it&#x27;s still working but I&#x27;ve noticed a slight burning sensation when I first apply it. This lasts for a few seconds but goes away soon after that and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Causes a little irritation if I get it too close to my actual eye (which is the point of liner isn&#x27;t it?!), but other than that, it&#x27;s great. Love the dark black, smooth line, easy applicator.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a shot.I will not be purchasing it again.Its a pain in the butt.It doesnt go on even, and to get a thick even line, you have to apply, let dry, and repeat several times.Very aggravating!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to this brand but the last time I bought it, the color was really dark and nice but it seems like they did something to the formula recently. There are just better alternatives now than this one sadly. It just doesn&#x27;t provide sharp dark lines anymore and you really have to apply it more often now.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I have used.  I do an eye primer under and it lasts all day.  Even without primer, it has staying power.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner so much! It works great and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> My search for the perfect liquid eyeliner stops with this product. I have been on a journey half of my life to find brand with the perfect applicator, the perfect shade of black, the perfect consistancy.. etc.  Almay takes the cake. Never fades, doesnt bleed or transfer onto my eyelid in the middle of the day, doesnt take my eyelashes with it when Im removing my make up at the end of the day and, best of all, does NOT irrite my eyes.  I really love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good eye liner, the tip is great except the liquid isn&#x27;t very dark so you have to apply a couple layers but overall not bad</li>
    <li> this kind of Eyeliner always made my eyelid a little bit uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so did this one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;except that, it was great , very dramatic eyeline, did not fade away after a whole day,beautiful~</li>
