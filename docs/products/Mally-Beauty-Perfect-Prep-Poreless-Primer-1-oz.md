      <li>We&#x27;re sold on Laura Geller Spackle if you&#x27;re looking for a good one ; )</li>
      <li>Filled in the pores and my makeup went on smoothly!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the problem was with the other reviewer, but just go to the QVC website and look at the wonderful reviews there.</li>
      <li>This is the only primer I&#x27;ve used and actually loved!</li>
      <li>For years I would use moisturizer and then do my foundation on top, but with this primer, which I&#x27;ve seen demonstrated on Mallybeauty.com, the foundation sits right on top without sinking into my pores.</li>
      <li>It worked like a charm and my makeup stayed perfect for the entire hot and humid day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of primers and this is by far the best so far!</li>
      <li>Together they keep my makeup fabulous all day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gonna last for a while lol.</li>
      <li>I felt like it rolled up on my skin and just didn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.  </li>
      <li>This product is so smooth and truly does what it says.</li>
      <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
      <li>This one rates right along side BE primer, but this one is alittle better.  </li>
      <li>When I first tried this product for the first week I really liked it, it did everything that the description said it would.  </li>
      <li>But after about ten minuted it absorbed and was great.</li>
      <li>I have large pores,  this product made them stand out more.</li>
      <li>This product sure didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many primers and nothing really compares.  </li>
      <li>Seriously guys, this is great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super silky and makes my makeup stay on longer and go on smoother.</li>
      <li>The PPPP is nice and light feeling on the skin and my makeup looks the same when I wash my face at night as when I put it on in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I get pretty oily during the summer humidity, and I just dab lightly away my sweat and</li>
      <li>This is the first Mally product I have tried and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
      <li>but I believe I could get a primer that works just as good from the drugstore for a lot less money.</li>
      <li>This is the first Primer I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
      <li>Well I have to say I disagreed the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>The first day I wore it</li>
      <li>Have used many products over the years, but never had an outbreak such as this.</li>
      <li>Pretty packaging</li>
      <li>The product is exactly as it is marketed.</li>
      <li>This will be re-orderd way before I run out since I can not imagine applying without first using Perect Prep Poreless Primer.</li>
      <li>I had my mom use it without telling her first</li>
      <li>First, to be perfectly honest, it only blurs pores, it does not make them disappear; however, it does make the overall surface of the skin appear smoother.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use a foundation, I just apply my powder and blush and I am ready to go.</li>
      <li>Like others, I watched the QVC demos and was really intrigued by it.</li>
      <li>seems more like a knockoff pink lotion &amp;#34;or...</li>
      <li>This primer, in my opinion is definitely better than any of the Makeup Forever primers, which are widely over-rated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more primers and by far Mally is the only one for me.</li>
      <li>and I was looking for a good primer for my face to hold my Bare Escentuals makeup on my face longer and not make my face look too oily or uneven.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff, wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, have ordered many times</li>
      <li>I am 60 and have had trouble with face makeup seeping deep into the lines on my face and with this product, my face stays just as nice as when I first applied my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this primer would work well for older women that have no history with acne or are past the age of still getting acne.  </li>
      <li>And i&#x27;m not usually a pimple person.</li>
      <li>The second biggest plus of this primer, and its main job, is that it does really help your makeup stay on longer.</li>
      <li>It is so soft and silky, I also use it on my hands.</li>
      <li>I am 55 years old</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I got it.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s vital to have.</li>
      <li>So, to conclude, you don&#x27;t really NEED this product as long as you have the Mally Beauty Evercolor Poreless Face Defender.</li>
      <li>I recently got my makeup done professionally.</li>
      <li>than my bare minerals.i get compliments always.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this Poreless Primer about 5 months ago and I was looking for a good primer for my face to hold my Bare Escentuals makeup on my face longer and not make my face look too oily or uneven.  When I first tried this product for the first week I really liked it, it did everything that the description said it would.  But by the second to third week of using it it caused me to breakout really REALLY bad and I stopped using it altogether.  Keep in mind though that I am only 19 and had a past history of having minor acne but this caused massive acne on my face.  I realized that this does not say that it is non-comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores) and it has silicone in it.  The silicone I am assuming does not let your skin breath.  I&#x27;m sure this primer would work well for older women that have no history with acne or are past the age of still getting acne.  But for anyone around my age trust me you do not want to use this.  It will clog up your pores and cause you to breakout.</li>
    <li> I saw this demonstrated by Mally on QVC.  It is to be used after you use moisturizer, then the Perfect Poreless Primer.  I have never seen a product like this before.  Instead of the makeup soaking into your skin, it sits on top of the primer, therefore, staying out of the wrinkles and creases. It sort of seals the moisturizer with a layer of Perfect Primer.  It truly works.  I could not believe it.  I am 60 and have had trouble with face makeup seeping deep into the lines on my face and with this product, my face stays just as nice as when I first applied my makeup.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem was with the other reviewer, but just go to the QVC website and look at the wonderful reviews there.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this primer. My make-up goes on like silk. I literally feel like I have on no make up at all. This will be re-orderd way before I run out since I can not imagine applying without first using Perect Prep Poreless Primer. For a 56 year old woman to feel her face looks flawless is indeed a high compliment to Miss Mally!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first Primer I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;m glad about that! For years I would use moisturizer and then do my foundation on top, but with this primer, which I&#x27;ve seen demonstrated on Mallybeauty.com, the foundation sits right on top without sinking into my pores. Seriously guys, this is great!</li>
    <li> I love this primer! I have a very dry \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone. This product goes on over my moisturizer, and turns my skin to silk! I use it morning and night. My skin is smoother, softer and my make up stays perfect all day!  This product is much more affordable here (8 ounces for $35.00)than on QVC- where they sell 1 ounce for $34.17 (the \\&quot;feature price\\&quot;). Can&#x27;t go wrong with that!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as it is marketed. I like it - but I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many primers and nothing really compares.  It is perfect and feels great. I have fallen in love with Mally&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I love it!  After reading the different reviews I was a little skeptical. I was not sure if this was the product for me.  I am 55 years old and I don&#x27;t like to use a foundation.  My face is starting to show its age. I use it in the morning and at night after applying my sunblock/moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t have to use a foundation, I just apply my powder and blush and I am ready to go. My skin looks healthy. It is so soft and silky, I also use it on my hands.</li>
    <li> not the real deal at all!!Was.not.happy nor satisfied with.this product.from.this.particular seller at all!!!  seems more like a knockoff pink lotion &amp;#34;or... pink hair creme&amp;#34; :( Definetly not a Mally primer...!!!</li>
    <li> I adore this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and would&#x27;t consider using any other primer!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> This product sure didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I have 64 year old oily skin that shows every pore, and I&#x27;d hoped for a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; but was sadly disapointed.  I tried mineral foundation powder over and liquid foundation both, but it didn&#x27;t help under either one.</li>
    <li> your face feels like satin .I put it on after moisturizer . than my bare minerals.i get compliments always. I love this stuff. ive used it nom 3 yrs.</li>
    <li> Mally has this formula down! It&#x27;s a must for me. I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more primers and by far Mally is the only one for me.</li>
    <li> Great price, great find, great product!  Odorless, light-weight, and does its job.  Love this primer!  Keeps my makeup on throughout the day without me needing to do any touch-ups.  I get pretty oily during the summer humidity, and I just dab lightly away my sweat and my makeup&#x27;s still on!  I&#x27;d def. buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes foundation make-up look and feel flawless. Very light feel. I will always have some in the make-up bag.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer I have ever used, and I have a lot of primers. This is the first Mally product I have tried and I&#x27;m hooked! The PPPP is nice and light feeling on the skin and my makeup looks the same when I wash my face at night as when I put it on in the morning.  If your on the fence buy it,  you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Love Mally. Bit this particar product is a no go for me. I have large pores,  this product made them stand out more. I wore it to work and ended up washing my face at work when I I saw myself in the nirror. It Didn&#x27;t Help Me out.</li>
    <li> This is the only primer I&#x27;ve used and actually loved! It&#x27;s super silky and makes my makeup stay on longer and go on smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This one rates right along side BE primer, but this one is alittle better.  Fills in pores and feels wonderful on your face.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love Mally products! This is one of the best primers I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s so smooth and has amazing coverage. Smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> I rated this three stars as I am not sure if I see and feel a difference from other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve watched this product for a long time. Reading the reviews I went for it. Well I have to say I disagreed the first time I used it. It seemed greasy. But after about ten minuted it absorbed and was great. Filled in the pores and my makeup went on smoothly! I&#x27;m editing this review I initially gave it two stars but after a weeks use I&#x27;m changing that to all five! Try it...</li>
    <li> Like others, I watched the QVC demos and was really intrigued by it. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on it! When it finally arrived via UPS, I started using it and I loved it. My face felt like silk and it hid imperfections....then, about a week later the small pimples started coming--on my cheeks, jaw area, forehead, chin.... they didnt stay small either. They are now large and disgusting. And i&#x27;m not usually a pimple person. I dont have allergies. Have used many products over the years, but never had an outbreak such as this. So, here I have a big jar of this stuff and cannot even use it. Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I paid for this and was sent EYE PRIMER...horrible service.  I wasted so much money on something I didn&#x27;t even order.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, have ordered many times</li>
    <li> It takes just a small amount. You use less foundation! This product is so smooth and truly does what it says. The first day I wore it I had people telling me I looked beautiful! I would recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Made my skin breakout in the worst way.</li>
    <li> I really love this. Feels great going on and the makeup STAYS. I&#x27;m a temp leasing agent and I work 40 hours a week. So I have to definitely need something to stay put and not slide everywhere like a hockey puck on ice. It does the job and I&amp;#34;m really impressed. I&#x27;m a Mallynista now :-) Oh and by the way, there&#x27;s plenty in the jar. I was surprised when I got it. It&#x27;s gonna last for a while lol.</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this, and I LOVE it!  My face feels so good after applying it.  It seems to help my eye makeup stay on better.  I am bad about rubbing my eyes (allergies), and I think this really helps keep my shadow in place.</li>
    <li> I had never tried a Mally product before because everything is way to pricey.I bought this and it&lt;br /&gt;is no better than a $10 primer I have.</li>
    <li> Perfect for under makeup</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this and I love everything else Mally, but this is nothing to write home about.  I felt like it rolled up on my skin and just didn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.  I had my mom use it without telling her first and she had the same thoughts.  We&#x27;re sold on Laura Geller Spackle if you&#x27;re looking for a good one ; )</li>
    <li> I love Mally cosmetics and wear many items in her line.  This is a great Bronzer.  Just enough with no organdy color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Mally Perfect Prep Primer after reading about it in a women&#x27;s magazine.  I was already using Oil of Olay primer which was about 1/2 the cost.  After using both I am unable to recognize any benefits or advantages of the Mally over the cheaper product.  It does feel very smooth on your face.</li>
    <li> After using almost every primer on the market, I finally caved in, and gave this one a try. First, to be perfectly honest, it only blurs pores, it does not make them disappear; however, it does make the overall surface of the skin appear smoother. The second biggest plus of this primer, and its main job, is that it does really help your makeup stay on longer. I have oily skin, and I have worn this under my makeup on the hottest of days, and when I return home the makeup is still in place. What I would recommend if you use this primer, and have oily skin, is that you use blotting papers to absorb the excess oil, and leave the makeup in place. This primer, in my opinion is definitely better than any of the Makeup Forever primers, which are widely over-rated.</li>
    <li> I recently got my makeup done professionally. One product that my makeup artist used was Mally Beauty Evercolor Poreless Face Defender. She applied it before she did my makeup and after to set it. It worked like a charm and my makeup stayed perfect for the entire hot and humid day. So, I knew I just had to have this product. I went online and found out that Mally Beauty also has this product, the Perfect Prep Poreless Primer, and I thought that I should get that to use before putting on my makeup. It worked well. However, the other day when I was pressed for time I didn&#x27;t use the Primer and just dabbed on the Evercolor Poreless Face Defender after applying my makeup without the Primer. And guess what? My makeup stayed perfectly, again on a hot and humid day. So, to conclude, you don&#x27;t really NEED this product as long as you have the Mally Beauty Evercolor Poreless Face Defender. I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s vital to have.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, no matter how I used this product, I was unable to shake the white hew it leaves behind.  I do not require a ton of makeup for coverage, so this may not have been the best choice for me.</li>
    <li> Pretty packaging but I believe I could get a primer that works just as good from the drugstore for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> Best primer out there! Wouldn&#x27;t switch to anything again. I&#x27;ve used tons of primers and this is by far the best so far! I recommend every one try it.</li>
    <li> Interestingly enough it is not just a primer but also hydrates.....Nice!</li>
    <li> Got this along with the poreless face defender. Together they keep my makeup fabulous all day.  Can not wait to try ohter&lt;br /&gt;mally products.</li>
