### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They seem to be happy.</li>
      <li>Great product to dispose of my used razors.</li>
      <li>Great blade dispenser.  </li>
      <li>constructed very nicely.</li>
      <li>Great product, fair price and on time.</li>
      <li>I read good reviews here and decided a razor disposal case was a good idea.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like the plastic, check around and I&#x27;m sure you can find it!</li>
      <li>The box that Feather makes for safety razor blades is made of some kind of metal (maybe tin?)</li>
      <li>Up front, I don&#x27;t own this blade bank.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Feather, from Japan, makes what I have come to regard as the best double edge blades in the world.</li>
      <li>Works as avertised, compact safe storage of used razor blades.</li>
      <li>love it, Now I don&#x27;t worry about used blades</li>
      <li>Many razor blades do not arrive in a case with a disposal compartment.</li>
      <li>It holds a lot of blades and is safe.</li>
      <li>I feel much better knowing that they are in a safe place until</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>If aesthetically was a little nicer, that would be great, but it&#x27;s a great disposal case.</li>
      <li>Safe and convenient to fit into my medicine cabinet in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>This one is made out of a strong plastic.</li>
      <li>Strong, durable case.</li>
      <li>This hold quite a lot of blades, then when its filled you can throw it out.  </li>
      <li>My brand of DE razors has the slot to dispose used razors but I bought this case to qualify for free shipping.</li>
      <li>Also, when I&#x27;ve tossed out a filled bank before, I always put a piece of duct tape across the opening before dropping it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great case, an easy way to safely dispose of a lot of sharp blades!</li>
      <li>I chose giving the item four stars because it works as intended, but could stand to be a little more attractive</li>
      <li>If you are buying a large order of supplies it would be better to buy elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already dropped 10 blades in and it seems like I have yet to drop anything into it, so it will last a good while for me.</li>
      <li>and if this one ever gets full.</li>
      <li>Good solid piece!</li>
      <li>Works like a charm, when full (and that will take some time) tape the opening shut, throw it away.</li>
      <li>Gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking of handling a bare razor-need to get this thing into a safe (non-cutting) area fast--Perfect solution, so I can sleep at night!</li>
      <li>After trying different razors, blades and shave soaps, I am very glad I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As it turns out it is perfect for  disposing single edge razors that I ordered later on!</li>
      <li>But I thought it was important for DE safety razor users to know, since the seller didn&#x27;t provide any useful information, that this was made specifically for straight razor users.</li>
      <li>Well my dear cat, Frankenstein, decided it would be fun</li>
      <li>Besides, I figured this would look pretty cool in my medicine cabinet in my bathroom anyway.</li>
      <li>Beats trying to fit used blades back in original container.</li>
      <li>This blade disposal case is ok but the blade slot is too big.</li>
      <li>Years ago, there was a blade disposal slot in the back of most bathroom medicine chests.</li>
      <li>The construction is kind of flimsy but most alarmingly is the slot is so big</li>
      <li>In other words, the Feather Blade Disposal Case is not needed if one buys the pre-packaged unit of either the 5 or 10 unit blades because they have their own disposal</li>
      <li>Simple design, holds a whole bunch of used blades safely.</li>
      <li>In the old days, many medicine cabinets had a slot in the back for people to drop their used blades right in the wall between the studs.  </li>
      <li>This is a much better option in the wet tiled bathroom.</li>
      <li>Feather has a different bank, which I don&#x27;t think is available on Amazon, for safety razor users.</li>
      <li>You can fit the thickness of several blades through this slot at one time.  </li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job, doesn&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the few bucks to ensure the blades are safely disposed of.</li>
      <li>The opening on the top of this bank that the previous reviewer mentions is sized to fit the entire head of the straight razor</li>
      <li>You can either properly dispose of the entire case, or snap off the cap, dispose of the used blades safely, and reuse the disposal</li>
      <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and lkeeps my little ones safe when they get a hold of it.</li>
      <li>Do you really want a NONsecure way to store old razor blades?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how safe that was.  </li>
      <li>I think this would have been better to make a very narrow blade opening to truly ensure the blades don&#x27;t fall out and hurt someone.  </li>
      <li>Some blades fell out when this gets near to capacity.  </li>
      <li>I worry about my toddler picking up my old blades.</li>
      <li>This is a good disposal case but it is a bit expensive for what you get.</li>
      <li>I purchased a 35 double edge blade sampler to see if I could find a blade which I liked, i.e. blades which are sharp and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I am recently new to double edge shaving.  </li>
      <li>Case in point: until this came in the mail, I was just putting my used blades on the bathroom counter in the center of a large roll of tape to keep them out of harms way and to prevent slicing up my garage bag.</li>
      <li>Medicine chests once had a slot in the back to banish old blades to the obis between the walls.</li>
      <li>and it stores spent blades very well.</li>
      <li>far as the overall usefulness of a blade bank in general, I definitely use one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Normally, double edge blades are packaged in packages of either 5 or 10 blades come automatically in a plastic case where one side dispenses new blades and the other side is for blade disposal.  </li>

    <li> love it, Now I don&#x27;t worry about used blades</li>
    <li> Must have for a wet shaver.  In the old days, many medicine cabinets had a slot in the back for people to drop their used blades right in the wall between the studs.  I&#x27;m not sure how safe that was.  This hold quite a lot of blades, then when its filled you can throw it out.  It is expensive on Amazon compared to other places, but shipping is included.  If you are buying a large order of supplies it would be better to buy elsewhere.</li>

    <li> Good solid piece! Buy it!!</li>
    <li> Over priced. Check elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is a good disposal case but it is a bit expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> Its a box and it stores spent blades very well.</li>
    <li> A must have if you shave with a double edge blade. Compact and well built.</li>
    <li> constructed very nicely. Works like a charm, when full (and that will take some time) tape the opening shut, throw it away.</li>
    <li> A blade bank such as this is a simple necessity if you are using razor blades of any sort. This one is made out of a strong plastic. It looks like it would be next to impossible to get a blade out of it without intentionally destroying the box.  It should do it&#x27;s job well, and looks like it should hold a lot of double-edged razor blades.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Arrived on time would recommend it to all</li>
    <li> Great blade dispenser.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and lkeeps my little ones safe when they get a hold of it.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES the entire set I bought him.</li>
    <li> ugly but functional and safe.</li>
    <li> The construction is kind of flimsy but most alarmingly is the slot is so big I&#x27;m afraid the blades will fall back out!  Do you really want a NONsecure way to store old razor blades?</li>
    <li> After searching, there&#x27;s a tin version of this blade bank.  If you don&#x27;t like the plastic, check around and I&#x27;m sure you can find it!</li>
    <li> Up front, I don&#x27;t own this blade bank. But I thought it was important for DE safety razor users to know, since the seller didn&#x27;t provide any useful information, that this was made specifically for straight razor users. Feather has a different bank, which I don&#x27;t think is available on Amazon, for safety razor users. The opening on the top of this bank that the previous reviewer mentions is sized to fit the entire head of the straight razor and then you drag the razor handle back and the blade drops into the box. The box that Feather makes for safety razor blades is made of some kind of metal (maybe tin?) and the opening is much smaller. DE safety razor users can definitely make use of this bank, but it just wasn&#x27;t designed for us. Also, when I&#x27;ve tossed out a filled bank before, I always put a piece of duct tape across the opening before dropping it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the overall usefulness of a blade bank in general, I definitely use one. I use Astra blades and there ain&#x27;t no place to put used blades in their cardboard packaging. And, personally, I&#x27;m not about to take an xacto knife to a mint tin to make one. Before I got a bank, I used to wrap each used blade in duct tape which was a wee bit unsafe and definitely a PIA. Definitely worth the few bucks to ensure the blades are safely disposed of.</li>
    <li> Ultimately an expensive box, but does the job I need it to do!</li>
    <li> Gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking of handling a bare razor-need to get this thing into a safe (non-cutting) area fast--Perfect solution, so I can sleep at night!</li>
    <li> Works well, much cleaner than my previous solution (I had a thick grey bag I was putting them in).</li>
    <li> Great product to dispose of my used razors. Safe and convenient to fit into my medicine cabinet in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Simple design, holds a whole bunch of used blades safely. will buy again when and if this one ever gets full.</li>
    <li> I worry about my toddler picking up my old blades. This solves that problem.  I just wish it were larger.</li>
    <li> I chose giving the item four stars because it works as intended, but could stand to be a little more attractive looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend having one of these around if you use a DE safety razor. Case in point: until this came in the mail, I was just putting my used blades on the bathroom counter in the center of a large roll of tape to keep them out of harms way and to prevent slicing up my garage bag. Well my dear cat, Frankenstein, decided it would be fun it start playing with these blades, unknowingly to me. So I walked in the bathroom one day and find bloody paw prints all over the bathroom because the cat was batting the blade around the bathroom and hid the evidence under the bathroom rug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, if you have a dumb cat, child, or life partner, buy one of these to put your used blades in.</li>
    <li> I read good reviews here and decided a razor disposal case was a good idea. I have cats and careless roommates - the last thing I want is for one of them to get zapped by one of my discarded safety razor blades. Besides, I figured this would look pretty cool in my medicine cabinet in my bathroom anyway. Let&#x27;s hear it for wet shaving with a safety razor!</li>
    <li> This blade disposal case is ok but the blade slot is too big. Some blades fell out when this gets near to capacity.  I think this would have been better to make a very narrow blade opening to truly ensure the blades don&#x27;t fall out and hurt someone.  You can fit the thickness of several blades through this slot at one time.  Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be getting this again as the Derby blades I now exclusively use have a tiny blade vault in the back.</li>
    <li> It holds a lot of blades and is safe.</li>
    <li> Gives me peace of mind that my dogs won&#x27;t eat a razor blade out of the trash. I just wish the case looked nicer on my sink counter.</li>
    <li> Many razor blades do not arrive in a case with a disposal compartment. Medicine chests once had a slot in the back to banish old blades to the obis between the walls. I was using a small jar with a slot in the lid. This is a much better option in the wet tiled bathroom.</li>
    <li> The disposal case stores my used blades as expected. Strong, durable case. I&#x27;ve already dropped 10 blades in and it seems like I have yet to drop anything into it, so it will last a good while for me. Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because of its design. If aesthetically was a little nicer, that would be great, but it&#x27;s a great disposal case.</li>
    <li> I am recently new to double edge shaving.  I purchased a 35 double edge blade sampler to see if I could find a blade which I liked, i.e. blades which are sharp and long lasting. The blades in the sampler were loose and I need something to dispose of the used blades, so I purchased the Feather Blade disposal case and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, double edge blades are packaged in packages of either 5 or 10 blades come automatically in a plastic case where one side dispenses new blades and the other side is for blade disposal.  In other words, the Feather Blade Disposal Case is not needed if one buys the pre-packaged unit of either the 5 or 10 unit blades because they have their own disposal case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, the Feather Blade Disposal Case is relatively &amp;#34;huge&amp;#34;, i.e. thousands and it will probably last me a life-time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone else.  They seem to be happy.</li>
    <li> Great case, an easy way to safely dispose of a lot of sharp blades!</li>
    <li> Works as avertised, compact safe storage of used razor blades.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I tried double edge shaving to get a closer shave. After trying different razors, blades and shave soaps, I am very glad I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, while emptying the trash, I cut my finger on a blade I had thrown away. That&#x27;s when realized throwing used blades in the trash is a bad idea. Years ago, there was a blade disposal slot in the back of most bathroom medicine chests. Those days are gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather, from Japan, makes what I have come to regard as the best double edge blades in the world. They also make a low cost used blade disposal case which holds 100 used blades. At about 1 week per blade, the case holds a 2 year supply of used blades. You can either properly dispose of the entire case, or snap off the cap, dispose of the used blades safely, and reuse the disposal case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case does what it says it will do and I will not be causing injury to someone after I have thrown loose blades away.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised and delived on time</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, doesn&#x27;t cost much.  Beats trying to fit used blades back in original container.</li>
    <li> Double edged razors are both useful and dangerous. I feel much better knowing that they are in a safe place until and after they have been disposed of. Great product, fair price and on time. Thank you</li>
