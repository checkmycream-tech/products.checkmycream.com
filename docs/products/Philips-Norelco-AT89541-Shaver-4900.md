      <li>Gives a very comfortable close shave and is surprisingly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>better electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and clean and does a good job of shaving.</li>
      <li>I am usually pleased with my orders placed with Amazon , but not this time.  </li>
      <li>I have owned 5 or 6 triple header Norelcos and like them as they work better on my face; most of them also have a usable pop-up trimmer.  </li>
      <li>It also means more nicks, or so it seems to me.</li>
      <li>but, I would have to say this is not my favorite.</li>
      <li>There are more fancy shavers offered by Norelco</li>
      <li>Shaver seems powerful especially on a full charge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>and I believe that for your money, you can&#x27;t find a better shaver.</li>
      <li>This shaver is one of the latest from Phillips.  </li>
      <li>I owned a shaver like this some 20 years ago and remember it as working better then this one does.  </li>
      <li>This shaver won&#x27;t work if you have beard/ moustache  grown anything more than two or max</li>
      <li>More like every 2-3 days or sometimes more.</li>
      <li>the blades are better so they can deal with hairs better&lt;</li>
      <li>Would like to consider up grading to the top of the line shaver.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco AT895/41 for my husband for Christmas. He likes the Philips Norelco Shavers because they are a good quality razor that gives him a clean shave and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My first shaver lost the pivot that holds the head on in the first day.  I got a replacement from Amazon which was painless.  The news ones have held up so far (2 weeks) and cut great.  Very quiet, light, and smooth.  I do not use the stand.  On the first charge they have run 2 weeks and still have juice left.  This have used Norelco electric shavers for 40 years and they usually last 8+ years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lazy. Really lazy. In fact, its kind of a blessing to me that I have a baby face. My facial hair is very sparse and light colored. I can go several days without shaving and no one would notice. But I notice when I run my hands across my cheeks and chin and feel the stubble. It annoys me for some reason. I also hate to shave, so I wanted a shaver that did well dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially tried the [[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]], a foil razor. It actually did well for me, maybe even slightly better than the rotaries I tried. But it had three big cons against it: The battery was not Lithium ion, it was quite a bit louder than the rotaries, and it was made in China (I know, everything is made in China, but I was hoping I could find some hold out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To that extent, I took a peek at the [[ASIN:B006GQYSC8 Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor]]. Great battery, made in the Netherlands, and quiet. Hooray! But, I sent it back to Phillips Norelco because the dry shave was kind of lousy to me. It took 10-15 minutes (!) to feel like I got a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a last resort, I found this AT895 locally. I also paid too much locally, so pick it up on Amazon to save some bucks. It is quiet with a great battery (fully charged in one hour). Unfortunately, this unit is also made in China but life is about compromises, right? But what did it for me is that this design, along with the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGE Philips Norelco AT830 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor]] have a special pivoting plate that the three cutting heads rest on. The pivoting plate only pivots in two directions, and only a few degrees (less than 10). But for some reason, that made a noticeable difference in the quality of my dry shaves. My neck, just under by chin and jaw, is a trouble spot, and I start there when the heads haven&#x27;t heated up from friction to reduce irritation. It takes time, but not as much as the aforementioned razors. It also takes fewer passes to clean up my upper lip, chin and cheeks. This translates to less irritation as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying pouch is of average quality - Phillips didn&#x27;t break the bank designing or producing it, but it will work. The charging stand is little more than a lightweight plastic saucer/doughnut shape that you can use or not. The cord plugs into the stand or the razor itself to charge. The stand has a tiny hole at its lowest point which allows excess water from a wet shave to drain down and out (on to your vanity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these razors did exceptionally well on a wet shave. I&#x27;ve used Barbisol, shaving soap applied with a badger brush (from my DE trials) and even body wash applied to my face in the shower. Wet the heads of the shaver and have at it. The device glides slickly across your face, and almost feels like it is tackling your scruff more aggressively. I never experienced irritation with a wet shave with any electric shaver, though the Braun actually cut me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the device is designed solidly. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it will disintegrate after three months&#x27; usage. I really love and appreciate the pop-open head that allows you to wash out the blades from the top, underside and clean the clippings trap as well. And it all stays attached to the shaver body so it keeps things simple. It takes awhile to get it to dry out because the trap has little nooks that water hides in. But just set the device on its side so that the open end faces as far down as possible (with the head &#x27;plate&#x27; opened, or alternatively, use the stand) and it will dry in several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt the irritation and time spent shaving with this AT895 was slightly less than with the AT810, but supposedly with practice, shaving time and irritation will reduce, and the results will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I like this razor. The Braun gave a better dry shave, but it had its shortcomings. And with my facial hair, nobody will ever call me out on it. Ifyou look like Dusty Hill, pony up for a more expensive model (of any brand) that has a more powerful motor. This model is likely best for people with light to medium facial hair density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!you look like Dusty Hill, pony up for a more expensive model (of any brand) that has a more powerful motor.

    <li> Would like to consider up grading to the top of the line shaver.  What&#x27;s your policy on upgrading?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobhawkes@aol.com</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace another Philips/Norelco razor (7310XL) that I&#x27;ve had for a couple of years. The previous razor gave a &#x27;decent&#x27; shave, but the battery life started to decline: I used to get 5 or 6 shaves from that razor between charges, but it dropped to 2 and I figured the battery was wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the AT895 for three straight days and, so far, I&#x27;ve been impressed: it delivers a closer shave in less time than my previous one. Perhaps its the &#x27;SmartPivot&#x27; feature, but for whatever reason it IS a considerable improvement. It should be noted that I only use the razor in the &#x27;dry&#x27; mode, so anyone reading this that prefers the &#x27;wet&#x27; mode should bear this in mind. That being said, I am--so far at least--completely happy with the razor. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars was due to my limited experience. If the same results I&#x27;ve experienced so far continue, then I would definitely rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> read many reviews on different razors. what I liked the most was the wet / dry feature. This is my first electric razor and could not be happier, works great with foam.</li>
    <li> What a surprise, either my old razors are junk or this is a really good razor.  Great shave.</li>
    <li> Works great, as most razors in this price range do/should. Charging cradle is hardly, although a little light and cheesy, but its just a stand so I can&#x27;t complain. Shave is close and only needs 2 passes to get everything. Pop-out clippers are ultra handy, as I use them the most. For the $$$, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I bought this item! I never have to use a razor anymore. This works so smoothly and cuts really close!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Gives a very comfortable close shave and is surprisingly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would be a top tier razor. It is not. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t bad, but I had a $30 razor I got from Walmart that was actually nicer. This one is slower than the one I used to have and costs over twice as much. I Still like Norelco better than the other brands, but I am not sure this is worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he had neck surgery and could not use a wet razor. His scar has healed now but he has retired the wet razor because the Norelco is much kinder to his sensitive skin.  He especially likes the pop up feature for trimming his side burns.</li>
    <li> Poor stand!  Not substantially built!  Had to wiggle razor into stand to find electrical contacts.  Design poor.  Razor is excellent meeting all previous expectations.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco electrical razors for the past 30+ years.  Please redesign the stand.</li>
    <li> My husband says it gives him the closest shave than any other electric shaver he&#x27;s used. He highly recommends this item.</li>
    <li> I love shaving in the shower with it - and also that I can dry shave if I want. It does both very well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for over 30 years and I believe that for your money, you can&#x27;t find a better shaver. They cut close and I can get us close to my mustache without hitting it. You don&#x27;t need the high end models as they cut all cut the same.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. Really enjoy being able to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions to &#x27;condition&amp;#34; my face to become accustomed to an electric razor for the prescribed 21 days ... used it in the shower, used William&#x27;s lectric shave, etc, but I never felt like I had a reasonably closer shave than I used go get with the Braun battery operated model. It was disappointing.</li>
    <li> Husband needed this for traveling and it works for him.  He said it&#x27;s not a close as a razor but all and all it is good.</li>
    <li> Ease of operation.  Gentle on skin,  Good, clean shaves.</li>
    <li> This thing has saved my life! No more Dollar Shave Club for me!</li>
    <li> My third Norelco , smooth close shave. I shave. Both face and head, does a great , job,!</li>
    <li> I was given this for Father&#x27;s Day.  I get a much closer shave then from my old Noreco!</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Replaced my old norelco of some twenty years or more.  Figured it was time to retire it.  The new technology is amazing.  Wish I had purchased a new one years ago but the old one would not die and is still working.  Going to use it for travel and keep the new one home.</li>
    <li> Great product.... Took some getting used to, not as close as a razor, but still a good shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t go back to foam</li>
    <li> From the first time I used the 895 it was a great.  I like forward to continued use for years.</li>
    <li> This shaver is one of the latest from Phillips.  I have had other shavers from Phillips,  but this one has proven tops.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone thinking about purchasing an electric shaver.  I would also recommend the dealer .  Best price I could find.  This item was purchased thru AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for last 20+ years - used the shaver wet and chased with a blade for smooth shave and no blood.  Now that I&#x27;m retired, I have been using it more often as a dry shaver but it was taking too long and cut whiskers were ending up on my shirt.  I was counting on Norelco reputation for a good dry shaver.  They say 3 weeks for face to adjust to any shaver changes but after 2 days, The Norelco is outperforming the Panasonic and best of all, it is VERY quiet, easy to clean and no whiskers on my shirt.  I haven&#x27;t tried the wet performance but expect it to be comparable Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Never had an electric shaver in my life before, this is my first one. After my first shave with this, it was a pretty good and close shave, it left my skin feeling super soft. I definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Curs better the first day than my old one. I should have upgraded long ago.</li>
    <li> It was a fine razor, I bought another one just like it when this broke after only having it for six months.  I hope that the new one is going to last longer than the first one did.</li>
    <li> After my dog decided to use my last one as a chew toy, I decided to upgrade from the standard rechargeable Norelco I&#x27;d been getting to a nicer one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I notice is how modern and sleek this Norelco looks, standing on its charger in all black. The charging dock makes charging and storage convenient, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the Norelco operates quieter and shaves smoother than my previous Norelco.  The hinges on the sides really help to contour the heads around your face and the end result is less irritation and a faster shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else is the same standard of quality I&#x27;ve gotten from my last few Norelco shavers. I&#x27;m confident that this will last me quite a few years, hopefully even longer than my last two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- Buy the replacement heads on here [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8 Dual Precision Replacement Heads]] instead of on Norelco&#x27;s website - you&#x27;ll pay 10% of the price they charge on their site and you can also get them subscribe and save to pay even less.&lt;br /&gt;- Oil the shaver heads just as you would a razor or electric clippers, though you can oil these every two weeks instead of after every use like clippers. I use [[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis 12750 Cool Care Plus, 15.5 oz]] as it&#x27;s cheap, a huge can, and it has great ingredients to make your blades last twice as long (you should replace them once a year but oiling them will make them last 2 years)</li>
    <li> Gives an excellent, clean shave, is very quiet and easy to clean. The battery life seems very good. I have been using this for about 4 weeks and have not had to recharge the battery. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great!  My husband loves it! It quick charges, so that he can take it with him when he&#x27;s on the go!</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head. Really like that I can use this in the shower with shaving gel. Smoother shave then any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Being a Soldier, you have to be clean-shaven every duty day. In garrison (i.e. when you&#x27;re not in the field) this isn&#x27;t a huge deal. I have soft, blonde facial hair, so I can get away with shaving (Dorco SXA5000 6 blade) the night before work and still be good through an average work day. In the field though, it&#x27;s either logistically difficult (i.e. not a lot of water), or uncomfortable (it&#x27;s really miserable shaving with cold water when it&#x27;s also cold outside).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different razors - Remington rotary, Braun foil, etc. and they either haven&#x27;t shaved close enough, or they tear up my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Philips AT895 - polar opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Dry: Not quite as close as a regular razor, and I can&#x27;t get away with shaving the night before.&lt;br /&gt;With Lectric Shave: Little better, the razor glides easier and it cuts a little closer. Still not good enough to let me shave the night before.&lt;br /&gt;In the shower: Doesn&#x27;t work too hot with just water. The razor doesn&#x27;t glide very well.&lt;br /&gt;In the shower with soap: Much better. Cuts about as close as a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Rubbery Grip: Makes holding on to it easy (even in the shower)&lt;br /&gt;* Cut - cuts very close with no irritation, even on the neck&lt;br /&gt;* Charger - easy to just plop in, with a simple indicator as to battery status&lt;br /&gt;* Value - does an excellent job on my face, which is good - didn&#x27;t want to spend $300 on a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* None I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: This will be a loyal friend for a long time.</li>
    <li> PROS: Shaves reasonably close for an electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;Can rinse off in water&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge a long time&lt;br /&gt;Does not pull hairs&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Would like a closer shave&lt;br /&gt;Pivoting head seems stiff and does not pivot as easily as I think it should&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again or look for a similar shaver</li>
    <li> About 7 yrs ago I injured my back so bad I couldnt stand at the sink to shave, so I decided to try an electric shaver. I started with a top of the line norelco and I thought it was taking my skin off it hurt so bad so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried panasonic, remington and finally settled on the Braun top of the line 9595 which is the same ast the 760cc. The braun gave me a decent shave but not a great one but it didnt hurt.&lt;br /&gt;  Recently my braun wasnt performing well so I decided to try a new shaver, I bought the cooltec sent it back. Then I bought this AT895 based on some of the reviews. They were telling the truth, this shave shaves my very rought beard without a problem. It gives me a much closer shave than my braun did and it shaves me smoothly and is kind to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised at the quality of the shave I recieved, I am extremely happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors since the early 60&#x27;s and they always have been the best.</li>
    <li> I have always had good luck with Norelco, but I am not too impressed with the shave.  I have to work at getting a good shave.  Charging system works great. Battery life is excellent.  I wish they would implement a accordion like cord.  The straight cord is a hassle and long.</li>
    <li> Provides very comfortable shave and seems easy to keep clean. After using Panasonic for many years I thought I would try the three blade approach of the Norelco and was not disappointed. Speed of the blades seemed to be slow, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette fusion guy for a long time. My beard is tough and my skin is super sensitive. I did try a foil shaver about 6 years ago and didn&#x27;t like it and went back to the fusions. The fusions cause a ton af razor burns and ingrown hairsThis shaver does the job. One or two passes on the checks and jaw line, a few more passes on the neck area. I do have to use my other hand to stretch the skin on my neck to get all the hairs but this shaver does get em. I use it dry and brush it out after use. No razor burns or in grown hairs as of yet. Shaver seems powerful especially on a full charge. Also the convenience of this shaver is awesome. It kinda lets you be lazy during your morning shaving routine. No water or shave cream to clean or rinse off your face. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Battery charging time and life are a big improvement over my older Norelco. The motor speed is also up, so shaving is quicker than before.</li>
    <li> Everything he wanted!  He says it gives a fantastic shave and loves all of the features. We could not have picked a better gift!</li>
    <li> Purchased January 3, 2015. Mediocre shaving from the start, then quit working altogether on April 10, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Have used Norelco forever - no more.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, I have never had a rotary so maybe expecting too much. I returned another (different) Norelco rotary to the manufacturer for failure on my part to realize it did not come with the pop up sideburn/stache groomer. I wanted to really like this razor because it is quiet and eventually gets the job done, however the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow appears now at about 1:30. The pop open head via push button is nice for cleaning but if you tap it on the sink it can come loose. Not difficult to put back on at this point. All in all a good shaver, but my wet/dry Panasonic still beats it for shave time, closeness and all around sturdiness....just much louder than this norelco</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed. Previous Norelco was excellent but motor wouldn&#x27;t accept a charge after many years so I purchased this Norelco as a replacement.  The motor isn&#x27;t nearly as strong and the shave is fair at best. Would be nice if shavers could rate the power of their motor, so the consumer could make a more informed decision on the purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this. Easy to use, very efficient and easy to clean as well. This is definitely well worth the price</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Great power even when running off battery.  One charge lasts 1-2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Just what I had hoped for. A very lazy way to shave when I don&#x27;t want to lather up and grab the bic. Having never used an electric razor before this purchase, I was pleasantly surprised by how close the shave was. It might just be me, but I also believe the whiskers grow back more evenly with this than with a straight-razor.</li>
    <li> Got this as an upgrade from my old Panasonic ES-LA63-S .. and made me feel I was using a dinosaur. This is half the weight, and makes half noise,,but also shaves twice as fast and twice as good. Besides Replacement Heads (Inner Blade Replacement) are about same price and you do not need to buy the expensive Outer Foil Replacement.</li>
    <li> power status light does not seem to work  --  will read manuel for help  --  may have to return  --  can you help me  ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mb wapner</li>
    <li> Here is a video of my unboxing, first impression and comparison of both the 4100 and 4900.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and Clean | Philips Razor Unboxings: https://youtu.be/AZIbwtZOz3A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the video can help you in your decision making, especially between two in the same series.</li>
    <li> Suspect a problem exists with rotary speed. Takes too long a time to shave..even when fully charged. Need to stay on one spot to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> This thing is worthless. It shaves but leaves numerous stray hairs all over your face that force you to use a regular razor to get. I wind up having to go over my face with a regular razor anyway, so what is the purpose of this product? Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have owned 5 or 6 triple header Norelcos and like them as they work better on my face; most of them also have a usable pop-up trimmer.  This one is a bit noisier than my older 8175XL (probably the quietest Norelco I have owed) and that is the worst thing about it.  The $60 price is a good deal.</li>
    <li> All I can say it&#x27;s thank you Norelco. I got the Philips Norelco AT895/41 Shaver 4900 about a month ago. I shave my head every other day and I got great results from day one. Close shave and I save more money now that I switched from the Gillette fusion simply because of price. The last time I got 12 Gillette blades for $54.00, if this is not highway robbery, I don&#x27;t what is. SHAME ON YOU GILLETTE for charging so much for 12 blades. THANK YOU NORELCO for a great product and a very reasonable prize. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to replace my original Norelco three header.  The original&#x27;s head was worn out and the battery would hot hold a full charge as it was over 7 years old.  I opted to keep the Norelco design and quality so I upgraded to the AT 895.  I like the fact it has the pivot head and improved blade system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts close and is easy to maneuver around all of your face.  It is easy to clean and has the unique charging base which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anybody.  You will not find a better electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NONE!</li>
    <li> This does a much better job than my prior Norelco unit. It appears that the new head design really works especially on a longer beard</li>
    <li> I purchased this about six months ago, a sufficient enough time to give a good evaluation.  No electric razor will shave as close as a blade but I really don&#x27;t care.  In terms of an acceptable shave and the convenience an electric offers, this one does a great job.  If I have the time I will use it with shaving cream applied to my face and it feels really great.  There is no skin irritation and you get a nice close shave.  I am happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco Razors for the past 50 years and this one is getting the job done as always---if you have never tried Norelco then now may be the time---would order again &amp; recommend to others as well!!!</li>
    <li> Only lasted 6 months.  Used it wet/dry about every other day for 5 to 6 months... then one day it would not turn on or recharge.  No warning... just wamo... this is the 2nd Norelco Wed/Dry that did that to me... design flaw.</li>
    <li> Worked Ok but did not shave as good as previous model my husband had.  Also it does not show amount of battery left as the previous one.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to thank JM Taylor for his excellent review and help. Much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an electric shaver fan, having shaved most of my 67 years with various electric shavers. I&#x27;ve used Remingtons, Brauns, Panasonics and Norelcos during this time. Currently I have the Braun Series 7 (760) and the Braun Series 3 (380) both of which are very good shavers. I recently gave my Panasonic ES8243A to a friend since he needed a shaver but could not afford one. It&#x27;s an excellent dry/wet shaver. I&#x27;ve mentioned this to demonstrate that I know a thing or two about shavers and let me say that the Norelco AT895 is one of the best. Forget the low price... it&#x27;s simply one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to qualify the above statement. Let me begin by saying that your beard type is all-important in this determination. A heavy beard generally requires the HQ9, RQ10 or RQ12 heads whereas a medium beard (like mine) will quickly adjust to the HQ8 heads which come with the AT895. I&#x27;ve had the Arcitec, the SensoTouch 3D (1250) and found both shavers to be good but somewhat irritating due to the shaver heads used in both. I owned the Arcitec for three years before finally giving it away to a friend. The SensoTouch stayed with me for a month before I returned it. It was simply too irritating on my neck and frankly I did not care for the ergonomic design and heft of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So having determined that your beard is light to medium, you&#x27;re going to want a Norelco shaver that offers HQ8 heads (830, 875 and the 895 to name three current shavers). I chose the AT895 because it came with a stand and a case. The three shavers mentioned are identical in every other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This AT895 will deliver a superlative shave. Albeit, technique is very important. Philips advises using circular motions and they could not be more correct. If you shave your cheeks, neck, chin and jawline using small, circular motions and going against the growth of the beard, you&#x27;ll discover just how awesome a Norelco can be. The upper lip is another case entirely. The area is too small for these motions so here you&#x27;re going to want to use straight motions both horizontally and vertically. I&#x27;ve found that doing this slowly and allowing the shaver to do the work will achieve the best results. Oh...and one more thing. Letting the shaver do the job is another key. Don&#x27;t press too hard because that will defeat the lift and cut system and merely push the beard into the face as well as contribute to irritation. Allow yourself a minimum of three weeks for your face/beard to adjust to the new shaver. If on the first few shaves you discover that the shave is not quite as close as you had hoped for... don&#x27;t despair and whatever you do, don&#x27;t continue shaving to the point of irritation. You&#x27;ll soon discover that by the end of the first week, your shaves are as close as you could possibly imagine AND are irritation-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge benefit of this shaver is its ability to give a wet shave. I do not shave in the shower (too afraid of dropping the shaver with wet, slippery hands) so I shave \\&quot;wet\\&quot; over the sink. Splash on hot water.... apply a low-foam gel (Schick Hydro or [[ASIN:B002XK066I All Natural Shaving Cream]] from the Pacific Shaving Co. available here on Amazon are two good gels)... wet the shaver head... shake out the excess water and begin the shaving process. I shave from the jawline and cheek on one side towards the chin area, slowly and methodically, making the circular motions with a few short, straight strokes where needed. I do this BEFORE rinsing the shaver for the next section. Remember: to cut down on \\&quot;mess\\&quot;, gently shake the shaver&#x27;s head after rinsing to get out the excess water trapped under the head. Next I switch over to the other side of my face and work that towards the center. Lastly I shave the chin and upper lip (straight strokes there). When I&#x27;m done, I wipe off the excess gel/foam with a hot, wet wash cloth and thenapply a moisturizer. MAN... the feeling is awesome. The entire shave lasts about ten minutes and if done correctly is no more messy than a dry shave. It simply requires some care in shaking off the excess water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave \\&quot;dry\\&quot; every other day. And when I shave dry I generally use a pre-shave like Williams Lectric shave unless we&#x27;re in a humid zone on vacation when I&#x27;ll use a shaving stick like Remington Face Saver which applies a light powder to the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might make the discovery that your face actually becomes smoother several minutes later. The thing is, Norelco actually cuts \\&quot;below\\&quot; the skin&#x27;s surface with its lift and cut. As each individual hair is cut it will return beneath the skin&#x27;s upper layer leaving the skin&#x27;s surface smooth to the touch. I say that you \\&quot;might discover\\&quot; this smoothing effect several minutes later as opposed to immediately since our beards are different and the rate at which this occurs for me might be different than you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say? The AT895 is an excellent shaver and frankly in my view it is an under-priced gem. I could not be happier with my Norelco AT895.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my son as a &#x27;going back to college&#x27; gift.  A week later I asked him how it performed.  He said that, in all the years he has been shaving, this shaver gave him the smoothest, closest shave ever.  I am now considering getting one for myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked well for me. It is easy to use and clean and does a good job of shaving.</li>
    <li> Shaver failed after  1 month, got replacement unit and it failed. Now have replaced charger 2 times and still not right.&lt;br /&gt;Very poor quality control for this product.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver  only 7 times and it stopped working.  I am usually pleased with my orders placed with Amazon , but not this time.  I Will say that when it was working , it shaved nice and close , but it&#x27;s not worth anything now.</li>
    <li> This is the only electric razor that gives you that barber shop (I.e. straight razor) feel without&lt;br /&gt;the nicks, cuts and scrapes.</li>
    <li> Back in my teen-age years, I started to shave:  unwillingly I might add.  However, when I got my first ever Norelco triple floating head shaver, that changed my mind.  Ever sense then, I have counted myself a fan of the Norelco brand.  After a period of time during which I grew a beird, I decided to shave again.  After one hand raiser after another, I felt it was high time to get a new Norelco.  Although I&#x27;ve had a Philips Norelco 7340 and a 7310, (both of which served me fairly well), I felt it was time to go wet-dry on my shaver.  Via the Iphone app, I bought the Philips Norelco AT895.  Although I&#x27;ve only had it for a little under a week now, I can say without any doubt that it stands as the best shaver I ever used. Here is a link to the full video review:    [...]    My face never felt so perfectly smooth as it does with the application of the AT895 even in dry shave.  While I do wish it was a little less easy to knock over on it&#x27;s charging stand, I can&#x27;t knock its quality.  What really stands out about this shaver is the fact that it is the most economical shaver for wet/dry I have found that is a truly quality shaver. When I say my face is smooth after a dry shave with the AT895, you may believe me when I claim that only a hand raiser can do better:  but, mind you, not by very much if any at all.  Frankly, I&#x27;d put the Philips Norelco AT895 against any hand raiser out there and still be absolutely confident that my new AT895 would come out the winner.  You will find that this shaver is very economical as to cost and the quality of it&#x27;s shave.  I believe that, should you buy this shaver, you will not find yourself dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item looking after contemplating on different shaver series from Philips Norelco. Have used this shaver for about 5-6 times in last one month or so since the purchase. Let me list of the Pros and Cons for this shaver: Pro&#x27;s first - 1. Lightweight and good battery life 2. works both wet and dry.  Con&#x27;s now - 1. This shaver won&#x27;t work if you have beard/ moustache  grown anything more than two or max three days. 2. This works good only around the cheeks area. 3. This did not do a good job shaving off neckline beard in particular. I had immense trouble and even had redness of skin around neckline while trying to shave off the beard. On trying repetitively I had my neckline turning red and bad sensation. I almost thought of throwing this away. 4. Plus I had tried both wet and dry use and still no difference. 5. Philips recommends using this shaver for few weeks to get a hang of it but after 4-5 uses I had enough of it.  TL;DR This is good shaver only for those who do not have any beard to shave off neckline. If you are someone like me and would have to shave neckline beard regularly this is not for you. The rotary blades are absolute waste and won&#x27;t work at all on the neckline beard. Stay away from this and buy something else.</li>
    <li> Just OK for me.  I had the 9710XL for years and loved it but one of three of the screen holders had a &amp;#34;nub&amp;#34; that holds it into the main framing piece break off and now one screen holder would pop out when I tried to shave. I tried to find a new replacement but it is no longer made or available.  Had to buy new razor.  I decided on the Norelco AT895/41.  Here&#x27;s the rub: The 9710XL is superior by far - holds a charge up to 99 minutes and has the LED to let you know minutes left before charge needed.  The AT895/41 only holds charge for 40 minutes and no time indication LED. All I needed was the replacement floating head housing. So I made my own solution - I realized the floating head frames are different and not interchangeable between Norelco shaver models (that&#x27;s for business - profit - buy another razor) but what I found out was that even though the main framing unit parts are &amp;#34;slightly&amp;#34; different and not interchangeable , that the individual floating head covers and screens are the same fit and design and size, just different color (black).  I just carefully popped out the three individual screen head holders from the new razor and popped them into my original 9710XL frame unit and they fit perfectly :-)  Had I known this before I purchased the new razor I would have just purchased a frame head and just changed the floating covers. Would have saved me a little cash.  The new razor seemed light to me but it did give a decent shave.  I just missed my LED and 99 minutes of charged time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this model shaver for years and years.  Finally I had to buy a new one....This is a great shaver, but they goofed in the charger stand design.  It is hard to get the little prongs to line up when reinserting the shaver.  The base is too light and flops around and the shape of the cradle is so loose that you have to concentrate or use two hands to get it to connect.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for 35+ years of my shaving life. Previous iterations of Norelcos felt more substantial than this one. While it is advertised as a wet/dry, I only use it as dry as that is what I am used to. Shave is close and virtually free of irritation. The motor in this shaver moves the blades alot slower than my previous Norelco&#x27;s. However, it does so without any negative affect on the shave. Having read the reviews, I am concerned about durability and only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I love this device. It saves me money on having to buy razors all the time an I dont have to worry about shaving bumps anymore. This razor shaves very close just like a regular razor blade. This was a great purchase. This is not my first one. I brought one years ago an it was great. This also comes with a 2 an a half year warranty also.</li>
    <li> Great razor! No short comings whatsoever. It&#x27;s what an electric razor is suppose to be! I would tell anyone to buy it!</li>
    <li> I like the thing. You can&#x27;t cut yourself and irritation is very rare. Personally i still use shaving cream with it but that&#x27;s just because i like the smoothness. Overall it makes for a quick and easy shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! Really close shave and a lot better than buying expensive razors every week! great purchase would recommend to anyone looking to get a close shave</li>
    <li> i bought it 2 months ago, the razor is really light , plastic made, but doesn&#x27;t feel fragile, more easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;it can actually shave pretty well, I am switching to a electric after years with gillette products, but they became so expensive and they keep adding blades, from my sensor excel (2), the mach 3, then they switched to 3 blades plus one on the back, now 5 plus one with the fusion ....it seems stupid after a while.&lt;br /&gt;bacl to the norelco, love the fact that you can use it in the shower, really easy to keep clean, or you can shave while doing other stuff in the dry way and it&#x27;s not spreading hair &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; around, really easy to get used to it</li>
    <li> Pulls and tugs the hair out.  NOT FUN!  Also, does not leave a clean shave on my legs.  I know, this is a guys shaver, but I thought it would work on my legs too.</li>
    <li> Best shaver my husband ever had.</li>
    <li> I thought this will be good, but the shave is nowhere close to what you would get with a normal razor. It leaves patches all over my neck and I have to use a normal razor again to get a close enough shave. This was a bad idea. Now it just occupies space in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Gives a good close Shave using shaving cream and a water rinse.</li>
    <li> My husband has always loved Norelco.</li>
    <li> I like this product and recomend everyone to buy this</li>
    <li> Not quite as close of a shave but it&#x27;s so nice to use. A Lot Better than their other models.</li>
    <li> It gives a close  shave and does not burn.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it, gives a nice close shave and the price was good.</li>
    <li> Great shaver - best bang for the buck. Shaves as well as shavers costing three times the amount.</li>
    <li> I Have been using Norelco electric razors for several years.  When the drive motor shaft broke on my 9160. I replaced it with this model.  I&#x27;ve only had it about a month but am totally satisfied with it.  I would recommend it to anyone that uses an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that it shaves any closer then my prior norelco.  It does have a feature that allows the use of wet or dry, which I haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t recommend highly enough!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor. You get a quick, clean close shave. It feels good in the hand. The bonus charging station is a nice accessory too. These suckers expensive so I recommend waiting for a deal.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Norelco and by far the best. It shave close and clean without razor burn or irritation. The closest and fasted shave I have ever experienced from an electric shaver. Definitely worth the price and then some.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th Norelco Shaver and I have enjoyed them all but, I would have to say this is not my favorite. It seems to run at a much lower RPM and that means longer shave times. It also means more nicks, or so it seems to me. I have a fairly heavy beard and the 4900 will do the job but not as neatly has previous models I have owned. I purchased it online and left it in the box for several months as my old one just kept on running. After finally pretty much laying my old one aside I took out the new one. By then it was way past the time I could have returned it. My advice, check around before purchasing the 4900. It will do the job, just not as smoothly and quickly as I was accustomed to.</li>
    <li> Only recently began using this shaver but Not my first Norelco shaver. So far works well. Two comments however- the charging stand is a bit cheaply made but does the job. Second comment is a potential be careful- this model runs on a lithium battery (good) but if you have an older cadmium type battery  Norelco shaver stand though the charging cord might fit into this new lithium charger stand the output it produces may not be completely compatible for your new shaver- which over time may shorten the new battery lifespan. I do not speak with authority but to me the power outputs of both do not appear fully inter changeable.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this for my husband for Christmas and he is absolutely thrilled with it!! It gives him a very close, smooth shave without skin irritation. He has always had very sensitive skin--he has a hard time with regular razors. So needless to say this was a very welcome gift.</li>
    <li> I gave a previous version of this shaver away and replaced with this model.  I was surprised at the nice close shave it gives.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it&#x27;s still on the first charge.  It&#x27;s nice and quiet and easy to clean.  I don&#x27;t really have any negative things to say about this shaver.  I can either shave before or after showering and get the same results.  Never tried with shaving cream as it&#x27;s not necessary with my medium beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this shaver.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about using a shaver like this due to the last time using one giving me a rash on my neck afterwards. However after using this in the shower this morning, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I got a great shave and now I&#x27;m saving money because I don&#x27;t have to shell out almost 30 dollars for new blades every few months for my regular razor. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my husband at Christmas, and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband said it was not as fast as his 10 year old Norelco.  Returned it</li>
    <li> Got this for the hubby for Father&#x27;s Day. He said not a great shaver. Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
    <li> It gives a close shave although never as close as a razor. Work on construction so it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> My husband has found his new love. Since getting this for Christmas, he swears by the perfect shave he get. So close and clean. He even use it on his head.</li>
    <li> I owned a shaver like this some 20 years ago and remember it as working better then this one does.  It&#x27;s ok but I have found myself going back to my razor for a faster more complete shave.  I will use this shaver in the evening after work to remove that 5-oclock shadow but that is about it.</li>
    <li> Basic shaver, doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the bathroom counter. Easy to use and clean. Give a nice close shave for an electric.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves the shaver. great product and good price. Excellent transaction A+</li>
    <li> Razor is light weight and cheap.  Does have the job of previous Norelco I had that broke--for same money.  Very, very dissapointed.. plan to use for a while then trash it.. and for first time ever--go to another brand.  This an entry level razor--I thought it would be nicer--cant imagine what the cheaper ones are like.</li>
    <li> So far, so good and I am very picky about shavers. I like this one a lot. I feel like I get a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Everything went as promised.</li>
    <li> This was given as a Father&#x27;s day gift. It was very well received.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Gillette Mach 3 razors for shaving and decided that the blades are so expensive I might as well buy an electric shaver that will last me longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at the whole Norelco line, I found that this 4900 model to be the best choice. Why?&lt;br /&gt;- It is an AquaTec model, meaning it can do both wet and dry shave and even shave in the shower if you want&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver head pivots, helps make shaving a lot smoother&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not a low-end model, so the motors are stronger/the blades are better so they can deal with hairs better&lt;br /&gt;- A charger stand is included, makes charging very convenient and takes up less space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t shave everyday. More like every 2-3 days or sometimes more. This electric shaver handles those longer hairs for me extremely well.</li>
    <li> Does a good job, and I like the long battery life and quick charge cycle.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product.  years and years looking for a electric shaver that doesnt irritate my skin.  This is it, leaves a very smooth finish and take s caste of your skin.  Very had to harm yourself and a pleasure to use.  you can use it in the shower as it is waterproof but i found it easier to use in dry conditions.  It also has a side cutter so you can trim when your beard is longer.  I have recommended this to friends that had the same problem as i had, no one believed me, one of them tried it and will never go back to razors again</li>
    <li> Although not significantly different than the other Norelco shavers I have owned, this one does the job--just like the others I have used since the 80s.  The one thing that does continue to improve is battery life.  I purchased this shaver just before Christmas when it was on sale and I have only had to charge it once since the initial charge.  Very good battery life--you never need to take the charger on a trip or vacation.  Very easy to clean and it provides a very close shave--at least close enough for me.  I usually replace the blades once a year and hopefully will get 4 or more years before the battery starts to fail.  The battery can be replaced but it is often more practical and almost as cheap to just get a new shaver.  There are more fancy shavers offered by Norelco but this design always gets the job done for me.</li>
    <li> Been using triple blade expensive shavers for many years got tired of paying the price. Always used Norelco in the past was sure it was right choice - and the wet/dry feature seemed nice.  Unfortunately no after shave, no &amp;#34;method&amp;#34;, no anything keeps my neck from getting a rash when using. So I use it for face and chin, and still use a razor for the neck.  How sad is that! It does work well with gel or shave cream and instantly rinses clean. Nice unit and mfg.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father. He really likes it.i would want to advice everyone. As he said,it is really sensitive and silent.the battery life is not best but it&#x27;s okey.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good deal. It just is not very high quality</li>
    <li> I am 20 years old and I have never owned an electrical shaver before, in fact Im not a huge fan of shaving because I either get red rashy skin after or I don&#x27;t get a close shave which makes shaving a pain. So I would always just trim. I was browsing around looking for razor blades to shave once more after a year of not shaving just trimming, and I stumbled upon this beauty! I read the reviews, bought it and waited. When it came I charged it for an hour or so and turned this baby on. The first time shaving was awkward since it was a while since I shaved but it gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Although my face was a bit red, it was super smooth!! I looked my age again! The battery lasts for a long time, it&#x27;s water proof and I don&#x27;t have to worry about changing blades for a long time. It&#x27;s a huge time saver too! My face has now adapted to it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> My husband said it is best shaver he has ever owned.</li>
    <li> Great price and perfect gift.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> Nice shave and perfect replacement for my 8 year old Norelco electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Tried other other electric shaver&#x27;s and have always come back to Norelco. The features are excellent and the ability to use lotions does the trick.</li>
