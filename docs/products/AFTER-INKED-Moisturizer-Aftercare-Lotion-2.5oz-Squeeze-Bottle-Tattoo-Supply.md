    <li> It kept my tattoos moist and looking great it&#x27;s not greasy and fragrance free just a good quality lotion for new and existing tattoos!</li>
    <li> I used the small tube given to me by tattoo artist. My first tat healed quickly with no issues, pain, scabbing or infection! Healed beautifully!!&lt;br /&gt;So i ordered this tube to continue using as my daily mousturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I love it but noticed it smelled and the small sample tube did nnot. Not a real pleasant odor but not bad and it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I have used pretty much every aftercare product - and this by far is the worst. It has a short shelf life - will turn to water in time - leaves your skin kinda sticky - and is really too water based to make a lasting impact on coloration. I got 2 full sleeves and side pieces - the only product i use is Cam&#x27;s Tat Wax - go with that and not this hipster doofus product. Waste of loot</li>

    <li> I love tis product.  I have 14 tattoos and use this product all of the time. It keeps your body art looking fresh and shiny whenever you use it. I always have extra because I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of it.</li>
