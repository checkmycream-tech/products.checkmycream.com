    <li> I absolutely love this brush!  Blends well, washes well, stands up to daily use.  A MUST for the Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
    <li> Amazing..great quality brush. Enables you to use less product.</li>
    <li> The best face brush for foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used! Hands above all the rest!</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush, but not anything extrodinary.  You could probably get the same quality brush at any cosmetics store/ counter.  For less.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush.  Works very well no complaints</li>
    <li> Nice brush but it has very soft bristles. Works best if you&#x27;re looking for light coverage.</li>
    <li> Creates flawless coverage!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Just received yesterday and do not know how I ever lived without it.</li>
    <li> I love the Bare Escentuals face brush, it gives you a perfect finish and holds the product perfectly so your makeup goes a long way.  I simply clean my brush once a week with warm soapy water and let it air dry.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say this is a FACE brush.. its a bit small and the brissels are a bit short for a good foundation brush. However, I love it as a blush brush. very soft and good distribution.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the bare minerals complexion rescue. This brush is very soft and does the job perfectly. It looks like all I did was put some lotion on.  I don&#x27;t really use complexion rescue like the instructions state- I put a streak on my forehead, a streak on each cheek, a streak on my nose and a streak on my chin (all with my finger) and then blend it with this brush. It works flawlessly and with this technique. I think if you put it directly on the brush you&#x27;d get weird coverage, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this brush.... Bristles separate and lots of shedding. Not dense enough for a good application..... Drags the foundation and does not provide undetectable coverage that was expected....</li>
    <li> Best overall brush for blending face makeup (BB cream) and powder I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This brush works great....highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great brush! Awesome quality brush with speedy delivery.</li>
