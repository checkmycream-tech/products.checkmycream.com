      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>What I liked about this one was the size and the contoured, dual opposed tweezers.  </li>
      <li>I took a nice warm bath and exfoliated my legs like the instructions said too.  </li>
      <li>Good tool but the cord easily shorts out after 6 months</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product, it is exactly as described, and it works just fine.    </li>
      <li>I liked it a lot better than shaving because I never felt that prickly feeling.</li>
      <li>This is BY FAR the best way to epilate.</li>
      <li>First, this thing works great on my legs.  </li>
      <li>fits very comfortably in my hand; I wanted electric rather than batteries.  </li>
      <li>I am sure this is a great product, and seems to do what it supposed to, but the pain is absolutely un-bearable.</li>
      <li>BUT WILL BE BETTER</li>
      <li>I would have to say the pain was greater with my legs.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy this epilator because it has dual heads and claims to remove more hair with them.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It cuts most of the hair but it does not pull it out by the root.</li>
      <li>but I love the results.  </li>
      <li>This Epilator is just okay.  </li>
      <li>I am able to get rid of all of the hair (most of the time) and go without shaving my legs for up to a month at a time.  </li>
      <li>I already love it.  </li>
      <li>Waxing is much more convenient</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t know how many guys use this</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>cant able to keep  on face n in body.</li>
      <li>we love it</li>
      <li>It was not painful at all!!</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with the product, and</li>
      <li>One thing though, you can&#x27;t seem to take out the top part to take out any pieces of hair that might have gotten stuck in between the blades.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t remove most of the hair, and quite often it would not remove the hair from the root, but just break it off.</li>
      <li>Simply is the best product in the market......</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing as I use it more and more</li>
      <li>, this is next best thing to lasering!</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands and models.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job, and I am so thankful for being able to have found this product.</li>
      <li>When I first using the Emjoi, it hurt like hell!!!</li>
      <li>I have done legs, arms and even armpits (though you must have a high pain threshold for this) and it works great and lasts way longer than shaving.  </li>
      <li>Best epilator I have found so far, much cheaper than waxing and more effective than shaving.</li>
      <li>And hey, environmentally friendly, in that I am not adding a hundred disposable razors a year to the landfills!    </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m 100% happy so far!  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve had many waxing incidents gone awry), but I was just fine -</li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced and arrived in good time.</li>
      <li>The epilator easily removed it.  </li>
      <li>You are, after all, pulling out each hair by the root and not just one by one, but you have 30 tweezers working all at once very quickly pulling the hairs.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Maintenance of areas already epilated is easy, and so is using the epilator on areas with sparse hair.    </li>
      <li>so it is easy to pack.</li>
      <li>It is pretty effective in removing hair.</li>
      <li>I first started using my mom&#x27;s and then got to the point that I wanted my own.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair on my legs</li>
      <li>I only use it on my face because I have a lot of &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; and it does a great job keeping it smooth.</li>
      <li>Great for facial area and bikini spots.</li>
      <li>I especially appreciated that under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I use it under my arms.</li>
      <li>All told, I&#x27;m happy with this and would definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, easy to clean and has been working well for a year now.</li>
      <li>it does fit it&#x27;s name \\&quot;mini\\&quot; but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
      <li>It may sound intimidating..</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a great solution to remove hair on different areas of my body.</li>
      <li>My legs feel as smooth as if I&#x27;d used a razor.</li>
      <li>After some time using it even the sound starts to cause pain.  </li>
      <li>It gets my face, v zone, and arms baby smooth as I have never shaved those places.</li>
      <li>I would compare the sound to a tattooing machine(but not the pain).</li>
      <li>I could never get a smooth result and it was embarassing.  </li>
      <li>It worked great and just broked last year.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s free shipping and customer service.</li>
      <li>If you need to use this often or would be travelling with it, those features would probably be important.</li>
      <li>I regret to say that I&#x27;ve never been able to finish a whole leg, nor could I get more than one hair off my bikini line and underarms.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Though I would consider myself to have a high pain tolerance I was nervous about trying the epilator for the first time.  I tried the epilator on a small section of my calve and was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt much - it felt a little like getting shocked in the first few seconds but it wasn&#x27;t excrutiatingly painful during the entire process. I was surprised at how fast the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting was and midway through I switched to \\&quot;high\\&quot; but didn&#x27;t notice much difference in pulling/pain. I felt like the epilator didn&#x27;t get all of the hair and I would have to go over and over the same section for a few minutes. I switched to my bikini area and had the same problem. For someone who gets a Brazilian often this was not worth my time to use it; for the time and pain it&#x27;s better to just get a wax in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My daughter requested the emjoi hair removal system for her birthday so I found it on Amazon. It was reasonably priced and arrived in good time. My daughter really likes the product. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying it! I have 3 more daughters!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a similar item based on the recommendation from YouTube video \\&quot;how to keep your underarm from turning dark\\&quot;. They recommended to use this electronic epilator rather than wax. I always done the wax myself at home(save money)and when I received it and use today that this little thing can actually surprised me of how clean my armpit is after used it. It was not painful at all!! This mini machine does a very good job!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands and models.  So far emjoi is one of my favorite brands.  This model is small, powerful, effective, and quiet.  The small size gives it versatility for awkward angles/places.  Can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t know how many guys use this but I am one. I think this is a painful way to remove hair, but let&#x27;s remember that You will be removing many hairs by the root! I have tried Nair, and waxing. So I can say that I know what pain is. But at least with this pain you should get weeks of smooth skin. I have only just used it so I don&#x27;t know how long I will get or how many ingrown hairs I will get. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     I used this on my back and arms and and just tried a little on my face. They say not to use on your face, why I don&#x27;t know other than the pain. I bleed in a few spots and would break out into cold sweats while using this. Anyone that has used any electric shaver should know that they always say that your skin just needs time to get use to it. So I am hoping and thinking this will be the case with this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     Even with what I have said above I would recommend this product Because it does it&#x27;s job, and I am so thankful for being able to have found this product. I think in the long run it will be worth it. Because it is a lot cheaper than anything else. Even if it breaks and I have to buy one every year. Since I was spending around $50 a month when I was paying for Nair, a growth inhibitor and shipping. which is 50 X 12 &#x3D; 600 yr. &lt;br /&gt;Also when it comes to time it may take awhile to do the area(s) that you chose but in the long run it really is no time at all. Remember you should get a least a couple of days or up to 6 weeks of being smooth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     For my back I used Nair since I did not have this product yet. Then waited a week for the skin to heal.This helped me not have as long or as many hairs to pull. They recommend trimming the hairs if it&#x27;s been awhile since your last session. but since I couldn&#x27;t reach I had to use the Nair. I am looking into a extending claw to hold the Emjoi AP-96 OptiMini Epillator in the future. &lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year for its original price. I thought it would be a great solution to remove hair on different areas of my body. WRONG! This was the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried. Not only was it excruciatingly painful (and I have a medium-high tolerance for pain), but it took several passes to remove the hair. Sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t remove most of the hair, and quite often it would not remove the hair from the root, but just break it off. Thus, some hairs would grow back as quickly, if not QUICKER than shaving. Wasn&#x27;t the motivation for buying this product to find a longer lasting, easier way of removing hair? Also, it caused me to bleed (which could be expected with PULLING ONE&#x27;S HAIR FROM THE ROOT!). I have this advice for any prospective buyers: DO NOT BUT THIS EPILATOR! I don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more negative reviews for this product, but there should be.  If you buy the Emjoi OptiMini Epilator be prepared to have red skin and pain for hours, bleeding, and a feeling of dissapointment or anger. To remove unwanted, hair go to a waxing salon or buy a really good razor.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD BUT WILL BE BETTER IF WAS WIRELESS, ALSO IS VERY SMALL AND NICE.</li>
    <li> this little one certainly spins nice.  It is very small and compact as expected.  no problems with its operation, however, I don&#x27;t prefer the dual rollers with opposite spin.  The guard also is a place that can grab the skin.  In a pinch I&#x27;d use it (pardon the punn).</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful at all to use it. But I have really high pain tolerance. I already pluck my armpits and I can tweeze the hair from my legs without feeling anything. Even if it was painful, I would have put up with it as long as it worked. IT DID NOT. I followed the instructions carefully and even applied Tend Skin before and after I used it. Not only it broke off so many hair, leaving me with prickly skin, but I also got major folliculitis. It&#x27;s been almost  2 weeks since I last used it (I actual tried it twice. Really shouldn&#x27;t have done that.) and the folliculitis are slowly healing. I just hope it won&#x27;t leave any scars but I know I can&#x27;t show my legs for the rest of this summer. If you are prone to getting razor bumps after shaving, waxing, etc. I suggest that you try something else. This is such a disappointment and I was so excited to try it too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, it is exactly as described, and it works just fine.    Be advised, that if you wish to remove a large amount of hair (I am a male and use it for facial hair and so on) it&#x27;s slow going, because it&#x27;s more painful the thicker your hair is. Maintenance of areas already epilated is easy, and so is using the epilator on areas with sparse hair.    The only complaint I have is that cleaning the device is time consuming. It comes with a small brush, but it is difficult to use the brush to get into the small crevices of the inner workings of the device, where the hair tends to stick. Be sure to clean it very thoroughly, and if you turn the epilation head by hand, you&#x27;ll find more hair under it.    Good luck.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second one....I have a summer place and hated dragging it back and forth so bought a second one. I&#x27;ve used it for over a  year and it really works..</li>
    <li> it does fit it&#x27;s name \\&quot;mini\\&quot; but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well. it leaves a lot of ingrown hairs. can anyone give me any tips as to how to use this product for full effect?</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Being a petite person I find that its size is perfect for under my arms and it does a great job of hair removal.  The level of discomfort isn&#x27;t any worse than waxing and it works out to be much more affordable in the long run.  Although, if you need to remove hair from a larger surface area or just a lot of hair in general I would recommend purchasing a bigger epilator from the same brand.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It does what it is supposed to do, which is remove hair. I don&#x27;t understand people complaining that it hurts, of course it hurts, you&#x27;re pulling hair out by the root. I have used the Veet pre wax spray and that did help some. I also suggest disinfecting the device heads with alcohol before use so you don&#x27;t spread bacteria into the hair follicle and wind up with pimples. I did get small dots where I used this since those small red dots are inflamed hair folices but they went away over night.  I have used this every where, face, legs, v zone and have loved it. I haven&#x27;t thrown out my razor because I shave my legs right after I use the Emjoy so my legs will be completely baby smooth. It gets my face, v zone, and arms baby smooth as I have never shaved those places. The smoothness last about 2 weeks then I use the emjoy again since the new hairs sprout up. As time goes by I find myself using the razor less and less on my legs as it takes a few months to get every hair plucked. If you epilate and get all the hairs by the root it eventually stops growing, I&#x27;ve waxed my underarms for years prior to the Emjoy and have very little hair there. Another great thing is you can Emjoy whenever you want, no more waiting for the hair to grow like with waxing. All in all a great product and small enough to take with you but don&#x27;t let the size fool you, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She has always used an epilator - never shaved. She&#x27;s from Europe so epilating or waxing is her main preference and more prevalent over there. She&#x27;s only used it once so far, but she liked it. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. Her previous epilator - a Braun Silk Epil (6820 I think?) died in less than a year. So life length is my main criteria of judging this product. I can&#x27;t speak as to the level of pain as, like I said, she&#x27;s experienced and didn&#x27;t mention that it was more or less painful than her previous.</li>
    <li> The product does remove hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I liked it a lot better than shaving because I never felt that prickly feeling. However it certainly doesn&#x27;t give you that totally clean feel that waxing/shaving does. No matter how much I used it, I always had a bunch of longer hairs. Also, I had difficulty getting into the recesses of my under arms. Mine lasted about 1 1/2 years. I used it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator to save money on waxing all the time. My skin is too sensitive for shaving, and I prefer to wax, but hate spending so for a professional job and found home wax kits to remove more skin than hair. I was seriously disappointed by this product. The cord is short at confining, and the \\&quot;safety bar\\&quot; makes it almost impossible to use. The head is bulky and very difficult to maneuver around small, hard-to-reach areas like ankles and bikini. I also found the dry-only epilation extremely painful, and would also irritate my skin. The \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed I also found to be very slow and would often grab at hairs and tug, but not pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying an epilator, get one that you can use in the shower, like the Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry 2-speed. That&#x27;s an epilator I *highly* recommend! I love mine!</li>
    <li> The OptiPro does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I really like that the hair does not grow back for a couple weeks.  So far I have only used it on the underarms and bikini area.  I have very sensitive skin, so it gets red and irritated quickly.  But, it doesn&#x27;t hurt like Nad&#x27;s did.  And, Nad&#x27;s is very messy and a job to cleanup after.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of dark hair on my arms and bought this as an alternative to waxing. I love it. I got it last night and used it before work this morning and I am so impressed! It didn&#x27;t catch every little hair, although it probably would have if I wasn&#x27;t in a rush. The people who have commented on the pain probably haven&#x27;t endured waxings, electrolysis and laser treatments. This is cake compared to that! I thought I would need my boyfriend to do it for me because I&#x27;m not good at inflicting pain on myself (I&#x27;ve had many waxing incidents gone awry), but I was just fine - it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> I have a tried a few different epilators and this is the best one by far.  The shape is comfortable and can get in the harder-to-reach areas although the placement of the cord would be better on the very bottom rather than off-center.  The two speeds are something that not many epilators have and are very useful for the different types of hair.  Because the two heads are rotating in opposite directions it gets more ahirs than the other epilators I&#x27;ve had because it grabs hair that grows in any direction.  The heads rotating in opposite directions also help pull the skin taut so it&#x27;s less uncomfortable, but if you have loose skin or thin skin, please make sure to use your free hand to pull the skin more taut or you may be in for a painful surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like one person said, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt a bit the first few times, it even hurts me if I don&#x27;t do it for a very long time.  You are, after all, pulling out each hair by the root and not just one by one, but you have 30 tweezers working all at once very quickly pulling the hairs.  Let me tell you, even with the initial discomfort, it proves well worth it.  After one or two times of going over my whole legs, the hair is so fine and soft that I had probably 1/4\\&quot; of regrowth and you could see it was there, but you couldn&#x27;t feel it!  I have a problem with the hair on the back of my thighs and no matter how fresh the razor was or how much shave gel I used etc... I could never get a smooth result and it was embarassing.  Using this epilator, I now have smooth thighs all-around and they stay that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating dow take a long time to do a large area, but each time you do it, you have less hair, it hurts less, it&#x27;s quicker, and soon you master thge technique that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I had one and my skin ended up getting caught while the tweezers were rotating.  Now of course, that&#x27;s not really the machines fault, but when that happened, the gears stripped and I tried desperately to contact the company to try and get a replacement head, but I have had absolutely NO response from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very sad and *irritated* since I haven&#x27;t had my epilator, but I shouldbe getting my new one in the mail in a couple days so I can finally give my skin a break and stop having ingrown hairs!s stripped and I tried desperately to contact the company to try and get a replacement head, but I have had absolutely NO response from them.    I&#x27;ve been very sad and *irritated* since I haven&#x27;t had my epilator, but I shouldbe getting my new one in the mail in a couple days so I can finally give my skin a break and stop having ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> I have used other epilators.  What I liked about this one was the size and the contoured, dual opposed tweezers.  I used it mostly for arm hair - fine, dark hair.  The epilator easily removed it.  I cannot imagine that the results last for SIX weeks for most people.  You&#x27;d have to have a very small amount of blonde hair to get away with that.    I&#x27;ve used it on arms, legs, bikini line, and facial hair (that wasn&#x27;t recommended).  I have a lot of leg hair, and have experienced ingrown hairs when I&#x27;ve epilated my legs.  Plus, it took way too long to epilate my legs - it&#x27;s just easier to shave.  I imagine if you had a SMALL amount of leg hair, the epilator would be fine for legs.    Yes, epilating is PAINFUL.  Hey, it&#x27;s pulling out hair.  What do you expect?    My biggest complaint is that the unit is now broken simply from regular use.  (I&#x27;ve had it a little over a year - past warranty.)  A little part broke, and since I can&#x27;t replace just the part, I have to replace the whole thing.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi Opti Mini works wonders, it does what it says, pulls from the root so the hair grows back not ticker but the opposite. Can you stand up to the pain though?</li>
    <li> I bought an Emjoi about 10 years ago and loved it. It lasted until just a couple years ago. I got the OptiMini Epilator to replace it and was very disappointed. I don&#x27;t think the dual opposing heads are a good addition - they make it very difficult to target certain areas. Also, the middle is recessed too much so on many parts of the body the middle tweezers don&#x27;t reach your hair. I am returning this and trying a different model.</li>
    <li> Does it hurt? Heck yes! What did you expect from a device that yanks the hair out? But it works. I only use it on my face because I have a lot of &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; and it does a great job keeping it smooth. High speed has a tendency to break the hair rather than pull it out, so I always use the slow speed. You have to pull the skin tight/smooth or it will pinch, but that is pretty typical of an elipator. It is lightweight, easy to clean and has been working well for a year now.</li>
    <li> I researched every style and brand of epillator I could find before deciding on this model.  It was down to the Braun 3370 and this one.  I decided that since this has the newest \\&quot;dual opposed heads\\&quot; feature, I should get the latest model with the new technology. I was only going to use this standing in my bathroom in front of the mirror, so I didn&#x27;t need the cordless model or the ability to recharge it.  If you need to use this often or would be travelling with it, those features would probably be important. This model is also small and held easily in the hand, which I thought would be helpful since my main concern was the fuzz on my upper lip and sides of my jawline so the small size would be easier to manipulate around the curves of my face.  My skin has become pretty sensitive over the years and waxing just got to be too harsh--the skin around my jawline/neck area was traumatized. It looks like tiny blood vessels directly under the skin surface burst from the wax pulling away and resulted in small, patchy discoloration patterns.  Plus, the whole process took a while and I&#x27;m not patient with things that take too much time.  I was excited to get this Emjoi AP-96 in the mail, but was pretty freaked out by the condition of the box when it arrived. It looked like an elephant had stepped on it and the USPS put this little piece of tape over the gaping hole that said \\&quot;RECEIVED UN-SEALED\\&quot;.  Are they saying THEY received it in that condition? Geez. Thankfully, the Emjoi is packaged floating in plastic and was just to the side of direct impact.  I took it right into the bathroom to try it on my face and was completely amazed at how quickly, easily and efficiently it removed my facial fuzz. I was instantly in love with this thing--almost as much as I love my Dyson vacuum, and that&#x27;s saying something. Ripping(drama) out all of that fuzz wasn&#x27;t anything I would consider uncomfortable, either.  And I&#x27;m a veteran waxer and former user of the dreaded Epilady.  I have since usedit on my legs, bikini area and armpits.  No problems--works like it should.  I would buy it again.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying the Braun 3370 also, just because I like having two of things (my husband always says two is one, one is none-so I have an excuse) and since it&#x27;s a little bigger it would cover the larger surface area on my legs a little faster. This one does the job, though. They&#x27;ve got several of these different epillators on ebay all the time--new ones in their package-- and I almost bought one there. But I realized that if something went wrong there&#x27;s no returning it, so I didn&#x27;t bother.  You can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s free shipping and customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver 6 years ago for myself and was very happy with it, till I broke the cord and I had to reorder it for my teen age daughter,  it is a great product, less hair and softer skin,  we love it and I recommend it to whom ever wants not to shave and have less hair and softer skin. Simply is the best product in the market......</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping this will be better than shaving and last longer, but its not good, first of all it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair and second its very very painful and very very slow, if you have lots of free time to spend shaving the most painful way posible (I have done wax and wax doesn&#x27;t hurt compare to this) then this is your product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other bad thing it produces ingrown hair THE horror!!</li>
    <li> This hurts a little, yes, but far less than waxing.  Far less for me than Nad&#x27;s.  If you press down very hard somwhere like your shin bone, you can scratch yourself with the edges of the head.  Just firm but gentle pressure, and it does a surprisingly good job with surpisingly little pain.  Knees are very difficult, however, because they are so round.  Works on facial hair, but go slowly and gently, pulling skin taut.  I expected this to cause far more pain!  It does take quite some time to do both legs, however.</li>
    <li> I have had this epilator of alittle over a year now. I regret to say that I&#x27;ve never been able to finish a whole leg, nor could I get more than one hair off my bikini line and underarms. I am sure this is a great product, and seems to do what it supposed to, but the pain is absolutely un-bearable. Granted I cant stand waxing either, so perhaps I have a skewed perspective. One thing I did notice however, is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the hair out by the root, only seems to break it off at the skin. I found that the pain wasn&#x27;t worth it because 1/2 the hair wasn&#x27;t fully plucked and I would have stubble just a few hours later. I bought one of the mens Gilette razors that pulse (thats what my husband uses) and get an infinately closer and smoother shave than I ever did with this epilator. Personally, if i&#x27;m going to have stubble anyways, shaving is a more comfortable way to end up with it. I would not recomend this product to anyone else who has never waxed, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t have alot of time for grooming.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this epilator because it has dual heads and claims to remove more hair with them. It does not. I followed all the instructions and prepared before i used it with terrible results. It cuts most of the hair but it does not pull it out by the root. It is very painful and it gave me red blotches and all that without removing the hair from the root. I promptly returned it. Ladies do not waste your money or time.</li>
    <li> This Emjoi product is the 2nd I&#x27;ve owned. The first lasted 15 years.  I like the smaller version, and don&#x27;t have any complaints. This is BY FAR the best way to epilate. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a month ago and love it so far.  I have done legs, arms and even armpits (though you must have a high pain threshold for this) and it works great and lasts way longer than shaving.  The best part is not having to wake up every morning and shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned epilators since they were first introduced to the market. I&#x27;ve owned 3 of the Emjoi Optima&#x27;s, (5 Emjoi&#x27;s total) With all 3 Optima models, the rotating heads quit working. The 1 year warranty does not cover the cost of shipping the unit back to the vendor. In April, Customer Service required me to return the entire unit. They returned it with the original body and I suppose a new head. But the head has quit again, but I am out of warranty, and out of luck. Emjoi does not sell replacement parts. The motors also last about 1.5 years before dying. But I refuse to return to shaving.</li>
    <li> Horribly painful and ends up breaking hairs more often than pulling them from the roots. Just not a good idea.. Waxing is much more convenient</li>
    <li> This product is just great! It gets the job done! And it is so small and portable. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just received this product today, and I decided I&#x27;d try it out.  I took a nice warm bath and exfoliated my legs like the instructions said too.  I plugged it in and turned it up to the slow speed - and it scared the living daylights out of me!  Then I turned it up to the high speed and in the back of my mind I thought.. no way. Not doing this.  I paced a while and thought about it, then decided to give it a go.  I tried it first on my arm hairs and it really didn&#x27;t hurt too bad. So, I went for my legs.  Ouch! However, as I covered more and more skin, it got to be less a shock and more just a vibration.  Yes, it didn&#x27;t get all the hairs, but it got the coarse dark ones towards the end of my legs.  I&#x27;m guessing as I use it more and more the hairs will get finer and there will be less of them.  Yes, you do bleed a little and have some red bumps, and it is uncomfortable.  However, it&#x27;s better than shaving every other day or going to get waxed.  Overall for the first time I am satisfied and would recommend this.. don&#x27;t be scared to use it! It may sound intimidating.. but it&#x27;s worth while.  For my first epilator, I&#x27;d say things went well. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Yes, it hurts. It rips the hair right out from the root. You might bleed. But it works, and the hair takes a while to grow back. Best epilator I have found so far, much cheaper than waxing and more effective than shaving.</li>
    <li> I have used another Emjoi epilator for a few years but got tired of buying batteries. This Emjoi is very gentle and removes the hair quickly without any pulling. My legs feel as smooth as if I&#x27;d used a razor. Hair grows back so fine that it isn&#x27;t very noticeable. It&#x27;s compact and comes with a storage pouch which is nice for travel and it has a long cord. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Great for facial area and bikini spots. Nice epilator though not drop proof (this is 2nd one I have purchased ...1st one broke.)</li>
    <li> I love this little device.  I first started using my mom&#x27;s and then got to the point that I wanted my own.  I have been using the Emjoi for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is painful but I love the results.  I use it on my legs, arms and upper lip.  I am able to get rid of all of the hair (most of the time) and go without shaving my legs for up to a month at a time.  I don&#x27;t think I shaved once this summer while using this.&lt;br /&gt;I generally put on a TV show or movie while I am doing my legs and arms.  It can be a little noisy so I turn up the volume on the TV a little bit.  But it isn&#x27;t so loud that it would be heard outside of a bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money and MUCH better than some of the cheaper ones out there.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, as I just got it today. I already love it.  It is so easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, unless you call a slight tingling painful.  I have only used it on my legs and face so far.  My technique could probably use some work, but I know I will  tossing my razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits very comfortably in my hand; I wanted electric rather than batteries.  The size is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I have shaved and used Nair for my entire life before I got this product a few years ago. I originally got this because when I shave under my arms, I would get ingrown hairs which ended up scarring. When I first using the Emjoi, it hurt like hell!!! But after while, your skin gets used to it, and you only have to use it once a week. This thing is a little workhorse that I have been using faithfully for the past 2 years. I tried on my bikini area and my legs a few times, but I&#x27;m not brave enough to use it in those areas on a regular basis yet. All in all, it&#x27;s a great buy and I highly recomend it</li>
    <li> I used it under my arms and I started bleeding. I get waxed frequently and can handle pain but this was VERY painful. I returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mini epilator. I have a regular size one with lots more tweezers, but bought this one while I was traveling. My large one with more tweezers obviously takes less time to remove hair but this still works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for around half an year now and it still works pretty well. One thing though, you can&#x27;t seem to take out the top part to take out any pieces of hair that might have gotten stuck in between the blades. Otherwise, this worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> I had this product for years but one trip to Europe killed it so naturally I bought it again. Comes with a pouch and brush and is small so it is easy to pack. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had one of the original Epi Lady shavers, bought when I was about to take a 6-day raft trip and didn&#x27;t want my usual hairy legs after two days.  If you think this Emjoi is painful, you should have tried the Epi Lady, but it worked!  90% of the hair on my legs just never grew back, and a lot of what did grow back I got rid of with a second round.  But alas, after several years my Epi Lady has lost its oomph so I bought this Emjoi and am very disappointed.  No better than a regular electric shaver.  Pathetic, sorry I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This is great because it is one of the few that are corded.You don&#x27;t have to go broke buying batteries.It is pretty effective in removing hair.Not to much pain involved on legs.Hair does come back in thinner and is faster to remove the next time you use the product.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product! Small and comes in a little bag, very handy, cute and it does a good job</li>
    <li> I am buying myself a new Optimini today, same exact model as my old one, which I lost. (I know, I know, hardly seems possible, but there you go: organizationally challenged.) I just read all the reviews for all the other different models and makes, and from what I see, nothing out there has any strong advantages over the mini, and many cost a heck of a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;Some background: I understood when I first bought it two years ago that it would hurt; if you have read this far and aren&#x27;t clear on that yet, get it: it definitely hurts in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;But since I knew that, I was braced, and forced myself through the initial gasping, squealing process, because I had also read that the pain would lessen slightly with each use. And it TOTALLY did.&lt;br /&gt;After three uses or so, the pain was like half of the first time, and after about two months, while it still stung a bit, I would do it while watching TV. After four months, pain was a non-issue, and now I just pay my nine year old (daughter) a buck a leg, spread a bath towel on her lap and take a nap as she \\&quot;buzzes\\&quot; them while watching cartoons. No blades, no danger, even if she holds the moving parts against her hand it can&#x27;t hurt her. Seriously, the pain is now just a kind of light prickling that I find relaxing. And the legs look great!&lt;br /&gt;The loofah thing didn&#x27;t help with the in-grown hairs that did show up in occasional patches at first, but I found that salt or sugar body scrubs in the shower (I always used the epi after a hot shower, really eliminates the breakage problem) not only took care of in-growns but also kind of prepped the hair, made it stand up for a more complete removal.&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus here is that if you have thin or light skin, you don&#x27;t get that sub-cutaneous shadow effect, because the whole root is gone, not just the hair. I especially appreciated that under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I use it under my arms. I don&#x27;t find it any more painful than the legs, but I *am* more careful to hold the skin taut there, because you can actually get your skin caught in the epi - a frightening experience, until you realize it&#x27;s caught between the housing and the wheels, not in the tweezing mechanism. Just remember, the motor automatically cuts out under even light resistance; in fact, if you should happen to press down too firmly in normal usage the gadget simply stops. So when I accidentally grabbed my skin, the whole thing just stopped, and I carefully eased it off. No blood, no trauma, not even a mark, and I just went ahead and finished... holding the skin taut, as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;In summation:&lt;br /&gt;Saves me lots of money, &#x27;cuz razors are ridiculously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me hair-free for about 10-12 days.&lt;br /&gt;Less hair comes back with each use.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used anytime, anyplace you have a minute and a free hand (or a bored kid.)&lt;br /&gt;And hey, environmentally friendly, in that I am not adding a hundred disposable razors a year to the landfills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m replacing it today. Love it.

    <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful and it feels cheaply made.  The head is small (of course, it&#x27;s a \\&quot;mini\\&quot;) so it takes a while to use on the legs.  I was not impressed by this machine but I got it as a backup to my regular epilator (just in case it stopped functioning, lost during travel, etc.).  My main epilator eventually stopped working so I went to my backup.  It pulled a small piece of skin into the part between the rotating heads, jammed and it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to purchase this particular machine again due to how weak the machine is.</li>
    <li> This does the job really well with few pass over area where hair is to be removed, but it takes some pain to get the result. After some time using it even the sound starts to cause pain.  I would compare the sound to a tattooing machine(but not the pain). The result after the pain is endured is long lasting as compared to shaving with a razor.  Results lasted about 10 days as compared with about 2-3 days with razor.</li>
    <li> I started using an epilator about 10 years ago.  I purchased one that I saw on an informercial.  It worked great and just broked last year.  Purchased this epliator based on the reviews and price.  I am somewhat disappointed.  This Epilator is just okay.  I need to do several passes to get all my hair out.  The one that I purchased 10 years ago would only take 2 passes at most to take out all my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been Brazilian bikini waxing myself for about 4 years now so I&#x27;m not new to the pain of hair pulling. (I shave my armpits and legs) With that said I wanted something a little bit \\&quot;neater\\&quot; than using wax. The small size of this interested me. Thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I got it, took a nice long bath and went to work on my girlie part. I did trim the hair fairly short as I had heard the hairs can pull and break off if too long before using. Yes it hurt. But I got used to of it fairly quickly. Made sure I exfoliated the day before and a few days after to help prevent ingrown hairs. Also did my armpits and today, my legs. I would have to say the pain was greater with my legs. I&#x27;m not a hairy person. My mom is Japanese and we just don&#x27;t have too much body hair which I&#x27;m grateful for :)&lt;br /&gt;I love that it takes a much shorter time and less mess than waxing. Also like that it can travel.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase and glad to rid myself of wax and a razor.</li>
    <li> I understood this would be small but I really didn&#x27;t get how small.  It takes a very long time to do my legs but is great for underarms.  That said, it is perfect for travel.  I don&#x27;t see the benefit of the two rows and don&#x27;t feel that it cuts down on the time or efficiency of the product.  I will be purchasing a full size unit in the near future and will forgo the double rows.  Product is OK but doesn&#x27;t WOW me.</li>
    <li> This item was no longer functional after its third use in three months. The switch was not operational at all. It did work well upon its first and only first use. Unfortunately, upon its return the customer will not receive a full refund. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good tool but the cord easily shorts out after 6 months</li>
    <li> This epilator is GREAT! It&#x27;s a good investment because it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and saves you money. I use it on my legs, arms, armpits and face, but you can use it anywhere you want. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 1/2 years now and I&#x27;m completely satisfy with this product and I can&#x27;t live without it. However, people tend to forget the importance of exfoliating the skin before and after and then blame  epilators in general  for the end result. I absolutely recommend the optimini to everyone especially to first time users because it&#x27;s not as expensive as other epilators and it does the job anywhere on your body and face.</li>
    <li> This is the second epilator I&#x27;ve owned and it doesn&#x27;t hurt/sting as much when it is being used as the prior model.  I do have a couple of places it scraped the skin, so you have to be somewhat careful to use it properly.  All in all I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Used the epilator per directions given with mediocre results. I&#x27;m going to stick with waxing as its a less painful experience and more efficient.</li>
    <li> I dont have much experience with epilators.  I cant compare this one to another.  All I can say is for me it works well.  Also it was one of the few epilators that had exactly what I was looking for - a cord I could plug into the wall.  No battery to wear out.  It&#x27;s very compact.  The case is a little flimsy but it works.  And it&#x27;s not pink - as a guy that&#x27;s another plus.  If you&#x27;ve never used one it can be uncomfortable at first but for me that went away after a few uses.</li>
    <li> It removes the hair but, it does hurt. I saw it on a shopping channel and found this one. It was said that its like 20 tweezers all at once plucking hair out and, that&#x27;s just what it feels like. Removes hair yes it does.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS and have hair in all the wrong places. My mom bought me one of these several years ago and I used it at least every other day on my face, under my forearms and stomach. It lasted a long time and did a good job. Despite it being a double head, I do have to pass over some areas a few times but in all reality, it only takes like 5 minutes to do my face with several passes, which is still a shorter time and I get more little hairs than I would manually plucking. (Remember I have to pluck my face everyday!) If I use the OptiMini, I can go a couple of days before I go over my face quickly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head for $85. It was good too but I like the feel of the Optimini and it does a good job for me!</li>
    <li> Just got the item today.  It was well packaged and shipped fast.  The item itself is small, pretty quiet, and has everything to just get to ripping those unwanted hairs out.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for the last 2 years, I like to wax mainly my eyebrows now because waxing anything else is just to time consuming and messy.  I used this as soon as it arrived on my legs and bikini line.  It does a great job.  I have coarse and fine hair and it seems to get them all.  I&#x27;m so excited to not have to mess around with wax, or waste so much money on razors! I don&#x27;t think this is the best thing for your face though because of the pain.  I have a high tolerance to waxing, but facial hair (youch!) I&#x27;d rather just tweeze that.  I read all the reviews before I bought this, and I&#x27;ve got to say, I&#x27;m 100% happy so far!  If it lasts even a year, it will save me so much money.  And it&#x27;s summer now, who wants to shave every other day and deal with razor burn?!  Not this lady!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on clearance on one of those TV shopping channels.  I have fine hair on my legs so it grows fast.  Since it does pull the hair from your body, it does hurt a bit, but you get used to it.  My hair is starting to not grow back for a nice permanent hair removal common of waxing and epilating.  I do have to make several passes as my leg hair doesn&#x27;t always lay in the same direction.  I also go in small circles to get those stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> When faced with getting a new electric shaver I decided to look into an epilator.  Being \\&quot;50 something\\&quot; and of ample size my bikini line was not a big concern, but I do have some of that middle age chin hair that none of us want and I hoped that this would make that less of a problem to remove.  First, this thing works great on my legs.  With the first use it did sting a little and the shin area stung for an hour or so afterward, but nothing that was bad enough to outweigh the benefit.  I don&#x27;t need to remove the hair again for weeks!  As for my chin, it will remove the fine hairs, but it can&#x27;t seem to get a good enough hold on the coarse ones to pull them out (alas, back to the tweezers).  I&#x27;ll admit to not being brave enough to try this on my underarms, so you&#x27;ll have to look to other reviewers concerning that.  All told, I&#x27;m happy with this and would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this little device, glad I bought it. I was waxing for years but my underarms were begining to get discolored due to bad wax jobs and shaving. I am used to the pain of waxing so I can stand the pain, this is next best thing to lasering!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I am really pleased with the product, and the value. I was a little concerned because it was so much cheaper than other ones I looked at, but It meets all my expectation.</li>
    <li> not good in india the adaptor gone and high consumption of power supply coz of that it runs lie a grinding machine cant able to keep  on face n in body.</li>
