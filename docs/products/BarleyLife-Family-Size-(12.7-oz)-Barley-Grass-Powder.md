    <li> Perfect transaction, and fresh product!</li>
    <li> Barleylife (previously known as Barleygreen) was introduced to me by a nutritionist and mother of 5, who swore by it.  I was feeling \\&quot;out of sorts\\&quot; and she sent me information.  I ordered it, took it as directed, and over time saw positive health improvements.  I&#x27;ve now been a devotee of Barleylife and other Aim products for about 15 years.  You cannot go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> Great product and great service, thank you!</li>
    <li> love it keeps my body akaline</li>
    <li> I got the product right away. Transaction was fast and smooth. I&#x27;ve taken barley green for more than 20 years and in more than happy with it. It has keeping me healthy, with a lot of energy and looking young. I highly recommend drinking barley green everyday for a better and healthier life.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend and decided to give it a try.  Having taken it for 3 months, I have felt a general improvement of my health conditions.  And I will continue taking it to see how it could work.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the BarleyLife.  I have been taking Barleygreen and did a comparison on vitamins and minerals and was very impressed with what I read about the BarleyLife.  I will continue to order it from Amazon....free shipping!</li>
    <li> I started using Barley Life when my nutritionist recommended it and it&#x27;s perfect for a quick meal substitute. It&#x27;s easy to digest and provides all the energy and vitamins a person needs.</li>
    <li> Mixes well. Tastes green and full of nutrients. Add this to your daily list of nutrients.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many, many years. I combine it with Aim Just Carrots and Redi-Beets and the result is wonderful. I drink it in the morning on an empty stomach. I am 70 years old and I can definitely feel a difference in my energy levels when using these products.</li>
    <li> Product came on time as usual. Great product! Thanks! My second order time ordering.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Big difference in the days I don&#x27;t take it in the morning. Love Barley! Ships fast!</li>
    <li> Have used this product every day for over a year.  I feel so energized on it.  I am however very disappointed that the price has gone up $10 since my last order in March!  It is becoming cost prohibitive....darn!</li>
    <li> It is very ease to mix in water and drink. It gives me energy and has greatly helped my workouts.</li>
    <li> I started using \\&quot;BarleyGreen,\\&quot; now called BarleyLife,  25 years ago--and it was really a game changer. I could make a LIST of all the small health issues l had that the BarleyGreen remedied. It was like it just worked its way through my system making corrections. I know it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but given its effectiveness and its absorbability, it really does deliver industial-strength nutrition to the cells. (I now understand that that&#x27;s where real health resides: in the CELLS.)  So l&#x27;ll continue using it as long as l want to stay free of the many maladies that l had in my mid-forties.To this day l have very few wrinkles, steady energy, excellent digestion, freedom from most infections, healthy joints---on and on, and l absolutely credit the barley grass. In addition, the chlorophyll detoxifies--so nutrients lN, toxins OUT.  What a blessing.</li>
    <li> This product is very expensive but it is very good if you want to be healthy. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT DOES NOT LIKE THE TASTE OF VERY STRONG RAW VEGETABLES AND VERY STRONG RAW GREENS. I would recommend the capsules rather than the powder. This product is for Very Hard Core Vegan and Vegetable lovers. It has a Very strong almost algae/Seaweed earthy taste. I love to mix it with apple juice and drink it. The liquid will turn into a very dark pea/kale green color. If memory serves it has one of the highest antioxidant amounts out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She says she feels better every time she drinks it.  She&#x27;s very careful about her nutrition so she won&#x27;t eat or drink just anything.  I&#x27;m not quite up to the healthy green drinks yet, but I&#x27;m working on it.</li>
    <li> I believe this to be a superior, quality product.  Dr, George Malkmus recommends it.  My friend was diagnosed with colon cancer.  She juiced vegetable juices for 90 days (took it 3 times a day) and ate only salads and raw fruits and vegetables, and used Barly Life.  It rebuilt her immune system so powerfully that her malignant tumor went away.  IThe tumor shrank down to nothing.  Anyone who is fighting cancer or any other disease should watch Dr. Larraine Day&#x27;s video, &amp;#34;Cancer Doesn&#x27;t Scare Me Anymore.&amp;#34;  She is an MD who had breast cancer.  She covers important information about how to beat it without using the typical medical treatments (chemo, radiation, surgery) that are so deadly to the body and cause so much suffering.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and have noticed that going to the bathroom is easier.  My research on BarelyLfie indicates that is has other health benefits so my plans are to continue using it for the next 3 to  months and then reassess.  They price seems high as I have found it on-line cheaper so shop around.</li>
    <li> My 86 year old grandmother is bragging to all of her friends that she doesn&#x27;t have to take her daily aleve anymore...and has so much more energy.  I feel great too, but watching this daily change in her has been just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely drink it on an empty stomach, like 20 minutes before breakfast.  I use a little whisk to mix it in all the way, it can get clumpy.  The taste is mild, like grass, nothing to write about.</li>
    <li> Used this for years.I mix it into my morning smoothie with ally other supplements . chlorophyll being the blood cleanser it is,we all need this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is bursting with extra nutrition! I add it to my morning smoothie and I feel I&#x27;m giving my body more of what it needs to stay healthy over the long haul. An investment in my health.</li>
    <li> The expiration on my container is 08/2014. This product is now ROCK SOLID and will not break up. I have tried to dissolve it in water to no avail. I called the customer service number listed on the back of the container and the lady was quit rude saying that it had been over 3 months and if I had used the product as I was supposed to, there wouldn&#x27;t be any product left!  I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was hearing. It shouldn&#x27;t matter how long I take to use their product within the expiration date, their product should not turn ROCK HARD! She would NOT exchange the product AND she was quit rude offering no alternative solution. Should you purchase this product, use it quickly or it WILL HARDEN.</li>
    <li> BarleyLife is an excellent source for someone who has inconsistent or low fiber diets.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and ordering from the company.  However since I am a prime member I don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.  It is a great product because it gives you 100% of vitamin K which I needed.  I drink it with OJ every morning to start the day.</li>
    <li> I like this product of Barry green powder, believing that has high quality standard, but it is bit pricey for me.</li>
    <li> Barley Green is very good for your health.  Many people take it, and have asked me to order it for them.&lt;br /&gt;They look younger than they are, so what more would you want?</li>
    <li> This product works exceptionally well, one scope gives you all the greens needed for the day</li>
    <li> Great product. I take twice daily.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed the fast delivery and the product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like the Barley Life.  Seems to taste much better than some of the other Barley products.</li>
    <li> It tastes awful, yeah it is supposed to be good, so I ask if anyone knows how to make it taste better?  It just tastes like grass and it won&#x27;t dissolve in water which makes it a pain to consume along with the taste.  I&#x27;m serious and sincere in this question.  I would like to keep this in my diet, but how much do you have to endure in life?</li>
    <li> Barley Green, what can I say! This is a great product. It is good for any problem you are having in you body. It will give you a lot of energy forget about those unhealthy energy drink this stuff works well. It&#x27;s goes down great juice until you get use to that taste. We all love it my whole family!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!! Ever since I had been diagnosed Hypothyroid I had been looking for a natural way to treat it. I had gained weight, was so tired, losing my hair, finger nail ridges, etc. all the classic signs. Then, my doctor confirmed it. She wanted to put me on synthetic hormones. I said no, I&#x27;m going to see if I can find a more natural treatment. So began my internet search. But days, led to weeks, led to a month, and I just kept coming back to AIM BarleyLife Barley Grass Powder. I finally ordered some a year ago. Right away I noticed my energy improved greatly, I felt better...healthier...and, as an added bonus I started dropping lbs. I didn&#x27;t change my eating habits, it just happened. Over the year, whenever I ran out of AIM BarleyLife I would try other \\&quot;greens powder\\&quot;. Some were wheat grass, some said barley grass, some were a combo of both. But...every time I ran out, and tried something else, the weight came back, and my energy slipped back down. So now I know, for sure, after a year, that it is definitely the AIM BarleyLife Barley Grass that makes all the difference in how I feel. My energy level goes up, and the weight starts dropping off again. Test over!!! For me, this is the only product I will use, from here, on out, for health, energy, weight management, and my Hypothyroidism. Thanks AIM</li>
