      <li>This stuff gets it done quick!!!</li>
      <li>Love this lightener!</li>
      <li>My favorite hair lightening product!  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use, like baking a cake.</li>
      <li>I used this with 20 (Loreal) developer and got a nice lift to my very light blond hair.  </li>
      <li>By far the best lightening product ever made.</li>
      <li>and I get the same excellent results every time.  </li>
      <li>: I also want to add that I was advised NOT to bleach on top of my already-bleached hair but stubborn me did it anyway</li>
      <li>Wella Blondor is my favorite bleach, and it&#x27;s much more affordable in tub form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>but it prevents breakage (don&#x27;t use it more than every 6 week because it can make the hair brittle).  </li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Lightens my hair better than any product I have ever</li>
      <li>This lightening powder gives me great lift and I highly recommend it for any bleaching process.</li>
      <li>Strong bleach.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery and amazing product</li>
      <li>It was my first time bleaching on my own</li>
      <li>I have the timing down perfect</li>
      <li>Great and priced similarly to beauty supply with discount.</li>
      <li>hair is light brown (about level 5 or 6)</li>
      <li>I used this a week after my misfortune with the blue bleach and I am happy to report I did not have any breakage.  </li>
      <li>Must use a toner afterwards or hair will be crayon yellow, but works great.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t leave my hair super light</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought the large size.</li>
      <li>Then, I tone with Special Effects toner.</li>
      <li>that I then tone with Wella Color Touch in 10/6, which neutralizes most of the yellow tones, giving me a beautiful natural looking golden blond without any brassiness.  </li>
      <li>I love this bleach, It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and doesn&#x27;t burn or frizz it..</li>
      <li>but it is still healthy, not dry, not damaged, and I was able to achieve the color I want.</li>
      <li>I love how fast and balance this enlightening powder pulls up.</li>
      <li>Im so lucky I didn&#x27;t ruin my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done it myself for years and have gotten better results than I ever did when I was going to a professional colorist.  </li>
      <li>I highlighted my own hair, I receive constant complements on the highlights!</li>
      <li>and I lighten just until the brown begins to turn golden.  </li>
      <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I decided to break down and get some good stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love my blondor, it gets my hair as blonde as I like!!!</li>
      <li>Works fast and even!</li>
      <li>Certainly salon quality.  </li>
      <li>just beautiful pale blonde ..shipped fast too</li>
      <li>Apoghee is quite stinky (that&#x27;s the real protein in it)</li>
      <li>I regularly use Color Touch in 10/6 which lasts about 4 weeks if I use a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Lightens very well.</li>
      <li>It performs very well.</li>
      <li>lightened my hair really well in one sitting and no too damaging.</li>
      <li>Great lifting product a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, but keep a close eye on your hair.</li>
      <li>I always deep condition after bleaching, first with Apoghee Two Step reconstructor and then with a moisture mask, either</li>
      <li>I tried using Loreal blue quick bleach prior.  </li>
      <li>It bleaches super fast but doesnt mess the hair as much as other bleaches, its so worth it</li>
      <li>i am platinum blonde thanks to this product</li>
      <li>This bleach is not harsh to my hair.</li>
      <li>This product was well-recommended by a friend who is a professional hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My natural is a medium brown.  </li>
      <li>It did leave my hair with the typical yellowing, but that&#x27;s what toner is for right!</li>
      <li>It took a bit to long to get to my house and the price was a bit to high</li>
      <li>I used this with clairol pure white 30 developer and it took a whole month to get to a pale blonde and thats with my middle to end</li>
      <li>It left my roots which are dark brown orange the first time with 30 dev.</li>

<li> hair still being a slight golden blonde (orangish, due to years of dying my hair a level 2 dark brown).</li>
<li> It lightens either fast or slow depending on the volume of developer used.  </li>
<li> DOES&#x27;NT DRY OR STRIP HAIR</li>
<li> The (Loreal) bleach dried up strangely and left my root job with missed spots all over my head.  </li>
<li> For those who are lifting to the pale yellow stage, I suggest using a 30 or 40 volume developer.  </li>
<li> Not sure if it was the bleach itself or my hair but never had to bleach my hair 6 times before to get to a platinum blonde!</li>
<li> My stylist uses it as well on her other clients.</li>
<li> I have to bleach my roots twice, for about 30-45 minutes each time, to get to pale, pale yellow.</li>
<li> LIKE THE HARSH OTHERS...</li>
<li> So bottom line I was never able to even out my hair color and after 6 bleach sessions I threw the towel in.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard to get except on Amazon.</li>
<li> I was not happy with the results.  </li>

    <li> This didn&#x27;t leave my hair super light but it didn&#x27;t totally damage it either. It left my roots which are dark brown orange the first time with 30 dev. So this was a no for me I use another brand that does the job in one shot. Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> lightened my hair really well in one sitting and no too damaging.</li>
    <li> Another great Wella product, came on time and in perfect amount of packaging. Product is perfect.</li>
    <li> It was my first time bleaching on my own and I was a bit scared but I did have some guidance which helped me a lot. This product was well-recommended by a friend who is a professional hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I also want to add that I was advised NOT to bleach on top of my already-bleached hair but stubborn me did it anyway and it did NO damage to my hair at all. I was told my hair would feel like spaghetti but it is still healthy, not dry, not damaged, and I was able to achieve the color I want.</li>
    <li> This stuff it is the best hair bleach I have ever used and I will be buying more. It took a bit to long to get to my house and the price was a bit to high</li>
    <li> This is one of my newest product! It performs very well. I love how fast and balance this enlightening powder pulls up.</li>
    <li> Lightens very well. This stuff gets it done quick!!! Highly recommend, but keep a close eye on your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s very hard to get except on Amazon. Very easy to use, like baking a cake. :)&lt;br /&gt;Lightens my hair better than any product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and amazing product</li>
    <li> Great product , Great price! Best bleach in biz been using it for over 15 years! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Great bleach!  Certainly salon quality.  Will totally buy again when I run out of this giant tub. Works fast and even!</li>
    <li> A GREAT PRODUCT....GENTLER ON MY HAIR...DOES&#x27;NT DRY OR STRIP HAIR LIKE THE HARSH OTHERS...ITS ALL I WILL USE NOW ....</li>
    <li> I love my blondor, it gets my hair as blonde as I like!!!</li>
    <li> Great lifting product a little goes a long way. No clumping stays moist.</li>
    <li> By far the best lightening product ever made. Best lifting, best toning, and makes hair feel great. Where have you been all my life??</li>
    <li> Its worth every penny. It bleaches super fast but doesnt mess the hair as much as other bleaches, its so worth it, you cannot buy this product on stores, only with beauty license</li>
    <li> bleached my hair with no damage</li>
    <li> Not sure if it was the bleach itself or my hair but never had to bleach my hair 6 times before to get to a platinum blonde! I used this with clairol pure white 30 developer and it took a whole month to get to a pale blonde and thats with my middle to end hair still being a slight golden blonde (orangish, due to years of dying my hair a level 2 dark brown). So bottom line I was never able to even out my hair color and after 6 bleach sessions I threw the towel in. Im so lucky I didn&#x27;t ruin my hair. I will not be re purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I love this bleach, It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and doesn&#x27;t burn or frizz it.. My stylist uses it as well on her other clients.</li>
    <li> worked the way it says on the container.  lightened me up a bit quicker than the lighteners.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It lightens either fast or slow depending on the volume of developer used.  It keeps the integrity of the hair in tact and never leads to breakage.  I use this to do balayage highlights on my shoulder length hair.  I&#x27;ve done it myself for years and have gotten better results than I ever did when I was going to a professional colorist.  I have the timing down perfect and I get the same excellent results every time.  My hair is a level 4 medium brown and I get enough lift to get a medium level 8 blond that I then tone with Wella Color Touch in 10/6, which neutralizes most of the yellow tones, giving me a beautiful natural looking golden blond without any brassiness.  For those who are lifting to the pale yellow stage, I suggest using a 30 or 40 volume developer.  I use a 30 and I lighten just until the brown begins to turn golden.  I regularly use Color Touch in 10/6 which lasts about 4 weeks if I use a sulfate free shampoo.  I always deep condition after bleaching, first with Apoghee Two Step reconstructor and then with a moisture mask, either Je Veux Mud Mask or Shea Moisture Manuka Honey, both of which are excellent.  Apoghee is quite stinky (that&#x27;s the real protein in it) but it prevents breakage (don&#x27;t use it more than every 6 week because it can make the hair brittle).  I usually get a friend to help me with the back of my head because it&#x27;s really a two person task.  This lightening powder gives me great lift and I highly recommend it for any bleaching process.</li>
    <li> I highlighted my own hair, I receive constant complements on the highlights! This bleach is not harsh to my hair.</li>
    <li> Product was sent right on time with no delays this is a good product I was very happy with the purchase would order again Wella is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> My favorite hair lightening product!  Quality stuff... i am platinum blonde thanks to this product</li>
    <li> I bleach and tone my hair to get it platinum blonde. Wella Blondor is my favorite bleach, and it&#x27;s much more affordable in tub form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is light brown (about level 5 or 6) and I use Blondor with a 20 volume developer on my roots. I have to bleach my roots twice, for about 30-45 minutes each time, to get to pale, pale yellow. Then, I tone with Special Effects toner.</li>
    <li> I tried using Loreal blue quick bleach prior.  The (Loreal) bleach dried up strangely and left my root job with missed spots all over my head.  I was not happy with the results.  I decided to break down and get some good stuff.  I used this with 20 (Loreal) developer and got a nice lift to my very light blond hair.  My natural is a medium brown.  I used this a week after my misfortune with the blue bleach and I am happy to report I did not have any breakage.  This will be my bleach going forward.  It&#x27;s a bunch cheaper than going to the salon and you won&#x27;t look like a brillo pad.  It did leave my hair with the typical yellowing, but that&#x27;s what toner is for right!</li>
    <li> Love this lightener! I am glad I bought the large size.</li>
    <li> The beat ever! No orange..just beautiful pale blonde ..shipped fast too</li>
    <li> Strong bleach. Works great. Must use a toner afterwards or hair will be crayon yellow, but works great.</li>
    <li> Great and priced similarly to beauty supply with discount.</li>
    <li> This format is great! the last one I got Lasted for two years.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Would buy again</li>
