      <li>Many years ago a hairdresser introduced me to this product</li>

      <li>More economical to buy in this size.</li>
      <li>She felt it did not do as good of a job as promised, she is going to continue to use it until it is gone, but we most likely will not re-order</li>
      <li>very fast delivery , love it</li>
      <li>This shampoo/conditioner is great - seems to moisturize my hair, which can be really dry and brittle.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair clean and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo and conditioner for dry color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Bottles arrived relatively quickly( 2 days) but leaked.</li>
      <li>shipped quickly</li>
      <li>After switching to this KMS, my hair is much more weightless, soft, clean, and shiny without the oily look.  </li>
      <li>I rarely use the conditioner on my scalp, and I have no issues with my hair feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>The price was right</li>

      <li>It is very gentle, and is made with natural ingredients.  </li>

      <li>I absorbed the loss and kept them because I didn&#x27;t want to send them back.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>smells great and usually runs about 20 dollars a bottle for half the size in salons</li>
      <li>I do use heat styling tools every day, but this shampoo leaves my air feeling silky and soft to the touch while allowing it to hold a style.</li>
      <li>and I already knew I loved the shampoo/conditioner as I have been using it for about 6 months prior, but one of the bottles came with a broken pump and there was conditioner everywhere.</li>
      <li>I have colored, glazed, straightened, relaxed and a whole host of other damaging scenarios in regards to my hair and this is the only product I trust.</li>
      <li>She was also very happuy that the shampoo and conditioner bottles were the same size, as the previous purchase from a local store di not offer that.</li>

<li> purchased as a gift - much less $$ than at a salon&lt;br</li>
<li> My hair dresser has been using this product on my long, thick, curly, permed hair for years.  </li>
<li> and I like how it hydrates my hair without making it feel heavy.</li>
<li> The pump was already in them, which isn&#x27;t how my shampoo and conditioners usually come when I buy them at the Beauty Supply Store.  </li>
<li> It was really unfortunate and it is basically unusable, and I was not aware it was broken before taking it out of the packaging and using it.</li>
<li> I will say that the packaging was very bad on these.  </li>

    <li> Excellent product, excellent price</li>
    <li> My wife really did not think this was the best bang for her buck.  She felt it did not do as good of a job as promised, she is going to continue to use it until it is gone, but we most likely will not re-order</li>
    <li> Always a great product. shipped quickly</li>
    <li> very fast delivery , love it</li>
    <li> I purchased much smaller bottles from a salon for about the same price as these! This is a great shampoo / conditioner set for anyone with fine hair.  It is very gentle, and is made with natural ingredients.  It smells, too!</li>
    <li> Many years ago a hairdresser introduced me to this product and I have only used this moist repair. It is the best and I an so glad to . find it on Amazon. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and I like how it hydrates my hair without making it feel heavy.</li>
    <li> The best hair care for the absolute best price! Anywhere else charges close to $30 just for one bottle this size but here you get both for about the same which is over a $40 savings! I have colored, glazed, straightened, relaxed and a whole host of other damaging scenarios in regards to my hair and this is the only product I trust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for many years. My hair used to feel and look dry even though I do not color or perm it. I do use heat styling tools every day, but this shampoo leaves my air feeling silky and soft to the touch while allowing it to hold a style. The fragrance is light and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE this set! smells great and usually runs about 20 dollars a bottle for half the size in salons so it&#x27;s a great deal</li>
    <li> Shampoo/conditioner leaked all over delivery box.  I am expected to return the product even though it&#x27;s leaked everywhere.  What a scam.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist sold me this in her salon for twice the price. I loved the product so much I came to amazon to order more....you can&#x27;t beat this price and KMS is perfect for my hair that tends to get greasy easy.</li>
    <li> Bottles arrived relatively quickly( 2 days) but leaked. The bottles were sticky with dripping Shampo and Conditioner. I absorbed the loss and kept them because I didn&#x27;t want to send them back. The Shampoo and Conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve found for my dry frizzy hair. The price was right but I think I&#x27;ll check Sally&#x27;s price, it doesn&#x27;t ship well.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  I&#x27;m still sitting on the bench on whether my hair is any better from using them than the products I was previously using which were also beauty salon products.  I will say that the packaging was very bad on these.  The pump was already in them, which isn&#x27;t how my shampoo and conditioners usually come when I buy them at the Beauty Supply Store.  There was 1/2 of the product all over everything so that was a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love it and is a great product and amaizing  color.  Looks exactly like in the pic.Love it, Love it,Love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often I have an opinion on shampoo and conditioner, but this has proven to be effective for everyone&#x27;s hair in the family!  Whereas other products would get rid of bubbles in bath water, this doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s as though it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals other ones do to do that.  It only requires a little bit of each and it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
    <li> I use only this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves hair clean and shiny.  no residue soft and fresh feeling&lt;br /&gt;great price!!</li>
    <li> I received these and I already knew I loved the shampoo/conditioner as I have been using it for about 6 months prior, but one of the bottles came with a broken pump and there was conditioner everywhere. It was really unfortunate and it is basically unusable, and I was not aware it was broken before taking it out of the packaging and using it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of both the shampoo and conditioner, they work great and leave your hair feeling clean. After repeated use my hair became shinier and feels much more hydrated.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner for dry color treated hair.  More economical to buy in this size.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo and the large size makes it more economical. The smell is nice but a little perfumey. Makes my hair soft and manageable but not weighed down. If you like a good lather in your shampoo then you&#x27;ll love this. Will last me a long time but will buy again!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hairdresser uses this line and my kid asked me to buy it.  She said she likes it. _</li>
    <li> used this product aat my daughters house like it so I ordered it...Great products.  Will buy again when I run out</li>
    <li> I love KMS Repair for over processed hair. Affordable. Great product</li>
    <li> Price is incredible for the incredible quality of kms</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner is great - seems to moisturize my hair, which can be really dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> I started using KMS Moist Repair about two years ago. I dye my hair once every few months (with regular root touch ups). I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner if you do anything to process your hair (including heat tools!). I also use the leave in treatment every day after I shower, which I also recommend. For those of you with hair that tends to get greasy, no worries! I rarely use the conditioner on my scalp, and I have no issues with my hair feeling greasy. May 2016 update: the product changed at some point in the last couple of years. It&#x27;s not as effective.</li>
    <li> A superb combination of shampoo and conditioner which is a must to give a thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Love the vanilla smell and shampoo/conditioner is moisturizing for my hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo came open and I emailed them; one hour later ai received one email apologizing and they sent me another one priority mail. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the provider.</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift - much less $$ than at a salon&lt;br /&gt;would purchase again&lt;br /&gt;excellent deal for the $$</li>
    <li> Have always loved KMS products.</li>
    <li> Items arrived on time and not damaged. My wife loves this product.  She was also very happuy that the shampoo and conditioner bottles were the same size, as the previous purchase from a local store di not offer that.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser has been using this product on my long, thick, curly, permed hair for years.  Recently the natural products I was using were causing a build up of oil, and making my hair look heavy and greasy.  After switching to this KMS, my hair is much more weightless, soft, clean, and shiny without the oily look.  It also has a nice, light fragrance that does not impact my sensitivities to perfumed products.</li>
