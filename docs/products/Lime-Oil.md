      <li>Wonderful essential oil - I have ordered a number of these from the NOW brand -</li>

      <li>I think it smells better than lime somehow.</li>
      <li>Now Foods essential oils are great products!</li>
      <li>buy it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
      <li>The bottle is glass, with a plastic dropper at the top of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;ve all been fantastic!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say more about it.  </li>
      <li>I Love this oil,it is Fabulous  </li>
      <li>The product alone is fine.  </li>
      <li>but I found the dropper used on the bottle to be quite precise.  </li>
      <li>If you have a heavier touch, though, and need a precise amount, I would recommend using a bulb dropper.    </li>
      <li>All of these oils are fantastic and I use them in my craft projects to make things like lotion bars and beard oil/balm for my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>the light came on.  </li>
      <li>It smells like cheap lime candy.  </li>
      <li>This smells so fresh and invigorating!</li>
      <li>I have found it fun and easy to clean pots and pans and Dishes.</li>
      <li>It is a true lime smell if that is what you are looking for.</li>
      <li>Love the Now Foods oils, decently priced and work well.</li>
      <li>This is strong but very pleasing to the nose.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and perky-</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use them for candles, as I normally use regular fragrance oils made for candles, and to be honest, essential oils are too good for that in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The lime makes the bathroom smell good too when I wipe a few drops on the sink just for the fresh smell.</li>
      <li>It smells so wonderful and believe me when I say a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I know many consider NOW an inferior essential oil company</li>
      <li>If I were able to rate the packaging, it would only be 1 star.  </li>
      <li>In case anyone is interested, the recipe for my complexion spray is below:  10 drops</li>
      <li>I buy many of my essential oils from NOW</li>
      <li>The lime is more like candy than actual limes.</li>
      <li>This one is very strong and bitter.</li>
      <li>I put a cap of the lime oil,and 1/2 cap of the basil oil in my large bottle of Ultra Palmolive pure+clear Dish Soap.</li>
      <li>I also read it was very antiseptic for bacteria, fungus and viruses</li>
      <li>They are very affordable quality</li>
      <li>Plus NOW is a family owned company that believes in quality and reasonable prices.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to rate and value the merits of oils, because I don&#x27;t really use them for much.  </li>
      <li>That didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s actually helping and it has made my fingernails very white and very strong as well.  </li>
      <li>I love diffusing it with other citrus or with spearmint.</li>
      <li>I use this almost daily in my water has a mild Lime flavor  </li>
      <li>The scent is refreshing, and the 1-oz. bottle will last me a long time!    </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m still trying to think of new ways to use it.  </li>
      <li>I purchase only NOW Foods essential oils when possible and I have been satisfied with their quality as well.</li>
      <li>This is the first essential oil I have purchased from NOW</li>
      <li>IDK if that&#x27;s because of the oil, or my felt pad, or my old clock.</li>
      <li>Packaging was just right, even though handling was obviously rough.</li>
      <li>highly reccomend Now Foods essential oils.</li>
      <li>Just put a squirt of the shaken Dish Soap in the pan ,with a little warm water then scrub just a little and then its done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like all of the NOW oils. This one is very strong and bitter. It is a true lime smell if that is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> The perfect lime scent!!  I can&#x27;t say more about it.  If you like [[ASIN:B00125PH5U Lime Mate Non Aerosol 7 Ounces]] (who doesn&#x27;t?!), then this is the essential oil to match.  Goes wonderfully with vanilla, also.  It&#x27;s a bright and calming and sunny fragrance for my home.</li>
    <li> This really smells wonderful.  It&#x27;s got the aromatherapy aspect for sure.  I put two drops in a large glass of water and it smells wonderful and somehow makes you feel wonderful while you&#x27;re drinking or smelling it.  I never gave a lot of credence to aromatherapy but this has made me change my mind.  I got a beautiful balsam wreath for Christmas which hangs on the front door even now (Feb) because when the sun hits the front door it permeates my whole house with the lovely smell even though the wreath has turned brown now.  I also bought some balsam oil from Now so I can use that from time to time.  The lime makes the bathroom smell good too when I wipe a few drops on the sink just for the fresh smell. It goes a long way.  I also read it was very antiseptic for bacteria, fungus and viruses so I put a drop under my fingernail that  has a fungal infection and it&#x27;s actually helping and it has made my fingernails very white and very strong as well.  I will always want to keep some of this around.</li>
    <li> This smells so fresh and invigorating! I love it! The 6 bottles will last a long time though, so I don&#x27;t expect to be buying it again anytime soon, but I will if I run out!</li>
    <li> The lime is more like candy than actual limes. Still smells really nice</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lime oil.  I purchased this exclusively for when I make laundry soap and fabric softner, to soften it.  Very simple to make fabric softner crystals, similar to Purex Crystals:  4 cups epsom salts, 20 drops of your fave essential oil (modify to preference).  I love 10 drops lavendar + 10 drops lime, mix well, 1-2 TBSP per load.  Love the Now Foods oils, decently priced and work well.</li>
    <li> I know many consider NOW an inferior essential oil company but I love them. I have been using EO for healing and well being for 25 years and have tried almost every brand and I keep coming back to NOW for their quality and price. I did a blind test with some of my students using the most expensive  oils and NOW oils  they could not tell the difference and most picked the NOW brand! Plus NOW is a family owned company that believes in quality and reasonable prices.  NOW  keeps essential oils affordable for everyone.  No I dont work for NOW!</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and perky- I love diffusing it with other citrus or with spearmint. I&#x27;m always pleased with NOW oils.</li>
    <li> The product alone is fine.  It is what you would expect.  It has a very strong lime scent.  If I were able to rate the packaging, it would only be 1 star.  When I received my order, the lid was loose and I lost about 1/4 of the product.  No free return so I had to eat the loss.</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily in my water has a mild Lime flavor  am very pleased with the product.will probably order again.</li>
    <li> I just got this in today and I&#x27;m already in LOVE. It smells so wonderful and believe me when I say a little goes a long way. This is the first essential oil I have purchased from NOW but this seems to be one of the best quality oils I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Hardly had much of a scent. I used this to make a foot salt scrub but it didn&#x27;t smell of lime.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really smell like limes to me - smells more like lime Starburst candy.  :(</li>
    <li> Will buy again!! Packaging was just right, even though handling was obviously rough. I buy many of my essential oils from NOW and they&#x27;ve all been fantastic!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate and value the merits of oils, because I don&#x27;t really use them for much.  It smells really, really great.  That&#x27;s all I actually care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it by putting a few drops on a felt pad, which was heated by a small light bulb in my alarm clock, &amp; that was supposed to release the smell when my alarm turned on in the morning/the light came on.  That didn&#x27;t really work.  IDK if that&#x27;s because of the oil, or my felt pad, or my old clock.</li>
    <li> i love love love the smell of this oil! as well as the quality! I do not have to worry about putting it on my kiddos and them somehow getting it in their mouths. Smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!!  I could smell thsi lime allllll day long.  I think it smells better than lime somehow.</li>
    <li> I Love this oil,it is Fabulous  I put a cap of the lime oil,and 1/2 cap of the basil oil in my large bottle of Ultra Palmolive pure+clear Dish Soap.I have found it fun and easy to clean pots and pans and Dishes.Just put a squirt of the shaken Dish Soap in the pan ,with a little warm water then scrub just a little and then its done.Now, it&#x27;s fun to wash dishes!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice i use it to scent cleaning supplie and bath products</li>
    <li> Quality of this essential oil is perfect! I purchase only NOW Foods essential oils when possible and I have been satisfied with their quality as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is just me, but this smells awful. It made me gag. I am throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of lime-scented and flavored things, and this is no exception.  This oil has an authentic lime smell, and works perfectly in the all-natural complexion spray I make at home.  The scent is refreshing, and the 1-oz. bottle will last me a long time!    The bottle is glass, with a plastic dropper at the top of the bottle.  The dropper is not a squeeze-bulb dropper- but I found the dropper used on the bottle to be quite precise.  If you have a heavier touch, though, and need a precise amount, I would recommend using a bulb dropper.    In case anyone is interested, the recipe for my complexion spray is below:  10 drops [[ASIN:B000W3XB9M NOW Foods, LIME OIL 1 OZ]]  10 drops [[ASIN:B005P0N6Z6 Now Foods - LEMON OIL, 1 oz liquid]]  10 drops [[ASIN:B0019LWW9Q Now Foods Grapefruit Oil, 1-Ounce]]  5 drops [[ASIN:B000MGOYZE Now Foods Rosemary Oil, 1-Ounce]]  1/2 cup distilled water    Shake well before using.  This mixture is very refreshing to use as a pick-me-up any time of day!</li>
    <li> Wonderful essential oil - I have ordered a number of these from the NOW brand - I use a lot of their products already and so I&#x27;m a fan of the brand. All of these oils are fantastic and I use them in my craft projects to make things like lotion bars and beard oil/balm for my boyfriend. I don&#x27;t use them for candles, as I normally use regular fragrance oils made for candles, and to be honest, essential oils are too good for that in my opinion. I&#x27;ll save them for using in my personal care products. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with all of the ones I have purchased!</li>
    <li> It smells like cheap lime candy.  Not what I was looking for at all.  Does any lime essential oil actually smell like lime?</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good.  I love the smell of lime.  I have added it to a handsoap dispenser that had some unfragranced soap in it and can smell it when I wash my hands.  I don&#x27;t work with essential oils so I&#x27;m still trying to think of new ways to use it.  My niece makes candles and I&#x27;m sure this would help make an awesome scented candle.</li>
    <li> Now Foods essential oils are great products! They are very affordable quality oils.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend Now Foods essential oils.</li>
    <li> buy it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> Sometimes lime scented products can be too intense or fake smelling. This is strong but very pleasing to the nose.</li>
