<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The replacement was perfect and my husband is very happy with the saver.</li>
    <li> Great produce, I reorder every year.</li>
    <li> work great.  on time delivery</li>
    <li> Best razors on the market.  The replacement head works perfectly even after 2 years.</li>
    <li> Would not buy a second one.</li>
    <li> It gets dull too fast.</li>
    <li> Correct replacement for model 320s-4</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and works wonderfully on my electric razor. I wasn&#x27;t sure which one to get until I read a review that told me where to find the replacement head model and that location for those who may not know is under the trimmer part of your razor. Simply extend it up and there it is at the bottom. If you have had your razor for a while like me you may need to angle it just right so you can read it.</li>
    <li> Using this replacement head attachment feels like I have a brand new shaver. I tried to find one where I purchased the shaver but to no avail.</li>
    <li> Great price on Amazon</li>
    <li> great price for a quality product. I wish I had done it months sooner. Become a Prime member, I received it in two days with free shipping, and it was delivered on a Sunday from the USPS! Awesome! Prime has more than paid for itself in fast shipping of inexpensive items.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth shave again...</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what it said it would be and fit the series 3 shaver. Braun could be a little more helpful with explaining what head goes with what type of shaver though.</li>
    <li> Providing me with close, excellent shaves</li>
    <li> Still catching hairs without cutting. outch!</li>
    <li> They worked just fine.</li>
    <li> This is as much a review about my Braun razor as for the cutting head.  The Braun razor (model 320s-4) is great.  It gives a very close shave over the entire face and doesn&#x27;t require an excessive number of passes.  It also holds a charge an amazingly long time.  Perhaps the cutting head is the key to the close shave.  Either way, the combination of head and razor makes for a terrific shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years. the replacement foil packs keep the shaver like new. The price is great and it&#x27;s worth ordering.</li>
    <li> Works great just exspensive&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> fit perfect work great</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Great upgrade from worn head 5 years old. Now can get those pesky long maverick whiskers that escaped the old head. A clean shave at last.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have good, close shaves again.</li>
    <li> nice could NOT get at walgreens</li>
    <li> The product worked as it should. Sent chrome instead of black that&#x27;s why I ordered 32b not 32c. But whatever.</li>
    <li> Terrific; shaver works better than new!</li>
    <li> I just replaced my shaving head for the 3rd. time, I do this about every 18 months as advised by the maker. My model is the Series 3 340  wet/dry. Before I got my Braun shaver I had a Panasonic and Norelco. The Panasonic was fine in the beginning, but it didn&#x27;t take long for my shave not to be what I liked. The Norelco just didn&#x27;t give me a close shave for my heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Braun is the one I like the most and only having to replace the cutter and foil head every 18 months is great. The replacement head is easy to install and my shave is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ----. If and when my shaver gives up the ghost, it&#x27;s out the door to replace it with another Braun.</li>
    <li> Makes your shaver effective again.</li>
    <li> It made the razor like new.</li>
    <li> Made my Series 3 shaver like new again.</li>
    <li> Why buy new razor? Just replace the blades with this cartridge and it&#x27;s good as new. Exactly fit my razor, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a replacement electric razor blade? It works or it doesn&#x27;t. This one works as long as you&#x27;re very careful and order the correct one. There are several different replacement Series that look like they are the correct one, just ready carefully and order the correct one.</li>
    <li> It is the correct replacement head. I did not realized what the &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; was for. Chose &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; and found out that the head need the &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; which our shaver had a Silver head.</li>
    <li> Braun makes at least 3 different \\&quot;Series 3\\&quot; model lines with very different and incompatible replacement heads. Check the model number carefully to make sure you get the right head. The model number should be printed on the shaver body. The 32s and 32b heads are essentially the same except that one has silver trim and the other has black trim (I just buy the cheaper one). The 32s and 32b heads have the cutters and foils integrated into one unit, unlike some other Braun Series 3 heads that are 2 separate pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This head works well. The foil is very thin and gives you a close shave. Unfortunately, the foil is not very durable. Mine wore out in less than a year (compared to 2 years for other Braun shavers that I have owned).</li>
    <li> Fit my Braun 3 series shaver perfectly. Restored its shaving performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is ridiculously hard to open though. Small complaint though.</li>
    <li> Great razor and screen replacement.  Love the one piece idea.</li>
    <li> good stuff just over priced</li>
    <li> This is exactly the replacement pack I needed for my Braun shaver.  Recommend double checking to ensure you are getting the correct pack for your model.  Great product.  Amazon is the most convenient and inexpensive method for purchasing such a product.</li>
    <li> Works like a brand new one.  Extends the overall life of an expensive shaver.  I will do it again nextime.</li>
    <li> Good price and delivery.  Well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the 2nd time, had my shaver for a few years now and with these replacement blades it makes it like brand new again. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered with no screw-ups. A fresh shaver heads makes all the difference for a close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Fair price for getting a good shave again without having to buy another razor</li>
    <li> You cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> Wish I had known the 32s series was gong to be at better price shortly after I would have waited}:</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Free shipping was a deal. Razor works like new.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Interesting though the new one didn&#x27;t work any better than the old one so I will keep using the old one for awhile longer.</li>
    <li> These heads include the blade as one piece.  Good value</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected!</li>
    <li> great! fit perfect.no problem.</li>
    <li> Braun is a very good electric shaver and the replacement head works fine.  It lasts for 18 months, which saves a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Head design has been changed and the cutters don&#x27;t last but a couple of months.  Going back to blades, quicker much better shave</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this product on Amazon - for half the price that it is marked at my local &amp;#34;box store&amp;#34;. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These heads now have a triangular perforation pattern which is clearly superior engineering.  I used to use the older models of the Braun Shavers with their circular perforations on the foil and they would wear through within the short space a couple of months at best.  Now that is no longer the case.  These newer &#x27;head and foil&#x27; replacements last upward of 8-10 months and I shave every day both my face and head.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the price.  I used it every day till the blades got dull and then I bought these new ones on Amazon.  You can&#x27;t beat Braun with any other foil razor.  I highly recommend this replacement head and trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun shaver for several years and knew it was time to replace the shaving head. This one fit perfectly and WOW what a difference it made. I feel like I&#x27;m shaving with a new shaver again.</li>
    <li> Item is as described very happy with it would buy again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. And expected, perfect replacement. No issues at all, I also purchased it at a great price. Better than a box store price</li>
    <li> My husband is pleased with it; just what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Gave to son to replace 1 yr.old head on Braun I gave him last Xmas.. He claims it&#x27;s even  better version than original.He has thick, course hair &amp; Braun is the first elec. razor that really shaves closely. He is 44 &amp; has tried multiple other brands. Also, it must hold a charge as he said often when he&#x27;s rushed in the a.m., he brings it to work  as he does not have to plug it in.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Fits my razor. Just didn&#x27;t like that I had to order it online because none of the stores carry it.  Braun says the head will last 18mo. So when you go to look for it they&#x27;ve discontinued it by then.</li>
    <li> My razor is new again.</li>
    <li> My razor is now, good as new</li>
    <li> First class replacement head was easy to replace and I was completely satisfied</li>
    <li> Really like the improved shaving performance I am getting.  Shave feels much closer.  I probably waited to long to replace the original head but enjoying the results now.</li>
    <li> Pro:  It fits my Braun 340 razor.  It works good for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  The screen doesn&#x27;t last too long, requiring replacement.  If I had known how often the head required replacement, I would have bought a different brand of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 32B is black and 32S is silver.  Other than color, they are exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Great service, great product and came 2 days before it was booked for.</li>
    <li> I waited a little too long to replace the head,but it now works like new!!</li>
    <li> Great to have new, on time right the way Spain, thank you</li>
    <li> I wish it was cheaper but a remarkable difference in shaves.  I should have purchased two.  I may not find it again the next time I need one.</li>
    <li> My husband thought he needed a new shaver until he learned that the head should be changed every 18 months or so.  The replacement head works great and it as if he has a new shaver.  For the low price of the replacement head was well worth buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Completed satisfied with the product and the provided.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 3 Combi 32b Replacement Head Pack 1 Count, cuts my beard very well, this is my first replacent in over one year &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
    <li> Since the battery still lasts weeks on a charge, it didn&#x27;t make sense to buy a whole new unit. Swapping or the blade unit makes this razor like new. Installation was super simple. I will probably buy a replacement annually.</li>
    <li> It came fast. It works very good.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I bought a replacement head for my Braun.  Now it&#x27;s like I have a brand new razor at a fraction of the price of  a new one.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your product! all as well as it was written in the description, I loved)&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more)</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this item where I bought the shaver so had to go to Amazon. Exactly what I needed to tune the little thing up and now Im back to getting my close shaves!</li>
    <li> Luckily, I did some research online before I purchased the Braun 32b replacement.  I ordered the correct one. Good quality!</li>
    <li> Works great. Never a problem!</li>
    <li> searched town most of a morning - probably 4 ? 5 ? stores.&lt;br /&gt;found 32b at one store and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;got it home to find it was used.&lt;br /&gt;who would have thunk it !&lt;br /&gt;bought this on amazon - it was correct and new too !&lt;br /&gt;yep - it fit , it was new and sharp.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe that the old head on my razor was that bad, until I put this replacement on. Much smoother, quicker cutting. It was like having a brand new razor all over again! The replacement head is as good or better than the original, and no issues with compatibility for me. Enjoy shaving again and replace your head! Recommended and will buy again when needed!</li>
    <li> Product arrived just as expected and was able to be put into use immediately.</li>
    <li> Original equipment, brought razor back to brand new.  If you oil it as they suggest, you&#x27;ll get a year out of these blades.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and was about $9 cheaper than Walmart and Target.  Shipping was fast, in original packaging and works as a replacement for the version of Braun Series 3 that I own.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this sooner.  It has restored my Braun to the same close, comfortable shave that it had when it was new.  I need to put a reminder on my calendar app to buy a new one every 18 months.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement to keep my shaver going.  Easy to replace and worked and performed as advertised.  I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Fit perfect. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I replaced the top and it did not work on my gusband&#x27;s face.  My son said it may have been pushed too hard.  Is this a problem.  It does&#x27;t work.  Joanne Crow&lt;br /&gt;crowct@aol.com</li>
    <li> I bought it, of course, to replace an existing shaver head.  The package appears to be genuine, not counterfeit, and was delivered completely free of any damage.  Actually, it is a backup cassette for the new replacement head that I just installed.  I always keep a backup replacement, just in case I damage the one on the shaver.  I bought this one because it was the cheapest price I could find, and the shipping was FREE.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun for almost ten years and for the money it is a great shaver. The replacement heads make it brand new and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Replacing the head on the older Braun razor was more involved, this one takes about 10 seconds.  Yes, after a year of use the new head does give a better shave than the original.  My last Braun razor lasted about 10 years, this one has better speed regulation as the battery runs down.</li>
    <li> I guess I waited too long to replace the head, because the new one was just super.</li>
    <li> Great replacement and easy fit.</li>
    <li> Its a great shaver, works well, holds a charge well, and rinses clean. The first head did not last as long as I thought it would, but this one seems to be of higher quality--maybe they put a cheaper version on the one that comes with the shaver. The trimmer works better than others I&#x27;ve had in the past as well.  However, if you are looking for shaver with a head that keeps/traps the hair so you can rinse it away, this is not the one.  A lot of it is trapped in the head, but quite a bit sprinkles on the sink while you shave.  Do you like to shave while you walk around your room/bathroom getting things in order or shave while you drive to work--don&#x27;t even try to do it with this one.</li>
    <li> Fits and works but grabs you hair very painfully, would not by again or recommend to anyone, not worth the trouble of returning</li>
    <li> On time delivery and a good price. Will buy another soon.</li>
    <li> The replacement head fit fine. No problems. I was initially concerned, as the box it was shipped in was barely taller than the plastic container in which it was housed, but there was no damage.  I was surprised it came from Dublin, Ireland.  The shipping was free. However it probably took an extra 10 days to 2 weeks.  If you want to save money and you&#x27;re not in a rush it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Perfect cuts like new,took 10 seconds to change out.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on my husbands razor</li>
    <li> My razor works like new</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not getting as close a shave as I am used to- seems to me that the replacement head is getting dull faster than it&lt;br /&gt;should.</li>
    <li> Great OEM replacement</li>
    <li> Perfect fit! Genuine Braun replacement head. It made my 320s like new!</li>
    <li> Best electric razor&#x27;s best replacement head price. Just make sure you a certain of the specific model number as it is not that obvious on the razor body...and the replacement heads are specific to a particular model. I have to say that these Braun razor heads last way longer than other brands of razors I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> i have bought three of these replacement heads since owning my shaver and none of them seem to work as well as the original one that came with the shaver. i have read similiar reviews from other people who think perhaps the people who make the replacements don&#x27;t follow the same qualty guidelines as the original manufacturers.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 3 Head is ideal for me. I am a senior and had started to&lt;br /&gt;cut my self when I shaved with a regular razor. I don&#x27;t have to worry&lt;br /&gt;about that with the Braun Series 3. The head is a replacement to the&lt;br /&gt;Braun I use. Thanks for the product and price.</li>
    <li> my shaver is like new again</li>
    <li> Fit my 380-s4 perfectly. Like the black trim much better than chrome it came with.</li>
    <li> The advertising for this Braun Series 3 cartridge was misleading.  Therefore I ended up ordering the wrong part and had to return it.  I became frustrated and went to a repair store handling Braun razor service and parts and purchased what I needed. Now I know the correct part for next time,</li>
    <li> I rated it 3 stars simply because of the price.The razor head does a good job but I think it&#x27;s a little over priced.</li>
    <li> Just what my razor needed to bring it back to life! Fast delivery, good price. Brought my razor back to factory performance.</li>
    <li> Great, great, product. For sensitive skin, including people of color, its not to demanding on your face and leaves a smooth finish. Will order again!</li>
    <li> The replacement head is as good as the original but neither gives as close a shave as I would like.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced the head on my series three since I got it.  It was still working but definitely not doing the job it once did.  This replacement head popped on perfectly and the shaver performs like brand new.  Nice...</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and expected.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The Braun 32b replacement head for the Series Three Braun 340 takes just five seconds to snap on.  The \\&quot;Made In Germany\\&quot; head makes my razor as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A head will last a five shaves a week kind of guy about two years if the head is rinsed after each shave and gets a hot water wash and some spray lube once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun foils are delicate so keep the plastic foil cover locked in place when you finish shaving.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t hold up to original1</li>
    <li> Unable to get this part for razor at Wal-Mart where I got the razor just 2 years ago. Saved me buying a new razor</li>
    <li> I replace them twice a year and it takes care of my whiskers nicely.</li>
    <li> Nice unit. No issues.</li>
    <li> My husband has had his razor for almost a year and this is the first time we have had to replace the head. It was the exact head needed and came in perfect condition and packaged well. Hoping this one lasts longer than the original.</li>
    <li> excellent -- correct replacement -- even after we order/receiced wrong  unit!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazion took care of it--replaced with this correct one--GOOD JOB!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product very good</li>
    <li> Fit as described and got my shaver back to a brand new shaver shave. Makes a huge difference and it looks brand new again. I got two years off the original head but it was starting to lack for sharpness and required more time to shave because of that. I was happy to see that it was a black shaver head as I had heard on other reviews that it was now silver. I guess you just have to pay attention when you order your replacement head and make sure it states that it is black.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new Braun Series 3 replacement.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades make for good shaves.  Expensive for replacement heads, but cheaper than new shaver.</li>
    <li> Braun products are of the highest quality and performance.</li>
    <li> Works perfect shaves just as good as the original one did.</li>
    <li> This replacement was just as good as the original. The black finish looks a little &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; than the original fake chrome finish.</li>
    <li> It does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I like it, I love it. Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> This was cheaper than in stores and since most stores do not this one I was so happy when I actually thought about looking it up on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement parts.</li>
    <li> I HAVE A DIFFICULT BEARD AND THIS RAZOR WORKED GREAT. WITH REPLACEMENT HEADS, (4 SO FAR) NOT GOOD AT ALL. DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
    <li> Good replacment head, it really makes a difference when you change the shaver head. Smooth and clean shaved skin !</li>
    <li> I purchased the shaver cutters and screens because I own Braun shavers. the price was good. the speed and shipping was greatand the merchandise arrived in perfet condition.</li>
    <li> helps keep one&#x27;s face from getting sore need to replace every six months.</li>
    <li> This is a Great replacement part for the Braun razor. Made the razor like new, good close shave. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great so far been using it for a few months.  Works much better then my old one.  Quicker to shave.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for our son who has this razor.  It seems that it&#x27;s so hard to find the replacement screens.  I guess there&#x27;s too many models out there and no store can carry all of them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Product was as represented.  It does a super job.  Will definitely re-order when I need a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Received it sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> Order this items several times a year.  Try to keep an extra set on hand at all times, in the event my razor needs changed.</li>
    <li> By paying $30 (including shipping) to get this part swapped out (and will probably do it about 3 more times), I get to use a &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; shaver for at least 5 years instead of thinking this one&#x27;s broken and buying a new shaver after only a year and a half.</li>
    <li> I love my braun series 3.  Never thought I would get back to using electric but they make a great product.  Replacement head works great too.</li>
    <li> I gave up disposable blades in favor of an electric shaver. Those blades are crazy expensive given what they are. So far I&#x27;m getting a daily shave on a coarse beard for close to a year on a head. Not too shabby. We&#x27;ll worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On thing I do to lengthen the time between head replacement is to use a bit of shave oil on my face when I shave. I can&#x27;t confirm this scientifically, but I think the oil helps to keep the blades lubricated and sharp while also saving my face from the harshness of shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price to get it replaced.  The save it much better and takes less time.  I do like braun.  This is my 3rd razor and I have a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband - it was then first time he used a replacement. Gave him a close shave. After using them replacement, he could really tell how dull there old one was!</li>
    <li> I guess I had gotten used to my shaver pulling hairs out and not doing a great job resulting in more passes over my face. Installation took 2 seconds, just clip it on. So much better. I actually like shaving again.</li>
    <li> fits perfect on the razor and i did not realized my old cutter was so dull. much better shave than before</li>
    <li> The cutter that came with the original electric razor was great.  It felt good for around 6 months.  The replacement cutter felt good for not even a few weeks.  To be fair, I had the same experience with Remington.</li>
    <li> The replacement head was just what I needed.  I installed it and left on my trip to Costa Rica.  The third day there the head failed.  I have not had this happen on any of the many replacement heads I have installed before.  I do not know what happen this time.  The razor did run faster in Costa Rica the power is 120volt.  I will try another repalcement head pack because the price is right and I can not find them in the area I live.</li>
    <li> Works well. As with all products like this, it is terribly over priced.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> My shaver now acts like a new one again.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe the improvement. I put it on my calendar to replace the head every 6 months.</li>
    <li> Caught this blade on sale for 17 bucks. I wish I would have bought more of them before the price went back up.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth replacing electric shaver head!  Smooth and quicker shaving. Brings shaver back to life, feels like a brand new shaver.</li>
    <li> The head arrived in good shape and fit my razor exactly as it should.  I&#x27;d forgotten how a new razor felt, it was great.  I&#x27;m sorry now I waited so long to get the new head!</li>
    <li> Not perfect but a good enough shave for the money</li>
    <li> Excellent, and I get another in six months.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding the heads for the shaver I bought my husband a year ago at Sam&#x27;s Club, but this works perfectly for it!</li>
    <li> Was looking for this forever! I thought I had the right one from Target turns out I was wrong. I should have checked here first. Well, it fit perfectly on my 350cc and extremely sharp and reliable.....my face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom after a shave with these fresh blades!</li>
    <li> Great Price. Lowest price I have found.</li>
    <li> This replacement is of better design &amp; quality than the original, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these anywhere for this price... and Ive looked everywhere,some charge double this price for the same thing. I will never go to the store again for this item!!!</li>
    <li> good product very good and very satisfied</li>
    <li> Perfect and very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Check your model number on Braun&#x27;s web site before buying. There are multiple Series 3 heads and they are incompatible. The shaver is excellent as long as you get the right head.</li>
    <li> It works and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> Husband is satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> Works like the original and keeps on shaving.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but nothing like a fresh blade for a shave. Make sure you buy the right model as they all look alike.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit!  I just snapped off the old had and popped the new one on and it was a brand new shaver.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how close the shave was.  Nex time I won&#x27;t wait as long to replace it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 20 years and most electric shavers out there have been disappointing.  I personally don&#x27;t like the tilting heads so many shavers feature nowadays, because I have thin, very meticulous side burns and a thin mustache.  The tilting head shavers are too inexact and may swivel when I need them to remain fixed in place.  For this reason, I have really like this shaver.  It has no swivel head and has a very good cutter block head.  Every time I replace the head, it feels like a brand new shaver.  Braun manufactures the best shavers overall, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it works great!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I had the Braun shaver for over 3 years but never replaced the head.  The old shaving head had rips at one or two spots and started to scratch the face.  The new head is fine, improved and appears easy to clean with the fine brush (provided originally with the shaver) or with the force of tap water.  I hope to see this lasting for a few years.</li>
    <li> After researching the razor&#x27;s manual and reading some online comments, I ordered what I thought would fit my husband&#x27;s razor.  It was too small, however.  I am not sure how to find the correct replacement foil for a razor that is just over 2 years old…I would hate to think Braun planned for their products to become useless in such a short timespan.</li>
    <li> This replacement head save me money and gives me a great shave. Now I can get a couple more years of service from my razor.</li>
    <li> I did not like this replacement. Feels cheap and did not work anywhere close to the original. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Worked like  charm, shaving easier and shave every day now. Good buy will replace in 12 months shortcuts better bye</li>
    <li> Amazon has a really great plan that automatically sends you a new shaver head kit every 6 months. Works great for me as I don&#x27;t always keep track of when I replaced cutter &amp; Foil. Really hurts when cutters get dull.</li>
    <li> My Braun shaver is once again working like a new one! This replacement head has restored its performance just as I had hoped it would. Best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric!</li>
    <li> Purchased shaver in February 2013. Cutter and foil came apart after 2 months.  This replacement foil and cutter only lasted three weeks.  Will not purchase a third one&lt;br /&gt;jftnsaks</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my old head. I don&#x27;t like adding words at the end. This is the reason I don&#x27;t leave feedback anynmore. its stupid. Let me say good. Or great that&#x27;s all I want</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an extra razor head for the Braun 3 razor. Have not used it yet. Appears to fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great razor works very well along with the replacement head</li>
    <li> Everything turned out okay, Thank You FJG</li>
    <li> Great product honest seller great shaver</li>
    <li> Top quality. I had forgot how good my Braun shaver could be until I replaced the head unit. Well worth the small investment.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that  I should have done it sooner.</li>
    <li> Good spare for the price</li>
    <li> It worked perfect. When I put it on my new Braun electric razor.  To try it for the first time.</li>
    <li> The right part at the right price with speedy shipping. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> The 32b works perfectly on my 340s-4.  I&#x27;m good to go for another year or so. Good clean shave like it was new.  I had originally ordered a 30b that is also for a series 3 Braun but the 30b is NOT the proper one for the Series 3 340s-4.  Order the 32b if you have a 340s-4.  I mistakenly thought series 3&#x27;s were all the same.  Not so...  The packaging was proper and delivered promptly.  I&#x27;m a happy camper again but must admit I still like my Panasonic ES8043 better than the Braun and use it on alternate weeks...</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find the blades at WalMart and these were exactly what were needed at a reasonable price. Had to change the blades as soon as they arrived and have worked fine so far.</li>
    <li> Second replacement head that I have had for this razor.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Just what was advertised and works great. Made a big difference after I installed the new blade head. cut so much more closer.</li>
    <li> I have the Braun shaver and needed a new head for a long time (probably went 3 years or more). So when I got this new head, I was pleasantly surprised how well I can clean my face again. So it seems that the instruction to replace every 18 months is actually a good idea.</li>
    <li> This fit as expected. The style was updated but still fit the older razor with the correct numbers. ... ...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe that I was trying to shave with my old cutter.  This one is very smooth. thanks...</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I have used Braun razors for years.  They are great razors but several years ago because so expensive, close or over $200 that I went to others.  Finally they came out with a razor that was under $100.  Owned for six months and love it.  Like always, finding replacement heads is a nightmare.  Same store you bought it from, won&#x27;t carry replacement head any more, i.e. Walmart, Target...  So, I can always find them on Amazon, even though I think Braun then tries to make up the money by over charging for the replacements, &amp;#34;Give them the razor for free, charge them a lot for the blades.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I USE THIS DAILY. IT FITS MY RAZOR.</li>
    <li> Smooth shaving back to OEM. The Braun series 3 the best out there period.</li>
    <li> This did include blades and works like a new razor.</li>
    <li> Took old one off and snapped this one on.</li>
    <li> This is what I needed. Great product, good service.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use with his Braun electric razor. It has been great...no problems...worked just as I had hoped. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Was not happy with the life or capability of the head that was supplied new with the shaver only 9 months earlier... (had extremely good luck with the previous design).  This replacement is significantly better right from the start...  we&#x27;ll see in 9 months....</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 electric shaver Combi 32b Replacement Head Pack (1 Count) is a great product, provides a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Brought the Braun shaver to new conditions. Easy to clean. Provides smooth shave. Razor feels like the day I purchased.</li>
    <li> I noticed after using this replacement head for a month or so that it would poke me with a sharp point of something.  Turns out the center cutter must have been dull and thinker whiskers would get caught and act like little spears.  I went back to the original head and problem was solved.  I suppose some day I&#x27;ll have to buy another one and I hope it is better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the razor itself.</li>
    <li> I had this item for maybe 2.5 months and the inside mech. broke......too late is too bad for me.  No exchange now</li>
    <li> They seem to have changed the design, the cutter blade is not the same as the original and looks more cheaply made. Fits in shaver and works well, but has less &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; in the design.</li>
    <li> Great product . Thanks amazon for carrying tear razor heads.</li>
    <li> Made my Braun work just like new.</li>
    <li> Works good. Only expect to get 6 months or so</li>
    <li> If you own a Braun 3 series, you need this.  Makes an old razor like new and shaves better.</li>
    <li> Price is as good with the 20% discount at bed bath and beyond. Also, the free shipping didn&#x27;t apply even though I&#x27;m a prime member. You losing it Amazon!</li>
    <li> as good as the original</li>
    <li> bet 20 dollars spent.  its like a new shaver.</li>
    <li> 2nd time I bought this product- After 3 shaves it fell apart. Amazon replaced - easy process.,&lt;br /&gt;New unit still doesn not seem to be as strudy as the one I bought a year ago</li>
    <li> Item was as described and the pricing was way better than buying it in a store! Would recommend to all buyers.</li>
    <li> It improved my shaving since the old head was about 17 months old;  or mabye it was 16 months old, I don&#x27;t know.  Thjere, is that enough words?  It is silly to require a certain number of words.</li>
    <li> The new head doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than the old head I replaced. Unless you shave everyday don&#x27;t buy this razor.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly.  Fit my Braun 7300 razor.</li>
    <li> Best cutting head for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Brings your Series 3 back to brand new performance.</li>
    <li> Braun is great for OEM replacement parts support.</li>
    <li> Blade was fine, shipping quick</li>
    <li> The Braun Replacement Head Pack was received in good condition albeit about 5 days later than originally proclaimed.  I am now using the parts and they are functioning as expected.</li>
    <li> The replacement shaver/foil combo head fit my three year old Braun 340S shaver perfectly and it now shaves as well as a new one.  Very happy with the purchase.  No complaints, at least none so far.</li>
    <li> Fit and worked. Had  to have the numbers off of the shaver. Just be careful. There is a lot of different shavers.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a clean shave..</li>
    <li> This nifty replacement head smartly refreshes a tired old razor making it work like new again.</li>
    <li> Should have purchased a year ago or more.  Like having a new shaver.</li>
    <li> As advertised, the correct shaving head for my Braun electric shaver, for a good price.</li>
    <li> This replacement unit matched my series 3 razor.</li>
    <li> Its very hard to find this replacement part in the stores, that&#x27;s why I ordered it from Amazon. It works like I just bought a new shaver. When you start shaving for about 13 to 14 months, the foil and cutter starts getting dull and you don&#x27;t get the same kind of shave. I think the manufacturer should consider changing their replacement recommendation to 15 months or less, not 18 months. Thank you for having this replacement part available for me.</li>
    <li> Much improved shave after blunt set that took too long to try and get a close shave, and much more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I love that I can just order my replacement screen online! Now I get this in just 2 days instead of looking all over town. Saves me a ton of time and I always have a smooth face. ;)</li>
    <li> Made in China &#x3D; defective shaver head/cutter. James</li>
    <li> The replacement head arrived in a timely manner and my husband seems to be enjoying it.  He has an extremely tough beard, and this has been the best electric shave that he has experienced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the wrong model for my razor.  It&#x27;s very confusing as to which one is the right.  Based on the series (3), this should have worked.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Work well just wish they lasted longer and cost less.</li>
    <li> pricey but good product</li>
    <li> For some reason, I can&#x27;t get a good shave from my Braun Series 3. I&#x27;ve replaced the heads on time, but it seems to have made little difference.</li>
    <li> My husband loves getting these</li>
    <li> fit perfect  works great</li>
    <li> My razor took very long to shave my face until I got this fine replacement part.  Now my face feels wonderful!  I can shave in just a minute.  I wish I had replaced this shaving cartridge tears ago.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Shaver is like new now!</li>
    <li> These cartridges sell for a lot more money in the stores near my home. I will definitely be buying these on amazon for now on. My husband loves this shaver so its worth it. The shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> The replacement blade/screen was new! It fit my shaver just as well as the original and the shave was great. One easily forgets how great the quality of the shave was when the screen is new because the daily deteriation was very very subtle after a couple of years use. Note that the postage or shipping cost almost as much as the product itself!</li>
    <li> Works just fine. I&amp;#34;happy</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and was just what i needed</li>
    <li> Excellent goods! Made in Germany. Used the Braun S3 340 shaver more than two years. Now my razor became as new. The price is great.</li>
    <li> This was the first replacement cassette for my Braun Series 3 electric shaver after using the original for about one year. The original shaver&#x27;s cassette did not shave very close from the beginning and I had hoped a this replacement cassette would improve performance. It did improve over the year old unit it replaced but still not a close shave and it&#x27;s performance degraded rapidly to the point that I am searching for a new shaver, not a Braun this time.</li>
    <li> order came quickly and was as advertised</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> After 2 years I finally got a new replacement head and I&#x27;m back to getting a great shave with no more nicks again.</li>
    <li> This is the second batch of blades I purchased through Amazon.  Blades last about 12 months.  Will definitely purchase again.  Have had the razor for about 5 years.  It is nice to be able to keep a set of sharp blades in the razor.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great for what I need... just wish it was less expensive.</li>
    <li> Shaver cartridge is cheap knockoff!! Fell apart after a few months during use, giving me severe facial cuts! Original cartridge lasted 2 years before it had a small scratchy burr, requiring replacement. Avoid this seller, go for the Braun seller at 2x the price for the real deal.</li>
    <li> This simply is a replacement head, no problems installing it, brings the Braun 340 back to original cutting capability. All of these can be cleaned by running them under hot water, then air-dryed overnight, no rusting.  For a really good cleaning, I&#x27;d think that a swirl in a small dish of rubbing alcohol would further degrease the cutters.  I do that occasionally.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a shave with a fresh blade!!</li>
    <li> Right fit for my shaver and fast mailing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the latest in replacement heads, Great!</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the one that came with my shaver.</li>
    <li> The Braun replacement heads are exactly what I needed.  The expedited service was also above and beyond that expected.  It all makes me wonder why I haven&#x27;t availed myself of your services prior to this.  Your service is first rate!</li>
    <li> I did not believe that I needed to change this part on my shaver.  I mean, come on, metal against hair?  Metal should survive right?  Guess not...  Anyway, I replaced the blades and it has shortened my shaving time and the shaver runs a little quieter..</li>
    <li> the shaver replacement  for my model is hard to find in the stores but not on this site ,i love the price and the shipment was very fast ,i would buy here again thanks</li>
    <li> In the past getting a screen/blade combo that lasted was a real problem. This screen/blade combo heads have lasted almost as long as they claim they should (18 months). For me, just getting past six months with other brands was a miracle. These have lasted about 15 months for me, which with my tough facial hair is really good.</li>
    <li> Okay not as good as original Head and not as long lasting. Less expensive than new shaver.</li>
    <li> It improved shaving immensely!</li>
    <li> amazon delivers quickly like the braun replacement head 32b but would pay a higher price if made in u.s.a.made in china has poor quality get 3 mo.max use cutter dulls quickly the braun razor gets the job done when the cutter is sharp.</li>
    <li> I guess I had gotten used to my shaver pulling hairs out and not doing a great job resulting in more passes over my face. I am now using the parts and they are functioning as expected.</li>
    <li> Improove my shaver perfomance exectly 30%, as braun said.thnanx</li>
    <li> Made my razor like new again.</li>
    <li> Like buying a whole new razor.  My husband hadn&#x27;t realized how dull the old head had become over the course of two years until he snapped this baby into place.  Now the shaver glides over his face without irritation, as it did when new.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted at a good price</li>
    <li> perfect, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Have had the same shaver for a couple of years.  Replacement heads work well for me.  I will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> The replacement head is exactly what is needed.  Order was find. My only complaint is with Braun not the vender in that the replacements are difficult to fine and don&#x27;t last as well as I would like.  Delivery was great and exactly when indicated.</li>
    <li> This breathed new life into my Braun. They over estimate head life IMHO. I&#x27;ve got a pretty easy beard and I didn&#x27;t get a year. I guess 3 heads over the 2 year life (of the battery). One more head to go for me.  Worth it, feel immediate improvement.</li>
    <li> I had been using the previous cutter block/head since purchasing the razor over 2 years ago. I could not get a close enough shave with it even after 10 minutes of skin irritating use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this new cutter block, in 2 minutes my face is almost blade smooth again. Now I remember why I paid so much for this Braun razor back when! I will be making this purchase every 6 months from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason they don&#x27;t sell the 32b or 32c head replacements (which ARE interchangeable) in any Best Buys or other stores where Braun&#x27;s are sold. This was a GREAT price and fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> It was a process trying to find this particular blade replacement. I went to walmart and bought what I thought was the correct one but it wasn&#x27;t. Amazon never lets me down.</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly,was just as ordered,came on as ordered and when it was suppose to arrive. It was easy to replace the razor head.</li>
    <li> Price was right, shipment was fast and well packaged.  Everything was packaged in the air cushion package material to keep safe.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement head hoping it would be a remedy to the Braun shaver&#x27;s inability to shave anything more than a 1-2 day growth, but found that it didn&#x27;t work any better than the old shaving head. I think that the bottom line is that foil type shavers just don&#x27;t work for me and have since replaced the shaver with a Norelco AT830 Powertouch with which I am very happy.</li>
    <li> No issues, arrived on time and works as advertised.  Just don&#x27;t understand why replacement parts for shavers are sop expensive.</li>
    <li> Much better than having to fight the wal Mart crowd.</li>
    <li> Placed an order for a back-up immediately -- best shave and price and it fits my 8000 series Braun perfectly.</li>
    <li> Series 3 is a newer version from my present Braun Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It performance is no better than my old one, so I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have purchased a Series 7 but could not locate the differences or reading reviews that would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the opportunity, I would exchange for a Series 7, if I knew how much more improvement I would experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for two years. They recomend replaceing head in 18 Months. Original was still doing the job but finally changed. GREAT SHAVER...</li>
    <li> The replacement head made the razor work like it was new..</li>
    <li> Really good, Works perfect for my braun Serie 3.&lt;br /&gt;I was worry about get it online, but it was really good and fit on my machine!! five stars!!</li>
    <li> Love the Braun series 3. I will never go back to a conventional razor. I have had it for close to 2 years now.</li>
    <li> The trimmer will tell it all slide it up and it will tell you what replacement part # you will need.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Brand new and as advertised.  Arrived very fast.</li>
    <li> Works well, as expected.</li>
    <li> If you want a super close shave still ahve to use a razor blade.  This head works ok for an electric razor, still need to use a blade every couple of weeks to get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> This is legit. I broke mine sometime ago and stumbled upon it on amazon. Never buying this item at the store again.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected - quality merchandise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 years since I bought my Braun, and the old cutter block was worn out - the foil guard was ripped, the head came off easily in use, and the cutters were obviously dull. The replacement has cut my shaving time by about 25%, and the head no longer pops off!</li>
    <li> Repuestos para m&amp;aacute;quina de afeitar Braun, braun no falla!!&lt;br /&gt;Hace m&amp;aacute;s de 2 a&amp;ntilde;os que tengo la afeitadora, los repuestos duran aproximadamente un a&amp;ntilde;o y medio.&lt;br /&gt;Braun es una muy buena elecci&amp;oacute;n al momento de elegir afeitadoras</li>
    <li> did not realize when I purchased this item that it was plastic as opposed to metal.  the last one I purchased was metal.  it seems to work ok but I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as a metal head would.......</li>
    <li> Have ordered this man times and have been very please , would recommend this to any one, who is looking for a razor head,</li>
    <li> I loved my first Braun, so when it finally wore out, I immediaterly bought another. I was a little dissapointed in the shave it gave me though. It seemed to take forever to shave and I don&#x27;t ave a very heavy beard. I had it over a year and managed to poke a hole in the screen (my fault). The results with this replacement pack shocked me. It is taking half the time to shave now. The blades seem much sharper than the originals. Great item!</li>
    <li> Great price. Very well packaged. Delivered on time. exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Attached perfectly, works just fine</li>
    <li> Good product.  Shipping time was good, I needed sooner than I thought I would.</li>
    <li> Replacing the worn head made a wonderful improvement. Is shaving very well now.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement head, just as good as the original.</li>
    <li> Contrary my original review, this is NOT an original replacement head assembly and is the NOT same quality of my original Braun. The blades fall out of the head especially when taking out of the cleaner. What a pain. It seems the plastic used is of lower quality than the original. The previous replacement head had a chrome looking plastic which is stronger than this one. Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> Out of the box, the replacement head gave me a great shave. Same experience I had the very first day I bought the shaver. It just worked!</li>
    <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I like my Braun 360.  Amazon delivered a new head for it promptly.</li>
    <li> I bought a Braun shaver over a year ago and it has never cut very well.  I thought it was just a poor purchase but when I added the new shaver head recently it made a tremendous difference.  I wash I had exchanged the razor when it was new and tried another one and I may have been happier.  I am happy now.</li>
    <li> razor is only good for about six months nad then it takes much to long to shave with many and I mean many passes to get a decent result.</li>
    <li> this has been a great razor and cleans nicely.  The  heads last longer than most brands and with the replacements it runs as good as new for my guy.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a factory original replacement, works as well as the new, original product</li>
    <li> Right size and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> The replacement head 32B fit perfect, works great.</li>
    <li> A perfect choice for replacing the Braun Series 3 head. I am very satisfied with how well the Braun shaver does the job of shaving&lt;br /&gt;with the replacement head.</li>
    <li> these replacement heads and the brawn 3 series shave worse than a $20 Remington all in one tool i bought at a cvs.</li>
    <li> These work great, but be sure to replace them every couple of months cause they tend to grab hair when they&#x27;re dull.</li>
    <li> the product is what I expected. it works fine.i would recommend it. I was hoping that the right product would be delivered and it was!</li>
    <li> Ordering the new foil saved me from buying a new razor, which is what I considered.  But now its as good as new.</li>
    <li> the new head makes my shaver work as well as it did when it was new. The Braun shaver shaves close and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband has difficulty with dexterity so this was perfect - just popped the old head off and put this one on.  Just what he needed!</li>
    <li> My son bought me this Braun Series 3 340s-4 razor just about 3 months ago, and with just regular daily usage I am disappointed in the quality to have to be buying a replacement head already. You would think Braun would build them to at least last 6 to 12 months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality from Braun and damaging the brand name, probably just more Chinese junk !!!</li>
    <li> This replacement head fit perfectly on my Braun Series 3. I had accidentally damaged the original by dropping my razor, and this was a perfect fit for a replacement. If you are unsure if this is the right replacement head for your product, you can always check the Braun website and it will provide more details!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this replacement head... The head continually pops off the razor and does not cut all that well. I continually have to go back over to catch &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; hairs not too mention it pulls hairs on occasion; it takes longer than wet razor shaving. Not certain if it&#x27;s the head or the crappy razor....most likely both.&lt;br /&gt;This is a disappointing Braun product in general.</li>
    <li> Have used Braun electric razor products for several years. They&#x27;re long lasting and&lt;br /&gt;produce very good results. Will continue to reorder.</li>
    <li> Love my Braun Series 3 shaver and using a new replacement head on a regular basis gives me the smoothest shave.</li>
    <li> service and product top&#x3D;notch</li>
    <li> Like having a new razor!! Had put a dent in the original. Thank to Amazon there was no mead to go on a hunt for the replacement head. Very fast shipping had it in two days. Quality original replacement part, now back to shaving pleasure.</li>
    <li> The new cutting head renewed my razor to new performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had deteriorated slowly and I had forgotten how well Braun shavers worked. It is like night vs day, it saved me buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> This is a spare for replacement when the original malfunctions. So far the original works wonderfully in the Braun razor. I keep the cutter as clean as possible before returning the razor to its charger stand. It&#x27;s doing a great job for me, and I&#x27;m sure the replacement will continue to give me good service. Delivery was fast and packaging was excellent to protect the item.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> Identical to the original Braun razor head that I was replacing on my electric razor model.</li>
    <li> Nothing exciting to report but be forewarned you must read the teenie tiny print on your razor for the proper replacement as there are many with nearly the same product number with a different letter. I almost ordered the wrong one twice.</li>
    <li> Makes the electric razor like new again.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a better price than in the stores.</li>
    <li> only gave 4 stars as they were as good as original and was to be expected. so i was very pleased and will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;it made my sahver as good as the first day i used it. now i know that the next time it starts to go where to buy it</li>
    <li> Great shave. Easy to use. Handles easily.</li>
    <li> Good product, but for what it is worth I don&#x27;t have a very full beard.</li>
    <li> replaced the heads on my Dads razor....perfect</li>
    <li> works pretty well, not exactly an amazingly fantastic difference from my used one. But it fit my shaver and it takes hair off my face</li>
    <li> Braun has redesigned the 32B replacement blade.  Instead of the thin, sharp blades that this part (and the razor it fits) originally had, the 32B now has wider, flat blades that don&#x27;t shave a well.  Where you used to be able to hear and feel the blades cutting your beard, now you don&#x27;t.  Unfortunately, Braun customer service has confirmed that the original-style 32B is no longer available, and the new style is not optimal for their older Series 3 razors.  Bad!</li>
    <li> Not as good as original and didn&#x27;t stay sharp more than a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Fit for purpose, price is fair..  considering it saves the hassle of shopping and crowds I am very happy with purchase...</li>
    <li> Received sooner than anticipated. Product fine.</li>
    <li> Although the Series and Replacement Head number are the same as the original that came with the razor, the screens on this replacement head compress downward when shaving rather than remain rigid as the original Head did. did.</li>
    <li> Bought this one instead of 32S because the pictures showed the smart foil, irregular hole pattern instead of the hexagonal grid of oval holes.  My old Braun has these and it works great.  I get the package, open it up:  foil with oval holes.  Open it up figuring that at least I am getting a new foil, it will work better than the old one.  Not so much:  the foil is terrible.  Worse than the old one.  Cannot catch all the hair to cut and pulls more than any foil I have had for this razor.  After 15 minutes of fighting with this thing, pulled out my old Braun and wrapped up in no time.</li>
    <li> Great price; great delivery time!  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> it does everything smoothly and neatly that I expected...I only buy Braun electric razors,,,allother brands dont work well for me...</li>
    <li> fit my razor , does not seem to be as sharp as the original blades, dont think i will get as many shaves before needing to replace</li>
    <li> Keeps my shaver going thanks</li>
    <li> Work great and feel good on my skin. Cuts my facial hair without nicking. Easy to clean and easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Works really well and a good price.</li>
    <li> If you have the older silver style series 3 340 Braun shaver, this will not fit.  The entire design is different.  Apparently Braun (in their infinite wisdom) has multiple shaver designs named the \\&quot;series 3 340\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m not sure what sane manufacturer would do this...</li>
    <li> Not sure it made razor as effective when it was new but having difficult telling since husband has dementia</li>
    <li> Fits and works so well with the main body. In fact, it feels better than the original head unit that came with the Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> The correct replacement foil for the Braun 340s-4 shaver, per the instructions behind the clipper handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad that the first foil died within 7 months. The next shaver will have more power for faster shaves, but that&#x27;s a different review.</li>
    <li> Being able to replace the blade easily on this shaver every so often is a great idea.  This shaver gives a great shave, and when the blades wear out, I just buy another replacement head and keep going!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent and exactly what I expected. Arrived on time and not damaged. Very easy to fit and made me realise I should replace the foil more often.</li>
    <li> I received my new shaver head and it only lasted a couple of days before I started to have problems with it.  I contacted the seller through Amazon and they had a new one sent immediately.  I&#x27;m back to loving my Braun shaver again and want to say how GREAT the seller was!!!  I would heartily recommend these people for any and all your purchases.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and the price.</li>
    <li> So the foil on my current model decided to flake to pieces the other week, which is great if you like slicing your face up as you shave. On the front of my electric razor, it says \\&quot;Braun Series 3 340.\\&quot; So when I searched for replacement parts on Amazon, I stopped at the 32B and quickly ordered, on account of the desciption saying \\&quot;Compatible with Series 3 340.\\&quot; When I got the package and went to install it, I noticed it was way too wide and big to even fit on my model. When I flipped my razor over, it said \\&quot;Use replacement parts 30B.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...32B says it works with my model razor, but my model razor says only 30B will work. Does it really need to be this confusing? I&#x27;m sure the 32B kit is a fine product and works wonderfully (hence me not blasting it with a 1 star review simply for it not being what I was expecting), but it would be nice if Amazon updated the description of the product to save others from the $20 pitfall that I fell into.</li>
    <li> The replacement fits the razor and the order was filled quickly.</li>
    <li> Works just like the originals. No problems and easy to change out. Cut my tough beard easily</li>
    <li> This was the replacement I needed for my Braun razor. It was the correct model and works great. It also was cheaper than Wal-mart by several dollars!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and with no packaging issues.  A great value for the money and fits and works very well with my razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered Braun the 3Series 320S-4 Shaver on a Black Friday deal about 2 years ago.  Finally got around to ordering the replacement foil/cutter.  Amazon incorrectly suggests the 30B as the replacement for this shaver; this 32B is the correct one. (I&#x27;m told the 32S also fits, it&#x27;s silver (S) instead of black(B))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho - I didn&#x27;t notice the slow degradation of performance over the course of almost 2 years.  This was a direct swap, about a 30 second job.  Wow what a difference it makes!  Moving forward, I will make a point of changing this foil/cutter out more often.</li>
    <li> Online was the only place I could find replacement heads for my clean &amp; renew Braun shaver and Amazon had the best price and I have used them before for other products and was always happy with the prompt service.</li>
    <li> works great/  easy to install/  delvery was very quick/ instructions for repacement easy to understand/ everything eas in one package</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for a while now.  They&#x27;re a little more expensive than other brands, but they work well and last a long time.  This replacement pack is no different.  Well made, just like the one I took out of my shaver.</li>
    <li> Functionally this replacement works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment is that the color does not match the original 350cc and the tolerances  are not as tight. It works great though.</li>
    <li> Working  well. Thank You.</li>
    <li> The product shown in the picture was not the product that I received.  The 32B and 30B are not interchangeable.  That fact is obvious and shipping an obviously different item number from the one advertised is not very fair to the consumer. Additionally, I had to pay for the return for an item intentionally misrepresented. Amazon should have rules about this type of thing.</li>
    <li> Good, as described with a good price.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product a 1 star rating for its short time that it gave me a smooth excellent shave. I believe this is caused by the stainless steel blades that are used in this cutter head instead of carbon steel bales which hold blade sharpness much longer. I also have an older model Braun shaver, with carbon steel blades, which I am using daily, and I get a close smooth shave from it.</li>
    <li> Works like new.  The B on the 32B stands for Black.</li>
    <li> Product is good as described.</li>
    <li> This model Braun razor stinks compared to the last one I owned. The charge doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 shaves. I won&#x27;t be buying refills again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will end up going back to manual before I buy another refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d try your luck elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
    <li> This item was the best price and was just what I wanted.  Great for the price because that is why I bought it, Price</li>
    <li> I buy 2 of these for my husband every Xmas.  Amazon price is about 30% cheaper than Walmart.  The cleaning fluid is also available at the same savings.  Once again Amazon saved me money, gas, and time.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this Braun razor for years (not daily).  So glad to find an easy, economical source for replacement heads.  He is pleased!</li>
    <li> on time, no problems, thanks</li>
    <li> So much better than the dull old head...He is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This replacement shaver head was just what I needed as the old one was over 2 years old.  The price was the best part of this deal.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This product is simply an exact replacement for the original head. It&#x27;s fine!</li>
    <li> exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> I buy the razor 6 moth ago but when clean I missing some small part, I recomend clean softly with brush inclueded, any way I not open because still working perfect I will change when require</li>
    <li> Good price. It influenced my purchase of a new electric razor. Beware: you can&#x27;t always replace that head in a nearby store!</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutter were as advertised, fit perfectly and also functioned just as if it were a new razor.</li>
    <li> Great head for a great razor.</li>
    <li> Original equipment replacement part. Fits perfect and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I got this replacement head for my Dad&#x27;s razor, and the website make it easy to find the right one.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit, but it does!  My Dad is happy, I&#x27;m happy and the price was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, promptly delivered.</li>
    <li> The replacement head fit my Braun shaver and really made a difference to shave closer than the well-used head I&#x27;d been using for a couple of years</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Good delivery time.</li>
    <li> It is all that I expected.  A+ rating.&lt;br /&gt;Ray Kraemer</li>
    <li> Though the finish of this product is glossy and the OEM part was flat black, the fit is great and works like new :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not realize how poorly the original head was performing until I swapped this out. The old part actually had small plastic pieces breaking and falling out (around the spring-loaded mechanisms) and the foil began to crack. Along with some fresh &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; to clean and lubricate this shaver, I&#x27;m happy that this investment will continue to pay dividends.</li>
    <li> Hubby says this is GREAT!  He&#x27;s been using this shaver for years. The price is fantastic on Amazon.  The product is excellent - super close shave....his face is like a baby&#x27;s bottom. ;)  It&#x27;s great quality and lasts several months.  He shaves almost every day. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great and fit perfect</li>
    <li> Working just fine now.</li>
    <li> There is nothing surprising here, Braun  makes an excellent product and the quality of the replacement heads is consistent and first quality every time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best replacement blade systems I have ever used, so hopefully they don&#x27;t get discontinued.... Thanx Braun</li>
    <li> Very good turnaround time, and exactly what I needed at much less than local stores wanted. Expect to purchase again in 6 mos or so when it gets dull.</li>
    <li> reorderd right size and my mistake was corrected by vendor great taking back and sending correct size as soon as possible!!!</li>
    <li> Please, note that Braun&#x27;s website does not specify which razor are they suitable for.  Seems that all are compatible but I found they are not.  Thus, after checking the local stores where the prices were three times the AMZN charge, I ordered two for my 320 model and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> my husband been using braun  for years this series 3 is superior to the rest he has used in the past.  thank you olga hunn</li>
    <li> Nice, sharp, good to be back in business</li>
    <li> Just what I need at a good price.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is just like the original on my Braun Series 3 #340 shaver, except:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is shinier.&lt;br /&gt;It actually cuts my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to figure out which ones actually needed. Why would Braun name razors that use different replacement blades the same is beyond me. The blades worked well and give a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Great price along with fast service.</li>
    <li> Works just like a new one,  So far so good, this seems to be working just like the one that came with the razor.</li>
    <li> Yes, I like the product so far. It came with a silver rim compared to the black rim on the head replacement it had at time of purchase but It fits perfectly and works great for the price.</li>
    <li> After two we rubber of frame od the base of the cutter fell off..I have to be very care when I take it a part to clean it.so it does not fall off again. It does work well though.</li>
    <li> It was a new head for my shaver; thus, it did what it was supposed to do-no problems.  There was no problem with the order processing, delivery, etc.  All is well;.</li>
    <li> I was having problems finding this replacement head but found it thru Amazon.  I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun replacement razor head in the mail, I noticed it had already been opened, the seller had re-taped the box. I inspecting the Braun replacement Head it appeared to be new and never used. I tried the new replacement head and it was dull.I think I was sold a used electric razor replacement head, I will not buy anything from this seller again \\&quot;SunshineColdwater.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the original product, fast delivery, would recommend to anyone very, very good original spare parts braun taken Amazon</li>
    <li> Cheap Chinese knockoff.  Packaging was not in English. Item may look like the real thing but trust me IT IS NOT.  Foil heads catch and pull on facial hairs making shaving painful.  This never happens with real Braun replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Made a world of differrence on my razor. I love Braun.</li>
    <li> Just what I would have bought</li>
    <li> renewed it just like it was brand new</li>
    <li> So far, works the same as the previous head. No complaints.</li>
    <li> The replacement head works fine and arrived on time. Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> This was my second attempt to switch to an electric shaver from a blade and man am I glad I chose this one!  the wet/dry electric Braun is as good as a blade and better in many ways!  As to the replacement head, over the course of 18 months I spent much more than the cost of this head on shaving and pre-shaving things than I did this.  But the important thing is the quality of the shave. This razor, a tube of either Remington Shave gel or King of Shaves shave gel, my choice of after shave and I&#x27;m set.  Baby Butt Smooth face ever shave, no exception.&lt;br /&gt;From what I read electric shavers have improved so much there are several that are as good as this Braun and a few cheaper; but I don&#x27;t know if they last as long or are better. I have learned that the main thing is the RPM&#x27;s of the razor. This one has about 10-12 thousand RPM&#x27;s as opposed to Norelco&#x27;s entry leval one that has about 6 - 8 thousand RPM (which explains why I never got a decent shave with one.) so the higher the RPM the better and Panasonic has the most powerful shavers in that sense.  But they cost several hundred dollars too.  This Braun cost&#x27;s about $60 - 80 bucks and is solid as a rock!&lt;br /&gt;The change over is easy: Pop off the old head and pop on the new one and you are done! My shave is just like it was when my razor was brand new!  I&#x27;m just guessing that as my razor gets older the motor will start to slow down and the RPM&#x27;s will decrease and then the shave will suffer.  Then I buy a new razor.  But for now I&#x27;m happy and the replacement head works great!  I&#x27;m on blood thinners and can&#x27;t use a blade anymore anyway.  So I&#x27;m pretty happy with this.  My next one might be a higher powered Remington...we&#x27;ll see :)</li>
    <li> Just as described. Fast shipping. Recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> received promptly-fits razor-works ok</li>
    <li> Shipped as ordered and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I use the Braun razor and of course every so often the head needs replacement. Comes as a unit and fits right in place.</li>
    <li> A great purchase to keep a close shave.  The original wears down after a year and needs to be replaced by a replacement.</li>
    <li> HUSBADN VERY PLEASED WILL BUY AGAIN RECOMMENDED GREAT GIFT</li>
    <li> My Braun rechargeable razor has an led light that indicates when I should replace the shaving head. I took its recommendation and found this exact replacement, which was reasonably priced and fit perfectly. And works well.</li>
    <li> I tried to find this product in 4 different stores.  Finally, I ordered online and had in 2 days!  My father was thrilled to get the new blades for his razor!  I bought an extra one to give him for Christmas,</li>
    <li> This replacement head pack is exactly what I needed. I think it shaves better now than when it was new.</li>
    <li> This shaver head made my husband&#x27;s razor brand new again, without the expense of buying another full shaver.  It is perfect.</li>
    <li> Great way to extend the life of my shaver. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable and arrived within 2 days - very fast shipping.  Braun shavers have always worked best for me if I replace the blades more often than suggested.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Effective</li>
    <li> Exact replacement head</li>
    <li> Product is an exact replacement for original head. Hopefully it will last as long as the original.No issues at this time.</li>
    <li> Received replacement head pack on time, put it on and it performs well with no problem. Excellent product for the price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet (my shaver&#x27;s still new) but bought it as a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; to have on hand.  Looks like it will fit my shaver just fine. Decently priced, cheaper than buying at your local store.</li>
    <li> It fits and looks like the one that came with my razer.  It doesn&#x27;t quite cut like my original one though and doesn&#x27;t seem to be built as well. Foils pop out of place every once in a while.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is just the one I received though. A little overpriced considering the cost of the razer itself.</li>
    <li> It works fine for me@!  Good price. A little slow on delivery.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect including the price!</li>
    <li> Great Replacement and shipped very quickly.  Make sure to get the right one that fits your Razor there are a couple of different ones out there..</li>
    <li> This is a direct repacement for this shaver head. It is made by the shaver&#x27;s manufacturer and fits and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a factory replacement for my Braun Series 3 razor. Shipment is fast. This is the fourth time I&#x27;ve made this purchase in the last few years. Each time has been a brand new razor head in the factory package.</li>
