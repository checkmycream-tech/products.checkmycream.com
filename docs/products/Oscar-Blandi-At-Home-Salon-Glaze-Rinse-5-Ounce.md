### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Love !!!!!</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>This product is not that impressive.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best when it shines -</li>
      <li>It is a great boost for your hair in between getting it colored and done at a salon.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have found both items.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews, but this is an awesome product!  </li>
      <li>(I love the smell!)</li>
      <li>it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>I have since tried it one additional time and still pleased with results.</li>
      <li>I have had my hair glazed many times at the salon after a color treatment.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product but for some reason it dries my scalp</li>
      <li>Easy to use like a conditioner.</li>
      <li>and makes your hair have that silky and strong feel that glaze does.</li>
      <li>As any girl with fine hair knows this spells hair</li>
      <li>I fully recommend this to anybody with fine hair looking for some shine and lift.</li>
      <li>I always thought it was just the technique of my stylist that made made my hair look  salon styled, but I have to say this product will give  you a fighting chance  to compete for the same salon look because of its great smoothing capabilites.</li>
      <li>quick and easy to use instead of paying $25 to have done at a salon.  </li>
      <li>I was sold that this was something I had to have for any special days or nights out.</li>
      <li>What this product will  do for you is give you a salon look for a special occasion....</li>
      <li>This is eqaully as good with same results.</li>
      <li>This product looks good on my blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Not a bad product for the price.  </li>
      <li>I love the effect on my hair, leaving it shinny, silky and smooth especially after I iron it.</li>
      <li>originally tried this product as a sample, but after SEVERAL compliments on my hair: &amp;#34;so shiny, so healthy, so pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>You should use a lot, just as much as someone would use in a salon to get the full effect.</li>
      <li>a ton!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a mirror quickly after and started examining my hair and it felt and looks so much healthier.</li>
      <li>(equal parts/lil more) with my conditioner/hair mask &amp; leave it on for 7-10m &amp; rinse</li>
      <li>and I am, for the first time in my life, experiencing frizz-free shiny hair without compromising any curl.  </li>
      <li>I was actually really amazed with the difference!</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>This product lives up to the hype - but not for everyday day use - as I think it works best when I towel dry my waist length hair &amp; mix it</li>
      <li>It really made my hair shine after the first use.</li>
      <li>Like the product although no startlingly super shinny hair (not expected), hair does feel better, looks better.</li>
      <li>The next day, I went to the lake and caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror and noticed immediately how much shinier my hair looked and that my blonde highlights looked super lustrous, bright blonde, and like I had just gotten them done</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have much time to pay attention.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a shine really.</li>
      <li>So much hair started falling off in clumps.</li>
      <li>I use a combination of products, but adding this to my shampoo-and conditioner routine really plumps up my hair  without losing the curl.</li>
      <li>very thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>It looks so much healthier and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As most folks with curly hair know, shine is not something that goes hand and hand with curls due to the texture of the hair.  </li>
      <li>Its important to follow instructions and make sure hair is towel dried prior to application.</li>
      <li>but does a decent job of &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; the hair color in.  </li>
      <li>wow!!  </li>
      <li>but I am willing o use it as necessary for those specail hair events.  </li>
      <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t tell much of a different with this product.</li>
      <li>I live in a busy city, with plenty of wind and pollution and humid conditions.</li>
      <li>My hair tends to be really dry and frizzy and dull, but this really brought some amazing life to my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a product I will certainly continue to use over and over again to bring back life to my hair!</li>
      <li>will stay using the Fekkai \\&quot;Salon Glaze\\&quot; - Clear Shine Rinse.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it will last for many washings ...</li>
      <li>Was hoping for more noticeable shine and body, but I have been able to achieve the same results with less expensive items.</li>

<li> Unfortunately, this is not a product that works well in my hair.  </li>
<li> I was not  looking for a product that was trying to convince me of  unrealistic results for an extended period of time.</li>

<li> VERY SCARY.</li>
<li> Very, very disappointed with this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My  hair is fine, thin, dry and permed. I use a combination of products, but adding this to my shampoo-and conditioner routine really plumps up my hair  without losing the curl.</li>
    <li> Like the product although no startlingly super shinny hair (not expected), hair does feel better, looks better. I mix it 1/2 &amp; 1/2 with my conditioner</li>
    <li> This product is not that impressive.  Was hoping for more noticeable shine and body, but I have been able to achieve the same results with less expensive items. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I got this product after getting a glaze done at the salon.  It definitely adds shine to your hair.  I mix it with my conditioner and use it that way.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at the chalky, not sleek, feel of this product and will never waste my money again on this.&lt;br /&gt;I will stay using the Fekkai \\&quot;Salon Glaze\\&quot; - Clear Shine Rinse.</li>
    <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t tell much of a different with this product. I let my hair air-dry and ran out the door in a hurry so I didn&#x27;t have much time to pay attention. The next day, I went to the lake and caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror and noticed immediately how much shinier my hair looked and that my blonde highlights looked super lustrous, bright blonde, and like I had just gotten them done even though its been months and they&#x27;ve already grown out a ton!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a mirror quickly after and started examining my hair and it felt and looks so much healthier. I was actually really amazed with the difference! My hair tends to be really dry and frizzy and dull, but this really brought some amazing life to my hair. I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with it and looking at it i the mirror! It looks so much healthier and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I will certainly continue to use over and over again to bring back life to my hair! I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived with out it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair. I love the effect on my hair, leaving it shinny, silky and smooth especially after I iron it.</li>
    <li> Very, very disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It did not add any shine and made my hair feel less clean.&lt;br /&gt;A total waste of $25.00!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product but for some reason it dries my scalp</li>
    <li> Not a bad product for the price.  Cheaper than salon quality glaze but does a decent job of &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; the hair color in.  Hair was softer after use as I have very thick, slightly wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a shine really. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love !!!!! I have had my hair glazed many times at the salon after a color treatment. This is eqaully as good with same results. I always thought it was just the technique of my stylist that made made my hair look  salon styled, but I have to say this product will give  you a fighting chance  to compete for the same salon look because of its great smoothing capabilites.

What this product will  do for you is give you a salon look for a special occasion.... Not sure if it will last for many washings ...but I am willing o use it as necessary for those specail hair events.  I will buy again and and will tell all of my friends to try it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Recommended to others!</li>
    <li> wow!!  I rarely write reviews, but this is an awesome product!  It has changed how I style my curly hair.  Tames frizzies and actually gives me some shine.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> As most folks with curly hair know, shine is not something that goes hand and hand with curls due to the texture of the hair.  However, I&#x27;ve been putting a few drops of this glaze rinse in with my Ouidad climate control defrizzing conditioner each time I shower and I am, for the first time in my life, experiencing frizz-free shiny hair without compromising any curl.  I am so happy to have found both items.</li>
    <li> I have white hair that looks it&#x27;s best when it shines - this glaze rinse did the trick. Easy to use like a conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the hype - but not for everyday day use - as I think it works best when I towel dry my waist length hair &amp; mix it (equal parts/lil more) with my conditioner/hair mask &amp; leave it on for 7-10m &amp; rinse very thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Well....this worked for me -so definitely recommend but I&#x27;m knocking off a star as it&#x27;s a lil too pricey!!!</li>
    <li> My hair starting FALLING OUT in masses using this product. VERY SCARY. Will never use again.  So much hair started falling off in clumps. I&#x27;m in shock and extremely stressed after using this.  I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER use this product again!</li>
    <li> very disappointed with this product.Never again! It did not deliver any shine whats so ever. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> quick and easy to use instead of paying $25 to have done at a salon.  Takes me minutes instead of an hour.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is not a product that works well in my hair.  I&#x27;ll continue to get shine from argan or moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> I live in a busy city, with plenty of wind and pollution and humid conditions. As any girl with fine hair knows this spells hair disaster.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I use this product (according to the directions), my hair stays lighter and more voluminous all day, and doesn&#x27;t get weighed down or dirty looking as it tends to as the day goes on. I fully recommend this to anybody with fine hair looking for some shine and lift.</li>
    <li> originally tried this product as a sample, but after SEVERAL compliments on my hair: &amp;#34;so shiny, so healthy, so pretty&amp;#34;. I was sold that this was something I had to have for any special days or nights out.</li>
    <li> I like this. It really made my hair shine after the first use. I have since tried it one additional time and still pleased with results. Suggested usage - to mix with regular conditioner after shampoo to maintain shine. Also I&#x27;ve tried one other glaze in the past that i didnt like, however I think I used it wrong. Its important to follow instructions and make sure hair is towel dried prior to application.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It is a great boost for your hair in between getting it colored and done at a salon. It smells just like the glaze at a salon (I love the smell!) and makes your hair have that silky and strong feel that glaze does. You should use a lot, just as much as someone would use in a salon to get the full effect.</li>
    <li> This product looks good on my blonde hair. shines! However, it was shipped in a very thin padded mailer and had leaked during shipment. Needed a small box or extra wrapping.</li>
