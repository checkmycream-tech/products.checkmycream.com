      <li>I love the results.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>The smell is quite overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Conditioner is OK.</li>
      <li>but I dont love them.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I like the smell and the curls that this shampoo helps create, but I wish it lathered more.</li>

      <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I still use Wen, but it is nice to have something on hand that is inexpensive, smells good, and makes my hair feel as soft as Wen does.</li>
      <li>Great product, quick shipping &amp; easy transaction -- Thanks!</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner works great on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is more like a creamy conditioner than shampoo and didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was clean.</li>
      <li>Never quite sure my hair got clean.  </li>
      <li>it arrived quickly!  </li>
      <li>it is pricey but worth every penny of it!</li>
      <li>Both of these products leave my hair, clean, manageable and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>I do not believe these are TRUE Redkin products.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair that has a mind of its own.  </li>
      <li>Smell isnt a factor unless you are sensitive to that kind of thing.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner are nice and all, but they didn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as I&#x27;d have liked and were still harsh on my bright red dye.</li>
      <li>Funny thing is that my hair was not as smooth as the samples my hairstylist gave me.</li>
      <li>Just don’t think these products are worth the luxury price.</li>
      <li>and it was overwhelming for me to keep it soft, shining and non-frizzy.</li>
      <li>It is one of the better sulfate free shampoos that I truly like next to Wen.</li>
      <li>it is like a fresh perm.</li>
      <li>the fact that it keeps my curly hair in check is totally worth the dealing with the  scent.</li>
      <li>Shampoo is said to be low suds, more like no suds.  </li>
      <li>(that Suave compares to Redken), and the price is much cheaper too!</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product from Hair Cuttery</li>
      <li>I am not completly out of my first bottles of shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT, AT THE BEAUTY SHOP.</li>
      <li>I have tried many shampoos and conditioners, but none that give the lasting results I get with Redken products.</li>
      <li>Firstly, I don’t like its fragrance.</li>
      <li>Used other Redken Shampoo and liked</li>
      <li>Will recommend to everyone who has dry and frizzy hair, whether its curly or not :)</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair with enough body that I can run my fingers through it to remove tangles easily.</li>
      <li>It was much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
      <li>My mother and other well-meaning people used always to tell me how many people wished they had curly hair, and got permanents to curl their hair.</li>
      <li>It had minimal lather like it advertised and seemed to clean my hair pretty well.</li>
      <li>I used it the first time and thought that store brands I had tried in the past worked better.</li>
      <li>The manufacturers state that its formula includes particularly helpful Moringa oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make your hair curly, but it does make it very soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had particularly wavy or curly hair and with this whatever natural kinks and waves</li>
      <li>Finally, I have found it just doesn’t hold long enough: I am lucky if it holds for a full day.</li>
      <li>Other than that it smells clean and I like that.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and these are products that my hairdresser uses.</li>
      <li>but the scent is rather masculine.  </li>
      <li>Even in humid weather, my hair remains soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>After using this product my curls are bouncy and soft.</li>
      <li>have regretted my curly frizzy hair all my life, and have spent many hours and dollars in various beauty salons trying to get it straightened, with results that included horrendously dry hair with breakage and oxidation.</li>
      <li>But here in North Carolina, the American South, with long hot humid summers, as a young woman no longer, I decided the time had come to try to make my peace with the hair with which I was born.</li>
      <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because my hair is soft and somewhat fine; this shampoo and conditioner seems to make my hair hard.</li>
      <li>I actually couldn&#x27;t believe how soft, shiny and non-frizzy</li>
      <li>So over the last few years, I have tried many products to try to preserve my small curls and prevent frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hairdresser suggested I try this product for my hair.  I have thin, straight hair that is cut into a chin-length bob.  The volume that this shampoo and conditioner provides is amazing.  My hair holds it&#x27;s shape now, without needing any additional products.  It&#x27;s made for curly hair, but works fantastically for hair that needs some bounce and lift.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I have dry curly thin hair and it was overwhelming for me to keep it soft, shining and non-frizzy. I tried both shampoo and the conditioner (the shampoo doesn&#x27;t have a lot of foam so don&#x27;t freak out, it&#x27;s actually better for your hair) and it worked perfectly the very first time I tried. I actually couldn&#x27;t believe how soft, shiny and non-frizzy my hair became! It doesn&#x27;t fade away in 24hrs neither. I tried a variety of products including expensive ones, it was such a waste of money. If you are unsure of the shampoo, the conditioner still helps a lot but as a duo it is just great. Will recommend to everyone who has dry and frizzy hair, whether its curly or not :)</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I will order it again.  It was much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
    <li> Redken Curvaceous Shampoo 10.1oz and Conditioner 8.5oz Duo Pack. This duo, by the respected haircare company of Redken,  is intended for unisex daily use, for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair that needs to be tamed and elongated, for users wishing for loose waves to spiral curls.

My mother and other well-meaning people used always to tell me how many people wished they had curly hair, and got permanents to curl their hair. I looked – politely, I hope—disbelieving. But here in North Carolina, the American South, with long hot humid summers, as a young woman no longer, I decided the time had come to try to make my peace with the hair with which I was born. So over the last few years, I have tried many products to try to preserve my small curls and prevent frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this eye-catching Redken duo of beauty aids for curly hair,  I remembered the hair salons I had favored that had used Redken products and decided to try it: the duo, plus the Redken mousse, in fact.

Then, I find that, though this trio of products does give me the small curls I want in my hair, my hair is not as shiny as some other products have made it. Finally, I have found it just doesn’t hold long enough: I am lucky if it holds for a full day. I find the results of this Redken product no different than any mass market conditioner I have tried in my never-ending quest to tame my wild and curly hair. Just don’t think these products are worth the luxury price.</li>
    <li> Redken products are wonderful. I have tried many shampoos and conditioners, but none that give the lasting results I get with Redken products. Even in humid weather, my hair remains soft and manageable. I love the results.</li>
    <li> The product does make my curls stay intact, but these products weigh my hair down. I didn&#x27;t heed the warnings about this product smelling like men&#x27;s aftershave, but it does! The smell is quite overwhelming. I prefer Suave&#x27;s curly shampoo and conditioner (that Suave compares to Redken), and the price is much cheaper too!</li>
    <li> but the scent is rather masculine.  like cologne.  the fact that it keeps my curly hair in check is totally worth the dealing with the  scent. it arrived quickly!  THank you!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner they make your hair feel so good !&lt;br /&gt;I leave the conditioner on longer than recommended because the benefits is phenomenal it is like a fresh perm. I am a women of color.</li>
    <li> This smells so good. It doesn&#x27;t really make your hair curly, but it does make it very soft. It is one of the better sulfate free shampoos that I truly like next to Wen. I have used Wen for two years and wanted something different. So I bought this. I still use Wen, but it is nice to have something on hand that is inexpensive, smells good, and makes my hair feel as soft as Wen does. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product work wonders and makes my hair curly.  I love it it is pricey but worth every penny of it!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is said to be low suds, more like no suds.  Never quite sure my hair got clean.  Conditioner is OK.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair, seems the color last a little longer</li>
    <li> I have struggled with thick, curly and frizzy hair for 50 years! I don&#x27;t mind paying good money for a good product. I researched shampoos and conditioners for curly hair and this Redken came up as a good product to use. I used it the first time and thought that store brands I had tried in the past worked better. I figured I needed to use it for some time before judging it too harshly. I finished out the bottles and still feel the same way. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Didin&#x27;t like the smell, did not help the curls in hair, made them frizzy. Would not recommend the product. Used other Redken Shampoo and liked</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product from Hair Cuttery and I love it. I have Curly hair that is mid back length hair and this size bottle of poduct lasts me almost 5 months. I am not completly out of my first bottles of shampoo and conditioner but I wanted to get the replacement before I did run out. I love this stuff. I keeps my hair tame. I have tried may products to help my friz and this stuff does it and ofcourse getting it trimmed every 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> The smell was what I didn&#x27;t like about this product. It had minimal lather like it advertised and seemed to clean my hair pretty well.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Not impressed. My hair gets greasy faster than with other shampoo/conditioners with little noticeble improvement over other brands. Smell isnt a factor unless you are sensitive to that kind of thing. They&#x27;re okay but I dont love them.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is more like a creamy conditioner than shampoo and didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was clean. The conditioner was okay, but I&#x27;ve used better. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipping &amp; easy transaction -- Thanks!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are nice and all, but they didn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as I&#x27;d have liked and were still harsh on my bright red dye. I loved the texture my hair took on with this product however. I&#x27;ve never had particularly wavy or curly hair and with this whatever natural kinks and waves I do have survived the wash and looked wonderful. I just wish this product was color-friendly.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner works great on my naturally curly hair.  Leaves my hair with enough body that I can run my fingers through it to remove tangles easily.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner.  I live in tucson, where the water is hard on your hair.  Both of these products leave my hair, clean, manageable and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> GREAT product at a WONDERFUL price!!!  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This Redken Curvaceous product was recommended to be by my hair stylist after I had a perm. After using this product my curls are bouncy and soft. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO + CONDITIONER. IT COST A LOT MORE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT, AT THE BEAUTY SHOP. NOW I CAN STILL BUY IT, FROM YOU + SAVE MONEY. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> A nice sulfate free option that rinses out nicely.  I bought this because I thought it would help add/enhance the waviness of my hair, but it did not make anything curvier.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE: I do not believe these are TRUE Redkin products. Bought from Amazon to save $. Compared what I just purchased from my salon and there is a slight difference in the smell.  Funny thing is that my hair was not as smooth as the samples my hairstylist gave me. She also told me that Redkin only sells to salons.  Not sure what&#x27;s going on with Amazon but if you buy you will be disappointed as I was.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and these are products that my hairdresser uses. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because my hair is soft and somewhat fine; this shampoo and conditioner seems to make my hair hard. After I put in my leave in treatment some of the hardness goes away. Other than that it smells clean and I like that. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the curls that this shampoo helps create, but I wish it lathered more.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair that has a mind of its own.  These products help enhance the curl and make styling easier.</li>
    <li> No problems at all. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love these hair products!</li>
