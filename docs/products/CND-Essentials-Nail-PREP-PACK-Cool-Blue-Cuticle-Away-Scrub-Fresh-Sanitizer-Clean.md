      <li>I love the Scrub Fresh and Cuticle Away - haven&#x27;t used the Sanitizer much.</li>
      <li>Scrub Fresh is used to remove any oils and moisture from the nail before applying CND polish, Shellac, or any enhancements.</li>
      <li>this stuff gives the process a boost and is worth it.  </li>

      <li>Cool Blue is used to sanitize the hands or feet.</li>
      <li>The only nail prep kit i&#x27;ll ever use on my clients, will order more in the future!</li>
      <li>That was the main reason I purchased these.  </li>
      <li>The Cuticle Away is much gentler than other cuticle gels/removers I have used (e.g. Sally Hansen), and seems to have a bit more of an oil in its base that loosens the cuticle more effectively.</li>
      <li>New.</li>
      <li>The cool blue leaves my hands feeling clean without excessively drying them out-</li>
      <li>Be careful to not put the Scrub Fresh on wood.  </li>
      <li>No other issues.  </li>
      <li>Before using these 3 products prior to my shellac manicure, I would always have 1 or 2 nails with a small chip within 2 weeks which I would repair easy enough.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A really good set, goes with a bag. I use all of the bottles every time I do my nails.</li>
    <li> New. Came in about a week. I gave it four stars because I only use one item out of the three.</li>
    <li> All three of these products work great. Cool Blue is used to sanitize the hands or feet. Cuticle Away allows you to easily remove the cuticles without soaking the hands. Scrub Fresh is used to remove any oils and moisture from the nail before applying CND polish, Shellac, or any enhancements. These steps are important in the nail prep to ensure you get the amount of wear Shellac claims (14 days).</li>
    <li> I usually purchase my nail stuff at a close by shop but they have not had the cuticle remover the past few times. SOOO I purchased this package online. I received the items very quickly and everything is still up to date for another year. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The cuticle remover works really great. It totally did it&#x27;s job, but the other 2, I could have taken or left them. I didn&#x27;t see much benefit to either of those.</li>
    <li> I love CND !The only nail prep kit i&#x27;ll ever use on my clients, will order more in the future!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this combo pack! Remember, sanitation is EVERYTHING! This pack gives you all you need to keep it clean when doing nails or in the salon. The cool blue leaves my hands feeling clean without excessively drying them out- big plus! I really like the Scrub Fresh too.</li>
    <li> awesome product and shipping was really fast i was hoping i got the green zipper case which i did so excited and satisfied with this LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;GOING TO BUY THIS WHENEVER I RUN OUT OF FIRST PURCHASE WHICH WAS THIS</li>
    <li> I love the Scrub Fresh and Cuticle Away - haven&#x27;t used the Sanitizer much.

    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
    <li> Ha,,,,got the hang of it right away and really works good.</li>
    <li> I do my own shellacking at home to my toes and fingers.  I bought this as I needed more cuticle remover, so why not try the CND kit.  This kit was reasonably priced and the scrub is supposed to be good.  Before using these 3 products prior to my shellac manicure, I would always have 1 or 2 nails with a small chip within 2 weeks which I would repair easy enough.  Now that I use the disinfectant and scrub I have not had 1 chip.  I keep my shellac on my fingers for about 3 weeks, and toes a month.  this stuff gives the process a boost and is worth it.  The cuticle remover is good too.</li>
    <li> Be careful to not put the Scrub Fresh on wood.  It will eat right through it.  No other issues.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed that the items did not come with the clear plastic bag as shown on the website.  That was the main reason I purchased these.  I thought these packs would be convenient for traveling. Other reviews do not mention this so I am assuming that it was just an oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my order of two of these Prep packs, and was dismayed that one of the hand sanitizers bottles oozed out quite a bit of fluid, because the lid was loose.  The good thing is that hand sanitizer does not make much of a mess, but still ....</li>
    <li> Thank you!!! I like it</li>
