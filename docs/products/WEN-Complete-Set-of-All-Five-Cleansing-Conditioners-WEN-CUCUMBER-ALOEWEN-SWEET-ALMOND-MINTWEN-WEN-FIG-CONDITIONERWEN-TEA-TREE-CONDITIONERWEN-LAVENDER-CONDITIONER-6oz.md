      <li>This is the best hair product out there.  </li>
      <li>I bought the 5 samples-size to see which would smell the best, and do the best for my hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!  </li>
      <li>and it worked out perfectly...</li>
      <li>I do NOT use the amount of pumps suggested and have had perfect results.  </li>
      <li>Found that I like the fig the best after using all 5.  </li>
      <li>I was very impressed this time.  </li>
      <li>and I was moderately impressed.  </li>

      <li>Excellent way to try each flavor of shampoo to determine which one works best with your hair type.</li>
      <li>Amazon is the perfect place to buy without the auto shipment commitment from the Wen website.     </li>

      <li>The lavender and the cucumber aloe are also good, but not as good as the mint.     </li>
      <li>And I also do not use the recommended amount and still have  good results.</li>
      <li>I am in love with the wen hair care cleansing conditioners and this is a great way to find your preference.</li>

      <li>I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke!</li>
      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>And I am so glad that I did!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I LOVE the stick balm and don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it!)</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly an amazing product.</li>
      <li>I have tried thousands of hair care products and wen hair care is amazing.</li>
      <li>but it is amazing.</li>
      <li>My own fault, I didn&#x27;t read.  </li>
      <li>The order came timely and was packaged nice.</li>
      <li>My mom noticed how nice my hair looked and couldn&#x27;t believe it was mine.  </li>
      <li>and I am thrilled.</li>
      <li>People have been commenting on how nice my hair looks</li>
      <li>However, if you have more body, texture, and if your hair that can handle more oils and weighty products it may work great for you.</li>
      <li>the tea tree one (wich by the way my husband liked).  </li>
      <li>It turns out that the product doesn&#x27;t work any better than using a good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and it was nice, but I found that it was just okay.  </li>
      <li>Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair.</li>
      <li>Performs amazingly well on thinning, fine or medium textured hair adding volume and body.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>I love all 5 types of wen cleanser/conditioners.  </li>
      <li>friends don&#x27;t let friends use shampoo :-)  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Disappointed in myself for not reading the product details more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>From now on, I would order probably just the mint, but I&#x27;m glad I tried them all.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I would like but love when I do.  </li>
      <li>I personally like the Aloe and Cucumber the best.  </li>
      <li>so I went to ask my husband if he could tell by touching it.</li>
      <li>did not make the texture of my hair any better than drugstore brands.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I still like Wen, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stand-alone product, but better used in a rotation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d still like a bit more moisture, but that could be just me.     </li>
      <li>althoug it is healthy.  </li>
      <li>(sexy).      </li>
      <li>and my hair needed to be washed MORE often than before.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m glad i got this set.</li>
      <li>for me the lavender works best but the cucumber aloe is a close second.  </li>
      <li>and I have tangle free hair, which has always been a problem for me!  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and the tingle on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>All of them also smell fantastic!</li>
      <li>Hope it helps someone! :-)</li>
      <li>The longer you use WEN, the better the results.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice scent, and I did enjoy the scalp-tingling menthol.  </li>
      <li>We ALL *love* it.  </li>
      <li>I use salon products, mostly Redken, Biolage, Aveda and some Aquage.</li>
      <li>I do love wen products</li>
      <li>, you can better determine which one work well on your hair.</li>
      <li>Interesting combination of &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>After searching online for the product, I saw this set and thought that it might be better to be able to determine which actual product would work best for my hair and which scent I actually like best.  </li>
      <li>Love the set.  </li>
      <li>But I enjoy trying all of them and then picking the one I like the best to buy in a larger size.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of wen Hair care but the product I was sent was not working quite right for my hair type.</li>
      <li>And... I must say, it looks wonderful, feels soft, and very shiny.   </li>
      <li>I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it.</li>
      <li>I have fine thinner hair</li>
      <li>It works very well &amp; I plan on ordering more!</li>
      <li>My hair always looks so healthy after using it, even the first time!  </li>
      <li>I decided to try the product, but didn&#x27;t want a huge amount just in case</li>
      <li>I wanted to sample all that was available</li>
      <li>These are a great alternative to traditional shampoo.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you want to try this product before committing to the automated shipment method, I suggest purchasing this sample pack. My wife&#x27;s hair looks, feels, and smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Tea Trea as directed for one month now.  I&#x27;m still trying to decide how much I like it.  It has made my hair very shiny, but alsmost greasy looking sometimes, although when i touch it, it isn&#x27;t greasy.  I have washed my hair with regular shampoo once because it seemed weighed down.  I generally like the product so far though.</li>
    <li> I believe this is the REAL WEN but my daughter ask about it...........it was a gift to her from me.  She said she read where Wen had been duplicated and sold as Wen when it wasn&#x27;t.  I have no idea what to say about this product since it was a gift to her and she doesn&#x27;t know if its real or not. The order came timely and was packaged nice. I would order from this company again unless I heard differently fromothers.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the wen hair care cleansing conditioners and this is a great way to find your preference. I gave 2 to a friend as a gift and use the other three on different days. The fragrances are strong, but go away after rinsing (or at least are less powerful). I do NOT use the amount of pumps suggested and have had perfect results.  I did have to play around with the number of pumps but have settled on 5-7 depending on how long between shampoos. My hair is long and fine.</li>
    <li> This is not my first experience with WEN hair products.  I have been using the sweet almond mint and decided I wanted to try all of the products without buying the full sized products.  I really like WEN-my hair is softer and shinier than it has ever been and I have tangle free hair, which has always been a problem for me!  I have used all of the different conditioners and for me, the tea tree oil is a bit heavier than the rest of the conditioners, so I probably won&#x27;t order any more of that particular one, but I really like the rest of them, with the original almond mint being my favorite.  I did not give it 5 stars because the products do weigh your hair down more than other conditioners, but your hair will be in better condition overall, so it is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I have sort of Irish wavy hair with nappy sections around my face and I&#x27;ve been at a complete loss as to how to deal with and handle it.  It&#x27;s not curly enough to do anything with it and so I&#x27;ve ben blowing it dry straight and using a flat iron.  I finally decided to take the plunge and get the Wen 5 pack to try it out and I gave a few out to my family for Christmas.  We ALL *love* it.  My hair has never looked better!  I&#x27;m so pleased and satisfied that I have actually been wearing my hair in its natural state... blow drying it on low and using a comb only (as Chaz recommends combs)-- it is so full of body now and so much less frizzy.  The frizz is almost all gone.  People have been commenting on how nice my hair looks now-- people I didn&#x27;t tell about the Wen before I started using it.  I love the smell and the tingle on my scalp.  I went ahead and bought the complete set (Fig) and love all of the products.  Thank you, Wen!!!! (P.S.  I LOVE the stick balm and don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it!)</li>
    <li> I love all 5 types of wen cleanser/conditioners.  I mix them all together in small containers for travel.  I have shampoo and conditioner all in one small bottle, perfect for travel.  All 5 types have great advantages for my hair, so mixing them all together seemed like a good idea.  I couldn&#x27;t pick just one over the others.  I have the best of all 5 now for my hair.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews &amp; all the hype from the television, I took my chances and bought this set. First disappointment, it has menthol in it! Yuck! I smelled it right away. And when you shower the heat from the water makes it ten times worse. It made my eyes water, it was like rubbing that stuff for colds all over my head. Great, if you have a cold &amp; need your sinuses opened. I thought it did an ok job conditioning my hair, so I decided to try to put up with the menthol , at least until I ran out anyways. These costed so much. they claim to clean as well, but they don&#x27;t. After a week or so, I got zits on my scalp that took forever to go away. I used the recommended directions of a full 20 pumps each use, ( which is insane), using that amount each time makes them run out very quickly, at this high price, you&#x27;re much better off buying a seperate shampoo &amp; conditioner. This is no better than Pan-tene restoratives, which works great and costs only $4 or so a bottle. Ive tried tons of expensive salon conditioners and so far, not many are better than the pantene brand. So save yourself a bunch of money. Don&#x27;t buy the HYPE.</li>
    <li> This is my third straight month using Wen only and I&#x27;m hooked!  My hair type is oily (scalp), stick-straight, fine and as of the past two years thinning.  Due to the thinning I&#x27;d noticed that the quality of my hair had deteriorated. I was cautious about using something new not to mention skeptical about a \\&quot;condition only\\&quot; shampoo but was desperate to mend the breakage. To my surprise, I didn&#x27;t experience an oily weighed down look or feel(I follow the directions exactly) nor have I felt the need to use another shampoo in between. Although not totally mended, my hair does appear much healthier.  To date I have only used the Cucumber Aloe along with the Tea Tree oil on my scalp but this time I decided to use the suggestions given for thinning hair and try the Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner for my scalp and the Sweet Almond Mint on the ends.  I&#x27;ve all but given up on ANY product fixing the thinning but I&#x27;ll update if there is any noticeable difference.  Regardless, I am happy with the progress I&#x27;ve already experienced and plan to use the Wen products from now on.</li>
    <li> did not make the texture of my hair any better than drugstore brands.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lavender Cleansing Conditioner for about a month and still working on getting the right method down, but it is worth the effort.  I absolutely love the smell and feel of the Lavender, but wanted to check the other options out to see if my hair liked any of the other any better. The smell test result:  Fig - YUCK!  Like cough syrup gone bad, don&#x27;t know if I can even put this one in the shower, Cucumber Aloe and Almond Mint are both lightly scented and OK, Tea Tree is strongly scented with the essential oil, but I really like Tea Tree scent so it is a hit with me, and of course, the Lavender is still yummy.  It was worth it to check out all of the products so I know I can order larger sizes without worry.    I have long, slightly wavy medium texture hair, but with some real kinky sections at the back of my crown which drive me crazy. I have to blow dry my hair or it is a wavy, kinky mess.  I would like to wash my hair every other day so that I can minimize the dryer damage but have a problem with dents in the back from my nighttime ponytail.  (I cannot leave it out or I have a cat on my head all night long, revelling in it.) I read on the Wen site that I could put a little cleansing conditioner plus styling creme into a spray bottle filled with water and spritz it on my hair to revive it the next day, so I am buying some of the styling creme today.  Fingers crossed.    I am still not completely sold on the product, but the theory behind it makes a lot of sense and I will keep working on it until I figure it out.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Will never go back to normal shampoo. Not what I expected though. Wish it was the bottles. Next time im ordering the bigger bottles</li>
    <li> I love this product and these sizes are perfect for traveling.  I never am without this product either at home or on the road.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had time to use the Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner.  Feels strange, in a good way, not following shampooing with a separate application of a conditioner!  With Wen you get the same result, but in less time.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife, who found this on an info-mercial.   Amazon is the perfect place to buy without the auto shipment commitment from the Wen website.     My wife uses these products every THREE days and LOVES her hair.  And... I must say, it looks wonderful, feels soft, and very shiny.   Her hair is fine and naturally red..(sexy).      Thanks,  Gordon</li>
    <li> I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it. My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair. About a 3-4 weeks into using the product, I noticed clumps and clumps of hair clogging the drain. The same thing happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me (I used the almond one and used the cucumber one). We&#x27;re both white, she&#x27;s a brunette and I&#x27;m a redhead.  She and I have very different hair types as well.  We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets. etc. Wen is what we had in common.  I lost about 1/3 the thickness of my hair; I was devastated. I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off. I quit using it and though my hair stopped falling out, my hair is not the same. Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  When I part my hair, I still have the halo affect of short strands of hair sticking up and they&#x27;re not new hair, it&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s still breaking off.  I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke! Now, it snaps at the lightest pull. Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have. I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc. It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence and I have seen from other customer reviews on the web that this same thing has happened to other people.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the very first time today. I ordered the introductory package(4-6 oz bottles) for $40.95 at QVC. With the amt of cleanser I used (20% of bottle for 8-10 pumps each top, nape, ends), I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll probably not repurchase. I have fine thinner hair and I thought that perhaps it would feel weighed down; it didn&#x27;t. It is soft and not flyaway although I feel it has a bit of a waxy finish. On the other hand, because you really have to work it through for the shower and then leave-in, I lost twice the amount of hair in the drain. That does not make me happy. I&#x27;m hoping that it only happens the 1st time and the instructions say you can go 2-3 days per washing. We&#x27;ll see and I&#x27;ll update when the bottle is used up and again using the other formulas: fig, cucumber-aloe, and tea tree. Hair looks good on second day but feels dry.UPDATE:*** The same thing happened on the second washing. I&#x27;m almost afraid to use it again.</li>
    <li> This is the set that I would recommend if anyone would like to give WEN hair product a try. It come with all version and you could try it every time you wash your hair, you can better determine which one work well on your hair. You have to feel silky smooth, not too oily and not want to wash out at the end of the day. I found the one I like and I no need to wash my hair that often, other words&#x3D; wash whenever I want LOL :)</li>
    <li> i wanted to try WEN hair care but i&#x27;m glad i was cautious and got the set so that i could try all of the different cleansing conditioners.  everyone has different hair and so needs different products.  for me the lavender works best but the cucumber aloe is a close second.  sweet almond mint is a little bit heavy for my hair and the fig would be a \\&quot;no way.\\&quot;  the tea tree has actually worked very well for my mother who has thinning hair and dry scalp.  all in all i&#x27;m glad i got this set.</li>
    <li> I almost hate that I love this product because it is quite expensive.  I have very long black hair, hangs down to the derrier.  The ends were so damaged: dry, frizzy, split-ends - a complete rat&#x27;s nest.  I was always so amazed that I had any hair left on my head after brushing.  One day I got sucked in to the info-mercial and bought the sampler set.  I&#x27;ve used this for a week now and my hair is practically transformed.  When was the last time I was able to COMB my hair?  Even after a whole day at work, when I don&#x27;t even touch my hair, I can come home and comb my hair and hardly any hair is pulled out.  My hair seems even longer now that it actually hangs straight.  Wow!  I am sold!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the original scarecrow when it comes to dry hair. Mostly my ends are bad, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that make my frizzy hair more manageable. I also have a dry itchy scalp, so it&#x27;s important to find something to ease the itch. I heard about Wen from a blog and decided to try it. Everything I read said I should be using the fig conditioner. I&#x27;m really glad I bought the sampler, as it turns out the cucumber is the best one for me. No more itchy scalp and clean soft hair. I&#x27;d still like a bit more moisture, but that could be just me.     Overall, I really like this product and will definitely buy it again. it won&#x27;t make you have hollywood hair, but it will make it healthier and nicer. I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> Products stick, literally.  I like the product,  bit this was clearly spoiled products,  perhaps stored  improperly,  because the smelled nothing like pervious ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The products work as described, feel great, and make my hair look wonderful.  These are a great alternative to traditional shampoo.  I will keep using the tea tree version for my dandruff.</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t like this product at all. First of all, you do have to follow the instructions and use the full 30 pumps or whatever, or you won&#x27;t have nearly enough product (probably depends on length of your hair) so you go through it really fast, not worth the price for something you can only use a few times. It made me lose A LOT of hair, falling out in clumps. And it made my hair feel wirey. I think there&#x27;s something to be said for regular shampoo, I switched back and my hair has been better than ever. Sorry Wen! Fast shipping though...</li>
    <li> I bought the 5 samples-size to see which would smell the best, and do the best for my hair. The menthol smell over powered any lavender etc. smell each was supposed to have. If you can get past the smell of Vicks or BenGay, it does good for your hair, but didn&#x27;t clean my scalp. It was an expensive experiment.</li>
    <li> I got this set just to try something new on my hair.  It works very well &amp; I plan on ordering more!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with these products.  It left my medium length hair weighted down and actually looked dirty (oily).  I tried using a lot as the intructions stated.  I tried using a little.  Nothing worked.  Complete waste of money.  If you follow the instructions, one 6 oz bottle will only last about a week.</li>
    <li> I have only used it one time (just got it yesterday!) but already I&#x27;m a believer! I ordered the travel set so I could try out the different flavors and see what works for me and what doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a guide that comes with the products that explains which product is right for who. It says:  Sweet Almond Mint: Moisturizes, strengthens, nourishes and adds sheen. It is wonderful for all hair types and works well on fine to medium textured hair.  Cucumber Aloe: Perfect for ALL hair types and extremely beneficial for oily scalps and dry hair due to its astringent and moisturizing properties. Performs amazingly well on thinning, fine or medium textured hair adding volume and body.  Fig: Formulated to strengthen and rehydrate the hair. Due to it&#x27;s moisturizing properties it performs amazingly well on dry, dehydrated, heat-damaged, color-treated, medium to coarse, wavy to curly, and ethnic hair.  Tea tree: Due to its healing and medicinal properties it is formulated to help those with dry, sensitive or flaky scalps and works exceptionally well on those with thinning, medium to coarse, wavy to curly, and ethnic hair.  Lavendar: Works exceptionally well on dry, dehydrated hair. Creates volume and body without weighing down the hair.    I have very thick, coarse, somewhat-wavy-but-not-the-cute-kind-of-wavy, makes-my-shoulder-hurt-to-dry-my-hair-because-it-takes-so-long-to-dry hair! I use salon products, mostly Redken, Biolage, Aveda and some Aquage. I use shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioning treatments, serums, detanglers, heat products, you name it. I am better if I wash my hair every other day or sometimes after two days because of how much it dries my hair out (the drying and flat iron). However, I work out everyday and sweat so I usually have to wash it more often. Basically, my hair feels \\&quot;thirsty\\&quot; all the time.     I got the kit and after reading the descriptions, decided to try Fig. I made sure to follow the directions and you really have to use A LOT. I read that you really can&#x27;t use too much, and a common problem is not using enough. So I put enough on that I thought I was going to fall over from being top heavy and massaged and massaged. Finished my shower duties, rinsed, and added a little as a leave-in. I let it air-dry a little, but if I do that I&#x27;ll end up looking like I have a mushroom on my head, so I finished with the hair dryer and my beloved flat iron. My hair felt sooooooo soft. And this was without the gazillion products the beauticians tell me to use (one to detangle, one to protect from heat from the dryer and then again from the flat iron, one to control flyaways and add shine, one just because they are on commission, :-) you get the picture). I was really pumped so I went to ask my husband if he could tell by touching it. But when I went to tell him, before I said anything he said \\&quot;Did you get your haircut?\\&quot; and I said \\&quot;No, why?\\&quot; He said \\&quot;It looks like you got it lightened or something because it&#x27;s really shiny.\\&quot; I was so pumped, I hadn&#x27;t even noticed that part yet!!! So then he felt it and said yes it was definitely softer... almost silky! I&#x27;ve never had silky hair!    That&#x27;s my story so far. I will update later if it changes or if my hair turns into a pumpkin at midnight. :-) Good luck!    ***UPDATE - After using the products for about 3 months, I did decide that if I use them too much (or for too long a period of time without changing it up), I did have the same problem as other reviewers with my hair feeling like \\&quot;straw\\&quot;. I also started to feel like my hair just needed a deep \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot;. I know their claim to fame is that they don&#x27;t contain the sodium whatever ingredient that is used in most shampoos that is hard on your hair, but I also think this is the ingredient that really helps \\&quot;clean\\&quot; your hair. And I&#x27;m sure our hair gets pretty nasty! All in all, I still like Wen, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stand-alone product, but better used in a rotation. However, that&#x27;s just my experience and opinion! Hope it helps someone! :-)</li>
    <li> I watched the infomercial for this product several times and could not decide whether or not I wanted to buy the product.  After searching online for the product, I saw this set and thought that it might be better to be able to determine which actual product would work best for my hair and which scent I actually like best.  And I am so glad that I did!  I absolutely despise the most common scent (sweet almond mint) and would never use it on my hair.  But, I adore the Tea Tree product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not, however, use the product every day or I end up looking like a refugee from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  I am now using the product every other day and am loving how my hair looks.  My hair is color-treated and goes through an enormous amount of abuse, so I love that I have found a product that is helping to restore its health.</li>
    <li> I saw the infomercial and wanted to try it but not sure if I wanted to get stuck with the almond mint and a bunch of other stuff.    These 5 give you a chance to try out the different smells.  They seem to all work the same with the tea tree oil being extra tingly on the scalp.  Did not care for the smell of the fig.  But all of them got rid of the frizz and made my hair look great.  this is the only product I need for my hair, no more shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, styling creme, etc.     this is the best stuff I found for curly hair. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> please just make sure that you are checking the sizes of things when you order, pictures are very deceiving.  I spent double what I should have by not paying attention to the size of the bottles.  Not the sellers fault persay but I think the pictures and the price together made it seem like an awesome deal when in fact it was a rip off.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product I have fine, straight hair, and with wen it just looks dirty, weighed down, and more stringy.  My hair naturally has no body or texture and wen was no help.  However, if you have more body, texture, and if your hair that can handle more oils and weighty products it may work great for you.</li>
    <li> I have tried thousands of hair care products and wen hair care is amazing. I have slightly wavy hair, so I blow dry it everyday. As a result, my hair is awfully dry and brittle. I saw the infomercial for Wen hair care and decided what do I have to lose? (Let me preface this by saying I have never ever bought anything from an infomercial...so I was pretty desperate to find a solution to my hair being so dry). Anyway, I ordered the sweet almond mint. It worked wonders. After blow drying my hair it was amazingly shiny, silky and soft. I bumped into my mother and she immediately commented on my hair. I find that you have to mix up the different flavors of the Wen hair care otherwise it can get oily. I recommend using regular shampoo right at the top of your scalp and then using wen hair care everywhere else. This way, you avoid too much moisture in that area. It&#x27;s truly an amazing product. It makes my hair look like I went to the salon daily!!!</li>
    <li> Pros:  Last summer I bought the WEN Complete Set of All Five Cleansing Conditioners - 6oz. so I could try them all and find the one right for me (I have between wavy and coarse- color treated hair); So I ended using the fig one (as suggested) and surprisingly it really left my hair beautiful since first use! it was super shiny and soft, my waves became more full and bouncy and almost no coarse or frizz (even without the extra help of styling products! instead I just used a little as leave-in at the end of every shower), that even my husband noticed! But the joy lasted very little as I only had 6oz. Then I continued using the rest, and also liked the lavender, then the almond mint, cucumber aloe and at the very last (and just for the \\&quot;extra cleansing for dry-itchy sensitive scalp that I get right after I color my hair) the tea tree one (wich by the way my husband liked).  Now the bad part of the story is that after evalutating the results of the first time and the high cost, I order the 32 oz. set of Fig and Lavender (for me) and tea tree (for my husband), but sadly and quite disappointed need to say that this time we did not have the same good results AT ALL! :[ I even ordered the fig styling creme hoping it would help me style my hair easier, but also... not good! (still wondering why).  So, I think this will be our last purchase of WEN products.</li>
    <li> I like the idea but it takes some getting used to because there is no suds. I have since did a karatin treatment so I do not use them. they are too expensive for what you get</li>
    <li> I have tried all of these products.  I personally like the Aloe and Cucumber the best.  I have fine, naturally curly hair which I color. All of the products relaxed my curl somewhat. The Mint left my hair dry as did the lavendar (I REALLY dislike the smell of the lavendar.)  Nothing stands out about the tea tree as it was just o.k.  The longer you use WEN, the better the results.  I really like that I only have to use one product for cleaning, conditioning and styling.  I do wish they would change the container as it is difficult to get the last little bit out of the bottle.  For the price, you want to get every drop you can.  I am confident that you can find one that will work best for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for infomercials!  I decided to try the product, but didn&#x27;t want a huge amount just in case I didn&#x27;t like it so I bought the sampler.  I&#x27;ve tried the tea tree and fig so far.  Let me first describe my hair.  My hair is about to the middle of my back in a long layered cut.  It is very thin and baby fine with natural curl.  Not pretty natural curl, but weird uncontrollable stick out everywhere natural curl that has spots that curl, are kind of wavy, and frizz.  I have to straighten it or help to enhance my weird curl to make it look nice.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t like to use styling products and go as natural as possible most the time.  My hair was looking dry althoug it is healthy.  I used the tea tree first and it was nice, but I found that it was just okay.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with a dry scalp so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use this one.  It did make my hair very soft.  My hair is usually pretty soft because of its baby fine texture, but it was very silky.  I also noted that my thin hair that ususally dries very fast took a longer time to dry.  (I let it air dry).  Because my hair is more like a little kids (baby fine) I knew the recommended amount of the product would be way too much.  I only used 5-6 pumps, followed the directions and combed it through my hair with a very widetooth comb.  All went well and I was moderately impressed.  The next time I used the fig product.  I followed the directions again using 5-6 pumps.  I decided to dry my hair this time instead of letting it air dry.  Again it took a much longer time for my hair to dry, which didn&#x27;t bother me.  I was very impressed this time.  (Maybe because I actually styled it this time?)  It was shiny, easy to comb, and felt so soft!  One thing I noticed was that my hair didn&#x27;t tangle.  Long baby fine hair is a nightmare to comb and I often felt like most my hair was left in my comb or brush instead of on my head.  I did not have this problem.  My mom noticed how nice my hair looked and couldn&#x27;t believe it was mine.  I&#x27;ve only used the product a short time and I&#x27;m wondering if it will continue to do as well long term.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered the sampler as it will take me forever to use it since I use so little of the product.  I would suppose people will need to take into account their own hair length, thickness, and texture when determining how much to use.  I&#x27;d recommend it and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!  Update since April...  I&#x27;ve been using the product ever since April.  Still only using 5-6 pumps instead of the large amount recommended.  My hair is much easier to manage and doesn&#x27;t tangle as much.  With the small amount I use I think I&#x27;ll be able to go at least 9 months with the supply I ordered.  I use far less of this product than I do my regular shampoo or conditioner, so it actually turns out to be a real value for me!</li>
    <li> The ad was misleading.  The bottles you normally receive from wen are16 oz. with caps on the bottles.  There was no information on the size of the bottle when ordering.  Two of the bottles I received were leaking losing part of the product in the box.  I will never purchase again from this site.  I do love wen products but they are expensive.  I will continue to purchase from wen or qvc and still pay the same amount for 16 oz bottles.</li>
    <li> December Update:  After using this product for two months, I have reverted back to using regular shampoo.  I still use Wen as a daily conditioner though. It also works great as a leave-in conditioner.  I left the conditioner in overnight and then washed again with Wen in the morning, and my hair looked noticeably thicker and shinier.    Original Review:  I ordered the Sweet Almond Mint, Cucumber Aloe, and Lavender cleansing conditioners.  So far I have only used the Cucumber Aloe.  The product works as advertised.  My hair is softer and fuller, looks healthier, and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.  I have short hair (sits at my shoulders), and six pumps for the crown, each side, and nape of my neck seems to be an appropriate amount (24 pumps total).  The Cucumber Aloe smells/feels like it has mint in it--it has a cooling effect, which I don&#x27;t mind.  My hair feels a little heavy on \\&quot;day 2\\&quot; so I&#x27;m forced to wash it daily, but I do like how the product makes my hair feel on \\&quot;day 1\\&quot;, so I will continue to use it.  I highly recommend Wen for anyone looking for a deep conditioner!</li>
    <li> ...not every one is for all hair types. I wanted to try them all to see which one I liked best.     I give the sweet almond mint 5 out of 5 stars...I would buy it again in a heartbeat. It&#x27;s a great product, and I use it every day.     The lavender and the cucumber aloe are also good, but not as good as the mint.     The tea tree didn&#x27;t really work out for me, and it kind of smelled like medicine.     The fig is my least favorite. It didn&#x27;t give my hair the normal \\&quot;softness\\&quot; that the mint did, and it smells REALLY bad.     From now on, I would order probably just the mint, but I&#x27;m glad I tried them all.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this and I am thrilled. I am not sure if I will use only these or use them in rotation with other products but it made a huge difference in one use. My hair feels soft ans shiny.I still have to get used to the whole no suds thing but it is amazing. So far the fig is my favorite scent. I have long naturally wavy red hair  that gets unruly in humid weather but this stuff seems like it will tame some of that. I say buy the 5 small scents and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of wen Hair care but the product I was sent was not working quite right for my hair type. I wanted to sample all that was available so I could choose which was for me and it worked out perfectly...I&#x27;m a fig user. Thankyou</li>
    <li> Interesting combination of &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love the set.  Found that I like the fig the best after using all 5.  Also like the almond mint &amp; lavender.  Leaves my hair very soft and clean feeling after use.  Love the fragrance.  Also improved the condition of my dry scalp with use - did not expect that but great bonus.  Alittle hard to get use to product not sudding up like shampoo but you get over that after using a few times.  Especially after experiencing the results of the product.</li>
    <li> I got the sampler pack on Amazon after starting with Wen. All you can get at the main site is the almond mint, no \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;. I really like changing scents according to my mood.</li>
    <li> Buyer BEWARE!  These are small 6 oz bottles.  My own fault, I didn&#x27;t read.  Frankly I didn&#x27;t know Wen made products in such small bottles.  I love Wen, but this was most certainly my worst Wen purchase ever.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great. After using it only once, it made my hair soft and shiny. However, after a few days, I noticed that my skin broke out around where my hair fell on my face, especially my forehead. I gave a couple of bottles to my sister as a gift and she said the same thing happened to her.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on these cleansing conditioners. My hair has started looking great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Wen!  This is the best hair product out there.  My hair always looks so healthy after using it, even the first time!  I little bit on the expensive side so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I would like but love when I do.  Always get so many compliments on my hair when I use it!</li>
    <li> What a scam. The amount of the purchase was the equivelant to 5 full size bottles, not mini travel size, which is what I received. BUYER BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> friends don&#x27;t let friends use shampoo :-)  WEN is the holy grail of hair care!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great overall. The mint frangraces are a little strong for me. The results are what is advertised. I think its a product for someone with dry to extremly dry hair. I can see where a person with oily hair may not like this product because its all about the mositurizing. After only one week of use, I have notice a difference and so have other people, in the feel and texture of my hair. Its soft, not like straw anymore. I highly recommend this product for black women who tend to have naturally dry hair.</li>
    <li> Tried all five until gone, and found it left my hair feeling oily. Similar to not washing for a day or two.</li>
    <li> Love this product! This cleansing conditioner is great for colored hair. Makes my hair soft and shiny. As of price, it is expensive and it doesn&#x27;t last a long time. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product after reading all of the raving reviews.  It turns out that the product doesn&#x27;t work any better than using a good shampoo and conditioner.  When I used the Wen, I followed the directions exactly- I used the correct amount, worked it into the different sections of my hair, left it on for the correct length of time, and rinsed it out completely.  It has a nice scent, and I did enjoy the scalp-tingling menthol.  But my hair didn&#x27;t look or feel any different afterward than when I use my regular shampoo and conditioner.  At a cost of nearly $2.00 an ounce, it would need to do something spectacular to my hair for me to continue to buy it.  I will finish up the remaining product I have left, but will not purchase anymore of it.    UPDATE: I noticed that after using Wen regularly, my hair started to get limp and dirty-looking faster and my hair needed to be washed MORE often than before.  This is opposite of what the product claims about having to clean your hair less often when using the product.  I am now only using the product as a conditioner- it&#x27;s not working as a regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> These small bottles are great for deciding which you prefer. I ended up going with the Sweet Almond Mint when I purchased the full-size. I think I only bought it once or twice before I decided it wasn&#x27;t really worth the cost (at least not for me).</li>
    <li> Love it! Excellent way to try each flavor of shampoo to determine which one works best with your hair type.</li>
    <li> Spend 40 mode dollars n get. 5 16 oz. Bottles ..stuff is fabulous but at that price get your money worth</li>
    <li> I got the sample pack so I could try several different varieties. I have fairly fine, long (past my bra), with a bit of coloring hair. My definition of &#x27;styling&#x27; my hair is not drying or styling tools, just brushing my hair several times when it&#x27;s damp to keep it from waving up. To sum it up, healthy overall hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out very optimistic and followed all instructions. Each time I washed my hair, which went from every 3 days to daily, I continued to try to be positive. My soft, silky, no stress hair from my first try with Wen felt like I had put treseme dry shampoo in it from root to tip. And yes, I rinsed very well. It added a slight wave to my hair which made it look like when I had damaged the crap out of my hair on college by bleaching it, blow drying and straightening daily. I thought Wen was supposed to make my hair feel healthier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every type and finished all I had hoping the Wen miracle would hit me after days, then weeks. Nope. I had to wash my hair daily instead of 2-3 times a week, and it still looked like crap. It also gave my previously healthy scalp little scabs all over while making me itch like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back to my usual regime of aussie moist alternated with head and shoulders with eucalyptse. After the first shampoo and condition I had my soft silky hair back. I went to work, everyone asked if I&#x27;d gotten ky hair done and what my secret was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, Wen is not for my hair. I&#x27;d still recommend trying it, so if you&#x27;re brave go f</li>
    <li> Misread the ad, thought they were full size. I should have known by the price; this stuff is always a great product but expensive.</li>
    <li> Although the smaller size is convenient ,but for that much money, I thought I was buying the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in myself for not reading the product details more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;I do love Wen, but I only use it a few times a week , not daily.  And I also do not use the recommended amount and still have  good results.</li>
    <li> I got this at the recommendation of a friend. With the double damage caused by dry climate and winter my hair gets dry and brittle if I wash it more than twice a week. This is a perfect solution. It removes product buildup and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, not damaged. Now I use these products daily (or whenever I shower) and only wash my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner once a week. My hair has been so much healthier! It would have been nice to know the benifits of the differant formulas (one is better for dry, one oily etc.) But I enjoy trying all of them and then picking the one I like the best to buy in a larger size. All of them also smell fantastic! Pricey but in my opinion well worth it!</li>
    <li> Very small bottle. Items do work but they take too much time for ppl who work. Plus price too high</li>
