      <li>It&#x27;s actually kind of embarrassing to smell like this.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice lotion...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
      <li>I have purchased so many body lotions that have never come even close to as good as this one.</li>
      <li>I love Booths lotions, the Lemon scent isnt my favorite but still smells good and will finish the bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great big bottle which I love and a very nice and creamy lotion.  </li>
      <li>Good texture and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>So my search is on for a better lotion for my legs</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion!!!!</li>
      <li>and that was the best, it totally worked.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in smoothness or a better appearance of my legs.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent is still the coconut fig.</li>
      <li>Its ok, and thats about it.</li>
      <li>really love the lemon sugar scent</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>

      <li>This has to be one of my favorite scents ever.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>This lotion smells AMAZING and leaves my skin smooth as butter.</li>
      <li>I never use this lotion if I am going to be around too many people.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the consistency and the scent is quite lovely and what I would expect from the name (unlike the Coconut Fig).</li>
      <li>Decent moisturizing, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>but this lemon-sugar has a nice fresh clean scent that I love.</li>
      <li>I used this to get my back looking beautiful for a strapless wedding dress</li>
      <li>Be sure to wear SPF when in the sun since the lotion makes your skin more sensitive and you will burn more easily.</li>
      <li>huge fan of C. Booth products.</li>
      <li>I would re-purchase this again as a light day lotion.</li>
      <li>At my age, if found it too light.</li>
      <li>Also,  from drugstore.com : 4 in 1 lotion- Free of parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, petrolatum. </li>
      <li>I love this product and the price is economical too.</li>
      <li>The price is great for the amount and it smells so good, it goes on not too thick but keeps your skin moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>The lemon scent is sweet and mild; not too strong or fruity (you aren&#x27;t going to stink like lemons).</li>
      <li>A pleasant enough scent, but sweet-ish rather than that &#x27;clean&#x27; citrusy scent</li>
      <li>works great on my dry hands -</li>
      <li>This stuff smells amazing and helps make the skin soft and evens out the complexion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fifty years old, olive-skinned and have not ever burnt from any kind of sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>Good for fading marks from back blemishes.  </li>
      <li>Packaging is cool.</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean but almost like lemon sugar cookie.  </li>
      <li>The lemon scent is delicious but doesn&#x27;t last super long as to not offend your senses.</li>
      <li>This product smells amazing and melts into your skin, I will definitely purchase again .</li>
      <li>Smell is fine, my main reason for buying it was because it said it had caffeine in it and</li>
      <li>This is great, very gentle, very moisturizing, and even my little boys don&#x27;t mind using it because they smell like lemon cookies after.</li>
      <li>in the Lemon scent for my daughter, who, like me is sensitive to strong fragrance and floral scents.</li>
      <li>and so at the end of the day they are very dry - after using this lotion they are good as new again!</li>
      <li>Just be aware of that ingredient when using it.  </li>
      <li>For someone younger, it may be ok.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty much candy for my skin!  </li>
      <li>(LOVE all of the C. Booth products I&#x27;ve recently purchased!)</li>
      <li>Makes skin smooth and soft without felling greasy.</li>
      <li>A potent combo of alpha hydroxyl acids&#x27; (on another listing there is no mention made of any such ingredient), and so, one day, after applying the lotion</li>
      <li>I have used lots of different lotions and creams - love this one!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Firstly, the smell is a bit over powering.</li>
      <li>I love the multiple actions of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>We received some of this as a Christmas present last year and loved it.  </li>
      <li>It works great, it&#x27;s not too thick, not too thin, and smells great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
      <li>I was really looking for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say the smell range (how close someone would have to be to smell it) would be in the intimate range (very close).</li>
      <li>According to 1 website,  it IS paraben free &amp; even advertised as such.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got it at such a great bargain---I was down to my last maybe 30 pumps---now I&#x27;m set for the year!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend C. Booth anything.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is high, but I can&#x27;t get it anywhere within 250 miles.</li>
      <li>Disappointing because the lotion was very good.</li>
      <li>It has a very soft and soothing lemon smell.  </li>
      <li>I have the other scents, and I think the lotion itself is good, but I can&#x27;t get past feeling like I&#x27;ve applied furniture polish.</li>
      <li>Non greasy light moisturizer, drys and smooths the little bumps on my arms</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Packaging is cool. The price is excellent.  The smell is a sugary lemon...the lemon fades a bit and it settles into a somewhat bubblegum scent.  A pleasant enough scent, but sweet-ish rather than that &#x27;clean&#x27; citrusy scent I was really looking for.  It&#x27;s a great big bottle which I love and a very nice and creamy lotion.  Feels good on the skin. The thing I did not notice when I ordered it is that it has, according to one of the listings on Amazon... &#x27;A potent combo of alpha hydroxyl acids&#x27; (on another listing there is no mention made of any such ingredient), and so, one day, after applying the lotion, I came home from cycling and presto...SUNBURNT.  I NEVER burn...never.  I think they should place a &#x27;sunburn alert&#x27; on the label.  I&#x27;m fifty years old, olive-skinned and have not ever burnt from any kind of sun exposure.  Just be aware of that ingredient when using it.  Overall it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> The ones I purchased in the store, the lotion was thick. The one I purchased online, it was very thin, almost watery. Disappointing because the lotion was very good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! Makes skin smooth and soft without felling greasy. The Lemon Sugar smells lemony, with a hint of citronella.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a chance not having tried it before and I was not disappointed. The price is great for the amount and it smells so good, it goes on not too thick but keeps your skin moisturized all day. It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> We received some of this as a Christmas present last year and loved it.  It smells so great and is also moisturizing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the multiple actions of this lotion.  It has a very soft and soothing lemon smell.  It helps to moisturize while at the same time clearing the skin.  Be sure to wear SPF when in the sun since the lotion makes your skin more sensitive and you will burn more easily.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m wearing lemon pledge.  I have the other scents, and I think the lotion itself is good, but I can&#x27;t get past feeling like I&#x27;ve applied furniture polish.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It works great, it&#x27;s not too thick, not too thin, and smells great. The lemon scent is sweet and mild; not too strong or fruity (you aren&#x27;t going to stink like lemons). I&#x27;d say the smell range (how close someone would have to be to smell it) would be in the intimate range (very close).</li>
    <li> I use this stuff on my feet and although I am no spring chicken, the skin on my feet is soft as a baby&#x27;s behind. Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried works as well as this for exfoliation. I&#x27;ve tried things that say they are for feet and they never work. The lemon scent is much nicer than the other two, which are repulsive. Amazon&#x27;s price is high, but I can&#x27;t get it anywhere within 250 miles. Used to get it a Kmart before they stopped carrying it and they charged only about $10 for the quart bottle.</li>
    <li> This lotion has everything in it!  Great smell, hydration, fast absorption...I have ordered it several times and will continue to use it as my all-over body lotion as nothing compares...</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and get tired of baby lotion this is one of a few that I can use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my lady and she loves it.  It&#x27;s a lot of volume for the price and moisturizes incredibly well.  It&#x27;s not oily or waxy and also makes you smell like a lemon cookie after using it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My skin is soft and I smell like a lemon cookie. I have dry sensitive skin and this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion!!!! its my no. 1 brand. the smell is so yummy that im just tempted to lick it rieght off!!!! Lol. and it arrived sooner than i ee</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer.  The Lemon Sugar and Vanilla Butter are the two fragrances I&#x27;ve tried. The scents are not overwhelming for my allergies.  I love this product and the price is economical too.</li>
    <li> I have used lots of different lotions and creams - love this one!&lt;br /&gt;Also really love the lemon sugar scent - it&#x27;s just like the cookies!!&lt;br /&gt;This works great on my dry hands - I work in a place where I have to wash my hands a lot and so at the end of the day they are very dry - after using this lotion they are good as new again!</li>
    <li> Firstly, the smell is a bit over powering. It does smell like lemon bars...lemony but not crisp. I was also disappointed in it&#x27;s moisturizing capabilities. At my age, if found it too light. For someone younger, it may be ok. I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I have purchased so many body lotions that have never come even close to as good as this one. I am very sensitive to fragrances (sometimes even the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; ones have an annoying scent) but this lemon-sugar has a nice fresh clean scent that I love. It does WONDERS on my skin. Has even eliminated the tiny whitish dry bumps I had that exfoliants couldn&#x27;t get rid of! Finally found a product that works!! Yay!!  Try it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great stuff and can&#x27;t buy it locally.&lt;br /&gt;Have to go on-line and wait.&lt;br /&gt;Have a bottle (32 oz) at each bathroom for grins and it smells great too!&lt;br /&gt;Ron in Texas on January 31, 2014</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and melts into your skin, I will definitely purchase again . its also a great value!</li>
    <li> Seriously love this lotion. Great price, great scent, and seems to work well as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the consistency and the scent is quite lovely and what I would expect from the name (unlike the Coconut Fig). I would re-purchase this again as a light day lotion.</li>
    <li> This is great, very gentle, very moisturizing, and even my little boys don&#x27;t mind using it because they smell like lemon cookies after.</li>
    <li> This is a huge bottle for a great price. I bought it in the midst of a lemon obsession and I think it may last for-ev-er.... Decent moisturizing, pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this scent!! 4 stars only because one of the top ingredients is alcohol :/ unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as Id like but the scent is so addicting!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while. I did pay significantly less than $15. I keep a bottle by my bed and 1 in the living room. Most recently,  my thumb was extremely dry and had deep painful cracks. I used this for 2 days and my thumb is 70% better and much less painful.  According to 1 website,  it IS paraben free &amp; even advertised as such.  This product got some negative reviews for containing alcohol,  I looked up the type of alcohol  used in this, cetyl alcohol.  Good Types of Alcohol  There&#x27;s a class of ingredients known as fatty alcohols, which are not the least bit harmful for skin. Often confused with the bad alcohols, such as denatured alcohol, the fatty alcohols include, among others, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol. Typically, fatty alcohols are used as emollients and thickeners in skin-care product  Also,  from drugstore.com : 4 in 1 lotion- Free of parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, petrolatum. </li>
    <li> This product makes my day----if you have a chance to try it then by all means use it liberally on your elbows, knees, shoulders, arms, legs, right out of the shower---this deliciously fragrant lotion will put a skip in your step. I can&#x27;t believe I got it at such a great bargain---I was down to my last maybe 30 pumps---now I&#x27;m set for the year!</li>
    <li> Non greasy light moisturizer, drys and smooths the little bumps on my arms</li>
    <li> I have to strongly disagree with the reviews that say it smells awesome. It smells like lemon Pledge. I never use this lotion if I am going to be around too many people. It&#x27;s actually kind of embarrassing to smell like this. As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a bit greasy. I think my solution to not throwing the bottle out entirely will be to mix it with something unscented and much lighter.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and helps make the skin soft and evens out the complexion.  Good for fading marks from back blemishes.  Does not cause breakouts as I had feared, being acne-prone.  I used this to get my back looking beautiful for a strapless wedding dress and it did the trick.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of my favorite scents ever.  Fresh and clean but almost like lemon sugar cookie.  Not perfumy.  Lucious!</li>
    <li> I have been using C. Booth products for about 2 years now.  I am obsessed with the dermaC24 Anti-Oxidant moisturizer, but since it has been discontinued, it is hard to find reasonably.  I stocked up with those, and now have 12 (I hope they don&#x27;t expire).  I decided to try a few other C. Booth product and this lotion is EXTREMELY reasonable for the size and as an add-on item, is eligible for prime shipping.  The smell is subtle yet warming and NOT overly fragrant.  Good texture and absorbs quickly.  I highly recommend C. Booth anything.</li>
    <li> This product disappointed me, it made my skin very dry, didn&#x27;t live up to its claims at all ... i definitely  would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its ok, and thats about it. Smell is fine, my main reason for buying it was because it said it had caffeine in it and thought would be good for my legs.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in smoothness or a better appearance of my legs. Disappointed because I had St. Ives body lotion to help with cellulite and can&#x27;t find it any more and that was the best, it totally worked. So my search is on for a better lotion for my legs</li>
    <li> This lotion smells AMAZING and leaves my skin smooth as butter. It&#x27;s a great value and I would definitely recommend to anyone.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels delicious.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Feels great.  Amazing quantity for the price.  Outstanding price!  Love love love this lotion.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, not too light.  Not at all greasy.  The smell is very refreshing and not over-powering.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice lotion...I chose it because of the 4-in-1 multi-action.  May try the version that is specifically made for firming next time but it&#x27;s a large bottle so it won&#x27;t be for a while.  (LOVE all of the C. Booth products I&#x27;ve recently purchased!)</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty much candy for my skin!  It&#x27;s not a super heavy duty lotion, so it works well for an every day body moisturizer.  The lemon scent is delicious but doesn&#x27;t last super long as to not offend your senses.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Like lemons and sunshine!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this lotion. It does what it says it will do, which is even out skin tone and reduce markings and scars. It isn&#x27;t a miracle cream, but it is an exfoliating cream that hydrates sufficiently. I like the scent, although my hubby doesn&#x27;t. I like the cream enough that anyone else&#x27;s opinion doesn&#x27;t matter. The scent vanishes in a short time, anyway. Hope they keep making this great product-</li>
    <li> I bought some small bottles of something called Skin Below The Chin at a retail store and tried to hunt it down again and could not locate it.  Info on the web indicated that Skin Below The Chin was discontinued. Additional info indicated that it was made by this C. Booth company. So I looked for C. Booth products here in hopes that they were comparable to what they were making under that other label. So far, I have ordered this C. Booth 4-in-1 in the Lemon scent for my daughter, who, like me is sensitive to strong fragrance and floral scents. She has been quite impressed.  I will be ordering this one for myself as well.  Hey there, C. Booth! I do wish you would make this 4-in-1 in the Apricot-Ginger scent, please?</li>
    <li> huge fan of C. Booth products. Lemon Sugar smells like a citrus field in Italy. Take me away!</li>
    <li> smells amazing! this is the best lotion ever.</li>
    <li> I love Booths lotions, the Lemon scent isnt my favorite but still smells good and will finish the bottle. My favorite scent is still the coconut fig.</li>
