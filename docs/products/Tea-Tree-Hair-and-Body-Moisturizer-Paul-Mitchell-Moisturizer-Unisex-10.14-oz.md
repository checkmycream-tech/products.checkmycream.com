<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A small squeeze on the hands, rub them together and run through damp hair, and I&#x27;m ready for the day. Hair looks presentable at the office, or after work, and I don&#x27;t have it matted to my scalp or stuck up in spikes. Been using this stuff for over a year, now, and don&#x27;t plan to stop.</li>
    <li> Loveeeee this product!! My favorite hair &amp; skin product!!</li>
    <li> For me it works for hair and for skin. I use it on my face mainly as my skin gets very dry, but i can use it anywhere. I have kind of a skin dermatitis of a sort and this works very well.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff you can use for your hands, your face, your hair. Smells great, moisturizes well and you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smelling great, and feeling even better. I have a history of split ends, and so far, this has helped to prevent them.</li>
    <li> My boys just loved this hair product. It not only manages their hair, it smells great, . The product was shipped quickly.  I will buy I again.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this on his face after shaving, he says it is especially great on razor burned areas! He forgot the name and couldn&#x27;t find it for awhile, but he&#x27;s really excited to start using it again!</li>
    <li> My 10 month old has dry scalp - no dandruff - but he&#x27;s just recently starting itching and pulling at his hair. I was hoping this would help moisturize his head without making his hair look super greasy and it&#x27;s PERFECT!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve put it on 3 times in one day and his hair was still nice and soft :D So glad I found this!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Not only does it moisturize your hair (and body!) but it has replaced any and all hair molding products I have ever used before. Also, this is what I use as an after shave now. It feels fantastic on my face and protects against any post-shave skin irritation. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; originally bought this after a hairstylist convinced him. We have since repurchase twice. He doesn&#x27;t like it much for his hair, but it works well as a styling cream on my fine, curly, apl hair. It also smells really nice, it&#x27;s a nice peppermint scent just like the rest of the PM tea tree products which I like. My fianc&amp;eacute; likes to use it on his face after shaving. He says it is soothing and feels nice. My favorite use is on my feet. The tea tree oil in it is great for preventing toe nail fungus which I have an issue with sometimes. It makes the feet feel tingly after applying and is a great light moisturizer as well. I really recommend this since it is a versatile product which makes it well worth the money spent</li>
    <li> The one I tried in the sample package was amazing. So I wanted to buy it. The actual bottle didn&#x27;t seem the same then in the sample. Did nothing to get the tangles out.</li>
    <li> I have trouble finding this product in the stores anymore, but I love it. My husband and I both use it. It conditions your hair, keeps it smooth and shiny, but does not leave any residue or greasy feeling on your hair like many products do. I use this every day before I dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years vwet nice..</li>
    <li> Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and keeps asking me to buy it for him.  He says it feels tingly and minty clean on the scalp.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> I use this sometimes for both hair and skin.. I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t build up and it has a great smell. It&#x27;s great for you hair!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great thing about Paul Mitchell products!  This is another winner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great leave-in conditioner &amp; mooisturizer that does not leave your hair or skin greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh you down.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Likes: Subtle smell, visible improvement in hair quality, and a reasonable substitute for gel and other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: Psh, nothing. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to any male that want fresh hair but doesn&#x27;t want to style with gel, mouse, or overpowering products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*(Male Reviewer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the most fashionable person, but there&#x27;s no excuse for bad hair with this stuff. I just rub in a dime-sized amount in my hair after my shower and it keeps my hair looking healthy. What I really love, though, is the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of products that end up making you smell like you&#x27;ve sampled every single cologne as you walked through Nordstrom. It has a very light scent that fades quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he was complaining about flyaway hair.  He likes this product because he doesn&#x27;t like gel;  this works well and doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s tea tree, and I&#x27;m not buying it from a salon or sports clip, so it much cheaper...what&#x27;s not to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this is great to use on your kids hair when we all get those dreaded notes from the school that someone in some grade has lice, this stuff repels them like crazy.  I use this in my hair when I got hunting and have never had any issues with bugs....</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Got it as a leave in conditioner but I use it as a gel. Light hold and no flaking what so ever. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product I wish they made a pump body wash. The mint is what makes it so good the teetree makes it work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went through so many products to keep my hair in good condition and not getting dry often.  I can go at least 3 days in between washes and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stink.</li>
    <li> Arrived in the day and a half after ordered as promised. Already knew the product worked great so wasn&#x27;t worried about that. Thank you.</li>
    <li> makes my curly hair glossy and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both use it and like it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;Being able to use one product cuts down on the bathroom clutter.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist has always been telling me to keep my skin moisturized.  I tried this product directly on my scalp and it has worked wonders with itching and flaking.  It keeps my hair reasonably manageable, though some people might not like its thick texture.  It works much better than rinse-off conditioners.  If you have a scalp condition that causes flaking and itching, this product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 and sometimes get a little dandruff.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and they don&#x27;t seem to work very well.  Started using this and it has helped immensely.  I don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it smells great.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff but when you put it in don&#x27;t expect that they just disappear be absorbed completely. Your hair will be a little slimy at first. It eventually goes away but just be prepared it&#x27;s almost like you have hair gel in. The smell is great and the peppermint feel is probably my favorite.</li>
    <li> I only use occasionally. It is heavy for fine hair, but great for hair that has been color treated.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a drop to untangle hair, and the rest I rub on my hands, elbows and knees&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and has a delightful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive skin and quenches thirsty hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great post-shave soother.&lt;br /&gt;Wheat-derived conditioners and jojoba seed oil refine skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil, peppermint and lavender soothe skin and leave hair smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Heavy for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended At Times. prisrob11-26-13</li>
    <li> It had stickers all over what I was needing to read</li>
    <li> I feel like a baby seal before I go clubbing my skin is so soft. Dancing- I don&#x27;t club baby seals. If you don&#x27;t get this I suspect that you do because you are afraid of feeling how they feel...baby-silky-smoooooth.</li>
    <li> It works well. It&#x27;s just really thick.</li>
    <li> Originally I purchased Tea Tree Hair and Body Moisturizer after my hairdresser gave me a wonderful scalp massage using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then massaged my hands with it, and was surprised how wonderful it made my aching hands feel!  I really like the way it dries quickly and is not greasy.  I have Fibromyalgia and Osteoarthritis.  I have found nothing better for relieving my hand pain.</li>
    <li> Excellent as a leave-in conditioner</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner because it does not leave you feeling  greasy - it is totally absorbed, and you can use it on your skin AND hair. (Smells good too!)</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice in the past 6 months.  I first bought it because my barber recommended it.  I am a middle aged male.  My hair is thin and I part it to the side.  When it dries, my bangs fall down in my face (which I don&#x27;t want) because my hair does not naturally hold the part.  I wanted something for my hair that would give it body and make it look natural without looking greasy, waxy, or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves my hair feeling soft and it helps to hold my part.  Since I have been using it, my hair has started to look much healthier.  I am letting it grow a little longer because I can now control it better, while looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good feature of the product is that it has lasted a long time, I only need a tiny, pea-sized amount to do the job.  One bottle could last several months.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great for calming the hair, not sticky or stiff at all...healthy looking hair again! Easy to apply, goes a long way</li>
    <li> This stuff smells...amazing.  It&#x27;s got a lot of natural ingredients as well.  It&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer when you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower.  The tea tree oil also seems to naturally repel mosquitos, which is a problem this time of year where I live.  I don&#x27;t feel like it would be heavy enough to moisturize your skin in colder climates, but i have yet to test this theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put it in my hair.  My hair feels no more moisturized than before, and it seems to make me break out on the sides of my face as well, so i will be using it as a body moisturizer only.</li>
    <li> Spectacular product for hair that requires moisture.  I use this everyday and don&#x27;t see myself stopping anytime soon.  The worst part is, at the end of the bottle, trying to get the last out of it and having to pump 100 times to get the remaining tea tree oil out.</li>
    <li> The product came right on time and the bottle is about the size of my phone (iPhone 5c). Now I mainly use this for my skin and acne instead of my hair and it works great because it has tea tree oil in it. It reduces the redness and look of acne and helps with scarring. Will definitely keep buying more of this.</li>
    <li> Works really great and smells great. I use the product for my hair. Some people I know use this for shaving. Would recommend to product for someone that wants to use product for hair can have wet or dry look.</li>
    <li> I use it as a leave in conditioner as well as a moisturizer for my face after I shave. It manages my long hair style without using sprays.</li>
    <li> Finally found something that really works on dry elbows.</li>
    <li> Same great product that the hair place sold, work great</li>
    <li> Great product for hair and body.  I have a buzzed head and it is perfect for me.  I also use it on my neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect product for added moisturizing of the hair which adds control without the hard/stiff feeling of typical hair products.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it is everything I hoped it would be . A great product, does everything I thought it would.</li>
    <li> This product arrived right on time and we are very pleased with the smell, quality and way our hair feels after we use it.</li>
    <li> I really like how it makes my hair feel.  It is good as a body lotion too.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the lavender smell.  I would rather it smelled more like the tea tree oil as indicated in the name as I have an allergy and lavender and other flower scents (and chemical compounds) make me sensitive and irritate my allergies.  I have used the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and I didn&#x27;t have and problems with it.  It gets 4 stars because of the scent.</li>
    <li> discovered this one day at sports clips...use it every day after I shower and shave.  smells good.  A little goes a long way, but leaves skin feeling good.</li>
    <li> Buy this all the time from my local hair cut place, even better that there&#x27;s a better price online.  Leaves hair styled without looking oily or too treated.  I don&#x27;t use this on my body, but I do love the add&#x27;l benefit on my scalp.</li>
    <li> never use product in my hair.  got hooked on this from my barber and use it daily now.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, and keeps my head nicely moisturized without being oily.</li>
    <li> Very good product great conditioner for healthy skin and beard</li>
    <li> Great mosturizer and works as kind of a gel too for guys who don&#x27;t want to put sticky hair gel in everyday. Try it out! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy, but I would have liked it to make my scalp as tingly as the PM tea tree shampoo does.</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff over a decade ago and  now I only use this. It was suggested to me by my barber and I love it. I just put some of it in my hair in the morning after I shower and then go. I don&#x27;t need anything else and it keeps my hair nice without a lot of work. The other nice thing is that you don&#x27;t need to wash anything off your hands because it is a hair and body moisturizer with a clean scent.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: A week later, I do not know what went wrong. It was working great for the first few days and then out of no where my skin reacted awfully. It made my eczema flare up and with a vengeance. I was itching from head to toe. Since stopping it my skin has calmed down and is back to everyday itchies (ie hands and lower legs). Tried their shamp/cond &amp; bar soap products as well thinking the Tea Tree Oil line would be my cure-all for skin conditions and overall I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[INITIAL REVIEW]: Wow I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it as a leave in conditioner because I have long, fine hair and any product added usually just weighs my hair down &amp; makes it feel greasy/heavy. So only reviewing as a skin moisturizer and dang this stuff is awesome! Wish I could underline lol! Awesome because of the smell (I know I&#x27;m going to lose a few people here, but I actually like the kind of minty, citronella candle smell), it absorbs quickly and thoroughly, which is definitely something that is hard to find. Even some lotions that say they absorb with no greasy feeling don&#x27;t cut it and this stuff does! It seems to be helping my eczema! It&#x27;s almost cleared up my arms and has nearly completely cleared up my hands including some hard, scaly patches that almost look like psoriasis, though I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed with that skin condition. I&#x27;ve used it all over my body and so far my only (very mild) complaint is, it made the skin of my face &amp; neck break out so I will stick to Clinique products on my face, but everywhere else get&#x27;s a nice, soothing coating of PM Tea Tree Oil Moisturizer. Next time I&#x27;m buying industrial size! It&#x27;s working wonders for the cracks on the heels of my feet. Also just a FYI a little goes a loooong way! Lol</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters very curly hair, and I must say I am impressed! What a huge differance this leave in made with her curls, soft &amp; defined!! My son who has been growing his curls out tried it and same results!  Next time I will buy the bigger bottle :)</li>
    <li> Because  it works @ keeping your hair in place and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It beats all the rest</li>
    <li> This product helps reduce hair fall from excessive drying of the scalp especially during winter. Been using this product for months now</li>
    <li> One of the best brands for men products.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Hair not sticky and it looks like you don&#x27;t have anything at all but still works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Tired of sticky hair from using leave in conditioners or gel? This is the stuff you want! This stuff smells great, gives my hair the look I want, and leaves no sticky or greasy residue. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> This is one of my husbands favorite grooming aids.  He uses it as a hair balm as well as an after shave.  He first purchased it at a salon, but was surprised and happy that I could find it at a better price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> No residue, not greasy, smell great and a little bit goes a long way!  First lotion type product I have ever found that I actually like. I don&#x27;t use it in my hair, because I like a stronger spiking gel, but I know some people do.  Bought mine at local Great Clips.</li>
    <li> Smells nice,use it as gel occasionally.</li>
    <li> This is great if you have really dry hair like me. Instead of using conditioner in the shower and letting it sit for a while, I just use this and it also helps I need to go somewhere quit I just put a little in and it appears I have showered. The scent of Tea Tree is great at well. I am strongly considering trying some of their other products.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair and skin when in a hurry. Does great on braids too. smells good not too tree teay. Altough the fregrance is strong in the beginning it fades. On the skin its a good deterent for gnats and noseums for a little while. Leaves hair feling moist for hours. My little known secret.</li>
    <li> This is now a gel, We liked the older version so much better. They Cheaped out on this product - will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth conditioner. Nozzle came broken but you can use without.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells great and makes my hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> I saw immediate results for flaky and itchy scalp as well as red, irritated, itchy skin areas. Fantastic product. We&#x27;ve tried so many other tea tree oil products and, while there have been good results, this product is better by far. We&#x27;ll buy it again and again. Can&#x27;t beat the price of this seller either.</li>
    <li> BEST CONDITIONER EVER KEEPS HAIR SOFT AND TANGLE FREE</li>
    <li> I use this regularly.  Great styling gel and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Try this for shaving, I&#x27;ll never go back the gels and creams.</li>
    <li> In my 60&#x27;s, I have developed small patches of dry, itchy scalp.  It started with one on the top of my head which I picked at until it was badly irritated.  My dermatologist gave me an RX for betamethasone valerate lotion, apply as needed 2 or 3 times a day.  It stops the itch temporarily but is drying, so after awhile, it starts to itch again.  I have tried a number of dandruff shampoos.  None worked well to relieve the itching because they tend to be drying too.  I also tried some oils and creams, but they did not penetrate the scalp.  Meanwhile, I am developing more dry patches.  Since this product is described as a scalp moisturizer, I decided to try it.  So, I use the betamethasone and this product.  I bought a little scalp brush which I use to rub the moisturizer in on the bad spots.  I apply the moisturizer always after a shampoo and then whenever I notice the itch coming back, especially a day or so after using the betamethasone.  At least I&#x27;m not always picking at my head these days!</li>
    <li> I THINK THAT THIS TEA IS HELPING ME ,WITH MY SO DRY SKIN.</li>
    <li> My 13-yr-old son has been having a terrible time with dandruff and scalp itching even with regular use of a well-known tar shampoo.  Several months ago, we started massaging this leave-in conditioner into his hair and scalp when he gets out of the shower and it has helped tremendously.  It has soothed the itching and the dandruff is much better.  Even the pimples around and in his hairline have greatly improved.  The conditioner has a nice, clean light scent and makes his hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> The sensation is very weak! Product was overall below average. Would not suggest buying based on what the product describes it will do.</li>
    <li> They wash my hair with this at Sport Clips and I love the tea tree tingle and fresh feeling after. I decided to get some myself and the bottle lasted almost a whole year (I am a man with super short hair). Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Every man I know loves this stuff! Save it to your wish list and watch the price. Sometimes it drops pretty low and you get a great deal!</li>
    <li> I have sehborhic dermatitis and this is the only thing that helps and iv tried several prescription products that did not work</li>
    <li> I had this product when I was getting my hair cut at the local Sport Clips.  This stuff was great, my hair was soft and my scalp felt like it was breathing.  So I decided to buy this bottle. The only problem was that it seemed like it was going pretty fast, like maybe I&#x27;d received half a bottle.  Come to find out my wife has been using it too.  So apparently women and men can both benefit from this AWESOME moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the larger version of this product and received the 10oz. At $20+ dollars you can get this much cheaper locally.</li>
    <li> Love this and so does my husband! He uses it to style his hair instead of gel or hair wax and I use as leave in conditioner. Great product and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002FJ11UW Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Hair and Body Moisturizer, 10.14 Ounce]] Absolutely love, Love, LOVE this moisturizer!!!  If I let my hair dry naturally, I have wild witch hair!  My daughter suggested I iron it but I hate spending too much time on my hair (it&#x27;s past shoulder length).  I tried this moisturizer when my husband&#x27;s barber suggested it and it&#x27;s incredible!  I massage a small amount into my wet hair then smooth the remainder on my skin.  When my hair dries, the natural waves are smooth and soft...no wild witch hair any more!  MUCH better than Moroccan oil!  This product has a wonderful scent and does not make my hair or skin oily.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning. Give my hair a maintainable feel without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> Ive always enjoyed this product. I have very dry scalp and face and this service a dual purpose.</li>
    <li> This is not only good for your head, scalp and hair but it holds like a gel or fiber.  I was getting my hair cut at Sports Clips and they used this stuff on me then applied some fiber.  I liked it so I got some here on Amazon.  Come to find out - for me after a shower with head toweled dry I apply it and it holds my hair in place all day as well as moisturizes my head and scalp.  I love it - 43 years old and look like I am 25 - !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients great for hair, head and scalp&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes as well as conditions&lt;br /&gt;For me it holds hair in place so no need for additional hair gel or fiber&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Only one....PRICE so darn expensive but worth it&lt;br /&gt;Some say it leaves a white residue...it goes on and turns white but then absorbs into your skin and turns clear - it is momentary not permanent</li>
    <li> Love the Moisturizer, Nice smell, Feels great!&lt;br /&gt;... Except found it cheaper local than any place on Amazon or Online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product and I went ahead and purchase locally at Sports Clips as well.  Now I have 2 bottles (10oz) one purchased via Amazon and one local.&lt;br /&gt;In the future I will look local for this first.  It was about five dollars cheaper for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I mostly use it on my hair if I&#x27;m rushing and don&#x27;t have time to put in conditioner. I have it in a spray bottle mixed with some water, tea tree oil and peppermint oil. I just shake the bottle, spray and go! It smells great and makes you hair feel wonderful. I purchased this bottle almost a year ago and I still have it! Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old guy with curlyish hair and this stuff is EXACTLY what I need for a quick everyday look that is healthy and manageable. Highly recommend it, (and my girlfriend would too!) also it smells great! Will be purchasing a lot more!</li>
    <li> Good product, it has a strong quality, and does not make your hair look hard as a rock or dirty.</li>
    <li> Great product, used it for years. I used to buy it in salon, more convenient to get it here, and less expensive. Highly recommend thus product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair for the past couple months and it is great in controlling the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.  My hair is less dry and softer now-especially needed in winter months.  It also controls static.  I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It really works for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Oil gets me a headache, so I thought I&#x27;d try a hair cream to prevent my hair from drying. It works as I wanted to and keeps my hair from getting too dry.</li>
    <li> my husband has a bald head and uses this all of the time and loves the way it makes his scalp feel!</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Dries out my scalp and causes some irritation. For such an expensive product, I would have expected better.</li>
    <li> Takes care of hair business.  Doubles as body business.  Worth the ridiculous cost because my girlfriend loves the smell.</li>
    <li> I love Tea Tree Special, but I hate that this comes up when I search on shampoo.  Read carefully to avoid getting something you don&#x27;t want/need. The packaging is identical to the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Since my hair started going grey it became very course.  I used this because a stylist at Sport Clips suggested it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years now and love it.  It provides a little hold without being heavy and makes my hair much softer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is very good. Makes my hair feel good and I have dry, itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the pricing is way off. I thought salons would be more expensive, but literally the first place i checked had all the versions of this shampoo for 5$ less than the lowest price on amazon. Don&#x27;t waste ur money on amazon, just go to a nearby salon and see if they have it.</li>
    <li> great product. leaves hair soft and tingly. enough hold for me, even though it is not meant as any sort of styling product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about this being purportedly a &amp;#34;hair and body moisturizer&amp;#34; and curing cancer and any and all other things...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as far a solid hold without the super gelled up look, this does the trick.</li>
    <li> Superb product. no more dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this hair product it is a wonderful conditioner and it actually gives me a weird kind of confidence and it tames my wild bed head</li>
    <li> love this stuff. works great on thick mexican hair</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for a family member who has oily hair and a whole lot of dandruff that has been hard to conquer. This product makes her hair feel very clean and leaves her scalp much less &#x27;dandruffy&#x27;. She is continuing to use this product and says it makes her scalp feel tingly and really good. I have used it as well and like how it makes my hair and scalp feel. I believe it is a good product for several situations. I have also rubbed it on my skin when I had a mosquito bite and it made it feel a lot better.</li>
    <li> This product stops flakes that all anti-dandruff shampoos couldn&#x27;t. If you&#x27;ve ever smelled tea tree oil, this is exactly what it smells like. I&#x27;ve never used outside of my hair and scalp but I&#x27;m sure it would work wonderfully. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small size it is but it should last 1-3 months depending on your quantity of hair. Do yourself a favor and check this product out if you have flaky hair. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my hair cut differently for the first time in about 15 years. The lady that cut my hair recommended this to help maintain the two crowns in my hair that are a pain. Needless to say, they do make my hair more manageable so far. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it along with the construction paste and see how it goes..</li>
    <li> One day I got a haircut and my barber put this stuff on. As someone who gets out of the shower and has dry, puffy hair, this works great as a moisturizer. I used to use American Crew pomade every time I felt like doing my hair, but a lot of times I just end up using this instead for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my hair. I&#x27;m a guy and I have short hair so I don&#x27;t really worry much about it, but this stuff makes it feel amazing. Put it on after towel drying your hair when it&#x27;s just very slightly damp. It gives hair just enough hold so you can style it. It makes your hair a little bit greasy-feeling for a little, but it goes away throughout the day. Love to put it in my hair and just ruffle it to give it a messy look. My girlfriend loves it in my hair. I haven&#x27;t really used it for my body because I feel like it just makes my skin too oily, which only gets a lot worse when you get wet. It&#x27;s great for the hair though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair super soft&lt;br /&gt;can use it to style hair (nothing too drastic though)&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair slightly greasy for a little while</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for 2 years and love it. worth every penny I have spent. blah, blah, blah, blah! (had to meet the word count requirements!)</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. On days where I don&#x27;t feel like using a lot of hair product on my hair, I just use this instead. It holds it in place great, and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also just a solid lotion for your hands and arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years to style my short hair.  Even in sunny Florida it works and holds very well.</li>
    <li> According to my stylist, my hair is softer to work with</li>
    <li> I use this product daily when i get out of the shower and as hair gel. so far so good.  The wife and kids like it as well and sometimes use it too.  It also smells.</li>
    <li> Where I live is extremely dry and this product helps that without leaving it feeling weighed down. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  It&#x27;s not too creamy and the smell is not overwhelming. I will purchase this item again..</li>
    <li> Over all, this is good. I&#x27;m a guy and I got it for my dry scalp. It works ok for the scalp, still have some flakes though. My hair is really soft and it works ok for styling hair. Over all, not super impressed, but I&#x27;ll probably buy it again because it&#x27;s healthy and I don&#x27;t have anything that works better.</li>
    <li> use it for everything, seriously everything</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize well.</li>
    <li> I love it because it is a cure for my seborrheic dermatitis on my face. If you have seborrheic dermatitis I would recommend you to use it. Also it is good moisturizer. I also use it for my hair and it is pretty cool.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by a hair stylist to my bald husband several years ago.  He uses it all of the time.  Have had difficulty find it in stores so ordered it here.  My only nit is that I just bought two more bottles at the swap meet that were lower in cost.  Will not need to find again for a long time.</li>
    <li> My second bottle. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well and keeps my hair in control. Love the smell too~~!!</li>
    <li> I love PM TTO Shampoo and Conditioner. When i received this, I had hopes that it would compliment my hair as the other products had. Unfortunately, it did not. It made my scalp really dry and didn&#x27;t absorb into my hair which left it feeling greasy. Sorry PM, I cannot recommend this product for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this as a skin moisturizer and it is absolutely wonderful. Quickly absorbs into the skin and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to put any gel or mousse in my hair so I bought this to try it out.  It works GREAT!  Leaves my hair shiny and manageable without the stickiness of other hair products.  It has a nice minty smell to it which I love as well.</li>
    <li> Tried on my skin, but realized that I don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil.  To me this product smells like Lysol with perfume added to reduce the smell.</li>
    <li> Seems expensive to me, but I use just a dab of this every day to give my hair some hold. Not like a gel but enough to keep it from losing the part.</li>
    <li> My husband had dandruff very bad and this product was recommended by the lady who cuts his hair. He started using this and pretty much within a week or less you could tell a huge difference. He no longer has dandruff and his hair has never looked better. This is not greasy or waxy and a little goes a long way! Great product and smells nice as well!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  But be warned.  When you buy it online, the contents will separate.  Even when you shake it up, I think the stuff still doesn&#x27;t quite turn out as well as if you buy it in a store.</li>
    <li> I use this in lieu of hair gel, or any other hair products. It gives my hair a good look and feel without the harmful residue from other hair products. In addition, it is cheaper over time if you have short hair. The bottle lasts me about 5-6 months.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this product and now has an all in one for hair control and body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Moisturize your hair and skin all in one fell swoop!  Would be nice if they could add a little SPF to it, but really can&#x27;t complain.  Smells great, goes on with a light feel, tingles a bit.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my hair stylus, she but it in my hair under protest. Well I liked the way my hair felt and retained it shape. I have never been a hair jell kind of guy and this isn&#x27;t hair jell so I am okay. My hair and scalp are thanking me for the switch.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. It does not take much to use but works very well and smells great</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my oily hair. I bought Suave 1.99 shampoo and that actually worked better than this amazingly enough. I was very happy but disappointed I had already spent $40 on a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Package came on time. The product was perfect!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the smell</li>
</ol>
