<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> best value,works well</li>
    <li> Good SPF for the buck. Goes on quickly for a workout or session at the beach. Probably not the best protection out there but not bad either.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and after using this product i have blisters oozing out on my back ,my whole back feels like its on fire,I put it on my neck and back area,this did not protect me,i wasn&#x27;t in a pool and i was only outside 4 hours, after I took a shower I could still smell the lotion on my skin,nasty product and will not buy ever again! I hate banana boat, and you people have been warned!</li>
    <li> The only thing I know about sun burns is that I&#x27;m prone to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I know about sun tan lotion is that I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen saved my skin during the grueling four days that I spent in the Tennessee sun at Bonnaroo 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reapplied the lotion ever 3 hours, and came out with a beautiful tan and absolutely no burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I didn&#x27;t shower for the entire 4 days of the festival, and I didn&#x27;t break out or anything. I was piling lotion on top of lotion on top of lotion with no ill effects. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s even worth mentioning, but there you have it.</li>
    <li> I guess this is not for the face...getting all sorts of trouble on facial skin after using this. But generally satisfied with this one</li>
    <li> Dissapointed I bought 3 for our trip to FL. The very next day  after arrival in the mail I saw in two retail stores a much cheaper price per OZ . I had bought this with the e coupon on line thought it was a deal. I guess I need to shop retail 1st before buying on line.</li>
    <li> I wear this sunscreen everyday.  I love the 50spf because its not too thick and I get great protection.  I love the way my skins shines after I put it on.</li>
    <li> Much needed, I have tattoos and apply sun screen and sun block every day before going outside totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Love the family size, but I don&#x27;t use it yet!</li>
    <li> Product is great, but the pump became broken in shipping, we still used it as we were leaving on a cruise and did not have time to deal with a return.</li>
    <li> Much less inexpensive than buying at a retailer. Good quality product that protects all day long. Simple and easy to use</li>
    <li> One of them had a leak. But these are good.</li>
    <li> This is the sunblock that never rubs in! You can keep rubbing but your skin will still have the visible white lotion layer on your skin. Does not absorb or disappear like other sunblocks. So frustrating!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen it protected me from the sun i did not get sunburned and where i live it is sunny even at night.</li>
    <li> When in the water I would say this lotion needs to be reapplied every hour or so. I used it for ~3 hours while in and out of the water on the beach (air drying in between, no rubbing with a towel or anything) and I still got a decent tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale. VERY pale; not an albino and not even blond, but pale and I burn very quickly. When I bike in warm/hot weather I wear a long-sleeve shirt designed to protect from UV, full-finger gloves, and a very wide 360° brim on my helmet so I need sunscreen on my legs from just above the knee to my ankles and on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I have been using a CVS Pharmacy-branded Nutrogena knockoff that comes in a tube. It has a scent which is pleasant and slightly fruity which I could live without but doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s SPF 55, goes on nicely, feels smooth, soaks into my skin quickly, lasts a long time even when I&#x27;m sweating, and it doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; so I barely notice it when it&#x27;s on and doing its job. Unfortunately, it is also relatively expensive; the actual Nutrogena product is even more expensive than the store-branded knockoff. If I were just using it on my face as I do in cooler weather when my legs are fully covered I&#x27;d keep using it, but when I have to cover my legs I go through the tube of sunscreen too fast making it very uneconomical to use during the mid-spring through mid-fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save some money, I decided to try this Banana Boat with SPF 50. It has no odor. It&#x27;s not as smooth as the Nutrogena and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily but it&#x27;s not a problem in that regard, either. It takes longer to soak into my skin but again, not a big problem. It continues to do its job even during and after a heavy sweat. The one downside is that, even hours after I&#x27;ve put it on, my skin feels like I have lotion on it which is not a feeling I enjoy. At all. It also seems difficult to wash off in the shower, which I guess means it&#x27;s really waterproof but it doesn&#x27;t have a good &amp;#34;skin feel&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t like being distracted by it for hours at a time. I can deal with it on my legs, I guess, but on my face it bugs the heck out of me. I would have taken off two stars but the price per volume of this stuff is so much better that I took off only one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I like the pump bottle more than a squeeze tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy this again after my current pump-bottle is empty? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m thinking that, once this bottle is done, I&#x27;ll buy a tube of Nutrogena just for my face and another bottle of this Banana Boat just for my legs.ook off only one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I like the pump bottle more than a squeeze tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy this again after my current pump-bottle is empty? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m thinking that, once this bottle is done, I&#x27;ll buy a tube of Nutrogena just for my face and another bottle of this Banana Boat just for my legs.</li>
    <li> Says family size. Not sure what size family this is for. It&#x27;s good for like two people.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly, this sunscreen is THICK and spreads easily. 2-3 pumps takes care of my chest, arms, face and neck.  Other than that very minor complaint, this sunscreen works great - soaks in quickly without leaving an oily feeling, isn&#x27;t affected by sweat, doesn&#x27;t look/feel weird after being in the water, and lasts as long, if not longer, than it claims to.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to sunscreen for my pale, sensitive skin. I adore the pump bottle, which makes it easy to use. Also appreciate the lack of any scent. No nasty sunscreen smell or funky coconut odor.</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily and it is not too greasy and easy to rub in.</li>
    <li> I live in the UAE and am out in the sun often so need serious sunscreen. I hate the way most sunscreens feel but can honestly say this is the best one I have tried. It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, even after sweating. It is fragrance free and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Would purchase again it really work and even safe for my face</li>
    <li> I started using it recently and I just love this sunscreen. It is non sticky and really protects the skin from tanning. I was avoiding sun screens because they make your skin very sticky and oily but this one does not and I am sticking to it. I love it and it is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Keeps the sun off my dome.</li>
    <li> My derm doc very happy that I&#x27;m using spf 50 especially here in the desert southwest. This is great stuff - not greasy and it lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> My kids got burned because of this crap. It melts and runs in your eyes at the slightest provocation and even though I reapplied every HALF HOUR (instead of the 50 minutes advertised) it doesn&#x27;t last.  Stings the eyes too.</li>
    <li> I love pump dispensers so this sunscreen in a family size is definitely convenient for me. I keep it in the bathroom by our lotion (also a family-size pump) so it is always easy to remember to apply it before we head outside. The sunscreen itself absorbs easily and does not smell.</li>
    <li> This is n absolutely great product and this particular container is extremely convenient.</li>
    <li> Used it on my week long trip to PuntaCana, DR. Only little bit spreads a long way and is very effective against direct sun. Lasts a while even in water.</li>
    <li> My 2nd favorite after the spray pump oil by banana boat. Love the convenience of the pump. We go through about 2 a summer since we&#x27;re heavy beach goers. Not greasy and pretty much no scent. Love being able to get 99% of the product out of the container!</li>
    <li> I originally gave this product 5 stars but now I&#x27;m dropping down to 4 stars because it leaves a white film on my skin.  I&#x27;m a dark skinned African American, and I originally bought this product to protect my skin from the sun while I was toning it. I mean it was great at protecting my skin and it was moisturizing too but it left a white film that caused me to look ashy. 4 STARS!</li>
    <li> Good product and price but mine came with the nozzle broken...</li>
    <li> Works well. just as advertised. Don&#x27;t expect this to work like regular lotion because its not going to feel like it, it a bit heavier than moisturizer but helps out if your thinking about spending some time in the sun,</li>
    <li> works like a charm in Jamaica.</li>
    <li> Anything over SPF 50 is bogus. This worked quite well and was gentle enough for use on my 3 year old. No one got a single sunburn.</li>
    <li> Great sunblock to use for my family. We took one bottle to the beach and it kept our family sunburn free and enjoying the water.</li>
    <li> It works for me (no sunburn when out in the sun all day) and seems to hold up well in ocean water.</li>
    <li> We used every drop while in Jamaica and never got burnt, thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my little one, and it seems good to protect him.</li>
    <li> Great price! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> What else can you say. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, screens the body from the blazing rays of the sun.  It works well.</li>
    <li> The pump does not work.  The contents does.  They need to use a better pump.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go out without this one. Really does a good job at blocking the sun rays. Gotta take good care of my skin nowadays.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen but wish it was more waterproof for my kiddos.  It goes on easy and is great for hanging outside in the summer but it says &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;proof&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I always use this sunscreen, this size is perfect.</li>
    <li> Best deal..I use for daily runs...and it is way less expensive then buying the tube in the store.  Also..love the pump version..</li>
    <li> For the summer to go out to play with</li>
    <li> I got this quickly, and a good price.  But I specifically bought it for the pump, which was broken when I got it. Like others, I have to pour it out of the bottle, which is a real pain.  But I do like the lotion for running, not greasy or smelly.  But the pump is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> If you have a giant jug of sunscreen with a pump, you are more likely to use it. So I sprinkle these around our yard, garage, our pool area.  Never have an excuse not to screen up.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is unbelievably awesome. It works really well. It is perfect for my family and I! Happy to have bought it!</li>
    <li> Well this is the best sunscreen lotion I have ever come across,&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;- Spreads well&lt;br /&gt;- stays on even if u sweat in the heat outside&lt;br /&gt;- does not leave a white layer when it gets wet&lt;br /&gt;- is kind of waterproof&lt;br /&gt;- non sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;Not that I know of any !</li>
    <li> This is all I use on my family for a day in the sun!  Super easy to pump and spread on, rub in.  Great price compared to big box stores.  This is in my Subscribe N Save order!</li>
    <li> I love this like lotion!  This s*** is awesome and I am confident that I am less likely to develop skin cancer because I wear this s*** all the time!</li>
    <li> Nice big bottle with convenient pump dispenser. I am not sunburned after a hot Florida summer day so I will give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Holds up to the water great. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it takes a very long time to rub in.</li>
    <li> Great product.  goes on smooth.  Does the job for a good price.</li>
    <li> Maybe all sp50 is like this, but I don&#x27;t like how much white residue this adds. It is very viscous and hard to spread evenly. I prefer a SPF30 sport formula that I can cover my whole body.</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen. Does its job, and I like the pump like dispenser.</li>
    <li> Works great! I believe the lotion provides greater protection than sprays. We used this during our trips to the lake, no one got sunburned. Easy to apply, and best of all the pump can easily be turned &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t leak in our bags while traveling.</li>
    <li> Top broke off on the first use :( maybe I didn&#x27;t press right....</li>
    <li> Satisfied my need perfectly. Provides protection from sun and most important of all it is it is water proof. So does not drip and enter into eyes or anything.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.</li>
    <li> Banana  boat is a brand you can trust... Spent. A week in Mexico and did not burn.  Be sure to reapply as directed.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Rubs in with a little effort.</li>
    <li> Not greasy! Nice smell!</li>
    <li> i PUT IT ON EVERY MORNING.  ON FACE, APPLY IT AFTER YOU PUT ON YOUR MOISTURIZER.  GIVE IT A FEW MINUTES TO SOAK IN.</li>
    <li> Stays put -no joke-due to its specifically labeled &amp;#34;power stay technology&amp;#34; (there are other varieties in same colored bottle without this technology, so FYI); I slapped some on my back and missed some spots so now I have a handprint on my back from where this sunblock protected me from getting burned! And it offers broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) protection from both aging and skin cancer damage</li>
    <li> I had that sunscreen before and was totally satisfied, smell neutral, very easy to apply, after a few minutes you didn&#x27;t even realize that you wear sunscreen, good protection, size, price, package! Everything fitted.&lt;br /&gt;Now, application is a torture, my kids run for their life when I approach them with the bottle, the smell is disgusting, and on the skin it&#x27;s unbearable, feels as if you are wrapped into plastik, sweaty and oily. My husband, whom I could convince to use sunscreen with the last bottle, now rather goes with a jacket, jeans and hat on a hike  at 100 degrees than taking only 1 drop of sunscreen. Protection is still good, thats why I gave it 2 stars. We now only use it before swimming and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Stains clothes! I&#x27;m a runner,  I apply a small amount to my neck and arms - nothing excessive -  and i started noticing these orange stains on my running singlets. I just figured this one white one I owned was getting old. Some time passes and I then notice the stains to a white collared shirt (wore it at the beach) . I didn&#x27;t put two and the together until I JUST went on a decent run and started seeing the orange residue after just two miles into my little jaunt. Terribly disappointing. I used Banana Boat before -  maybe the 30 spf - without any issue. Um dumping this stuff.</li>
    <li> As people who spend most of our time outdoors and in and out of the water, Banana Boat has worked out to be the best overall product for skin protection that we have tried. It is easy to apply, non greasy, and lasts a very long time, even with long water immersion periods. We camp and windsurf, and a once-daily early morning application to face, neck, arms and legs lasts all day, although a second application can be helpful if, for example, you rub your face with a towel after coming out of the water. But it&#x27;s amazing that it doesn&#x27;t sweat off, even on very hot days, nor does it wash off while being splashed at 35+ mph on the water. And yet it washes off easily with soap and water, not like some other protections that you really need to scrub several times to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about different chemicals in lotions possibly being as bad (that is, potential to induce melanoma) as no coverage at all, and this may prove to be true. But because the research keeps changing on this as with many other things that we use or consume, we&#x27;ve decided to use this as our primary skin cover. It&#x27;s not a complete cover like some zinc-based lotions we&#x27;ve used--you do still tan a bit through it--but we have never burned with it, even with prolonged exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were to use it wearing just a bathing suit and &amp;#34;lying out&amp;#34; all day, I&#x27;m not sure that it would work as well. We are quite careful to avoid direct sunlight whenever we can, so I&#x27;m sure that we are reducing overall exposure. But when every day is spent outside hiking and/or windsurfing, our best efforts to avoid sun still mean that we&#x27;re getting a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our previous best choice was Solar Sense lotion, which is Zinc based. This seemed to provide even better coverage, and was also extremely water and sweat resistant. But it was thicker and therefor more difficult going on, and much harder to wash off at the end of the day--or even to thoroughly wash off your hands so it was cool to handle sunglasses without mucking them up. Banana Boat is much easier to clean up,and therefore is not as much of an issue. But Solar Sense may ultimately be the better protection.o it was cool to handle sunglasses without mucking them up. Banana Boat is much easier to clean up,and therefore is not as much of an issue. But Solar Sense may ultimately be the better protection.</li>
    <li> Applies easily with pump. I like to buy a new bottle every year. Has a nice coconut fragrance. Good deal</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first 2 days of my hikes at Zion National Park. The third day I was going to relax and just stroll around the park but my friend insisted we do more hiking. Thus, I only quickly apply some and ended up getting sunburn afterwards. It does last for quite a while, depending on how much you&#x27;ve applied. And most importantly it works great :)</li>
    <li> So easy to dispense into my hand. 2 shots does my face, ears, neck &amp; arms for walking about here in the tropics.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, not too sticky sunscreen. Great value for waterproof protection.</li>
    <li> This product is smooth dislove easy to wear,  not leave skin white.&lt;br /&gt;Good for every day use for summer time.</li>
    <li> used it on a kayaking trip and compared to my friends who had a different kind, I did very well; no sunburn despite being on the water in full sun all day</li>
    <li> I like this product in that is goes on easily and smells good. I am out in the yard frequently in the hot sun and find it works well.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps me whiter than Powder and I&#x27;m not riddled with cancer!</li>
    <li> I chose it because it was cheap and banana products I understand are OK. it&#x27;s a good product. It&#x27;s big and great for family use. it also arrived in great time and well packed. Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item, I assumed (wrongly) that the pump applicator would have some sort of guard or protector on it to prevent it being pressed down during shipment.  It does not.  When the package arrived, not only were the contents of the package coated with sunscreen, but the pump was damaged beyond repair.  The manufacturers of this product should either 1) change the type of cap they use to one that will not leak when the product is being shipped, or 2) put some sort of protective covering on the applicator so that it cannot be pressed down and damaged during shipment.&lt;br /&gt;I think the sunscreen is otherwise good, but unless they fix the problem with the applicator I don&#x27;t recommend buying it online.</li>
    <li> By far the best sun screen I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;going to the public pool&amp;#34; smell, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and it works great.  I only wish this wasn&#x27;t an Add-on item and they would sell it straight up so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy other stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a great brand!  This is our favorite sunscreen to use all summer long!  Goes on easy and isn&#x27;t greasy, and it does the job!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen worked well and it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> Spent a week in Guatemala, outdoors a lot of the time and came home with virtually no color but a slight watchband line.</li>
    <li> A really good value for the price. I keep one bottle by the front door and one by the back door and I put it on myself or the kids as we head outside. It stays in place without being too greasy.</li>
    <li> big value. Need spf 100 in this size.</li>
    <li> This goes on well, isn&#x27;t too oily,  doesn&#x27;t make you look pale, and blocks the sun as advertised.  I got EltaMD SPF 50 as well, and though it&#x27;s great, it isn&#x27;t significantly better (or even noticeably different) from this stuff.  Given this and the price, I&#x27;d go with this one (or a smaller bottle of this) over the pricier sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I was putting this on every hour at the beach and my face still ended up getting really sun burned.</li>
    <li> This sun screen worked great. I tend to burn and peel and did not have an issue this year.  We went to Cape Cod and sat on the beach for many hours.  Plus my tan seemed to last at least 2 weeks upon my return from vacation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally blonde-headed, blue-eyed, and extremely pale. I often joke that I can look at a picture of the sun and burn. In reality - all it takes is 20 minutes in direct sunlight for me to go home with a slight sunburn. So you can imagine that sunscreen is extremely important to me - especially when I am swimming the day away. I&#x27;ve had my bottle for quite some time and have never burned while using this. Just a few weeks ago I went swimming at a friend&#x27;s house for a couple of hours and slathered this on about 30 minutes before I went swimming. I didn&#x27;t reapply and did not burn. I find that giving my skin time to absorb the sunscreen allows it to work better if I am going to be in water.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels good, excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> I feel I received a bad bottle that was past its shelf life. I returned to Florida as I do this time of year with temperatures ranging from 70-80°. I always use sunblock and do not burn. I used the SPF 50 the first day and burned badly. As a result I threw the bottle away and am disappointed due to the skin damage.</li>
    <li> As sunscreen goes, this one isn&#x27;t that sticky.  Also, the pump just makes it that much easier to apply, especially to squirmy kids.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when I need it.</li>
    <li> Out of all the sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried, we find that Banana Boat sport sunscreen works the best (especially at the beach/pool). It stays on &amp; protects you from sunburn. We used it in the Caribbean last year &amp; came back with a nice tan, not a sunburn.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been pretty hot this summer.  Love the pump dispenser design, remember to reapply every 2 hours.</li>
    <li> 100 degree Arizona vacation, and pasty white skin sounds like a bad time. No burns here, or on my pasty children. Works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent sun protection</li>
    <li> good as sunscreen protection goes. lots of chemicals and the lid feel off on the first use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Banana Boat Sport for years, ever since I was a kid packing it for camp. It protects, spreads, well and doesn&#x27;t budge. And believe me, I&#x27;d know... I&#x27;m a ghost-colored redhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is really about the packaging. The pump dispenser is GENIUS! I have a four-year-old son and maneuvering a regular sunscreen tube with a cap while trying to lather him up? And keep it out of his eyes? And avoid straddling him and pinning him down in a way that might alert child services? FORGET ABOUT IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so that might be a little exaggeration, but you know the small things really add up when you have kids. Being able to squeeze this out one-handed is such a nice convenience. We go through a lot of this stuff around here and I haven&#x27;t had trouble with it clogging or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is popular enough to stick around!</li>
    <li> great price this stuff works great and goes on easy for 50</li>
    <li> Comes in a nice big bottle and since it&#x27;s SPF 50 I can go on my 2+ hour bike rides in the sun and not get burned, rather I get super tanned.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Non greasy and protects well. I have a fair complection and go for long extended bike rides in the hot sun sweating all the time but don&#x27;t burn thanks to banana boat.</li>
    <li> I love this sunblock!  It prevents the sun from burning me and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  You can find my exhaustive review here http://goo.gl/9X1kX0 .  I always throw a bottle or two of this in my checked luggage when I head to the islands.  It&#x27;s affordable and I have not found a sunscreen lotion that I like more.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Works. Doesn&#x27;t smell. Burns eyes less than other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> the pump bottle is very convenient and it keeps my son from burning to a crisp when applied every 90 minutes or so.  With swimming every day we&#x27;re going through about 2-3 bottles over the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair-skinned and try to keep out of the sun as much as possible, but when I go on vacation I still want to have a good time and be outdoors without worrying about my skin. I used this stuff for a week at the beach where I was outside most of the time and did not get burnt or even a hint of a tan. This stuff rubs in very easily as well.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to.  I like the pump top instead of having to squeeze the bottle to get the sunscreen out.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Protected my easily burnt skin from the Australian sun.</li>
    <li> Great smell and protection! Better price on Amazon than Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Spreads well and evenly. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some of the other lotions.</li>
    <li> works, usually only wear if im going the beach.</li>
    <li> Dispenser works great.  But the reason I give it a low rating is because the sunscreen did not run into skin quickly.  It took much longer to rub it in than my other Banana Boat sunscreen.  So there was a difference with this.</li>
    <li> smaller than expected but we (4 of us) used it a whole week during vacation and we still have more than half the bottle left even though we used it a lot. and it isn&#x27;t as oily as some of the other products i have used in the past.</li>
    <li> A lot. Not greasy at all. Perfect for family use.</li>
    <li> Hard to find the pump bottles at our regular stores.  Makes it easy and handy to have sunscreen ready for summer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sunblock, what more can I say. It protects the skin well and wasn&#x27;t overly expensive and the packaging is recycleable.</li>
    <li> Arrived just as ordered; best price I found. Product is good for members in our family who are sensitive to other brands.</li>
    <li> I brought one bottle of this Sunscrees Lotion to Maldives with my family(3 persons). It&#x27;s a very useful product when you go to seaside. We&#x27;re so happy we have a good vacation there. Our skins are protected well with this lotion. It&#x27;s true waterproof.</li>
    <li> Works really good.  Very good product, especially in Phoenix where the suns rays can beat you to death.</li>
    <li> Recomento a todos. Produto de &amp;oacute;tima qualidade e entrega dentro do prazo combinado no Brasil. Fiquei muito satisfeito com a compra.</li>
    <li> This is great sunscreen but I don&#x27;t like that when I rub it in it stays white on my skin. It takes about 5-10 minutes for it to turn clear. Not bad though, especially if you&#x27;re prone to missing spots when applying. Protects my skin great.</li>
    <li> Some time back I purchased this product for use on a vacation to the lake where it was sunny, worked great and I had a great vacation.  Each day I lathered up and enjoyed not getting burned but I really fell in love with the great sunscreen smell and when I got home from the trip found that I was really bummed to not have that great smell.  I found myself periodically opening the bottle to breathe it in and reminisce.  Finally one day I decided to put some on even though it wasn&#x27;t sunny, and I was overjoyed to learn that the product also works really well when not sunny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoying the product as I do, I began to become concerned about the amount of money I was spending on the product on a monthly basis.  I found the family size bottle and was nervous to try since I don&#x27;t have a family, but was thrilled to identify that the product also works just as well if you don&#x27;t have a family.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  We use Banan Boat all time.</li>
    <li> We found it offered good protection but is way too greasy.</li>
    <li> Price was right.  Feels the same as many of the other lotions.</li>
    <li> Good product and great prices. I will buy this again when needed. you should too. i took it on vacation.</li>
    <li> Way better value than buying at your typical drugstore! I prefer banana boat over coppertone sport.</li>
    <li> I took this to Antarctica (sunburn is a risk there, holes in the Ozone and what have you) and throughout South America. I was outside a lot and was careful to put lots on twice a day, morning and afternoon. The lotion did the job, I never burned once. The \\&quot;family size\\&quot; is good value for money. A family-sized bottle lasted me three weeks; your mileage will obviously vary based on size of family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fifth star because the formulation is a little greasy. A little residue dripped into my eye once while hiking (I was perspiring) and the irritation/pain was intense. Children should be closely supervised during application, and the rest of us need to be extra careful with how we apply to our foreheads.</li>
    <li> Came as described.  Did not spill during shipping as a lot of these types of products tend to do.  The sunscreen itself is great because it doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky feeling most sunscreen/sunblock does.  My favorite type of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, good protection.</li>
    <li> Great product and cheap! ☺</li>
    <li> I got this to keep by the door, so my husband and I would remember to put sunscreen on whenever we go outside (we&#x27;re new homeowners and are constantly doing yard work, walking our new dog, etc.). I wanted a pump because no one wants to fiddle with the greasy bottle, and I didn&#x27;t want sunscreen residue getting on the table. This is perfect for our needs and Banana Boat is a trusted company. I just wish they had a fragrance-free variety. Then it&#x27;d be perfect overall! Still, great and handy to have lying around to encourage people to lather up before going outside.</li>
    <li> This is nice sunscreen however the top was broken and will not pump the lotion out. I have to unscrew the cap everytime and pour it out.</li>
    <li> Gift. Stated it worked for the kids and kept them from suffering from the sun.</li>
    <li> No complaints about the price (I got it for about $9) or the quality of the product. This kept us entirely free of sunburn in Hawaii and Arizona. Yay for healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The pump can be put into &amp;#34;closed/off&amp;#34; position to avoid leakage, but to be safe we still put it inside a plastic bag so it didn&#x27;t get goop on the rest of our luggage.</li>
    <li> Nice its good product in time, nice pakage i recomended..,....</li>
    <li> Use this sunscreen almost daily, it is not greasy and lasts a long time even when sweaty/active. Will continue buying, the pump is so convenient!</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Tends to stain clothing when perspiring heavily.</li>
    <li> The minute I put this on my skin turned red. I looked it up online and it has oxybenzone that causes allergy. My doctor said not to use it again. This is what it says on the internet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EWG&#x27;s Sunscreen Hall of Shame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Banana Boat Quik Blok Sunblock Spray Lotion, SPF 35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why: Contains 4 percent oxybenzone, a chemical that according to EWG can cause allergic reactions and may disrupt the body&#x27;s natural hormones, and is more easily absorbed by kids&#x27; skin (though the FDA maintains that it has no data showing that using a sunscreen with oxybenzone is unsafe).</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors in the summer and need a sunscreen which lasts all day and won&#x27;t run into my eyes when I sweat. The pump is very convenient (much preferred to the squeeze tubes which are messier to use) and it goes on smooth and rubs in easily. One application in the morning and I&#x27;m good all day, and a bottle has lasted me a year so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good sunblock, I sunburn easily and this one protects me for a good couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Great Deal !  more efficient than spray.  Used it vacation to Aruba</li>
    <li> Banana Boat sounds like it would be gimmicky and less than serious, but this is the best PABA-based sunscreen!  It lasts longer than other sunscreens, works better, and tends to be less expensive than most.  None of the PABA sunscreens seem to last through the winter --&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s best to buy a new bottle every spring even if you haven&#x27;t used up the old one.&lt;br /&gt;I like to put it on an hour or so before I go to the beach, and that seems to do the trick for me, even though I&#x27;m very pale.</li>
    <li> This is always my sunscreen of choice and for the price plus the $1 off coupon they gave me it was great!</li>
    <li> Very nice and good quality. I recommend</li>
    <li> It a is very thin sunscreen.  If it is humid [as it is now in Southern California] it sweats off immediately.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful produt.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. We buy only this brand because for us this is perfect</li>
    <li> Great for Golfers...Apply every 9 holes...esp for walkers</li>
    <li> Works great. Have to rub it in a little, but seems to do an excellent job. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which I like.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to sunblock. Low cost, not too greasy.</li>
    <li> I obviously LOVE sunscreen!! BUT the family size is not as family friendly as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s a small bottle.</li>
    <li> Though a little too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; for my taste, I have been using this product for over a year now and love it. It really works well, protects as expected and the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; face application is more on me who have a naturally oily skin. Great product and top protection.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE  this sunscreen i usually have to buy super expensive dermatologist recommended stuff but this is just fine and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or make me break out!</li>
    <li> I have tried the rest this works the best hands down. It got rated the best even over the expensive stuff so buy it..I play sports and just like they say it will not burn your eyes and non greasy and that is what I like..</li>
    <li> I use this on while cycling and so far it is working great! It looks to say on even with sweat.</li>
    <li> Works well. Love the pump. Not greasy. Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good quality, nice value.</li>
    <li> I needed a sunscreen that I could apply daily after my shower that did not have that greasy feel. This stuff is great. Usually when you get above thirty spf it tends to be greasy and does not absorb like a good moisturizer, this absorbs immediately. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like banana boat so much.&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with the first site of it and this one is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product. So hard to find this in stores nowadays!</li>
    <li> It is cheap and great.</li>
    <li> Living in Arizona, SPF 50 is ALL I use!  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> good buy. Thick and cheap</li>
    <li> This sunscreen protected us through a year living in the Middle East, where we were in the pool and the sun a LOT!  It works well.  I used it to fill smaller bottles for travel and for the diaper bag.  Definitely nice to have the family size container when trying to slather it on myself and the kid for the pool each day.  The sunscreen sprays are easier, but after I heard warnings that they can cause lung damage when breathed (hard to avoid breathing it) especially in kids, I am happy to stay old school.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and perfect. It is very good . I&#x27;m satisfied. I totally recommend</li>
    <li> The whole family used this sunscreen during a reunion, and everyone was really happy with it. We all spent a lot of time in the water and didn&#x27;t have to keep re-applying it. No one got sun-burned.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Sweat proof&amp;#34; this product talks about is apparently just your casual lying around the pool type of perspiration.  I put the stuff on my head (shaved head) and about two to three miles into a 10k run, I had sun screen burning my eyes, and it&#x27;s not a pleasant feeling.  If you run with it on your face, I recommend a head band.  I haven&#x27;t found a good option yet that actually doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes while running; have tried Bull Frog and a few others.  Any tips greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> Got my SPF for a while! I got it because of the jumbo size.</li>
    <li> Goes on thick enough that you feel protected; provided good overall protection as we didn&#x27;t burn.  No nonsense or unexpected scent.</li>
    <li> Very good sunscreen. Not too greasy and does the job really well. I use SPF 50 most of the time.</li>
    <li> Cant wait for holidays to use this Sunscreen Family Pack spf50.&lt;br /&gt; I have used spf 30 and found this sunscreen very good for me.</li>
    <li> This works great!  We have used it at the zoo, swimming, and an amusement park and it has kept all of us burn free every time.  It isn&#x27;t quite as handy to put on as the spray types, but offers excellent protection that last for hours.</li>
    <li> This product might be great, if I could actually open it. The bottle has a pump, but the pump comes in a locked position that I have never seen on any other pump. You&#x27;d think there was poison in it for how difficult it is to open. I still haven&#x27;t figured it! Screwing the top off defeats the purpose (and convenience) of having a pump, so I likely will not use this product. I want a refund.</li>
    <li> Took this to the Dominican republic on vacation and it worked great</li>
    <li> I got sunburnt within the first hour, and it was applied twice, with no water contact. Not a very good product.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday on my hands and arms, i really like it. Its not greasy and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve used many sun screens and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> We used on our trip to HI.  Kids complained of it stinging.</li>
    <li> Applied Banana Boat SPF50 Sport on my skin the other afternoon and spent a little less than half and hour talking with a friend outside her home.  I wound up with what looks like chemical burns.  My skin turned bright red and the resulting itching lasted for about four days.  In all, it took me about a week to recover.  I never had any peeling (like comes after a sunburn), so I&#x27;m assuming there was something in the bottle that didn&#x27;t agree with my skin (to say the least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#x27;d never recommend this to a friend, but if you&#x27;re going to use it, you may want to start with use on a small area of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see a place to put up pics of my skin...but I&#x27;ve got them if anyone is interested.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m ready for Hawaii!!</li>
    <li> It works really well, the size is convenient and it doesnt smell bad. It is perfect for the body but it is a little bit too shiny for my face.</li>
    <li> would prefer a spray but just personal preference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried over 6 different brans of sunscreen and this is definitely my favorite.  It spreads on easily and offers good protection.  I tried buying the Target Sport off brand and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good. It didn&#x27;t spread on nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Coppertone sport is my preferred brand due to less grease. I&#x27;ve had to use this recently with friends as there was no other alternative, and it worked fine. I wasn&#x27;t sunburned after a long multi hour hike.</li>
    <li> Non Greasey, no pimples, no sumburn.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a tractor driver at a golf course and I nake sure to apply every morning because I get severly burnt if I don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> We purchased this exact product (not from Amazon) on 3/17/2015. Our family went to Florida and on 3/21/2015 spent 3 hours on the beach. 6 people in our group used this product. 4 adults applied 3 times in 3 hours. 2 toddlers applied 5 times in the same 3 hours. Every one of them were sunburned, severely!!!&lt;br /&gt;One person used another brand of spf 50 and it protected as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one conclusion; this product did not offer any protection at all, it is dangerous to rely on and if you have purchased it return it.</li>
    <li> Lots of block for little money, love the dispenser bottle. Its a bit greasy, but its perfect for body block. Use something else for face if you don&#x27;t like the greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but I found it took FOREVER to rub into your skin. My 7-year-old was not super pleased standing still that long.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than the spray-on lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well.  We bought this large bottle for a week long beach trip (Mexico, so strong sun) and two of us used the whole thing up.  Lots of reapplication (we reapplied every 2 hours or after a dip in the ocean), no sunburn.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Value! I shopped around and this is the best value I found.&lt;br /&gt;-BROAD SPECTRUM! 50S PF!&lt;br /&gt;-Personally, I can&#x27;t smell it. Only if I sniff it or when I first put a large amount on my hand. But to be fair, I&#x27;ve never been sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;***I love the pump (with the close/open positions), it is very reliable. No matter what bottle I put in my purse (even the caps you twist close), somehow they ALWAYS end up spilling! :( Which is not only wasteful but messy. I have carried this bottle with me in my car, backpack, large purses and it has NEVER EVER spilled.&lt;br /&gt;-So much sunscreen you can share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s big. But that isn&#x27;t a con, really. If you want it to be portable, easy fix. Pump a little into a smaller container fixed!&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit thick, but as far as I know, all sunscreens are (and keep in mind, if it&#x27;s less than 35 SPF it&#x27;s not really sunscreen, also if it doesn&#x27;t have broad spectrum protection, it&#x27;s only half the protection). Takes lots of rubbing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is a GREAT value. When I was contemplating buying a sunscreen my Amazon Prime free trial had just run out. I wasn&#x27;t going to renew it but I went to Walgreens (which is cheaper than a lot of other stores) and looked at the sunscreens (and a couple other items I was shopping for). I took my phone out and compared the SPFs, oz amounts, and $ to the ones on Amazon. That settled it. I renewed my membership because with deals like this one, I KNEW I was going to shop in Amazon a lot more often.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who swims outdoors daily.  We&#x27;ve tried many different kinds but he keeps coming back to this...</li>
    <li> Sunblock, in a container my girls can use easily, everyday. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Some sunblocks burn when they eventually end up in your eyes when you sweat.  Well this does not burn at all, you can paste it on your eyelids and it still wont burn. Its the best sunblock I have tried and I have tried a few since I am in the sun alot.</li>
    <li> This has a great pump and stayed on in salt water. I missed a spot on my leg and got badly burnt once but the rest of my body was fine. It shows how it really does protect in a dramatic way!  I found it smelled fine- not bad but not good.  I did not have any allergic reactions and it absorbed well. In fact, other people who had their own sunscreen kept borrowing mine instead of using their own. Thank goodness, I had a big bottle!  It was enough for a 7-10 day trip to a tropical island for one person (with friends using occasionally).</li>
    <li> i work in landscaping which mean spending nine hours and thirty minutes under the burning sun and let me tell you this sunscreen is making one hell of a different.Good stuff :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair and very careful with exposure to sun due to dermatologist warning. This works very well for me. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> SPF 50 is great for the kids at the beach, and the pump makes application more hands-free. One of my daughters has sensitive skin and she loves this lotion.</li>
