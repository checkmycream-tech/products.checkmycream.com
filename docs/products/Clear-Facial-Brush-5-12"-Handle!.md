      <li>and it was okay.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>Love the feeling around the nose area.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. . . that is all.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it was going to be a little firm. In all reality they thing is like a baby&#x27;s brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i needed a facial cleaning brush that could be used in the shower. I have an electric one, but i cant use it in the shower. That was extremely inconvinient. This one works well, though it is really cheapy and crappy. It works well for scrubbing, but when it came the lid thing that goes on it was cracked and the actual brush was purple......... Yea i have no idea why but it isnt clear like as advertised. It is really small but it does the job. No other complaints. It works well for how little it costs</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a okay brush it does what u need it to do.  my face feels pretty clean after use.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The brissels are soft to the touch but to exfoliate pretty well. It is a good size. Small enough to fit into your toothe brush holder but big enough to get a good grip on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, it gets the job done. the bristles are not too hard so they won&#x27;t hurt your face. I use it on a daily basis but i do find the washcloth more useful</li>
    <li> The brush is very gentle, can be used every day. My face feels very clean when I use it. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Initially, I loved the cleansing and circulatory effect of this facial brush.  However, the handle broke on it&#x27;s third day of use, scratching my face in two places.  I will look for something more durable in future.</li>
    <li> The bristles are way too soft for it to be of any exfoliation benefit.  I&#x27;m very disappointed as far as that goes.  I use it mainly for scrubbing in my daily cleanser, and it&#x27;s nice for that, and my face does feel cleaner after using it that way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  I use it.  But, it&#x27;s not great.   Once used the outside bristles stick out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item noticing that the length of the handle would be perfect. The issue I had was the bristles being a little to long and toooo soft. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a toooo soft scrub but this product bristles are really soft and long.</li>
    <li> The handle seemed to be pretty thick, so I gave it a chance...wasted my money, it broke after about a month of use, and this is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve owned..I now have an electric one by Oil of Olay...has lasted great..just keep batteries around and use.</li>
    <li> As described, good value</li>
    <li> Bristles too soft. Brush just about worn out already.</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price. I would have liked the bristles to be a little less soft but over all good buy.</li>
    <li> These bristles are so soft, it feels great! I will buy this product again when it&#x27;s time to buy another.</li>
    <li> When this product first arrived, I was surprised at how small it seemed and wondered if it would be big enough to make a difference. However, though it wouldn&#x27;t hurt for it to be just a tad bigger, this brush is a great size for the face. The bristles are soft but, stiff. I apply my face wash to my face first and then follow with the brush so that I don&#x27;t lose much cleanser on the actual bristles themselves. It has helped to rejuvenate my overall skin health. A little bit of pressure works to exfoliate very well. With daily use, thus far, it has held up well and has not developed any unpleasant odors or mold/discoloration. I rinse the brush thoroughly after use and allow it to dry before recovering it with it&#x27;s included protective cup that is simple yet, well designed. Overall, great buy.</li>
    <li> i had a brush similar to this and it had worn out so i was so excited when i found this on Amazon. i ordered it and so happy this it!!![[ASIN:B000NCZ1HM Facial Brush Clear 5 1/2\\&quot; Handle]]</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loved it. It was just a quick buy until his motorized brush came in. For the time frame he used it, he loved it and it got the job done.</li>
    <li> I have never used a face brush before, but when I noticed my pores getting a little clogged, I was recommended to try this to exfoliate. I really like this brush because it&#x27;s cheap and simple yet it gets the job done! I can put any soap or face wash on it and the bristles are very soft to work around my face. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> After many years (and a case of pinkeye), I decided to replace my face brush.  The bristles are not as full as my previous brush; nevertheless, the brush does its job quite effectively.  I especially like the elegant design of the handle!</li>
    <li> Works awesome!!!!!!!! My face is super clean and the brush it soft :) We recommend to anyone who needs one:)</li>
    <li> I have very sensative facial skin and have to use prescription lotions on my face after I shave. I use to get this brush from a local discount store but they have not had any for about a year. They discontinued them. Then I turned my eye upon ole trusted Amazon.com when I want to find something that I cannot find elseware and as Julia Childs would use to say \\&quot;walla\\&quot;. It is a wonderful item and shall be purchasing many more to come Jim.</li>
    <li> Loved this item - I had purchased one of the fancier modeled face brush that came with batteries - it broke within days of my 3 year old getting a hold of it!  After he broke it, i still used it without the batteries - i then left it at a hotel in LA - and rather than tracking it down and rather than deal with a \\&quot;clunky\\&quot; model again, I went to Sephora to buy just a simple face brush with handle - well big surprise the line was way to long - so I thought i&#x27;d order it online at Sephora.com - wrong!  The shipping was the cost of the face brush - so I went to Amazon and boom - there it was! Great price - great shipping and I love it - I mainly love the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; appearance - call me OCD - but I love how it looks \\&quot;invisable\\&quot; and clean, as it is clear and blends in on the beautiful crystal bowl it is displayed in on my vanity/sink!  Love it! I also bought this type of cleansing brush as I am a runner in the desert (phoenix, az) and this thing keeps my pores super clean - just washing after a run isnt enough to keep break outs at bay - so I need a brush like this!</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good brush but if you have sensitive skin like me, the bristles are a bit harsh and scratchy.  This would be best for normal skin.</li>
    <li> I brush very gentle because still it is little harsh.  I&#x27;m very careful to wash with Philosophy &amp;#34;Microdelivery exfoliating wash&amp;#34;.  It is very excellent.</li>
    <li> I had a facial brush that I loved for years, but lost it.  So I replaced it with this facial brush - and the handle broke off in my travel bag a week after I got the brush.  Very disapointing!</li>
    <li> It worked well for facial cleaning not to harsh.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Easy and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Does the same job as the over $100 electric version. The bristles can be softer though. So do not use too much strength when you are using it.</li>
    <li> This little brush is the best thing that has ever happened to my face. It exfoliates without being too abrasive. I feel like its bristles are perfect. How anyone could say the bristles are too soft is beyond me. Have rhinos stared writing reviews on amazon? I was a bit concerned about someone saying it was too fragile when I was looking to purchase, but since it was so inexpensive I decided to go on ahead. It seems perfectly sturdy. I would just advise against scalding water which might weaken the plastic and being too rough with it in general. I also really like the size. The handle is easy to hold and the head is just wide enough. I&#x27;m really loving this brush!</li>
    <li> A bit rougher than I expected, but I&#x27;d rather have that as compared to too soft. Nice brush. I use often.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush just last week and within 2 days of using it the base of the bristles starting rusting turning the brush brown. It was gross. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this at all. Also, the brush looks nothing like the picture shown.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a brush like this for years. When the last one broke, I couldn&#x27;t find one at the stores where I usually bought it and was happy to see it was on Amazon. You don&#x27;t need expensive \\&quot;peels\\&quot; and \\&quot;skin re-surfacers\\&quot; all you need is one little brush.</li>
    <li> I use this brush on a regular basis to clean my face and it does a great job! I recommend buying this if you want to improve your skin.</li>
    <li> I first learned about the importance of using a good facial brush when I read a clinical study that showed that the Olay Professional Facial Brush helped skin care products to absorb better.  I bought that brush, and they were right!  I can&#x27;t believe how I thought a good facial brush was just a scam.  They really work to exfoliate and prepare your skin for other skin care products.  I really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay product runs on batteries, and I just wanted a simple facial brush for back-up when the batteries died.  I ordered the ForPro brush, and I&#x27;m glad I did!  It is just as effective as the Olay which cost 10 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never believed a facial brush was a must in my skin care routine, but now I&#x27;m a believer.  And the Forpro is just as good as much more expensive brands.  Plus you don&#x27;t need any batteries.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> firm enuff opens poors, and deeply cleanses. i let it air dry and then apply the cap. i make sure i use natural soap to sufficiently clean the bristles and get the bacteria off.</li>
    <li> I got this a month or two ago and my skin has never looked better. It has developed a few cracks (from being dropped) , But it still works very well.</li>
    <li> Way too rough on the skin, felt like I was rubbing a toothbrush on my skin. This is probably really damaging.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my glamor-conscious teenaged granddaughter. I have a similar product, but local stores carried nothing in this line. Seeing this on Amazon was perfect. It arrived promptly, at a very reasonable price. Best of all, my granddaughter is thrilled with it!</li>
    <li> If you are looking to achieve clean smooth skin, look no further than this facial brush. Aside from the obvious things that are necessary for healthy skin like a good facial cleanser, a good facial scrub, moisturizer, and an overall facial care regime, this is the product to buy. This brush thoroughly cleanses away  the dirt your cleanser left behind all while helping to exfoliate dead skin cells that leave your complexion really dull. My skin is healthier, smoother, and softer because I have not only added this brush into my daily routine but also because I try not to leave home without it.</li>
    <li> After barely one use, it broke into 3 pieces...not even worth the money I paid for it! I bought a better product at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush for promoting exfoliation of the skin. Cleans the face very well. I would recommend this brush for anyone with problem skin. Its just as good as the professional cleansing brushes, you just have to do the work.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Will definitely purchase again. Helped clear my skin a bit. I gave it four stars because the top for traveling was shattered when I received it :-(. I really needed it... other than that perfect size. Just perfect!</li>
    <li> This thing shed like crazy. i wish i could get my money back, i threw away the brush in less than 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial brush - nice and soft, yet it does the job.  I did order a clear handle brush, but received a white handle brush.  It doesn&#x27;t make that much difference to me, but I should have gotten what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Enjoy the facial brush as other reviwes have said it into nooks and crannies Was a Avon Rep and believe in cleaner as per soap.</li>
    <li> This brush is not a bad buy for the price, it works well with your scrub or cream cleanser, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> wayyy to rough and im a dude. search &amp;#34;dermalogica face brush&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;simple pore brush&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Just got this today, after trying it threw it away. theres your review.</li>
    <li> This brush is good to travel with, I don&#x27;t have room to pack my power cleaner all the time. I take on short trip. It work for me</li>
    <li> Rust formed just a day after use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never using it on my skin again.</li>
    <li> Instead of spending close to $300 for a mechanized facial brush, I chose this brush.  I have had a mechanical brush in the past and this facial brush works just as well.</li>
    <li> Wow, this brush was a huge disappointment. My advice to you is to keep looking for something better and bigger!</li>
    <li> I found it nearly impossible to find this sort of facial brush locally at ANY stores. And I did not want a battery operated fancy pants brush either. I just wanted a simple, soft ~ manual facial brush. THIS IS IT! Product arrived on time as promsed with no quality or shipping issues. 100% satisfied and would reorder!</li>
    <li> it geet the job done and it makes me feel like that I am actually cleaning my face.and its cool that if you buy one they give you a second one for free</li>
    <li> This item is much softer than my current facial brush and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing as good of a job at exfoliating my skin.  Not worth returning it....but will keep looking for a better replacement.</li>
    <li> not very good quality. would rather buy ones from sephora..</li>
    <li> Small compact and I could not find a brush like this at any drug store or Walmart. The price was great.  works well</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like my face was getting as clean as it should be so I decided to buy a facial brush. I&#x27;ve actually noticed a decrease in pimples on my face. The bristles are not very soft but for this price I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once and it was okay. I found that the bristles were a bit too soft and did not give me the good exfoliating feeling I was expecting. They are good for the price though and maybe a little trim to the bristles will make them a little more exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I tend to brush my face very hard and in circles and need a brush with soft and durable bristles, this brush got all knotted up after one use in the shower and when I went to use again, I was scrubbing my face with knots and it felt like I was scrubbing with rocks, threw right in the trash and my face was blood red! Terrible buy.. On the other hand the company was great, got the product within 2 business days, just hate the product!</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday and used it to clean the grime off my face from my cycling last evening. The bristle are harder than the ones I normally use (the handle had broke). Other than the bristle, it works fine. I don&#x27;t really mind the hard bristle especially when I&#x27;m cleaning my chin and neck areas - but not on my cheek areas.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. it&#x27;s a softer brush and easy to hold with swollen and painful hands. Makes my skin glow and isnt to rough on it. Works very well</li>
    <li> This brush works great. I do wish the bristles were just a bit harder, but it works well and has stood up to daily uses for over a month with no problems at all. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a better clean on their face. My pores have shrank significantly and I can really tell a difference.</li>
    <li> It was shipped promptly and just as the description said. I would definitely purchase from this buyer in the future</li>
    <li> Item was great;beats those expensive electronic ones! All you Need is this face brush.this brush comes In handy to scrub away all the dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used facial brushes like this for years (LOVED my Origins facial brush). This one is far too abrasive for your face and could potentially do some harm. I recommend another brand for your face and use this one for your fingernails and toe nails.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is very good for its price. The brisles are sinthetic and somewhat stiff, and i like that because i do not have sensitive skin and want the brisles to really get in there and clean my pores.</li>
    <li> When used with my cleanser I stopped breaking out completely. only a few hormonal spots here and there. My skin is much brighter and no longer dull nor flaky. Recommend for all.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush to exfoliate the skin and remove dead skin cells, the bristles aren&#x27;t too rough and doesn&#x27;t leave redness on the face.</li>
    <li> the package arrived okay via postal mail.  I also got two pink ones, instead of the clear or white as picture.  I don&#x27;t like pink so i was feeling &amp;#34;suck, why am i getting another pink from another Amazon sellers?&amp;#34;  nevertheless, i kept the brushes and immediately tried one.  at first the brush was okay.  the bristles were medium.  I was using it on daily basis and do not brush too hard on my face.  then two months later, i&#x27;m shocked to see the brush looks worse then my toothbrush.  the bristles are twisted and tangled on one side.  only 2 months?  I guess i should not expect too much for this price.  the brush starts to feel harsh on my face.  i would not recommend it on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Brush works really good. Does a deep cleaning. I have tried electric brush too and this one does an equal job as an 100 dollars electric brush. Just buy couple of them cuz you need to change them every other 3 months.</li>
    <li> It is a great face brush but it gets worn down within a few months. The price is appropriate for this product i recommend buying more than one.</li>
    <li> One of my friends had given me one of these when we were in college and living in the dorms.  It was great because I was able to put it with my bath caboodle.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and does wonders with a good creamy facewash (I used it with Clearasil).  Great item and great price. I ended up buying this for my niece who is now in college and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> This is a soft and effective facial cleansing brush, would not recommend for dry brushing though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it over a year now and it&#x27;s still fully intact. I use it in the shower every time with some acne face wash and it does the job! Great, economic product! A must try!</li>
    <li> Shipping was great but the brush was way to soft for me. But I did like the handle. Wasted 15 bucks all together though.</li>
    <li> Saw this and saw all of the great reviews so I thought I would give it a shot. When I got it, I thought that the bristles were a lot softer than what I was expecting. I like the size and how it would be super easy to tote around and the idea that I could use it anywhere, but I&#x27;ve used microdermabrasion before, and compared to that, this is soft. I have felt soft bristles like this before on really soft tooth brushes or really really soft scrubbers. For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t say no. But I think I am going to end up passing it along to someone who is younger and is just starting out on a skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have mild adult acne, and after scrubbing my face daily with this brush, my breakouts are almost entirely gone.  Also, I love the way my skin feels soft and clean after use.  The bristles are a little stiff, but if I run it under warm water and am sure to have a good lather on my skin, it works quite well.  I have had the brush for four months now.  There are a few rust spots where the bristles meet the brush, but it is still clean and works well.  I should probably have been more careful about drying it out after each use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in mid March and used it twice a day until it fell apart on June 7th!!!  I BOUGHT 5 OF THEM AND GAVE ONE TO MY HUSBAND.  THE BRISTLES ARE ROUGH AND SOFTENED UP A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.  I WAS HOPING TO FIND THE HAND HELD &amp;#34;Precision Beauty&amp;#34; one butI CAN&#x27;T FIND ONE ANYWHERE!!! MTHEY&#x27;RE ALRIGHT FOR THE PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> When I first used it, it was extremely rough on my skin. After a second use it was better. The. When I didn&#x27;t use it for a while it was again very harsh. I also didn&#x27;t like how easily the bristles would bend. I set it under my cabinet with the kid on and when I went to use it the lid was off with the bristles bent. Definitely not worth even $.99...</li>
    <li> Soft but not to soft to cleanse the skin.  A handy product for traveling as well.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> The brush is ok.  It is a little rough on the face and after the first use the brush turned on some kind of yellowish color. I am not sure if I&#x27;ll buy another brush like this one.</li>
    <li> This facial brush has helped greatly to clear up the acne on my forehead. I&#x27;m trying to make it work on my cheeks. The bristles are soft but if you want that deeper clean simply massage faster with a little more pressure. This brush does the exact same thing any Clarisonic would so why pay all that money?!</li>
    <li> Great Brush!  I have been looking for a facial brush with nice soft bristles and this is the brush!!  The details of the brush are exactly as explained and it feels so soft on my skin.</li>
    <li> this really works well.  I use it every day on my face with a face wash.  i am very pleased with this</li>
    <li> This little brush will be good for cleaning your computer keyboard and such. It has very gentle bristles (more like nylon hair strands). If you are looking for a gentle scrub,  a wash cloth or a stiffer brush will serve you better... might work for a make up brush... Good day...</li>
    <li> Best thing to ever happen to my face!</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, and the bristles of this brush are so abrasive that by the time I finish cleansing with it, my skin is red and raw. Even if I only go over one section of my face for a short period of time, it&#x27;s still much too harsh and it feels more like I&#x27;m scratching away at my skin than actually cleansing it. I don&#x27;t even really feel like my face is cleansed much after using the brush because it doesn&#x27;t lather up well. I know that having a lather doesn&#x27;t always mean a deep clean, but when I put product in the brush, I find that I have to use my finger to distribute it throughout the bristles because it can&#x27;t seem to do it itself.</li>
    <li> This brush smells like rotten eggs......if you can get past that, it works fine. I used dish soap to try to get rid of the smell but it never goes away.</li>
    <li> meh, didn&#x27;t work as I expected it to. Gave it to my sister and she liked it but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. the brush itself is flimsy but the handle is great!</li>
    <li> The bristles are very hard and using this brush on your face is painful.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are so hard you could use it to scrub stuff out of pans and pots.</li>
    <li> As a matter of fact i liked it a lot but be careful you gatta wash it a lot to disinfect it after every use it.</li>
    <li> So it my hurt while using this product but it really cleans your face removing any dirt. It even made. My skin really smooth. I love this facial brush.</li>
    <li> broke after my 2nd use! Keep it out of the shower!</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower with soap or cleanser to exfoliate my face.  It works pretty well since I don&#x27;t want to use my expensive facial massager in the shower.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, and I felt it was just the right texture, I not find it to be too soft as some of the reviews stated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect size for your face and exfoliates well. My only dislike is that it is a bit rough</li>
    <li> too harsh for my face</li>
    <li> This brush is a necessity for me as I use it daily. It exfoliates and leaves you with smooth skin every time. The brush is not hard despite what some others say. It&#x27;s pretty soft to me. The bristles are very flexible. I use it with whatever facial cleanser I have on hand. The cleanser shouldn&#x27;t be too abrasive because the brush will only cause more irritation. There is one minor issue. The cap that goes with this brush is great to have, however, it&#x27;s not very sturdy and broke when I tried to put it back on the brush shortly after I had just got it. Other than that, this brush will leave you with clean and smooth skin if used properly. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than those motorized brushes out there. Grab one if you&#x27;re pinching pennies and like clear skin!</li>
    <li> This product was okay. It wasnt very sturdy and it broke after 3 uses. It did have nice soft bristles.</li>
    <li> Hey I&#x27;m Melissa,&lt;br /&gt;I brought this brush last year and it didn&#x27;t last a month. It got mold under the bristles and I threw it away. While I had it, it was harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> It took more than a month to get this.  I don&#x27;t know about the quality, since it was for someone else, and the slow delivery wasn&#x27;t a real problem in this instance, but if you need it soon, be aware that a month might not be soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that much of a delay, I deducted one star. But for such a low price, I felt kind of bad for the seller.</li>
    <li> I intended to use these to exfoliate my face but ended up using it to brush my elbow and toes instead. I gave it a 3 stars because it was not completely a waste of my money, I could not use it on my face but it came in pretty handy when I want to scrub my elbow or my toes, perfect size for the areas actually but The bristles are just too hard and tough for my face. I started at my cheeks and chin area, not even pressing down hard and immediately after about 5 seconds my face turn red and it was too painful I had to stop. These could have done some damage to my face if I kept going.. All in all, I do not recommend these for anybody&#x27;s face but if you are looking for something to brush places like your feet or legs these may be good.</li>
    <li> I have used a more expensive soft bristle brush but wanted something less expensive. I was surprised how much I like this one. I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one when I need it.</li>
    <li> The brush that I recieved has very hard bristles, isnt that soft on the face, but I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> It is generally soft and decent face brush. It has long soft bristles but that&#x27;s part of the reason why I say it is just ok. The brush bristles are too soft and would have preferred them be shorter since when you use it, it just flattens mostly to your face. When I first used it, several bristles fell off but then after a few uses it seemed to stop shedding and is just ok now.</li>
    <li> The first time using it feels on the edge of hard, but after a couple uses it feels great, and cleans well.</li>
    <li> the brush its self is great quality.&lt;br /&gt;ill being buying this product again soon.&lt;br /&gt;it soft enough for your face.</li>
    <li> This brush is good for exfoliation, but its a bit harsh on your skin. It cleans very well, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommended this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a timely fashion. The product is as the description, it was a good buy for my facial regimen. It was not to soft or to rough. I felt my face had a overall deep clean. It is certainly worth the buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Sucker snapped after 2months. It is good while new. The bristles get weaker every week until it snapped in half.</li>
    <li> This and the scrub I bought make my face feel great.</li>
    <li> pretty nice and soft like a baby&#x27;s bum.i just wished i ordered the one with a stronger brittle.Well recommend it and re-order</li>
    <li> Since I started using the product. It feels good on my face and it is not to rough on my face.</li>
    <li> First of all, my brushes were delivered ahead of the predicted time. Secondly, they are just what I hoped they&#x27;d be.....a soft plastic brush atop a sturdy brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush that helps to exfoliate your face.  Getting rid of the dead skin and also bringing blood to your face to help with that &#x27;glow\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s a brush and it works.</li>
    <li> Soft and nice touch to the skin.  Love the feeling around the nose area.  Brush does a good job without being harsh.  For those who claim it is too soft, better beware of the stiff brushes that will pull and tug at your skin as well as enlarge your pores.  Better to stay with a soft brush and \\&quot;work\\&quot; the skin a bit longer.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad product, but I was looking for a facial brush with stiffer bristles. The bristles on this facial brush are really flimsy and just bend all the way down when I put it on my face. If you are looking for a super gentle exfoliation, this is fine. For a stronger exfoliation, look for a different facial brush.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see. I live in Australia so I had to ship it out from a U.S Shipping address. The only thing that was a problem was the casing for the brush head was cracked from the top a little bit, other than that it seems to exfoliate pretty well and gets your face lathered up properly. Don&#x27;t use too much product (cleanser,etc) on your face if you&#x27;re going to use this brush, it really works into your skin so you don&#x27;t need to use too much. My skin felt very clean and tight, and it&#x27;s definitely a brush you can use every other day. I&#x27;m training to be a makeup artist and the skin on my face needs to be smooth and clean at all times as we use each other as models in class. So I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and if I ever need a brush again I&#x27;ll buy from this seller. They shipped the product very quickly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> For the price, I did not have a high expectation. It exceeded that completely. The bristles are very soft , it is well made and even came with a cover, which I did not notice when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Comes with a little cover. some of my bristles were bent out of shape because the cap was not put on neatly. soft bristles.</li>
    <li> The brush is okay. It does the job.  The bristles were coming out the first time I used it. What can you expect. It&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. gets the job done.  Bristles are soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin. yes i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item shipped fast. I got it in about 3 days. When I open the package, the lid to the brush was broken into 3 pieces. Could have happened during delivery. Other than that, this brush works well. It has a nice scrubbing to it that does not irritate the skin. It was a lot smaller than I thought, maybe about 6 inches long. Overall, this is a nice brush.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  A little awkward around the nose area because it&#x27;s round, but other than that no complaints.  Good buy good price</li>
    <li> The product was just what I expected, according to the advertisement.  It was received in good condition in the promised time frame.  The price was reasonable.  It&#x27;s so nice when that heppens!</li>
    <li> too harsh on my sensitive skin. it actually broke me out due to it irritating it more. unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This actually works, If you simply just want to clean your face. I never tried the more expensive brands to compare... But this works for me :)</li>
    <li> I got these for my pre-teenagers so they would wash their faces better instead of buying an expensive motorized one.  Works very good!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff is very gentle on my skin. I used it every night to remove my makeup along with my cleanser. I have been using this for a couple of month and will need a few more for the future.</li>
    <li> Literally shattered and disintegrated (without any impact) within two weeks of moderate use. I previously had one that I purchased from the body shop that lasted for 5 years. This is a totally terrible product.</li>
    <li> This is awesome..I use this regularly and I can tell a difference when I use this or my other facial cleansing brush compared to when I don&#x27;t. My skin feels cleaner after using a brush to wash my face. I use it in the evening before bed. My favorite face wash to use it with is the Yes to Tomatoes cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is about the best that you will get out of a face brush. Very Good, I have sensitive skin so my only complaint is i wish that it was a tiny bit softer so that i could really lather my face(it works fine anyway i just have to use it with lighter hands than i normally would). But it is very soft and perfect for my skin everywhere just not so much so for my face only because my face is so sensitive!):</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face after I&#x27;ve used to my hands. I like it fine enough but the bristles are a little softer than I had expected.</li>
    <li> My sking has improved a lot by using this facial brush! It works so well by brushing off all the dead skin off my face and making it feel fresh no matter what product it is that I am using. And the brush bristles are perfect! Not to harsh and not too soft.</li>
    <li> I used to order from Ulta until it all went to the battery operated-replace-brushes/pads/cleansers. A pump of Aveeno cleanser on the brush cleans my face and jaw line, leaving it clear and smooth. Rinse and shake the excess water and it dries quickly. I keep one in the shower and one in my sink drawer. I love these brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price. VALUE.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft; works perfectly on my troublesome pores!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  The bristles fell off the on the first use.  I should have known better than to buy such an inexpensive item.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning my face using a cleansing cream!</li>
    <li> Just right feel! Not too soft or hard! And fits nicely in cover. Has a great handle and you can get in nooks and crannies</li>
    <li> i just recieved the facial brush, i used it. and wow how clean,tight and fast.  worth every penny, would recomend  it to everyone</li>
    <li> I was thinking of buying one of those expensive battery operated facial brushes but I saw this and bought it to try it.  I am glad I did, it works just fine.  I leave it in the shower and use it every time I shower.  The bristles are soft enough and it cleans my pores very well.  I just wish it had a bigger and less slippery handle and a little bit bigger brush head, but for the price it is good and I couldn&#x27;t find any other brush for face that was not battery operated.</li>
    <li> Why? Because I like it! I ordered for my 13 yr old who needs a bit of a face washing boost because of breakouts. Using the soft brush really helped clean his face and he did not complain about it like he does about scrubs and masks. It is very gentle but also effective. So I tried one myself! Nice clean skin without abrasion. Used less moisturizer and less foundation because it just glides on. Skin glows. I am going to replace them every couple of months like toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few weeks and i have to say its OK.. I found the bristles to be too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my pics i&#x27;ve attached, i ordered a similar brush off eb^y, it took a few weeks to get here, but i found the bristles to be more stronger and gave me a more efficient cleaning. (The white one is the one i got from here, and the blue one w/ shorter handle is the one from the other site i mentioned).</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am a bit of a &amp;#34;dirty hippie&amp;#34; when it comes to washing my face at the end of every single day. That said, I had a lot of build-up to scrub away.  Anywho, this brush feels soft on my skin, though it also felt effective while using. It didn&#x27;t take me more than a minute of circling it over my face to feel satisfied.(I used Desert Essence something or other face wash in a pump)  I looked in the mirror after drying my face and my complexion was brilliant! If I put this review in shorter words it would read: Buy it, use it. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Very rough on skin and I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin. Couldn&#x27;t use again after first use.</li>
    <li> exactly what i needed to keep pores clear, soft enough not to irritate delicate skin, and seems to hold up fairly well for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these so I would have one in each of my bathrooms and also one to take traveling.  They clean my face very well and my pores look better since I&#x27;ve been using them.  My complexion seems to look better.</li>
    <li> just a brush. pretty small. if you use it with a face wash make, the face wash can&#x27;t have beads or anything because the beads will just get pushed to the back of the brush so use a wash that&#x27;s just like a liquid or foam. Not a bad product but nothing you couldnt find at a dollar store</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what the benefits of having a face brush other than my face feeling a little cleaner.  Its a good basic face brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used facial brushes in the past but over the past few years I&#x27;ve been more focused on everyone else and not taking care of my skin. There are similar products on the market that cost a fortune due to them being more &amp;#34;technologically&amp;#34; advanced however, they are not in my budget at this time. Honestly, for the cost this brush is very sturdy and does the trick. I put some of my fave facial wash on the brush and rubbed it into my face. What a difference !! My skin felt alive, clean and it looked much brighter. Best of all I spent less than $5 to achieve that result. Who can beat that !!</li>
    <li> Bristles were to stiff and harsh  use on my skin.  Be good for cleaning bathtub grout...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I exfoliate my skin more to keep my dreaded blackheads at bay.&lt;br /&gt;But even light circular motions for short periods (constant movement around my face) are just too much for my skin, I get red, irritated skin for about 5 minutes, then I have to wait to apply any kind of astringent because it will burn. :/&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my St. Ives apricot blemish &amp; blackhead scrub &amp; my 2 hands.</li>
    <li> Love the product, absolutely satisfied with it!I use every day and see huge changes in my skin, it improved a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my face, but after a week it started to turn brown and rust. had to throw it away</li>
    <li> I love this hard to find product.  In the past I&#x27;ve used soft baby brushes on my face.  This product beats the power models both in price and replacement.  It comes with a nice cover which was an unexpected plus.</li>
    <li> It hurt my face. I have sensitive skin and this is like my husband&#x27;s beard constantly scratching on my face. I don&#x27;t know why I still use it.</li>
    <li> This is just as I expected. Works as supposed to. Deep cleansing, improves skin color, and texture. No problems with product.</li>
    <li> After lots of use, I found that it works fine but it&#x27;s weak. It started off as rougher than I thought, which is not what I was looking for. Then, what happened was that after lots of use it is just the bristles just move out of the way and don&#x27;t work up against my skin like they use to.</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft but it reminded me of a brush that comes with a toy doll.  Not a bad buy.</li>
    <li> when the Facial brush arrived after waiting so long to get it I first looked at it and began to get upset&lt;br /&gt;It looked like it wouldn,t be any good and felt too soft when touched  .&lt;br /&gt;I decided to just try it out after all my effort of waiting for it,  omg the first time I used it my face felt really clean.&lt;br /&gt;you could see all the grime it had drawn out of my skin , I kept using it daily and my skin started to purge my acne is almost gone and my skin texture is so soft and It glows .&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this facial brush and need to buy another for when this one can no longer be used .</li>
    <li> I cannot use this brush because it is very rough even thought my skin type is not sensitive. I regret buying it and wasting money.</li>
    <li> Not to hard nor too soft.  I&#x27;ve use this type of facial brush for years to keep my face clear and exfoliated.  Gave a facial brush to each of my son&#x27;s when they became teenages.  Acne was never a problem for them.  They still have beautiful skin.  I give credit to the facial brush and glycerin soap.</li>
    <li> Yes, this brush is small, but its perfect for cleaning your face.  I was worried it would break easily, but I dropped it once in the shower &amp; it held up just fine.  No, the bristles are not rock hard, but your face is delicate, so I am grateful for that.  I put half a squirt of my Neutrogena face wash on it &amp; cleans my entire face &amp; neck area easily.  I feel like my face has been cleaner since I started using it, and it doesnt seem to get as oily throughout the day.  I say there is no need to spent tons of money for a brush that will do what this one already does.</li>
    <li> Good quality face brush, excellent price, and shipping was very fast. I use this every other day to exfoliate my skin and after using, my face has a nice glow; I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I think the cut edges of the bristles are actually too scratchy to comfortably use on my face. If they were a little more rounded it&#x27;d be a great product. Also, while the cap is a nice thought, it&#x27;s a poor quality plastic and shattered easily.</li>
    <li> i was very happy with this product. It came very quick. I would definitely buy from this seller again and recommend it to my friends and family. product looks new and works great..</li>
    <li> Great product so far no problems with it. Love that you can cover the brush with a TOP that you get from it. Gives my face a good scrub down. Keeps my face from looking flakie when I put on my makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m noticing my skin is so much softer and smoother! The brush hurt my skin the first couple of times, but now it&#x27;s softened up and it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore. Really helped with the whiteheads around my nose. I put my face wash on my hands first, and foam it up, Then I put it on my face and scrub with the brush. This helps because if you put it directly on the brush, it just kind of sinks to the bottom of the bristles and doesn&#x27;t do much. Has really helped and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> bristles are a little too soft for my liking after a handful of uses. Some have started to fall out and the top is not too sturdy.</li>
    <li> I really hope the seller has more sales like this in the future. Because buying essential oils can be really pricey at times. Tea Tree is good for your hair the main reason why I purchased it. This seller has great quality products trust me. I&#x27;ve bought from them before. They also have a 6 piece set of essential oils that you get to pick the oils you want in it. You have to go to their website for that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s available here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> this brush feels soft on the skin. it doesn&#x27;t hurt when in use. over all i like this brush and i will recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> This facial brush works very well, I bought this to replace a wooden handled, stiff bristled brush because the old one was just too harsh. I like the new one- cleans with out feeling scrapped</li>
    <li> The product that they advertised was not what I received. Which amazes me because I ordered the same brush like 5 months ago but when I reordered it I got something completely different.</li>
    <li> Been trying to find these locally for three years. Helps keep my skin glowing and worth the wait, why I ordered 5.</li>
    <li> Cheap lil facial brush that works.</li>
    <li> In the short time I&#x27;ve used it, which is 2 days, the brush seems to do its job. During those days that I need to exfoliate it does a good job of softening up my face. Wouldn&#x27;t try to use it for everyday because the bristles are a bit hard for my sensitive skin &amp; even though the handle is thick, it is plastic so you might need to be careful about how much pressure and heat you expose it to. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with that so far but overall, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> first when i felt the brush it was really soft but then at the night i tried it on my face. it was so harsh on my skin. my opinion i hate it.</li>
    <li> This brush is supposed to be for complexion/facial skin use, but it&#x27;s so hard and stiff that it is damaging to the skin and painful to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth Therapeutics: Happy Face Complexion Brush is much better.</li>
    <li> This brush gets the job done and fully cleans my face.&lt;br /&gt;All makeup and dirt is removed, easy to clean and rinse.</li>
    <li> When i first got this i was excited and happy with my purchase because it looked great and the bristles were great, and it was exactly what i wanted for an amazing price of a doller, but then when i was washing my face for the first time with it (bare in mind that i was using a medium temperature water and washing gently because it was my face) it got a whole ton of spider web like cracks in the plastic casing by the bristles, which cause concern but not much because i figured as long as it works great i dont care what it looks like, and i continued to use it for the next day, but the third day i had it when i was using it it exploded and literally shattered into at least 20 pieces, point being I was pissed, not even worth CLOSE to worth the wait for it, i would have much rather have wiped my ass with the money i spent on this pathetic excuse for a product.</li>
    <li> I like this brush . I decided to get one after a pro facial where one was used on me.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my skin is really clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> it works well and your face really glows after using it. i like it a lot. i had never thought to use a face brush before now. i&#x27;m glad i got this! it was cheap and i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush gets the job done, great for me, it was a little harsh on my face the first time but you have to get use to it came in about a week</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to my friends and family for keeping their pores clean. It was a good price as well.</li>
    <li> I like this brush because it does the job it was meant to do. I thought the bristles were too soft at first but came to realize that it was actually perfect for facial skin. My only complaint is that the bristles are too long, so I have to press harder on my skin. I was considering cutting them shorter.</li>
    <li> the bristles turn ugly and brown in about  2 to 3 days if left without the cover on.  the good thing is they are cheap</li>
    <li> The brush is very rough on my skin. After repeated uses and several attempts to soften the bristle I&#x27;ve given up on it.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time for the brush to arrive. When I got it in the mail, I was expecting it to be just like the picture. Instead of clear, I got a pink one. It Didn&#x27;t really bother me  that much but this is the second time I had to deal with color issues from buying off amazon. The brush is cheap, it looks like it would be worth a dollar ( I got it for 4). The bristles are a little to hard for my face. I do not recommend it. I would rather pay for one that&#x27;s higher quality.</li>
    <li> Works fine just don&#x27;t rub too hard have to use a soft circular motion and I use it with some apricot scrub</li>
    <li> I still use this product often and it&#x27;s great. Even though it&#x27;s not electronic it still leaves my face feeling softer.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully soft for daily use; nice longer handle than others  Best of many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Going To need to look for another one. This one is extremely scratching it hurts my skin</li>
    <li> I love this little brush, I can control the speed &amp; pressure NOT the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Nice little item to have.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I apply foaming cleanser on this and it peels off all dead skin cells for the very smooth skin. Applying makeup after washing the face with this blush is very nice- cream doesnt roll with dead skin cells and face is very smooth.</li>
    <li> Rough bristles, scratched my face causing visible wounds.  Looked like I got attacked by a cat.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and use it on a daily basis. I have very sensitive skin and this brush is perfect to use daily without causing redness on my face. Just add a soft facial cleanser and scrub! Does a perfect job every time!</li>
    <li> definitely superior to a washcloth. i&#x27;d like the bristles to be even a touch stiffer, but my skin is exceptionally &#x27;tough&#x27;. should be great for 99% of y&#x27;all out there</li>
    <li> The bristles are too stiff to use on ones face, should be softer. Not happy with purchase. I don&#x27;t recomend</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! it really helps clean my face and get rid of all the unneccessary dirt of my face</li>
    <li> Works great! But also found the same brush at the dollar store several times. If you can&#x27;t get to a dollar store to purchase one I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Im a guy with tough thick skin not to oily not too dry. its gets dry around the chin as thats where i have to make a lot more passes with my razor to shave the really thick tough hair. that usually leaves lots of dead skin which needs to be brushed off. i find this brush too soft for me, but if you have sensative skin it will be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some use the brush to lather and wash their face with various soaps and scrubs&lt;br /&gt;i use it without water on dry skin to brush the dead skin away before my shower/shave. once you get the face wet you will not be able to get the dead skin off as it sticks to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, removing dead skin off my face has led to a better closer shave with less irritation</li>
    <li> I really like it. Works well for my face, not too hard. The price was just right, as I didnt want to go too expensive</li>
    <li> I wanted a simple brush to clean my face with and this is exactly what I got. Its simple but gest the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who doesn&#x27;t want to spend much time on her face. I told her use this brush twice per week. She said it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I-&#x27;ve used a facial brush for years.  This one&#x27;s handle is too short and the curve at the end actually hurts my hand.  The bristles are way to hard, they should be soft.  This brush is crap, do not buy.</li>
    <li> My face got worse before it got better but that just means that it wasn&#x27;t clean to start with. This product does wonders as long as you stick to it. Not to hard and not to soft its a great medium.</li>
