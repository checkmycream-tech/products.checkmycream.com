      <li>Works perfectly.</li>
      <li>This works perfectly.</li>
      <li>so I ordered this with great expectation.(This cartridge can go 120,000 times!!)</li>
      <li>very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>As described very good.</li>
      <li>Good price excellent service.</li>
      <li>and I was happy it worked on mine.</li>
      <li>But I think that is a good thing.....</li>
      <li>I took a risk and bought this cartridge after doing a fair bit of research on my Flash&amp;Go, which I got in 2013 (before the 2014 cut off for these \\&quot;new\\&quot; 5k Flash&amp;Gos).</li>
      <li>I bought this cartridge to replace my first 5000/&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly with my flash&amp;go.</li>
      <li>have not had to use yet, but the whole system works great!</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure whether I can get a good product.</li>
      <li>I love not having to replace the cartridge as often.  </li>
      <li>Love  it</li>
      <li>the Flash&amp;Go can use in order to make more money off of cartridge sales.    </li>
      <li>helps kill the hair folical better.</li>
      <li>Can I have an idea about this catrige is it ok for my machine 5000 plus</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s when I concentrated most of the pulses.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>On the highest setting(5), you feel more of a snap.</li>
      <li>So glad I made the investment.</li>
      <li>Looks identical to the 1000 flash refills and it fits just fine</li>
      <li>i bought my laser machine back in 2012 and this works great for it.</li>
      <li>Works great does take multiple uses.</li>
      <li>If you buy this, try it right away to make sure its not a dud like mine.</li>
      <li>IPL home laser is great since it is more gentle than traditional laser but just takes time to see results.</li>
      <li>So that being said I&#x27;m sure its at a high number working fine.</li>
      <li>Arrived timely, great price, and as expected.</li>
      <li>I noticed that when I used this one it was more intense</li>
      <li>I tried the professional route and could not afford those treatments so this product still is cost effective.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I got lucky and have a compatible version that&#x27;s not a 5k.</li>
      <li>Happy I won&#x27;t have to change it soon due to all the charges it has!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth the pain you have</li>
      <li>so worth  </li>
      <li>My legs are now smooth and I still have to shave rogue hairs ( new hair growth I&#x27;m told comes every 10 days!)  </li>
      <li>I guess some older models will accept this cartridge and others wont, I wish there was a list of model numbers available</li>
      <li>So, turn it off and let it cool down when it starts to get warm.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m sure like everyone else reading this, I read all these reviews and was left with the question...</li>
      <li>I have noticed that the cartridges run out sooner if I let the machine get too hot.</li>
      <li>then you should be able to use the LONG LIFE refill cartridge.</li>
      <li>However if it doesn&#x27;t, I would feel safe to assume that the company has internally limited the amount of flashes</li>
      <li>light seems to fire only on every third trigger pull, but unit reacts as if it delivered a light pulse.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>My legs USED TO BE like a man&#x27;s stubble, growing out by 5 o&#x27;clock and so uncomfortable to sleep with my own legs touching because of the prickly, including my underarms.  </li>
      <li>so i need to be careful but other than that I am happy</li>
      <li>As a guy with moderately coarse hair, i am seeing some permanent elimination and significant reduction in growth, density, and speed of growth after 8 weeks treating chest and back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only thing I notice with this long life updated cartridge is that it is more powerful.</li>
      <li>In fact, while I was using it, I noticed that the yellow screen was progressively gaining stains, and no matter how well I used to clean it, nothing was helping, until it just stopped working.</li>
      <li>I for one have an older model purchased in March of 2013.  </li>
      <li>The replace cartridge light has not come on, and I definitely know this has had quite a bit of \\&quot;flashes\\&quot; used so far.</li>
      <li>Lo and behold like the other poster it worked just like the refills perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>, when I use it the light flashes just as every other cartridge has.</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy the newer version of the Flash &amp; Go and no more buying replacement cartridge.</li>
      <li>upgrade because I can&#x27;t get my product fixed!</li>
      <li>The long life cartridge is the exact same size, and everything fits into the same slots, even the chips looked to be the same; there seemed to be no difference besides how many flashes they contained.    </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>Makes a little sound, so I assume the machine still thinks it is working, but no flash.</li>
      <li>Purchase the produce directly from Silk&#x27;n</li>
      <li>Too early to post on results at this time.</li>
      <li>My face is completely hairless-</li>
      <li>Worked on the old Flash &amp; Go.</li>
      <li>I am posting a review for others who are as confused as I was by the reviews and questions regarding whether or not this will fit your particular Silkn Flash N Go.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Gentle enough to treat sensitive areas for manscaping.</li>
      <li>So far I have done my back twice, chest 3 times, and my legs 3 times.</li>
      <li>far as the 5 stars goes I will update that later after I receive and use mine a while.</li>
      <li>Reminding everyone that your hair must be very dark for the light sensor to seek the dark bulb at the root.  </li>

<li> One, if you have a model purchased prior to January 2014 the refill you need for the 120,000 flashes is called LONG LASTING(what I needed)</li>
<li> so I had to dial it down on sensitive areas.  </li>
<li> I am very hairy and this has caused me grief for most of my life.  </li>
<li> I am going to but the long life upgrade</li>
<li> This long life cartridge works just as any replacement cartridge would.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t counted flashes, but I&#x27;ve treated my entire back three times moving about 2cms each pulse, and half of my chest once.</li>
<li> last way longer than an average cartridge.</li>
<li> It gets a little hotter than the last one</li>
<li> I could use about 10 shots out of 100 tries.</li>
<li> /&gt;BE CAREFUL ABOUT purchasing the Flash&amp;Go</li>
<li> so we could be sure before buying :(</li>
<li> Hair was growing down my chin, neck.  </li>
<li> I have to get these dark black hairs before they turn gray.  </li>
<li> This time the previous cartridge was used up</li>
<li> The cartridge, the number of pulse were less than 200 and after two times use, it did not work.</li>
<li> /&gt;It takes for ever to cover a few square inches as it takes about 15 seconds to recharge between pulses.</li>
<li> Now, it is dead.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> A waste of money.</li>
<li> hopefully it doesn&#x27;t count those failed attempts against my 120,000 actual uses</li>
<li> Because the size shape, and at least some of the technology of the cartridge doesn&#x27;t seem to be the problem.</li>
<li> I bought from another site that had this on sale last week (starts with K and ends with ohls)and was so disappointed that it didnt work in my 2012 model.</li>
<li> I had a very thick mustache!  </li>
<li> Their customer service is terrible and it seems hit-or-miss whether you actually get a working product.</li>
<li> Useless.</li>
<li> I am very, very, very disappointed, as the product was 100% not what it was promised to be.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works perfectly. Worked on the old Flash &amp; Go. The only thing I notice with this long life updated cartridge is that it is more powerful. On the highest setting(5), you feel more of a snap. But I think that is a good thing.....helps kill the hair folical better. Glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy the newer version of the Flash &amp; Go and no more buying replacement cartridge.</li>
    <li> As described very good.</li>
    <li> have not had to use yet, but the whole system works great!</li>
    <li> This product DID NOT WORK FOR ME!</li>
    <li> I bought this, thinking that I was going to be done buying cartridges forever. Instead, after 3, THREE, usages, the device signaled me to change the cartridge and stopped working. In fact, while I was using it, I noticed that the yellow screen was progressively gaining stains, and no matter how well I used to clean it, nothing was helping, until it just stopped working. A waste of money. I am very, very, very disappointed, as the product was 100% not what it was promised to be.</li>
    <li> Upgraded to this one from the one that came with my device.  I noticed that when I used this one it was more intense so I had to dial it down on sensitive areas.  Happy I won&#x27;t have to change it soon due to all the charges it has!</li>
    <li> The cartridge, the number of pulse were less than 200 and after two times use, it did not work.</li>
    <li> Just opened the product tonight to replace the one with 5000 that &amp;#34;ran out&amp;#34; already. Sucks with this lifetime one that first time using it I have to turn my unit on and off about 30 times to finish one of my legs because the sensor would just stop working. If you buy this, try it right away to make sure its not a dud like mine.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely, great price, and as expected.</li>
    <li> thanks. product was on time</li>
    <li> Temporary reduction in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the pain you have to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;It takes for ever to cover a few square inches as it takes about 15 seconds to recharge between pulses.</li>
    <li> Works great does take multiple uses. follow the directions it does work!!!</li>
    <li> This did not work any longer than a regular cartridge.</li>
    <li> I am posting a review for others who are as confused as I was by the reviews and questions regarding whether or not this will fit your particular Silkn Flash N Go.  I for one have an older model purchased in March of 2013.  After speaking with a rep from Silkn here is what she told me.  One, if you have a model purchased prior to January 2014 the refill you need for the 120,000 flashes is called LONG LASTING(what I needed) If you purchased after January 2014 then you should be able to use the LONG LIFE refill cartridge. Two, if you go on their website and click on one of the refills it will immediately ask you for your models serial number and it will automatically pull the correct cartridge for your model.  Amazon does sell the Long Lasting refill also.  I used the search feature to find  them.  Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;As far as the 5 stars goes I will update that later after I receive and use mine a while.</li>
    <li> IPL home laser is great since it is more gentle than traditional laser but just takes time to see results. As a guy with moderately coarse hair, i am seeing some permanent elimination and significant reduction in growth, density, and speed of growth after 8 weeks treating chest and back.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough to treat sensitive areas for manscaping. It can give you quite a zap, but never leaves me red or swollen or harmed no matter where you use it! I recommend getting lidocaine GEL 2%-5% and you won&#x27;t feel a thing. ( NOT cream).</li>
    <li> Can I have an idea about this catrige is it ok for my machine 5000 plus before I buy I want to know</li>
    <li> ***I CANNOT GUARANTEE IT HAS ALL 120K FLASHES, OR EVEN 1000! I&#x27;M NOT GOING TO COUNT THEM***  I write this review for those who are wondering whether this cartridge will work with their Flash&amp;Go. I took a risk and bought this cartridge after doing a fair bit of research on my Flash&amp;Go, which I got in 2013 (before the 2014 cut off for these \\&quot;new\\&quot; 5k Flash&amp;Gos). It came in this box: [...] The cartridges it uses contain 1000 flashes.  The long life cartridge is the exact same size, and everything fits into the same slots, even the chips looked to be the same; there seemed to be no difference besides how many flashes they contained.    And lo and behold, when I use it the light flashes just as every other cartridge has. I haven&#x27;t used it extensively at all to know whether or not it could contain all 120k flashes. However if it doesn&#x27;t, I would feel safe to assume that the company has internally limited the amount of flashes the Flash&amp;Go can use in order to make more money off of cartridge sales.    Perhaps I got lucky and have a compatible version that&#x27;s not a 5k. However, I think a question for those who are still uncertain should be not, \\&quot;Is mine compatible?\\&quot;, but instead \\&quot;Why wouldn&#x27;t it be compatible?\\&quot; Because the size shape, and at least some of the technology of the cartridge doesn&#x27;t seem to be the problem.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this cartridge if you bought your device prior to 2013 as it is not compatible. I made this mistake and then had to pay shipping charges to return the cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have been using Silk&#x27;n Flash&amp;Go. This time the previous cartridge was used up so I ordered this with great expectation.(This cartridge can go 120,000 times!!) But what I got was a falty item. I could use about 10 shots out of 100 tries. Now, it is dead. When I try again, it sparks and smoke.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered and got it in Korea. So getting a refund is a bigger deal.&lt;br /&gt;I should buy another one again but I can&#x27;t be sure whether I can get a good product. I am just hoping this one was a miss.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it, hopefully we&#x27;ll update about the long life (in the next life)</li>
    <li> I love not having to replace the cartridge as often.  It gets a little hotter than the last one so i need to be careful but other than that I am happy</li>
    <li> This works perfectly. So glad I made the investment.</li>
    <li> Worked for about 5 minutes. Now it won&#x27;t. Makes a little sound, so I assume the machine still thinks it is working, but no flash. Useless.</li>
    <li> Love  it so worth  the  money.  I have  also  been  using  on my  husband &#x27;s hairy back.  It too is looking  gooe.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> light seems to fire only on every third trigger pull, but unit reacts as if it delivered a light pulse. hopefully it doesn&#x27;t count those failed attempts against my 120,000 actual uses</li>
    <li> think it is working on my legs and arms but not on armpit</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three years; buying cartridge after cartridge.  I am very hairy and this has caused me grief for most of my life.  My legs USED TO BE like a man&#x27;s stubble, growing out by 5 o&#x27;clock and so uncomfortable to sleep with my own legs touching because of the prickly, including my underarms.  Don&#x27;t get me started on the vjay jay scape.  So, understand I had a lot to work with and being post menopausal the hair just keeps growing.  I have to get these dark black hairs before they turn gray.  My face is completely hairless- that&#x27;s when I concentrated most of the pulses.  I had a very thick mustache!  I would cry each time I had to shave.  Hair was growing down my chin, neck.  So, I do not mind the process of keeping up this procedure.  My legs are now smooth and I still have to shave rogue hairs ( new hair growth I&#x27;m told comes every 10 days!)  I tried the professional route and could not afford those treatments so this product still is cost effective.  Reminding everyone that your hair must be very dark for the light sensor to seek the dark bulb at the root.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I bought from another site that had this on sale last week (starts with K and ends with ohls)and was so disappointed that it didnt work in my 2012 model. Looks identical to the 1000 flash refills and it fits just fine but when I turn it on all the lights flash orange. I guess some older models will accept this cartridge and others wont, I wish there was a list of model numbers available so we could be sure before buying :(</li>
    <li> When I noticed this at Kohl&#x27;s department store, I decided to give it a shot.( I had a 30% coupon for their store and ended up only paying about $67 for it) A great deal! I bought my flash n go in 2012 and I was happy it worked on mine. So far I have done my back twice, chest 3 times, and my legs 3 times. The replace cartridge light has not come on, and I definitely know this has had quite a bit of \\&quot;flashes\\&quot; used so far. I don&#x27;t count them, but I know I have used quite a bit, and that I have quite a bit left as well. If you do buy this from a retail store( not online) I would ask about their return policy, if it is not compatible with your unit. This long life cartridge works just as any replacement cartridge would. I gave this 4 stars because I am unsure as to whether it will hit the 120,000 \\&quot;flashes\\&quot; it promises. But, I can tell you that I would definitely buy this over any replacement cartridge because of the longevity.</li>
    <li> I plugged it in but it did not work and Amazon.com won&#x27;t let me return it.</li>
    <li> I have owned the flash n go for about a year with the regular cartridges. I have noticed that the cartridges run out sooner if I let the machine get too hot. So, turn it off and let it cool down when it starts to get warm. I am going to but the long life upgrade and I am definitely going to count the flashes!!! Will keep you posted on the outcome.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Looking forward to seeing the results. Too early to post on results at this time.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m sure like everyone else reading this, I read all these reviews and was left with the question...BUT does it work on the 1,000 pulse silk&#x27;n flash???? Well some said it did, others said no. So I tried it. Lo and behold like the other poster it worked just like the refills perfectly fine. I haven&#x27;t counted flashes, but I&#x27;ve treated my entire back three times moving about 2cms each pulse, and half of my chest once. So that being said I&#x27;m sure its at a high number working fine.</li>
    <li> I have the newest version of the Flash&amp;Go, and this &amp;#34;long life&amp;#34; cartridge didn&#x27;t even last for two sessions. I wrote to the company and never heard back. Their customer service is terrible and it seems hit-or-miss whether you actually get a working product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this cartridge to replace my first 5000/&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly with my flash&amp;go. very happy with the results. Good price excellent service.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it after purchasing the Silk&#x27;n Flash&amp;Go and it quit working after 3 months so now I also purchased an upgrade kit and can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL ABOUT purchasing the Flash&amp;Go and this product from Amazon as the product(s) are not covered under the actual product warranty!  Purchase the produce directly from Silk&#x27;n Flash&amp;Go website.  Three (3) months of using the Fash&amp;Go it quit working.  I am out $179 plus the purchase of this product upgrade because I can&#x27;t get my product fixed!</li>
    <li> i bought my laser machine back in 2012 and this works great for it. last way longer than an average cartridge.</li>
