      <li>Absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>Very lovely oil, smells wonderful and feels great in my skincare routine.</li>
      <li>If you have ever been to Hawaii, this oil will remind you of your joy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to combine with strictly floral scents to sort of balance it out.</li>
      <li>I also purchased the honeysuckle of this brand and combined it with the frangipani in my nebulizer, and the combination of the two is very pleasant and smells very clean.</li>
      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>So wanted an oil that smelled like my own pulmeria blooms here.</li>
      <li>I really love this.  </li>
      <li>It smelled more Indian to me.</li>
      <li>Read about many and their reviews.</li>
      <li>Yet, I&#x27;ve purchased frangipani oils that smell more floral, and others that have like a hint of pineapple.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance on my body.</li>
      <li>I love the way this oil smells: I put it on my wrists before I go to bed at night, and the aroma is tranquilizing and uplifting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have great respect for this company: they are really superior essential oil distillers.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think an oil would be able to capture the smell of the Frangipani flower, but this one did.</li>
      <li>- will see how that works :-).</li>
      <li>so it leaves a lovely smell after shower.  </li>
      <li>If you have experienced both, just know that this is the kind with the pineapple hint (in my opinion better than the other kind).</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted!  </li>
      <li>Love this oil; it smells fabulous.</li>
      <li>I put 2 drops in a 5 mL roller bottle, filled it with carrier oil, and put a roller bottle on top.  </li>
      <li>Smells Great - mixed easily with my coconut oil</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;m wearing a fresh flower lei!</li>
      <li>It does not smell like the pure smell of plumeria I am in love with.</li>
      <li>So many Plumeria scented things do not smell like the real thing at all.  </li>
      <li>This is a fairly gentle floral fragrance, and I love to add it to my baths or soaps.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find a fragrance that truly smells like the real flowers - this is the best I have found so far</li>
      <li>I love this oil, it is such a sensory treat!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure this is a pure, essential oil...</li>
      <li>Very nice but does not deliver the full essence of other brands I have purchased previously.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
      <li>I put a little in the Argan oil that I use on my face, and I love the scent it leaves.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually notice people smile when they smell it on me.</li>
      <li>Very intense and deep aroma!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this seller to anyone needing real essential (not fragrance) oils!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of oils, and this is small, but a mighty fragrance,.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a Plumeria perfume, or cologne, but was surprised to read that it&#x27;s the same as Frangipani..</li>
      <li>Barely smells like any flower.  </li>
      <li>It is so soft and inviting especially in the winter time.</li>
      <li>As I have written for other MB essential oils, these people really know what they are doing: I have been using essential oils since the 70s, and no other oils have moved me the way that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To me, this product was a let-down.  It did not smell at all like Frangipani, or Hawaii.  A real disappointment... just threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure this is a pure, essential oil... It smells to me like an imitation -- less intense than an essential oil would be. I also purchased the honeysuckle of this brand and combined it with the frangipani in my nebulizer, and the combination of the two is very pleasant and smells very clean. It says it&#x27;s Reiki charged on the label, so that&#x27;s nice. I am not a frangipani expert. Yet, I&#x27;ve purchased frangipani oils that smell more floral, and others that have like a hint of pineapple. If you have experienced both, just know that this is the kind with the pineapple hint (in my opinion better than the other kind). It&#x27;s great to combine with strictly floral scents to sort of balance it out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. I will  order again</li>
    <li> This product smells nothing like plumeria.  Barely smells like any flower.  I would never purchase this fragrance again.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance on my body. It is so soft and inviting especially in the winter time. I&#x27;ve actually notice people smile when they smell it on me.</li>
    <li> All the memories of Hawaii without the air fare! I love this oil, it is such a sensory treat! If you have ever been to Hawaii, this oil will remind you of your joy.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I add it to coconut oil and put it all over my body after I shower and before I dry off.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again!</li>
    <li> So many Plumeria scented things do not smell like the real thing at all.  This does.  I put 2 drops in a 5 mL roller bottle, filled it with carrier oil, and put a roller bottle on top.  a dab on my wrists and behind my ears and I feel like I&#x27;m wearing a fresh flower lei!</li>
    <li> this is a veribad  frangipani</li>
    <li> I love the way this oil smells: I put it on my wrists before I go to bed at night, and the aroma is tranquilizing and uplifting. As I have written for other MB essential oils, these people really know what they are doing: I have been using essential oils since the 70s, and no other oils have moved me the way that these do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have great respect for this company: they are really superior essential oil distillers.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Customers like it. Amazon keeps demanding more words, which is very annoying.  Guess they don&#x27;t like to keep things simple.</li>
    <li> I will keep buying this oil. Why?, because it reminds me of Hawaii</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted!  Thanks so much.  Highly recommend this seller to anyone needing real essential (not fragrance) oils!</li>
    <li> Very lovely oil, smells wonderful and feels great in my skincare routine. Thanks....will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Remembers me of Bali, Indonesia...</li>
    <li> This is a fairly gentle floral fragrance, and I love to add it to my baths or soaps. Smells like vacation!</li>
    <li> Very intense and deep aroma!</li>
    <li> I really love this.  I was looking for a Plumeria perfume, or cologne, but was surprised to read that it&#x27;s the same as Frangipani.. I&#x27;m a fan of oils, and this is small, but a mighty fragrance,.  I put a little in the Argan oil that I use on my face, and I love the scent it leaves. Sometimes, I just dab it on for perfume, and it&#x27;s wonderful in a diffuser, too.</li>
    <li> Smells Great - mixed easily with my coconut oil so it leaves a lovely smell after shower.  Also applied it to tissue to leave in bedding being stored - will see how that works :-).</li>
    <li> Came back from Hawaii to Florida. So wanted an oil that smelled like my own pulmeria blooms here. Read about many and their reviews. This scent is spot on! I used 6 drops in 4 oz glass dropper( purchased in bulk from Amazon) of Almond oil from health food store. The small bottle is very concentrated.</li>
    <li> It smelled more Indian to me. It does not smell like the pure smell of plumeria I am in love with.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think an oil would be able to capture the smell of the Frangipani flower, but this one did. I use it in a fan diffuser and the scent fills my entire living room with just a few drops. Reminds me of the years that I lived in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Love this oil; it smells fabulous. I will likely purchase this again. It is expensive, making it a bit of an indulgence.</li>
    <li> Very nice but does not deliver the full essence of other brands I have purchased previously.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a fragrance that truly smells like the real flowers - this is the best I have found so far</li>
