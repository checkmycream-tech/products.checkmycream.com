      <li>Re-Energize Shampoo and Conditioner in cool</li>
      <li>Loved it took me from brown to red in one try without damage - i used a 30 vol creme developer.</li>
      <li>This is my third tube used, and I&#x27;m loving</li>
      <li>(If you don&#x27;t you will have SUPER HOT roots</li>
      <li>and I got so many compliments from total strangers</li>
      <li>DONT apply to roots first apply mid-strand to ends for about 20-25 min THEN apply to roots for additional 10/15 min.</li>

      <li>I did a second application of Hicolor Magenta in December and then mixed Manic Panic Vampire Red with Ultra Violet in January (resulting in a beautiful &amp;#34;boysenberry&amp;#34; color</li>
      <li>The Shipment Was Fast</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It does damage your hair a bit, but not as much as bleach.</li>
      <li>after about a month, the color was faded too much for my liking.</li>
      <li>You can later add henna to treat your hair to smooth the cuticle.</li>
      <li>It looked like I did ombr&amp;eacute; and I was very</li>
      <li>The color on my virgin hair at the top was like a gorgeous hot pink and as it encountered the previously dyed hair it faded to a deep cherry color.</li>
      <li>Which is amazing because if you&#x27;ve ever had box-dyed black hair you know that NOTHING budges it!</li>
      <li>Only drawback is that you cant wash your hair that much cause it will fade quickly.</li>
      <li>i have really dark brown hair and wasnt sure this product would work</li>
      <li>To be safe, since I&#x27;d just moved into my house, I also put a tarp down, but I didn&#x27;t get any dye on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s vibrant and...</li>
      <li>I got this product along with a 40 developer and the color was so vibrant.</li>
      <li>wrong the color turned out great</li>
      <li>The resulting mixture was much more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than store bought boxed hair colors, but not as messy as demi-permanent dyes, like Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my roots were gray, and the Developer lightens hair, I started with the darkest part of my hair and worked up toward my roots.  </li>
      <li>I loved this color HOWEVER if you are expecting a vibrant color and your hair is already color treated dark (I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair black for years)</li>
      <li>I got lots of compliment for my new hair color.</li>
      <li>the first round black is the most stubborn color to get rid of!</li>
      <li>Do your darkest hair first, leave the gray for last.  </li>
      <li>About my hair before highlighting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair in a pretty short inverted bob with blunt bangs.  </li>
      <li>Do your darkest hair first, leave the gray for last.  </li>
      <li>The color is awesome but don&#x27;t be disappointed if it&#x27;s not what you expect</li>
      <li>so you have to have patience to transition to red the healthy way, after applying the second time I had to use a rinse color (manic panics pillarbox red) to make it vibrant now that I&#x27;m a red head</li>
      <li>Big surprise, it didn&#x27;t really work out that well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After reading the various reviews on here, and then checking out a few red hair websites, I decided to try my hand at doing my own professional color using L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor Magenta Highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It definitely comes out a bit pink, but results in a very cool gradient-like effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to make it last, wash in the coldest water you can handle and use color-friendly products.</li>
      <li>The color is amazing, especially for how dark my hair naturally is and being that it was color treated almost black.</li>
      <li>Just prior to using the L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor for the first time, I had some pretty serious gray roots, which I was really concerned about turning pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this color, I started off mixing the red and magenta but have been using just the magenta lately</li>
      <li>(Note:  This stuff is not nearly as bad as Manic Panic when it comes to mess and staining!  </li>
      <li>You can also add direct dyes over it if you want a \\&quot;bluer\\&quot; or \\&quot;oranger\\&quot; red.</li>
      <li>Generally when I want deep, purple-ish red hair, I have to bleach my hair first, let it dry,</li>
      <li>I have the usual jet black asian hair and honestly i didnt believe any color would work on my hair without bleaching and</li>
      <li>First of all, if your hair is box dyed black, DO NOT USE THIS.</li>
      <li>its a vibrant reddish pink</li>

    <li> I cannot say enough about this product. Generally when I want deep, purple-ish red hair, I have to bleach my hair first, let it dry, etc, THEN add a direct dye like Manic Panic or Special Effects. Using the Hicolor Magenta (I mix it with Hicolor Red) I save the whole bleaching step and my hair comes out AWESOME. I used 30-volume developer over my box-dyed black hair and left it on for an hour; I washed, dried, then repeated the process (because I had to lift black dye--if you don&#x27;t have dyed black hair you only need to do this once). It turned my hair a very satisfying magenta--not too bright, but not too dark either. Which is amazing because if you&#x27;ve ever had box-dyed black hair you know that NOTHING budges it! It does damage your hair a bit, but not as much as bleach. You can later add henna to treat your hair to smooth the cuticle. You can also add direct dyes over it if you want a \\&quot;bluer\\&quot; or \\&quot;oranger\\&quot; red. I like to sometimes add Manic Panic Vampire Red a few days later for extra shine and depth, but it&#x27;s not really necessary with this product. I love it! (Now I wish they made this in purple, too!)</li>
    <li> The color is amazing, especially for how dark my hair naturally is and being that it was color treated almost black. The color bleeds out with every wash, but even after 2 weeks my hair is still vibrant and honestly looks even better than it did when I first dyed it.</li>
    <li> It a great product, i have been wanting to have a bright hair and finAlly i found the perfect product for my hair. I got lots of compliment for my new hair color.</li>
    <li> I have the usual jet black asian hair and honestly i didnt believe any color would work on my hair without bleaching and that was something i wasnt willing to do. I got this product along with a 40 developer and the color was so vibrant. I got a lot of compliments on my hair and when coming out to the sun, it was a beautiful reddish/magenta color. Couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> Loved it took me from brown to red in one try without damage - i used a 30 vol creme developer.</li>
    <li> Love this color, I started off mixing the red and magenta but have been using just the magenta lately and I really like it. Lasts a long time, I get a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> One of the best of the reds for dark hair.  If your hair is very dark (as in black or very dark brown), you may not see the results you were expecting.  I use 40 vol peroxide, mixed as per instructions (1:2).  If I want it brighter, I will bleach the strands that I want the magenta to show most on.  Or, I use a bleach soap cap ( google this ) which I feel is a gentler way to lighten hair before I color it a different color.  Just my 2 cents. YMMV.</li>
    <li> So I have ash brown hair with blond highlights all over., can I use the magenta/red with this hair? Or does it have to be dark l?</li>
    <li> So worth it, colour is fab is even better then I expected, have used 5 tubes now and colour is the way I wanted it,  people always admiring colour</li>
    <li> Love this color and doesn&#x27;t fade quickly like others</li>
    <li> it works gr8 product!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! This is my third tube used, and I&#x27;m loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago I dyed my hair magenta using this. I dyed it once and then the next morning dyed it again. It was gorgeous! It had a gradient effect probably due to the fact that I&#x27;m addicted to dying my hair and had had blonde, purple, and red highlights in the past. The color on my virgin hair at the top was like a gorgeous hot pink and as it encountered the previously dyed hair it faded to a deep cherry color. It looked like I did ombr&amp;eacute; and I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then after about a month, the color was faded too much for my liking. It was still red and people still complimented me but I like it bright so I bought another tube and redyed it. Maybe it was the fact that I had used it twice before, but the color came out even more beautiful than I could have hoped. I got so many compliments and best of all I didn&#x27;t have to damage my hair by bleaching it.</li>
    <li> One tube is not enough for medium hair. Had to buy this twice. True to color.</li>
    <li> i have super dark hair, im tired of my hair, so i tried this, half my hair worked but i would need a 40 developer, and another go at it, overall does work nice and no damage, im happy!</li>
    <li> I loved this color HOWEVER if you are expecting a vibrant color and your hair is already color treated dark (I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair black for years) there are a few steps you should take 1. I would purchase double the amount you use as you will have to apply again. 2. DONT apply to roots first apply mid-strand to ends for about 20-25 min THEN apply to roots for additional 10/15 min. (If you don&#x27;t you will have SUPER HOT roots no good) this is a process so you have to have patience to transition to red the healthy way, after applying the second time I had to use a rinse color (manic panics pillarbox red) to make it vibrant now that I&#x27;m a red head I can now touch up and refresh with this color. The color is awesome but don&#x27;t be disappointed if it&#x27;s not what you expect the first round black is the most stubborn color to get rid of! I&#x27;m sure this works just fine on Virgin hair as my roots had no problem lifting the first time. I hope this helps and I wish someone would have told me all of this before I colored so I could be better prepared. Again this product does work just takes 2-3 sessions (I did mines about 1 week apart from each other) I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s red. It&#x27;s vibrant and... it&#x27;s red. Nothing else more you need to know. First of all, if your hair is box dyed black, DO NOT USE THIS. I&#x27;m saving your ass. This s*** is not going to work. Your roots will probably look okay but trust me, I have been there. You need to buy a developer with this. So... yeah.</li>
    <li> my hair came out so perfect</li>
    <li> This product is great i have really dark brown hair and wasnt sure this product would work i thought i would have to bleach my hair first. But i was DEF! wrong the color turned out great its a vibrant reddish pink I LOVE IT. Only drawback is that you cant wash your hair that much cause it will fade quickly.</li>
    <li> About my hair before highlighting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair in a pretty short inverted bob with blunt bangs.  I&#x27;d been dying my hair black for years using brands like Feria.  I decided about 6 months ago that I wanted to go back to red hair, so I tried Feria Violet Soft Black as a transition color, lightening the shades of red as my hair grew out.  Big surprise, it didn&#x27;t really work out that well.  Just prior to using the L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor for the first time, I had some pretty serious gray roots, which I was really concerned about turning pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the various reviews on here, and then checking out a few red hair websites, I decided to try my hand at doing my own professional color using L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor Magenta Highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Hicolor Magenta Highlighter (1.2 oz)&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Level 30 Developer (2.4 oz)&lt;br /&gt;Neutral Protein Filler (1.2 oz)&lt;br /&gt;Rubber gloves&lt;br /&gt;A smock&lt;br /&gt;Hair color mixing bowl (Sally Beauty has nice bowl that are marked by ounces and have a brush &amp;#34;strainer&amp;#34; at one end - cost ~$3)&lt;br /&gt;Hair color application brush&lt;br /&gt;Hair color mixing wand&lt;br /&gt;Comb&lt;br /&gt;Tube of Eucerin Aquaphor moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Disposable shower cap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on the smock and rubber gloves, then used the Aquaphor to protect any skin that I didn&#x27;t want to get stained by hair dye.  (Note:  This stuff is not nearly as bad as Manic Panic when it comes to mess and staining!  In fact, it is not all that messy, in my opinion, especially when compared to Manic Panic!)  To be safe, since I&#x27;d just moved into my house, I also put a tarp down, but I didn&#x27;t get any dye on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blended together the HiColor Magenta, Level 30 Developer, and Protein Filler in the color mixing bowl using the mixing wand/color brush.  It took about 15-20 minutes to get fully blended.  NO JOKE.  The resulting mixture was much more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than store bought boxed hair colors, but not as messy as demi-permanent dyes, like Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my roots were gray, and the Developer lightens hair, I started with the darkest part of my hair and worked up toward my roots.  I used the comb to periodically make sure the dye was equally distributed through my hair.  It took about 20 minutes to apply the dye.  I had leftover dye, since my hair isn&#x27;t very long.  I washed it down the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on a shower cap and left the dye in for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour, I showered, rinsing the dye from my hair.  The instructions tell you to shampoo and condition, which I did using TIGI Bed Head Re-Energize Shampoo and Conditioner in cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GORGEOUS bright, deep magenta hair.  Just lovely.  The original plan was to do the Hicolor as &amp;#34;Step 1&amp;#34; and then deepen the color using Manic Panic before going back to work after the holiday, but the color was so awesome and I got so many compliments from total strangers, that I kept it.  It worked in my favor, too, as I ended up being sent to meet a potential client in Atlanta, who loved me (and my hair!).  They ended up signing on with my company and bringing me down for some work in January.  I did a second application of Hicolor Magenta in December and then mixed Manic Panic Vampire Red with Ultra Violet in January (resulting in a beautiful &amp;#34;boysenberry&amp;#34; color, however it was a pain to apply, and made a total mess in my bathroom... and on hotel towels for weeks afterward).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest concern I had was my gray roots.  Do your darkest hair first, leave the gray for last.  It definitely comes out a bit pink, but results in a very cool gradient-like effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to make it last, wash in the coldest water you can handle and use color-friendly products.s messy as demi-permanent dyes, like Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my roots were gray, and the Developer lightens hair, I started with the darkest part of my hair and worked up toward my roots.
