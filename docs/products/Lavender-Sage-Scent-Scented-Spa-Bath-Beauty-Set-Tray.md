      <li>I don&#x27;t know how she liked it.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with the purchase when I examined it before wrapping it.</li>
      <li>I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF AT BATH AND BODY WORKS FOR THE PRICE.  </li>
      <li>The picture makes it look like a fairly nice Christmas gift, but when it arrived it just looks cheaply made.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made, and it&#x27;s quite a hassle to take out of the box.</li>

      <li>It is a very beautiful gift and the price is low, some like these wil be important for the next december.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s got a good scent and is very soothing in the bathtub.</li>
      <li>Would rather see it in person first.</li>
      <li>HAD TO ADD MORE TO MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT.</li>
      <li>The little box it came in is nice, but the actual bottles look really cheap.</li>
      <li>Am sending it back today, and I found a much better quality gift for the same price!</li>
      <li>I got the for my very busy aunt.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look very sophisticated and the lotion is very thin.</li>
