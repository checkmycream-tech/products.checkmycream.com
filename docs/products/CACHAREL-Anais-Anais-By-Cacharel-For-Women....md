      <li>This is becoming harder and harder to find.  </li>
      <li>The spray smells more like alcohol, and the body lotion is a bit better Really disappointed.</li>

    <li> Awesome perfume great deal. Thanks will buy some more soon love how this wonderful perfume smells. Get your self some soon</li>
    <li> This is becoming harder and harder to find.  It is the only cologne I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  Please keep making this.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Daughter-in-law loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> I wore this years ago, and decided to give it another go-around.  What a disappointment!  It sort of smells like a cheap knock-off.  Very overpowering.  I remember the scent to be more subtle; this one just hangs in a room (and no, I don&#x27;t over-spray).  Even the packaging/labeling of the spray bottle looks cheap.  Given the $65.00 this gift set cost, I should have sent it back.  The reason for the 3 stars is that at least I&#x27;ll be able to use the lotion, otherwise I would have given it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and was very happy with the purchase and the speed of which it had arrived.  Would buy again from this seller!!!</li>
    <li> I wore this fragrance years ago, and always wanted to purchase it again. So when i got the chance to do so , i did.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since 1983.  I keep trying other perfumes but keep coming back to Anais Anais!!!  My husband loves it; men I used to work with would ask the name so they could purchase it for their wives.  A great testament to its power!!!</li>
    <li> very happy with product</li>
    <li> Lotions was a little runny (watery).</li>
    <li> Anais is one of my top 3 favorite perfumes.  I have used it for at least 20 years.  The gift set is very nice with extra body lotion, one for me, one for a friend.  I will use this seller again because the packaging was excellent and I received it pronto.</li>
    <li> Happy to have found my signature fragrance again.  Was supposed to be available at other places, like Macy&#x27;s, but not.  So I was happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> A lovely, light, white floral perfume. I have worn this for years and love it. A nice scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you.</li>
    <li> I have long been looking for this perfume and I managed to surprise my mom with this set. She loved it and used it immediately. I had some doubt about the packaging but arrived in perfect condition, no wrinkles on the package!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  I can use very few products because many fragrances cause me to feel ill.  I have loved this product from day one and have no reason or desire to try anything different.  I wish you could still get the shower gel.  I love to layer the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this perfume .  I love how I can carry the moisturiser around with me. I love the packaged deal.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves Anais. I had a problem buying it locally and I thought my sweetie would have to choose another fragrance but Amazon came through and now everyone is happy.</li>
    <li> Older version of anais. I prefer the newer version</li>
    <li> Hard to find this was a christmas gift. Im sure the person im giving it too is going to love it .</li>
    <li> My wife has always loved this scent and I got it for mothers day this year. She is happy so I am happy.</li>
