      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite pomade.  </li>
      <li>one of my favorite pomade.</li>
      <li>i got this because i wanted something that controlled and held my wavey hair better than murrays.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t in love with the design of the can, however.</li>
      <li>alot better than wave and groom.</li>
      <li>try it out you will love it.</li>
      <li>Okay, I bought this product because I love Dax Wave and Groom</li>
      <li>Love everything about it.</li>
      <li>I was very excited when I got the package.</li>
      <li>This product is made of beeswax and oil so keep in mind it does not wash out easily.</li>
      <li>Comes out of the can easy and goes in the hair easy.</li>
      <li>Not as strong.</li>
      <li>your looking for something that&#x27;s just as good but easy to clean out three flowers make a new version of hair pomade that washes out easily.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want my hair product to determine my primary smell.  </li>
      <li>it looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>Recommended for all hair types, defiantly an awesome hold, smells great, works great for pompadour, edgy hair styles, Like stepping in the past!</li>
      <li>Such a classic pomade, best for the price</li>
      <li>Smells really nice, but i still like the Dax Wave and Groom better for a solid hold</li>
      <li>Out of American Crew, murrays superior and super light, axe clean cut, and layrite...</li>
      <li>I should give 1 star only but because this product has a good smell to it, I give it a 2 star.</li>
      <li>I have very straight, fine hair</li>
      <li>So I figured buying this product because from what the package say, Dax High and Tight Awesome Hold, I thought it&#x27;s the gon</li>
      <li>Dax so far is my favorite ponade that has a manly musky scent.</li>
      <li>it does smell good tho, and would likely work if you have straight hiar.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice shine to facial hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am also not crazy about the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for the look.</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair and this stuff holds its own pretty good</li>
      <li>True, the hold is a great medium-heavy hold, but washing it out completely is a nightmare when compared to other high-hold pomades like Murrays.  </li>
      <li>I still plan to use the product, but more sparingly in the future.  </li>
      <li>So I thought it must just be because the heater is on and its too hot inside the house.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and have a pompadour works awsome smells great</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I use this to slick my hair back (like Jimmy Darmody - Boardwalk Empire) and it works great, strong hold and a not-too-greasy look.</li>
      <li>Holds solid, easy to comb, holds any style</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit weaker hold than red can, but still in the &#x27;strong&#x27; category.  </li>
      <li>Meanwhile 50% of the rest of the population probably disagree with me and think it smells like a real man should.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really want to smell like anything</li>
      <li>Other than that, I have thoroughly enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>i do a sidepart and slick back styles very nice</li>
      <li>But, hey, that is what you&#x27;re loking for in a classic</li>
      <li>But you also can not achieve that \\&quot;classic look\\&quot; with a gel pomade or waterbased pomade...</li>
      <li>I use a water based pomade to finish styling any stray hairs but those products are 3x as expensive so I am glad that Dax does most of the work.</li>
      <li>pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I highly recommend this</li>
      <li>This product is great I would recommend getting the Dax shampoo because this is difficult to get out of your hair.</li>
      <li>I applied this product with my clean, dry hair, nothing on it; as I was combing my hair, I thought to myself &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Namely, Dax High &amp; Tight Awesome Hold is much more difficult to wash from your hair than every other pomade I have tried.  </li>
      <li>so I have to be careful not to use too much or my hair won&#x27;t lay down very easily.</li>
      <li>Its OK though, I just shampoo once a day to remove dirt and sweat, and some of the product stays in overnight, meaning you use less the next day!</li>
      <li>Nothing has change, still soft, still has some gaps, hair sticking out, and still looks oily.</li>
      <li>I use the High and Tight on the part and sides and the Green and Gold on the top</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic type of hold that you can comb through and reshape because it doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
      <li>Dax also gives a nice volume for a slick back look (like a pompador), as opposed to water based products that make your hair lay flat and look wet.</li>
      <li>when this pomade first touched my hair, I could tell this stuff was different than all the other&#x27;s I have tried...</li>
      <li>; my hair was supper soft to comb, some hair sticks out, it goes flat, and it looks greasy.</li>
      <li>desired!&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Dax has created a great pomade blend here for thick hair, probably thin also.</li>
      <li>you haven&#x27;t used an oil/wax based product before, be aware it only washes out fully after a few rinse and repeats.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awsome pomade I have thick hair and have a pompadour works awsome smells great</li>
    <li> smells amazing. Holds great. You need to work to remove it.</li>
    <li> Great, super rigid pomade. My only grip is that the pomade is incredibly difficult to remove from my hair. I would say it takes around 2-3 washes to remove the product. Other than that, I have thoroughly enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> excellent hold, great sheen, and a very musky manly scent. I use this alone to pull my hair tight and get that Don Drapper look from mad men. I also use it with Dax Green and Gold. I use the High and Tight on the part and sides and the Green and Gold on the top it looks fantastic. This product is made of beeswax and oil so keep in mind it does not wash out easily. But you also can not achieve that \\&quot;classic look\\&quot; with a gel pomade or waterbased pomade...no mater what they will dry up through out the day...this product will look sheen and shiney all day. If you are into pomades you owe it to yourself to get this, Dax makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm...</li>
    <li> This is similar to the red can Wave and Groom which I consider to be the Dax standard to measure the others against.  It&#x27;s a bit weaker hold than red can, but still in the &#x27;strong&#x27; category.  It washes out of your hair a bit easier than Wave and Groom but will stay there just like any other old greasy pomade.  The love it or hate it is going to be the scent.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the spicy pumpkin pie smell of Wave and Groom whereas this stuff smells like my grandpa before he drives into the big city to go shopping.  It smells a bit like cologne and I don&#x27;t care for it.  I don&#x27;t really want to smell like anything and I don&#x27;t want my hair product to determine my primary smell.  Meanwhile 50% of the rest of the population probably disagree with me and think it smells like a real man should.  I dunno.. I&#x27;m sticking to red can Wave and Groom.  It&#x27;s my favorite pomade.  I wanted to try this out though and see what it was all about.</li>
    <li> This is for when you do not want your hair to move an inch.  Put this on and you can run a marathon in the rain with perfect hair.  I often use this as a base and top it with some Royal Crown to get some shine, because the Dax is matte.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Such a classic pomade, best for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a couple different pomades and finally got my hands on this stuff. Out of American Crew, murrays superior and super light, axe clean cut, and layrite... this Awesome hold blows em all away. As soon as I opened the can I fell in love with the scent. I wasn&#x27;t in love with the design of the can, however. when this pomade first touched my hair, I could tell this stuff was different than all the other&#x27;s I have tried... It molds your hair however you want it ( I want the don draper/ madmen look) The fact that this stuff is affordable just makes this a must have. I will probably never buy a different pomade. this is my go to. I just want to hoard hundreds of cans of this stuff so I will never run out!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews because I am too lazy to right one, but I&#x27;m just so disappointed with this product that I have to say something. Okay, I bought this product because I love Dax Wave and Groom, it has great hold and I can sculpt my hair with ease. So I figured buying this product because from what the package say, Dax High and Tight Awesome Hold, I thought it&#x27;s the gonna hold my hair even better. I was very excited when I got the package. I applied this product with my clean, dry hair, nothing on it; as I was combing my hair, I thought to myself &amp;#34; This is not what the package is telling! &amp;#34; my hair was supper soft to comb, some hair sticks out, it goes flat, and it looks greasy. So I thought it must just be because the heater is on and its too hot inside the house. So I just went ahead and go to school, It was freezing outside, 7 degrees cold, so I was like maybe by this time it&#x27;s going to hold my hair. I went to the restroom to check my hair. Nothing has change, still soft, still has some gaps, hair sticking out, and still looks oily. I should give 1 star only but because this product has a good smell to it, I give it a 2 star.</li>
    <li> Comes out of the can easy and goes in the hair easy. Combs thru like butter and has a great hold. I have very thick hair and this stuff holds its own pretty good but def wish it had a tad bit more hold for my crazy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for spiking your hair without the crusty feeling hair gels leave. Only bad part it&#x27;s a pain to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for something that&#x27;s just as good but easy to clean out three flowers make a new version of hair pomade that washes out easily.</li>
    <li> Product excellent for styling close cropped hair.</li>
    <li> It is awesome... Good hold and not too awful shiny... Which is good for me... I mix with awesome shine if I feel like blinding someone that day.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Good choice.</li>
    <li> Recommended for all hair types, defiantly an awesome hold, smells great, works great for pompadour, edgy hair styles, Like stepping in the past! Pleasure doing business! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this to slick my hair back (like Jimmy Darmody - Boardwalk Empire) and it works great, strong hold and a not-too-greasy look. I use a water based pomade to finish styling any stray hairs but those products are 3x as expensive so I am glad that Dax does most of the work. Dax also gives a nice volume for a slick back look (like a pompador), as opposed to water based products that make your hair lay flat and look wet.

Its OK though, I just shampoo once a day to remove dirt and sweat, and some of the product stays in overnight, meaning you use less the next day! I dont smell bad, promise.</li>
    <li> This product is great I would recommend getting the Dax shampoo because this is difficult to get out of your hair. I am also not crazy about the smell of this product. It smells like Carmex chap stick.</li>
    <li> i got this because i wanted something that controlled and held my wavey hair better than murrays. it was worse in both areas, and slightly greasier. it does smell good tho, and would likely work if you have straight hiar.</li>
    <li> This is great beard wax, allows you to quickly and easily put some control into your beard. Gives a nice shine to facial hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to an ex-fiancee . . . . have not heard back from her.</li>
    <li> Holds solid, easy to comb, holds any style desired!&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Dax has created a great pomade blend here for thick hair, probably thin also.</li>
    <li> Ived used swagger coconut pomade, and murrays beeswax. Dax so far is my favorite ponade that has a manly musky scent.</li>
    <li> Holds your hair almost all day.Not as strong.Was looking for a stronger product.</li>
    <li> Dax High &amp; Tight Awesome Hold pomade is an excellent product that provides, as the name suggests, superior hold while retaining superb pliability.  I tend to pair this product with Royal Crown Pomade to get the perfect balance of pliability, shine and hold for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other petroleum-based pomades, this product will NOT wash out of your hair with ease.  But, hey, that is what you&#x27;re loking for in a classic pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/8/2013:  After using this product for some time I have an additional observation that merits inclusion here.  Namely, Dax High &amp; Tight Awesome Hold is much more difficult to wash from your hair than every other pomade I have tried.  True, the hold is a great medium-heavy hold, but washing it out completely is a nightmare when compared to other high-hold pomades like Murrays.  I still plan to use the product, but more sparingly in the future.  Hence, one star was removed from the overall rating.</li>
    <li> Works great on my side part and mini pomp. I have very straight, fine hair so I have to be careful not to use too much or my hair won&#x27;t lay down very easily.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite pomade. alot better than wave and groom. try it out you will love it. good for almost all type of hair. i do a sidepart and slick back styles very nice</li>
    <li> Love everything about it. It&#x27;s a classic type of hold that you can comb through and reshape because it doesn&#x27;t dry. It is hard to get out but it&#x27;s worth it for the look.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice, but i still like the Dax Wave and Groom better for a solid hold</li>
