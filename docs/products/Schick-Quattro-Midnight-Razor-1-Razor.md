### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It shaves great!!</li>
      <li>the best shaves</li>
      <li>This is without a doubt the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>very good razor</li>
      <li>Its just incredible.</li>
      <li>It does not give a great shave.</li>
      <li>my husband loved it</li>
      <li>With the Schick Quattro Line of razors, you&#x27;ll get a shave that&#x27;s as good</li>
      <li>but Schick does have a lifetime warranty on all of their products, and they made good on their promise.</li>
      <li>and it did a good job shaving, but I had to replace the blades to often.  </li>
      <li>Which is nice becuase the replacement catridges can be kinda pricey.</li>
      <li>Gillette&#x27;s Sensor 3 shaves as good, better in some place on my face</li>
      <li>Any of the good 3 blade razors from Schick or Gillette, and the 4 bladed Schick Quattro with give any man a good clean and close shave.   </li>
      <li>Works great, the neck angle makes it much more comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>No razor burn and very smooth close but not too close shave.</li>
      <li>One thing for sure</li>
      <li>Mach 3 is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>And we are satisfied with that.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the original Quattro, I liked it</li>
      <li>The blades clean out very well, the handle is a dream, giving you great control as you shave.  </li>
      <li>Schick Quattro is a very well made razor that will give you many good, clean, close shaves without nicks, cuts or razor burn, with each and ever blade.  </li>
      <li>They also advertise that the blades are spaced futher apart so that it cleans easily...</li>
      <li>They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
      <li>Who knows, but its just incredible how long it lasts.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to teach myself not to keep going over an area 5 times because the razor glides along so smoothly</li>
      <li>but It just didn&#x27;t feel like it fit my hand well.</li>
      <li>well figured i would give the quattro a last shot deal , if didnt work out always happy with the mach 3</li>
      <li>and while i will give it that it does shave closer, the mach 3 performance wise still beat the hydro , the shape in your hand and the feed back , feels strong in your hand ,</li>
      <li>I consistently get 3 weeks or more out of a blade.</li>
      <li>This is the opinion of many if you read the reviews, even many who love the Mack 3 Turbo complain of the blades not lasting.  </li>
      <li>Not to mention, that yes it looks cool.  </li>
      <li>but if you want a true close shave I recommend the Schick Quattro Midnight Edition.</li>
      <li>The razor glides smoothly over your skin for a very comfortable shave including the chin and sensitive neck areas.</li>
      <li>Did not hold razor head adequately.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First the good: It has a really cool looking case that can stand the razor upright so that it can air dry.</li>
      <li>I swear I&#x27;ve gone a month or more before having to put in a new blade.</li>
      <li>it took me time to adjust to the light wieght but the the razor has performing very well, providing some of</li>
      <li>But worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
      <li>And you get get a month&#x27;s worth of shaves on one blade.  </li>
      <li>the only thing is that it just brings one more refill but its really a close smooth shave</li>
      <li>Anyone saying anything different, is speaking nothing more then their opinion, not the facts.  </li>
      <li>First off it DOES shave closer, no question about it.</li>
      <li>The razor has a pretty nice rubber grip that prevents slipping.</li>
      <li>The Schick Quattro shaves just as well and the blades last, giving a man many more shaves per blade, and they cost less.  </li>
      <li>And the blades last much longer giving many more shaves per blade then Mack 3 Turbo&#x27;s, and they cost less.</li>
      <li>I had a chance to send away for one of these free and they not only sent one but two.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very displeased with the preformance of this razor</li>
      <li>, I will never go back to cheap razors again.</li>
      <li>the comfort was more than I expected.</li>
      <li>After two weeks, my wife said that she felt like the Gillette Fusion provided a much closer shave.  </li>
      <li>Our thoughts on the \\&quot;4 blades\\&quot; are this: what does it matter if blade number 4 isn&#x27;t getting any hair on it, if the others are working then it as a whole is doing it&#x27;s job.  </li>
      <li>The Schick Quattro Midnight is a Schick Quattro of a different color only, with the same great shave.  </li>
      <li>You can do it though, so its really a non issue.</li>
      <li>Ended up throwing the unit away and getting another original Quattro Razor (white).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than some other one and two blade razors, but it is no comparison to a Fusion or a Mach 3.  </li>
      <li>Most razors like Sensor &amp; Mach 3 give me a decent shave, but because of my coarse beard I have to go over certain areas several times.</li>
      <li>this particular product isn&#x27;t up to par...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>However these blades are still a few dollars cheaper then the Gillette Fusion and most Mach blades.</li>
      <li>, i have to say the quattro midnight exceeded my expectations , the blades are the right size, you can get into narrow spaces around your nose ,while the mach 3 is the work horse , the quattro felt like the ferrari you always wanted to drive , not crazy about the flimsiness of the blade on the quattro , didnt affect performance, once on your face the blade and handle combo  </li>
      <li>First off I tried the Fusion, Mach, and various Bic disposables.</li>
      <li>for me, the main reasons that the Schick Quattro is now the razor I use and why I recommend it to all, is that it gives a shave as good as, if not better, then any other razor.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the blades will last because I&#x27;ll probably never use it again, but I bought my first Fusion about 3 months ago and the first blade still works quite well.  </li>
      <li>The blades clog frequently.  </li>
      <li>For some reason it didn&#x27;t seem to capture as much hair either, I had to shave the same area</li>
      <li>Overall this razor does what it&#x27;s supposed to however, it doesn&#x27;t do it very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised . . .</li>
      <li>Been a long time mach 3 user , figured i would go with something new to update myself and keep up with the times , tried the hydro 5 , too big and bulky , felt like i should be wearing a yellow helmet with that blade and razor , went down to the hydro 3 since it supposedly provides a better shave then</li>
      <li>After shaving an area I would look at the razor and see that the first and second blade would be full of hair, the third blade hade a little hair and the fourth had practically no hair in it.</li>
      <li>looked at the women&#x27;s equivalent in the Quattro but the razor blades are more expensive for exactly the same thing</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now for the bad: Four blades is nothing great.</li>
      <li>I have a coarse beard and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>They are sharper, shave a little closer and include a trimming blade on the top for tight areas.</li>
      <li>The Schick Quattro Midnight Razor is the same as the other Quattro&#x27;s except for the color and the angle of the actual razor is closer to 90 degrees rather then the other more flat razors.</li>
      <li>why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;blade cartridge release&amp;#34; button is so large, that there is no effective way to hold the razor without your fingers (at least one) touching it.  </li>
      <li>Colonel Conk Amber soap provides a dense and slick cushion between the blades and your face and works much better than typical canned shave creams or gels.</li>

<li> why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;blade cartridge release&amp;#34; button is so large, that there is no effective way to hold the razor without your fingers (at least one) touching it.  </li>
<li> Colonel Conk Amber soap provides a dense and slick cushion between the blades and your face and works much better than typical canned shave creams or gels.</li>
<li> then the Mack 3 Turbo, and the blade last much long then</li>
<li> The blades are actually made in Germany and if you purchase the titanium ones they last a very long time!</li>
<li> only complaint I have is that with four blades the cartridge is relatively wide, so its just a bit tougher to get that spot right under the nose.</li>
<li> They do seem to last a very long time.</li>
<li> They were all over priced and usually gave me razor burn/cuts the blades particularly on the Gillette razors lasted maybe 5-6 days no joke.</li>
<li> and they said that one of the plastic &amp;#34;clamps&amp;#34; which holds the blade cartridge in place must be loose</li>
<li> do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A young man, or someone with Peach Fuzz may be alright with the Gillette Mack 3 Turbo, but if you have tough hard wiskers, you won&#x27;t get much life out of your Mack 3 Turbo Blades, and they are not cheap to buy.  </li>
<li> It gets an extremely close shave and no irritation.</li>
<li> Either that or the blades just arent sharp because when I would shave it pulls at the hair and gets caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;Being less than fully abled, I am not able to lean down and pick up the cartridge, so I have to revert back to a kind-of-worn disposable I keep as a spare in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The titanium blades also have a blade mounted on the back for trimming in those hard to reach areas.</li>
<li> It seems to last the longest and is the least pulling on the hair, but Quattro gets the job done as well.  </li>
<li> If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But the Schick Quattro Midnight gives me a very close shave without all of the irritation, and it&#x27;s next to impossible to cut yourself with this razor.</li>
<li> You can also lay the razor down like in the picture for storage.</li>
<li> It also has a wire guard on the blades so that you get cut less while</li>
<li> previous handle came apart after 24</li>
<li> I would suggest at least the Mach 3 Turbo over this if you cannot afford the Fusion, but the Fusion is an investment and probably cheaper over the long run.</li>
<li> /&gt;The problem with the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo is that the blades are expensive and don&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
<li> if not better then any other razor.  </li>
<li> Also, after a few weeks, the blades started coming lose and/or wobbled side to side on it&#x27;s mount.  </li>
<li> I had been using the Gillette Mach 3 for a while and switched a few months ago to the Fusion, so</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t shave the hair down to my skin, yet managed to cut my neck up pretty bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sorry to say that this product did not perform up to standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Midnight&amp;#34; razor has (according to Schick) been discontinued, and I can see the reason why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;blade cartridge release&amp;#34; button is so large, that there is no effective way to hold the razor without your fingers (at least one) touching it.  So, when shaving, the blade cartridge randomly pops off and drops to the shower floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being less than fully abled, I am not able to lean down and pick up the cartridge, so I have to revert back to a kind-of-worn disposable I keep as a spare in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did write Schick and they said that one of the plastic &amp;#34;clamps&amp;#34; which holds the blade cartridge in place must be loose, so the manufacturer DID send me a coupon to replace this razor with another one, and they also sent a coupon to cover the cost of the 4 cartridges that fell off (which fall blades-down, making them unusable afterward because they are out of alignment once they hit the tile floor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall...this particular product isn&#x27;t up to par...but Schick does have a lifetime warranty on all of their products, and they made good on their promise.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the quattro razor for years. And it is the ONLY one he prefers. It gets an extremely close shave and no irritation. Not to mention, that yes it looks cool.  Our thoughts on the \\&quot;4 blades\\&quot; are this: what does it matter if blade number 4 isn&#x27;t getting any hair on it, if the others are working then it as a whole is doing it&#x27;s job.  And we are satisfied with that. Also, I know for a fact that it can go months without changing the blade. They do seem to last a very long time. Which is nice becuase the replacement catridges can be kinda pricey. But worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had to teach myself not to keep going over an area 5 times because the razor glides along so smoothly, I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s actually shaving but it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the women&#x27;s equivalent in the Quattro but the razor blades are more expensive for exactly the same thing so I went with the mans version.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to send away for one of these free and they not only sent one but two.  Now I know why, probably because nobody is buying them.  I had been using the Gillette Mach 3 for a while and switched a few months ago to the Fusion, so I tried this out to see how it fared gainst those.  It didn&#x27;t shave the hair down to my skin, yet managed to cut my neck up pretty bad.  It&#x27;s better than some other one and two blade razors, but it is no comparison to a Fusion or a Mach 3.  I don&#x27;t know how long the blades will last because I&#x27;ll probably never use it again, but I bought my first Fusion about 3 months ago and the first blade still works quite well.  I would suggest at least the Mach 3 Turbo over this if you cannot afford the Fusion, but the Fusion is an investment and probably cheaper over the long run.</li>
    <li> The Schick Quattro Midnight Razor is the same as the other Quattro&#x27;s except for the color and the angle of the actual razor is closer to 90 degrees rather then the other more flat razors. First off I tried the Fusion, Mach, and various Bic disposables. They were all over priced and usually gave me razor burn/cuts the blades particularly on the Gillette razors lasted maybe 5-6 days no joke. I decided to try the original Quattro, I liked it but It just didn&#x27;t feel like it fit my hand well. So I then came across the Midnight edition with its aggressively curved design and knew I had to give it a try. It shaves great!! No razor burn and very smooth close but not too close shave. The blades are actually made in Germany and if you purchase the titanium ones they last a very long time! I consistently get 3 weeks or more out of a blade. The titanium blades also have a blade mounted on the back for trimming in those hard to reach areas. The reason I give this product 4 out of 5 is because like every new multi-blade razor the blades for these things are outrageously priced. However these blades are still a few dollars cheaper then the Gillette Fusion and most Mach blades. Gillette definitely has won the advertising portion of this market but if you want a true close shave I recommend the Schick Quattro Midnight Edition.</li>
    <li> Been a long time mach 3 user , figured i would go with something new to update myself and keep up with the times , tried the hydro 5 , too big and bulky , felt like i should be wearing a yellow helmet with that blade and razor , went down to the hydro 3 since it supposedly provides a better shave then the mach 3 , and while i will give it that it does shave closer, the mach 3 performance wise still beat the hydro , the shape in your hand and the feed back , feels strong in your hand , well figured i would give the quattro a last shot deal , if didnt work out always happy with the mach 3 , i have to say the quattro midnight exceeded my expectations , the blades are the right size, you can get into narrow spaces around your nose ,while the mach 3 is the work horse , the quattro felt like the ferrari you always wanted to drive , not crazy about the flimsiness of the blade on the quattro , didnt affect performance, once on your face the blade and handle combo  gave you instant confidence , qauttro is just sexy , compared to the mach 3 , with both you cant go wrong .</li>
    <li> I have multiple razors and just buy the blades that are on sale when I need them.  So, I switch between Quattro, Hydro, and Mach 3.  Mach 3 is my favorite.  It seems to last the longest and is the least pulling on the hair, but Quattro gets the job done as well.  One thing for sure, I will never go back to cheap razors again.</li>
    <li> very good razor my husband loved it the only thing is that it just brings one more refill but its really a close smooth shave</li>
    <li> I used to be a big fan of the mach 3 (and before that, the sensor). I was doubtful when I tried the quattro, but it won me over within 2 weeks. First off it DOES shave closer, no question about it. Second, the razor blades last FOREVER. I swear I&#x27;ve gone a month or more before having to put in a new blade. Its just incredible. I dont know why that is; maybe four blades means less wear and tear on any particular blade so altogether they last longer? Or is it the coating on the blade? Who knows, but its just incredible how long it lasts.  &lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that with four blades the cartridge is relatively wide, so its just a bit tougher to get that spot right under the nose. You can do it though, so its really a non issue.</li>
    <li> Overall this razor does what it&#x27;s supposed to however, it doesn&#x27;t do it very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good: It has a really cool looking case that can stand the razor upright so that it can air dry. You can also lay the razor down like in the picture for storage. The razor has a pretty nice rubber grip that prevents slipping. It also has a wire guard on the blades so that you get cut less while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad: Four blades is nothing great. After shaving an area I would look at the razor and see that the first and second blade would be full of hair, the third blade hade a little hair and the fourth had practically no hair in it. For some reason it didn&#x27;t seem to capture as much hair either, I had to shave the same area multiple times even when going against the grain. They also advertise that the blades are spaced futher apart so that it cleans easily...nope. In fact I actually had to run it under the water and submerge it under water for several minutes and even then there was still hair in it. The worst feature about this razor though would be the lack of anti-friction coating on the blades. Either that or the blades just arent sharp because when I would shave it pulls at the hair and gets caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very displeased with the preformance of this razor and I would suggest that you find a different razor such as the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo which cuts like a dream.</li>
    <li> Wanted to give these a try. It was alright.  After two weeks, my wife said that she felt like the Gillette Fusion provided a much closer shave.  We switched back to the Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> The Schick Quattro Midnight is a Schick Quattro of a different color only, with the same great shave.  With the Schick Quattro Line of razors, you&#x27;ll get a shave that&#x27;s as good if not better then any other razor.  Anyone saying anything different, is speaking nothing more then their opinion, not the facts.  Any of the good 3 blade razors from Schick or Gillette, and the 4 bladed Schick Quattro with give any man a good clean and close shave.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem with the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo is that the blades are expensive and don&#x27;t last long at all.  The Schick Quattro shaves just as well and the blades last, giving a man many more shaves per blade, and they cost less.  I have the Mack 3 Turbo and it did a good job shaving, but I had to replace the blades to often.  A young man, or someone with Peach Fuzz may be alright with the Gillette Mack 3 Turbo, but if you have tough hard wiskers, you won&#x27;t get much life out of your Mack 3 Turbo Blades, and they are not cheap to buy.  This is the opinion of many if you read the reviews, even many who love the Mack 3 Turbo complain of the blades not lasting.  Gillette&#x27;s Sensor 3 shaves as good, better in some place on my face then the Mack 3 Turbo, and the blade last much long then Mach 3 Turbo&#x27;s.  Being that both are made buy Gillette, I don&#x27;t know why this would be, but it is what it is, a fact.  Also, after a few weeks, the blades started coming lose and/or wobbled side to side on it&#x27;s mount.  Twice I had my Mack 3 Turbo Blade come off as I shaved!    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Schick Quattro is a very well made razor that will give you many good, clean, close shaves without nicks, cuts or razor burn, with each and ever blade.  The blades clean out very well, the handle is a dream, giving you great control as you shave.  And the blades don&#x27;t become lose or wobble as the Mach 3 Turbo Blades do.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But for me, the main reasons that the Schick Quattro is now the razor I use and why I recommend it to all, is that it gives a shave as good as, if not better, then any other razor.  And the blades last much longer giving many more shaves per blade then Mack 3 Turbo&#x27;s, and they cost less.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised . . . the comfort was more than I expected. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a coarse beard and sensitive skin. Most razors like Sensor &amp; Mach 3 give me a decent shave, but because of my coarse beard I have to go over certain areas several times. As a result I get a close shave but at the expense of redness, razor burn, irritation and cuts. But the Schick Quattro Midnight gives me a very close shave without all of the irritation, and it&#x27;s next to impossible to cut yourself with this razor. The razor glides smoothly over your skin for a very comfortable shave including the chin and sensitive neck areas. And you get get a month&#x27;s worth of shaves on one blade.  I recommend using the Quattro Titanium blades with the Quattro Midnight razor. They are sharper, shave a little closer and include a trimming blade on the top for tight areas. Mug soap used with a brush also will improve shaving performance. Colonel Conk Amber soap provides a dense and slick cushion between the blades and your face and works much better than typical canned shave creams or gels.</li>
    <li> The blades clog frequently.  It does not give a great shave.</li>
    <li> it took me time to adjust to the light wieght but the the razor has performing very well, providing some of the best shaves I have had in years.</li>
    <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
    <li> Works great, the neck angle makes it much more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Did not hold razor head adequately.  Ended up throwing the unit away and getting another original Quattro Razor (white).  No problems with the seller.</li>
