<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice set of brushes, larger than I expected.</li>
    <li> They smelt like weird chemicals. The quality of the brushes are not so great. There was long hairs sticking out of every brush I had to finish cutting them off. The way they apply make up sucks. I&#x27;d rather use my fingers and hands. I only use 2 brushes out of the whole kit.</li>
    <li> I love theses brushes, i was worried they would shed and be like cheap brushes, but actually they are quite amazing, i use them everyday. I love them. so worth it. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes bristles fall off. Not all of them...so far 2.</li>
    <li> In love&amp;#60;3 Got them 2 weeks early and I just love it! Only thing to complain about is the wooden and metal part aren&#x27;t held together the best but still worth it!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Cheaper quality but great for price.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my sister and she really loves them. They arrived a lot sooner than the delivery date and are very cute and soft my sister is very satisfied</li>
    <li> Brushing are falling of the handles after a few washes. Brush it&#x27;s self is decent but not useful when broken</li>
    <li> I bought these brush a few months ago even though I was a little skeptical. When they came the brushes and the case smelled like paint which never really went away. When I pulled one out of the pouch I was amazed at how soft they were and I love the case it is so cute and great for travel. I use these brushes everyday to apply foundation and eye shadow I love the eye brushes but the face brushes are really flimsy. However none of the brushes shed and they work well.</li>
    <li> Soft as furr (: work well and look amazing. Will buy again when needing more!</li>
    <li> The case they come in smells way too bad to keep &amp; the brushes need to be cleaned before use. The bristles feel pretty soft &amp; the colors are gorgeous. I hope these brushes hold up after a few cleanings. Great brushes for beginners</li>
    <li> Great buy,great price LOVE it LOVE IT LOVE IT.plus NO SHEDDING. Applies  make up nicely and I can tell it will last long!&lt;br /&gt;#RAR</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Super soft and great color! Yes there is a smell when you open the package.  Its the smell of plastic and it fades. Buy these brushes they are worth it!</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes fell apart about 2 weeks after having it. They aren&#x27;t worth the money so don&#x27;t bother. Brushes look much different in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love these. I Dont wear make up a lot but when I go out I like to look good! The only thing I found up setting is that I had to super glue the eyelash brush down because it detached from the stick as soon as I attempted to use it.</li>
    <li> Great brushes to practice with! Plus they are purple which is my favorite color. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding and I wash them after every use.</li>
    <li> Not only are these an awesome color, they come with an awesome handy case, and everything works great! The only small issue I &#x27;ve had is some of the hairs falling out but it was very few, and not a big deal at all. Other than that this was worth the money! I recommend to people who need or want new make up brushes, and don&#x27;t want to pay a ridiculous price! But if you&#x27;re one of those people who are very picky and obsessed with your make-up, just stick to the higher quality, and higher priced items. :)</li>
    <li> Great Brush set. Paid just under $10. It has everything you need for make-up application. Love the color as well; I ordered purple. Love it!</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;looks cute&lt;br /&gt;gets the job done, sort of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;smells cheap&lt;br /&gt;not good blenders&lt;br /&gt;scratches on red wood:(&lt;br /&gt;the case is ugly!</li>
    <li> Losing the glue attached to the handle</li>
    <li> The brushes came in time. They are really cute and love the bag!!</li>
    <li> I love the color of these brushes they are so pretty. One of the bigger brushes however was a white and dark purple not light purple to dark purple like the rest.</li>
    <li> I do not know much about makeup brushes but this one seemed to work well. The brushes were very soft and the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out. The pouch keeps the brushes organized which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I have had them for a little over a year now and they still work! I can tell some of them are starting to need replaced but I&#x27;m really hard on my brushes and use them several times a day! they are very soft and so cute! I defiantly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Been rocking with them for a long time. Love the angled bigger brush for highlighting &amp; the fluffy large brush for blush.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these brushes! Got them for her 18th birthday.</li>
    <li> They smelled allot like chemical when they arrived. It washed out after a couple washes though.</li>
    <li> Terrible, they fell apart the first day I got them and I had to hot glue the brushes back on the sticks. The bristles shed a lot and they don&#x27;t wash well. Not worth more than $5 for the whole set !</li>
    <li> I love these and they are very soft. The packaging and brushes themselves just smelled like paint. But other than that no problems.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! such soft brushes and they work wonderfully. I honestly don&#x27;t use the smaller brushes but I use them for painting and never realized make up brushes worked so wonderfully for paint haha.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for over a year now, and they have held up great. I recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes, dont shed and there is one for all my makeup needs!</li>
    <li> The brushed are spoiling soft!!! My favorite color is purple so these brushes makes putting on makeup very fun!!! The cute little carrying case is just adorable. I love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these a year ago because i thought they were so cute and I was new to makeup and the application. When they first came in they had a little bit of a smell. I washed them and there was no problem with smell afterwards. Some of the brushes came off the handles within a couple weeks. I still use the ones that haven&#x27;t come off yet. The eye shadow brushes are all very similar and don&#x27;t seem to serve a singular purpose but they pickup product well. The fan brush is thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up any product. These are nowhere near professional quality.</li>
    <li> loved the set. but i wish the labled the brushes so you know how to use them. otherwise soft and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The brushes are ok. The wooden handle has already detached off one of my brushes. No biggie. I just super glued it back on.</li>
    <li> I would give them 5 stars but I had to glue the silver part back onto the handle. Other than that theyre very nice</li>
    <li> makes a perfect gift for a beginner. I&#x27;m no make up artist but I prefer other brushes. comes with purple pouch as said &amp; each brush comes in its own plastic protection. the brushes are nice &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> Love love love these!  I love purple, so these were a perfect find!</li>
    <li> love these brushes... my first brush set and im really pleased with the quality and the price thanks</li>
    <li> I received my item very quick and works well. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so beautiful. Very soft and the colors are gorgeous. Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my niece and she loves it I would definitely recommend this product as a great gift purchase.</li>
    <li> I felt they were well worth the money, wish I had bought the 32 piece.</li>
    <li> i like the way they smell and feel on my skin</li>
    <li> Really soft brushes came fast too , the case smells like paint but brushes are beautiful . haven&#x27;t used them yet but seem lovely.</li>
    <li> Soft, quality brushes</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> very cute, very soft and useful</li>
    <li> cheap. but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> bought these for my friend for her bday. She loves purple and she loved these.</li>
    <li> Perfect set of brushes. They&#x27;re soft but still hold the makeup. Great buy, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft. They apply make-up beautifully. I love them so much. They are completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I wanted these like 9 months ago but they were $25.00 and since I was not sure if they were any good I went with another brush set, that was just basic than this went on sale for $12.00 and I jumped on it and im so glad I did the brushes came with the case on the day it said, the brushes are super soft and no hairs were falling out the only bad thing is the brushes are not labeled so if you don&#x27;t know your brushes you will have to google them.</li>
    <li> I just got these and I&#x27;m okay with them . Not for everyday use. But I do like the variety of tools I can use for different areas.  From 1 to 10 I would  say 9 is my rating.</li>
    <li> Love it nice and soft!!!!! Good buy</li>
    <li> It was kind of strange to open the bag of brushes expecting them to be the neon purplish/blue color and find white/purple ombre brushes inside lol. The bristles are white on bottom and purple on top, not the neon bluish/purple color shown in the photo. The handles and the case ARE the colors in the photo. It needs to be put in the description that colors vary.&lt;br /&gt;*edit*&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, these are my first set of brushes and I do like them. I&#x27;ve had them a little over 4 months now and they still haven&#x27;t shed bristles yet, but unfortunately three of the non bristle brushes have popped off of the handle (mascara wand, brow brush, &amp; eyeshadow pad). I&#x27;m not an every single day makeup wearer, I wear it maybe twice a week, so thats the only time I use them. So it does make me a little upset that they&#x27;ve not been used frequently to have broken already. I changed the stars from 4 to 3 because the brushes (other than the ones with bristles) have fallen apart. They&#x27;re cute and work for basic makeup application, but aren&#x27;t very durable.</li>
    <li> Overall, these brushes are just good. As mentioned, they do have a bad smell, but if you wash them before use it&#x27;s not a problem. They&#x27;re very soft, which is good and bad. Some are so soft little product remains on the brush; there&#x27;s a ton of fallout. However, for the price, the bigger blush/powder brushes and tiny concealer and angled flat brushes are my favorites. Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive I&#x27;d recommend it to someone who wants to branch out with their makeup collection.</li>
    <li> As a former a makeup artist, I&#x27;m not a fan of these brushes.  These brushes may be great for face painting,  but not for applying and blending makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all bristles have a similar feel to a concealer brush, except less forgiving.  I felt most brushes were just a repeat of each other just in different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smallest is great for eye liner, and the contour blush brush works fine, but over all the brushes are a low quality.  Went back to my old brushes.</li>
    <li> They look great, work great, and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Works wonders but the smell on them is so strong I&#x27;ve never smelled anything on make up brushes lime did these it smelled like they were dipped in paint</li>
    <li> My wife says the brushes are soft. I don&#x27;t know much about this sort of thing but she wanted it for Christmas and she likes it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the brushes the are so soft and pick the makeup right up</li>
    <li> Great on time no smell</li>
    <li> This product is priced very good for this many brushes I love my kit and the kit loves me XD being a girl I usally break and go threw a lot of brushes it&#x27;s great that there purple and its so bright that I see it before step on it</li>
    <li> So pretty! Soft brushes (that aren&#x27;t too soft) for a great price!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheap but perfect for beginners.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly</li>
    <li> Good amount and good application, but you must wash frequently otherwise the ends come off on your face.</li>
    <li> As good as they look.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but very soft to the touch. So in love with the color. Only down side is the case is more of a plastic like texture than silkily but that isn&#x27;t a big down fall for me.</li>
    <li> Eyebrow brush fell off the stem the first day. Glued it back on and it&#x27;s fine. The rest are still fine. Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Love it just smells like paint</li>
    <li> These are some fabulous brushes I just received it is like putting makeup on with silk.  I love them</li>
    <li> Brushes don&#x27;t pick up product very well</li>
    <li> These are beautiful, and the cost was  so low I wanted them! The bristles are very thin, hardly any on a brush. The bristles are also so soft and fine they don&#x27;t hold make at all! The only brush i was able to use effectively was the eyebrow brush and after 2 weeks of using it about 4 or 5 times all the plastic bristles broke way, and I wasn&#x27;t over using it nor was I aggressive with it. Cheap Cheap Cheap, in all ways. Guess that&#x27;s why they say you get what you paid for, it is certainly true for this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money, unless this is a gift for a child who likes to play with make up or someone just starting to use make up and wont know or care how poorly made these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side  note, I read the reviews of how poorly made theses are and how they didn&#x27;t work and I thought people were either just being dramatic or had way too high of standards for brushes, TRUST ME, that is not the case, they really suck. Do not be ignorant like I was thinking you could make them work for you. They are just as bad as people say.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup brush set! they&#x27;re so beautiful &amp; I&#x27;ve had them for 2 months without any problems.</li>
    <li> Yes the  brushes have a chemical smell but all you need to do is wash them first with dish soap and olive oil and the smell is gone. also let the case air out. good brushes over all and great for traveling</li>
    <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
    <li> Received mine today yippee looks alright thought there would be certain brushes but not overall unsatisfied afterall i love purple</li>
    <li> One of the best items I have bought from Amazon! I love them!!!</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift, item came exactly as pictured and was great quality. perfect for makeup lovers of all ages!</li>
    <li> My brush set is what I ordered but the case is falling apart</li>
    <li> I totally forgot that I had ordered the Professional Cosmetic Makeup brushes. They are wonderful. I love the color, the packaging, and the protected pouch. I am thrilled with the service I received for this Dragonpad product. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I liked these brushes! I have very sensitive skin, and the brushes I used before this were too rough on my skin. These brushes are perfect! They are very soft and apply the product well. I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are really good quality and I love the color of them.  The case is pretty good too!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very firm and the variety isn&#x27;t very great. I would try a different set of brushes if your looking for something more professional. But for a girls first set of brushes I say it&#x27;s perfect to start out with.</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok. They were very inexpensive.  Only down side is that they have a strong chemical smell; hope it disappears after I was &amp; air dry them. It took forever for them to arrive but arrived during the expected delivery dates. Overall I&#x27;m Satisfied with the brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! The set is awesome and I have a brush for everything! Keep in mind this is an incredible price for the amount of brushes you get so they are not professional quality brushes. The eyeshadow sponge type brush became unglued and another of the brushes has started to lose bristles already. It doesn&#x27;t bother me because they were cheap and I still have 14 other brushes to use.</li>
    <li> problems&lt;br /&gt;1. Terrible smell&lt;br /&gt;2. Brushes shed&lt;br /&gt;3. You can&#x27;t apply makeup on with these&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re depend on which one your using either&lt;br /&gt;*too hard/stiff even after a lot of wear&lt;br /&gt;Or&lt;br /&gt;*too soft&lt;br /&gt;the brushes also don&#x27;t pick up the make up wether it&#x27;s liquid or powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only honest good thing about these brushes is the color if you want them for display I guess these are the brushes your looking for.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all of my friends.  It was a great purchase for the money.  I will use it for many years.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful and soft! I love them. They only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is the brush handles appear purple in the picture but they are actually burgundy. Also the paint was fresh on the handles so the smell of paint was strong and I had to wait a few days to use them</li>
    <li> My sister loved the brushes</li>
    <li> Love em. Came back to do another review and there still great. I&#x27;ve had these a while now and none of the hairs are falling out and still very very soft.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a little while but most arrived in great shape. One is a little lose but overall great purchase.</li>
    <li> this is just a basic set of makeup brushes, they are not very soft. i have only cleaned them once so far and they held up pretty well.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like these they were not good with blending what&#x27;s so ever I dislike how the smell of the packaging was it was so strong and the big brushes were actually worth the money but the others were not .i really wish there was more blending brushes .it took me so long to try and achieve this look on my friend I had to use my own blending brushes</li>
    <li> I dont know if i would recommend these, the brushes arrived reeking like spray paint like the ends of the brushes were just painted on. As far as the actual brushes YES! They are pretty but i havent used them because of the smell its too strong and i really dont want to make my face break out with all the chemicals on these brushes</li>
    <li> Good for starter or backup brushes. Good price</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Brow brush broke same day</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing ! I bought them for the color, but they are so soft. Plus shipment was fast. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Love the soft brushes</li>
    <li> I did really like this set, the metal tips came off of the handles after a few weeks, I ended up taking them all off and gluing them and they were fine.</li>
    <li> The kit came new and as described.  The brush set has been amazing.  I would recommend the set to anyone.</li>
    <li> They r a little hard but great for price.</li>
    <li> Love how soft they are only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that they smell like paint but I can easily get passed that worth it</li>
    <li> It came a lil late or so. At first I did notice a chemically smell. Since I&#x27;m expecting I didn&#x27;t open any further untill my husband looked at it. My husband is a contactor and believes it&#x27;s the shiny paint coat from the case, not the brushes. it&#x27;s a specific kind of paint to seal the top layer of paint. I intended to wash everything anyway once I let it air dry after open. You can&#x27;t beat the price so I&#x27;m hoping I get some good use out of my new brushes. Purples my favorite color too. They&#x27;re really cute. Pretty sturdy. Thus far, I give it 4 stars without actually using them. The smell and delivery through me off a bit but its manageable. The case and amount of brushes given is a bargain. If the bristles don&#x27;t fall out id give it a 5.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal. For $10 you get 16 brushes. Not all the brushes are great but for the price I didn&#x27;t mind. They are easy to use and clean. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding and they&#x27;re not too uncomfortable on your skin. The case is kind of garbage but I already have a different container for my brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!  Very nice quality!</li>
    <li> These brushes are horrible but u get what u pay for</li>
    <li> I wish there would have been a guide on which brush you use for what. Or maybe a label engraved upon the brush. One of mine popped off the stick too. The bigger ones are supper soft and I love the color. The smaller ones are not my favorite mostly because I do not know how to use them.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but they send me the wrong color</li>
    <li> I got these on time and they work wonderfully. They are very soft though so if you want a bit tougher brush you might consider a different set. These are incredibly soft and smooth. Perfect for my sensitive skin ^_^</li>
    <li> They smell really bad. Like paint. The hairs stick out and are cheaply made but for the price i guess they are ok.</li>
    <li> Item arrived before quoted date, though it still took a few weeks. One of the brush tops came off but can easily be glued back. Overall nice appearance and good quality for the price. Good starting set for those who are new to using makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> i can do all sorts of things w/ these brushes! Came very Fast!</li>
    <li> Very pretty color,nice n soft!!</li>
    <li> Very soft and work perfectly! Ive never used better brushes before to be honest!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about a month ago and I still have not even gotten it and its really making me angry! I ordered this and still haven&#x27;t gotten it?! Not happy at all!!!</li>
    <li> I really, really love these. They are so inexpensive, and they are extremely soft. I have had very little problems with shedding, but you NEED to avoid getting the bottom of the hairs (where they connect to the handle) wet, or the glue will start to loosen and you WILL have shedding. I would recommend these to anyone getting in to makeup, as I had zero issues with them.</li>
    <li> I just started getting into this whole makeup (like legit do everything there is to do on your face makeup) and I bought this kit to get better acquainted with the brushed one usually needs. To be honest you don&#x27;t need all of the brushes unless you are a makeup artist or a person in the entertainment industry. So it is a very good way to identify which brushes you actually use and then you can go buy yourself really nice version of those brushes. These are not the creme the la creme of brushes but they do the trick, so if you are not picky about the quality of the brush and are decently skilled these will do just fine.</li>
    <li> Within a few uses the actual brushes started to fall off the wooden area it was attached to</li>
    <li> This brush set is beautiful and soft. I love the brush holder that it comes with, it is the perfect way for me to keep them organized!</li>
    <li> Love them!!! They work perfectly will buy again soon</li>
    <li> Came apart within a month or so. Lovely looking, poor quality</li>
    <li> I received this brush set and was so happy with it. For the price, it is faar nicer than anything I have seen in stores.</li>
    <li> I got these because I wanted a kit of brushes and was too lazy to go out and buy some. The smaller brushes are great for eyeshadow, concealer, eyeliner, etc. The bigger brushes appear to be very plush and wide, but when I received them, the big three were essentially the same size as a blush brush, not the big fluffy foundation brush I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes do smell very acrid, but after washing them with regular soap, the majority of the smell was gone. I haven&#x27;t experienced any hair fallout yet, so fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product uses her brushes about every day</li>
    <li> Love it. Was here very fast!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality super cute and are very stylish. But I don&#x27;t use a lot of the brushes</li>
    <li> They came on the day it said it would come. I&#x27;m a MUA. These are fairly good brushes, the quality isn&#x27;t like the expensive professional brushes. They get the job done. I would recommend these for personal use. The case is made of cheap materials, but it seems pretty durable.</li>
    <li> The brushes came super fast which I was happy about. However, when I first opened the package the plastic smell was overwhelming and smelt similar to a strong chemical. The brushes individually smelt the same way. Overall you get what you pay for. I think there are better brushes out there but they do the job and are cute. I was a little disappointed that one of the brushes broke even before I used it and another one had a stain on the wooden part. I would recommend washing them before hand in order to get the strong plastic smell out. I will not be using the pack it came in because it smells so bad. Not a bad purchase but would of liked something better.</li>
    <li> These brush&#x27;s are awful! I mainly use the ones to do my eye makeup and I hate them! They have no width to them. I am sticking to the single brush I had always used before for my eye shadow. It actually applies the makeup and has some width to it instead of unlike these brush&#x27;s that are like a square.</li>
    <li> Nice starter set - brushes very soft</li>
    <li> These are sooooo nice! I have had them for about 3 months, using them about once or twice a week. No shedding, breaking, or anything like that. They are soft and very appealing to the eye. I absolutely recommend them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. Very very soft like professional grade brushes. The bristles hardly, if ever (I haven&#x27;t noticed it yet and I&#x27;ve had these for months) fall out.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes wobbled but other then that it is a greate l beginner kit</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice.  They don&#x27;t shed and they are very soft.  I have recommend them to my friends and would recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> Brushes are better than I expected.  Yes I would recommend.  They are super soft--so go lightly when dipping into high pigment palettes.</li>
    <li> So soft and looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> So I got these brushes and a bunch of them had these hard plastic pieces of the ends, I tried removing them gently with my fingers but they didn&#x27;t just rub away. I&#x27;m returning them because I can&#x27;t put that on my face it would scratch me or something. It&#x27;s a shame because some of the brushes look like they would be good.</li>
    <li> Set came very quick and orderly. Bristles are soft and apply product well. Only downside it that the handles are red instead of black as I had assumed.</li>
    <li> The fan brush is a bit thin and the case smells like burnt plastic but otherwise beautiful synthetic brushes.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I absolute love it and all the brushes have a great sturdy texture</li>
    <li> Gifted it to my sister. She seems to love it.</li>
    <li> I gave it one less star because it smells really chemical plastic stench, but like the other reviewers say &#x27;you have to air it out&amp;#34; I actually bought this for a friend who is starting up with doing makeup professionally. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup professional but these work fine.  The price was great and the case for them is very nice.</li>
    <li> The images show the brushes to be purple, which is what drew me to them as my best friend loves purple. In reality, the brushes were mostly blue with purple tips. The bag also smells like paint remover so I had to let it air out. It&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for, but it&#x27;s an ok side gift which I had to pair with a much nicer gift.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good quality brushes for what they cost! They work very well. They&#x27;re really soft and they&#x27;re such a cute color~</li>
    <li> I ordered these back in December but since it was christmas I wasn&#x27;t going to receive them till the end of January but I never received them! Such a waste of money, just glad they were cheap though.</li>
    <li> The brushes were of great quality for the price!! Great brushes for a beginner with makeup! You really have everything you need with this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> These are super soft! They are also very pretty in person and work very well for applying my makeup. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I received them in the mail today and was surprised by how nice the purple bag looks. It looks like a clutch that you could wear out. it does smell like paint but it doesnt bother me. The brushes all look like they are good quality and come in great different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND BUYING!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bag and brushes.  Great quality, especially for the price.  They arrived next day</li>
    <li> Love my travel makeup brushes. The roll up case is very convenient and easy to travel with. Tons of people have asked me where I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes today and they are soft, look very beautiful and I am beyond pleased. The quality is wonderful. I feel like I got real value, they look exactly like the picture. The purple case they come with has a heavy plastic smell but I assume that will fade with time.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes! Didn&#x27;t ship fast at all but worth the wait!</li>
    <li> The brushes break off from the wood handles. They&#x27;re really cheap, but so is the price so it&#x27;s not surprising. They&#x27;re decent for short term use.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my 12 year old niece and when I opened it, I actually wanted it for myself! She LOVES it and my sister who has spent thousands of dollars on MAC products, including brushes, was amazed at the quality for the price. Of course these aren&#x27;t MAC brushes but you&#x27;re also not paying $30 for each brush. As an adult, I&#x27;d buy this for myself. It&#x27;s more than worth the money and the brushes are better than any I&#x27;ve ever bought at Target or Walmart. Seriously good buy!</li>
    <li> Good product with a great price.  I bought to use as a gift, liked it so much I ordered again so I could have one for myself.  I didn&#x27;t really need it at the time, but has since become my favorite, since the case packs so easily for travel.</li>
    <li> They had a strange smell, but after cleaning the brushes in MAC solution, they were soft and perfect for my make up pallets!</li>
    <li> Brushes are too soft to use as make up brushes. Cheap brushes for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this. I have to say, purple is my fav color so I went right after this. I received it nice and fast. However, it smelled so bad, I was really hoping for more out of this.</li>
    <li> The cosmetic brushes are of professional quality and arranged according to use - facial brushes are in one section, brushes to apply eye make-up in the next section and so on.  The storage case is well made and folds up to a small kit for traveling.  I definitely recommend this product for the quality, price and convenience.  The kit eliminates searching for brushes on my vanity and provides a handy way to protect and pack brushes in a small carrying case for travel.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a Theatre major. she loved the quality and is excited to use them for class and performance.</li>
    <li> I bought better brushes at a department store. These are not worth the money i paid. They are shedding already and i prpbably will just throw them away.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up that much product. But can&#x27;t really complain for the price. The eyeshadow brushes are better than the face brushes.</li>
    <li> I love the travel case.  It&#x27;s perfect for the money you spend for it!  I don&#x27;t need perfect so this worked well for me!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! Very soft and doesnt shed only problem I had was the nail salon smell that came with the opening the set. Not nessicarly a bad smell but I&#x27;d prefer not to have it in my bathroom. Great product ^_^</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and super soft. It took me a while to receive them but they were worth the wait! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used the brushes. This product smelled so bad. I aired it out for days and one month later it still smells very foul. I&#x27;d rate zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> my only problem with them is that all the eye shaddow brushes are hard, I wish they were a bit looser. Other than that it is an amazing set for a really good price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft!! The face brushes are so great, they work amazingly on my skin. There is also absolutely no fall out even after washing! My only down fall with these  brushes is that they are not that dense so when it came to blending, as far as eye shadow goes, they really aren&#x27;t the best. They make blending very difficult. And as most brushes do, they did smell at first but it goes away pretty quickly. Over all I do enjoy these brushes they are great starter brush for those that are just getting into make up.</li>
    <li> This 16 pc set were alright the brushes were flat but still managed to pick up the product they were super soft . I&#x27;ll recommend it only to starters</li>
    <li> Love it more than I expected, the brushes are easy to clean and are very sturdy</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the brushes but I&#x27;m content with the ones I have used.</li>
    <li> Great product was delivered on time and was worth the price. I only have two complaints about the product, the first thing is the smell of the product it smells strongly of plastic and had to be washed twice before the smell was gone. The second was that the eyebrow shaping brush and comb combo was broken when I opened the package. It&#x27;s not too much of a loss seeing as though I don&#x27;t use that type of thing often but it seemed like it had never been attached in the first place which concerns me about the rest of the brushes. Other than that it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
    <li> For the price I got.. I say there really nice</li>
    <li> Have not used these yet but Love the look and feel of them. I&#x27;m sure they are going to be wonderful.</li>
    <li> A full 14 brushes and tools that appears to be good quality at a very good price. Why pay $50 to $150 for a &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; when you can buy this for $15 bucks.</li>
    <li> Really a nice set for the money. I mean, $12 for a 16 piece brush set with a nice case, that&#x27;s decent. I haven&#x27;t been using them for very long so I can not really know if they will stand the test of time but as I said, they were cheap to buy so even if they only last me a few months or a year, I will be satisfied with that. They are nice and soft, seem to be sturdy and get the job done. They arrived a day before the estimated delivery and that was nice. All in all, you can&#x27;t really go wrong here. Low price, nice quality and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how great the quality of these brushes were. They haven&#x27;t broke, the bristles don&#x27;t come out in my makeup or on my face and help me to achieve the flawless look I&#x27;m looking for !</li>
    <li> Came in fast. Loved the colors and the little bag in came in.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they&#x27;re cute I love the carrying case they don&#x27;t shed when I use them and I will be ordering again in the future</li>
    <li> The product was just as described and was received before it was promised.  Packaging was also done well, protecting the product</li>
    <li> They work amazingly I use them from eyebrows to powder foundation. They are awesome and my favorite color too!. And very easy to handle</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty. The case they come in is flimsy and feels as though the closures will rip out at any time. The brushes are very stiff</li>
    <li> A great value for the price... the only set I would recommend higher is the set of 22 in blue - but for most everyone who isn&#x27;t working in front of a camera - the majority of women and anyone who loves purple - this is a fabulous set or gift for anyone.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of some makeup brushes! These brushes are soft and pick up the makeup well. I&#x27;m not crazy about the purple shade of the brushes since it is hard to gauge how much makeup you have on the brush. They apply the makeup well and clean easily. I would buy again  for sure!</li>
    <li> They came faster than expected!  These are wonderful brushes I use then everyday</li>
    <li> I really like most of  brushes. However, I find the larger brushes too soft to use efficiently, and the eyebrow bristle one came off of its handle right away. I superglued it back and it&#x27;s been fine. Granted, I had to do the same thing to one my my MAC brushes. Anyway, these were definitely worth the price if you aren&#x27;t buying them for the bigger brushes specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH, one other thing. The purple/maroon color scheme is kinda ugly IMO. But I didn&#x27;t buy my brushes to show them off to anyone. But they would look much better with black handles. Also would be nice if they were labeled or numbered.</li>
    <li> My aunt loves these brushe there her favorite she into make nd does a good job love em</li>
    <li> Love the color. I have only owned for three months and the bush tips keep falling off.</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive set these are of decent quality. The purple case is pretty but stinks to high heaven!  I have let it sit out to try and dissipate the chemical odour and its slowly getting better.  The brushes are soft and work pretty well; especially the powder and blush brushes. Not the best but definitely worth the money.  The brushes themselves are quite attractive with dark red wood handles and purple bristles.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, but the brushes do a great job...and are super cute! The bag it omes in has a very strong plastic chemical smell, however. The smell will go away after a few days but it was surprising at first.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter.  She declares undying love of me and the brushes so I am guessing they do their job as expected.</li>
    <li> Decent brushes. Only one star missing because after washing the larger brushes get kind of gross. Have now had them about 6 months and still in good condition, I use them 5-6, days a week</li>
    <li> These had a horrible spray paint smell to them when they arrived. I had to let them air out for a while. They brushes are soft but they do not work well at applying make up.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice and I have not had any problems with the brushes shedding which is a major plus. I would order these brushes again.</li>
    <li> I understand that it shipped from far away and it takes time due to holidays but it took over 3 weeks so i don&#x27;t recommend this if you are needing it before the holidays unless you pay for extra. Other than that the brushes are great. Looks exactly like the picture and came in neatly packaged and everything looks great. The brushes work well. I really like them. The colors are pretty and vibrant too.</li>
    <li> Love them! They are a great price and quality. I use them everyday and I am glad I chose these!</li>
    <li> great gift for a budding teenager</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. These brushes would be worth close to a hundred in a store but I only paid about 9 for them. They do smell sort of like nail polish when they first arive, but if you wash them the smell goes away. Incredible, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, perfect condition when arrived, awesome investment. Brushes are very durable and not cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these brushes they are so soft. I  haven&#x27;t used them yet but I will shortly I will be buying more of these in the future. Also, I really love the colors too.😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I love purple and own a lot of it so why not brushes and they are so soft. I love the bag they come in.</li>
    <li> For the price you get a lot of brushes, and the smaller ones work great, but the bigger ones shed and the brush tips have come away from the handles after a year of slight use (I used them maybe 5 times in a year, washed gently and laid flat to dry). The carrying case is fabulous and I love it and use it for my other makeup brushes, but the brushes themselves are not super great. The price definitely is okay for what you get, and I do continue to use and enjoy the smaller brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are TOO cute, I love the purple tint, and they are a great quality. For the amount I paid I thought I might be getting some cheap china made knock off brush which would fall apart in a week. But these are great! HaHa Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved them</li>
    <li> Great brush set. The brushes clean well. The purple doesn&#x27;t stay for very long depending on what color of makeup you use.</li>
    <li> I loved how soft they were but they weren&#x27;t that great when I used them</li>
    <li> Brushes are very loose. Not great quality but maybe good for a travel bag. I prefer better quality of brushes</li>
    <li> Just what you want in make up brushes! The brushes are soft and the bristles stay in the brush. Make up is applied evenly and profwssionly</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with these brushes. I was concerned that they may leave a lot of brush pieces behind on my face when  I would use them but they did not. I feel these are of high quality and really a nice touch with them in color.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Seller is Excellent. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes and would have given 5 stars. I rated a 4 because they stunk to high heaven when I took them out of the package. Smelled like turpentine or some type of varnish for floors.  Gave me a massive headache. I washed the handles down with warm sudsy water and left them in the other room to dry with the door closed..... now they are fine.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas present for my daughter and so far she loves it.  Quick delivery time.  I am very pleased with everything.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooooooo soft! I immediately fell in love with them. I think I drove my family crazy about them for a good fifteen minutes or so after they came in the mail just cause I was freaking out over them. They are absolutely perfect for everyday use and are a GREAT buy. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> These are so perfect I love them so much. Im going to order more shortly for Christmas gifts! Perfecto !</li>
    <li> i still use them today but if you get nail polish remover or any type of cleaning supply on the stem the paint will come off as if it was fresh nail polish. They are not as purple as shown they are white with purple tips. The bag for it comes apart easily. They are great brushes and have a large quantity of different ones that can be used for different things which is nice. The brushes get dirty easily but can be washed with conditioner. The silver part detaches from the stem easily but can be glued back on. In conclusion this was an okay product but can be advanced. If your looking for high quality brushes that are cheep, i would recommend looking at other sets. Though these are good starter brushes.</li>
    <li> honestly for the price this is a gold mine!</li>
    <li> Man I love these. Easy to clean, soft to use!</li>
    <li> These brushes are really a mixed bag.  On the pro side, the carrying case is well made and had two magnetic snaps that keep the brushes securely tucked away.  The larger face brushes are nice and soft, and though I experienced some fallout, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as soome brushes I have tried.  On the con side, the eyeshadow brushes are too thin and firm and too much the same.  There are no fluffier brushes for powdered shadows.  The thinner, stiffer brushes are not bad for cream shadows and products like eye primers or shadow bases, cream foundations, etc. but they really struggle with powder products, even if you&#x27;re just trying to pack on a thick layer of color, and don&#x27;t really work that well for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price (I paid about $10), they are an ok complement to the brushes I already have and there are enough good brushes to make it worth such a little amount, but this is not the set to buy if you want one all-inclusive brush set to meet all your needs.  Not a bad set to give as a gift, as long as the person receiving it already has some good, fluffy blending brushes, but if you want something more inclusive, there are some great sets for about $5 more that have more brushes, better quality, and are more encompassing of the various types of brushes for blending and shading.</li>
    <li> So soft easy to handle. A great buy. Essential brushes to create that diva look. Cute stylish purple pouch tyhat comes in keeps them neat and in plac. So easy to clean which I consider thast very important</li>
    <li> The product smells awful, I think it is the case. But the brushes inside worked great for what I needed them for. I would recommend them to someone who isn&#x27;t a professional make-up artist.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it was going to come with a pretty carry pack. You should get it if with is some you was going for. On de money.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive these brushes, they are a little softer than what I like but overall they are decent for the price.</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes! The packaging is nice, and I was afraid they would be discolored and not purple but they were! The only bad thing I have to say is that the fan brush was in the fold of the pouch when they shipped it so it&#x27;s kinda bent now, still seems to work well for highlighting though</li>
    <li> I love the brushes but the case already ripped.</li>
    <li> I absolutely live the brushes. They are soft and cute! The bristles Dont fall or anything. I would give it 5 stars But the smell that came with it smell like pure paint, like they just painted it then shipped it off. Other than that its okay.</li>
    <li> Great product for the very inexpensive price.  My daughter loves the brush set.  Compare to a very similar set in Sephora and which was around $100.</li>
    <li> I just got these in mail and so far not too happy , first they have this very strong paint smell when you first take them out the package then I was missing the eyebrow brush .</li>
    <li> Love it smells freshly painted !</li>
    <li> it was nothing i expected. some brushes are fine the only one i like was the angeled brush thats it</li>
    <li> Its nice I liked them love the color</li>
    <li> Very un - satisfied with this product they do not work well with any type of makeup not worth purchasing very disappointed</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift &amp; almost feel bad that I want to throw them out, but they are that bad.  As other reviewers mentioned, the eyeshadow brushes are too firm to blend.  The larger brushes for your face are OK but they are too soft &amp; not fluffy enough. I just received the Eco tools travel brushes &amp; are a much better option on a budget.  Honestly, this is just a waste of money &amp; space.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so worth it for the price! They are so pretty and soft looks 100 times better in person. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with them other then the smell everyone talks about. Which is not a big issue anyway..the smell is not that strong and you can easily open the case up and air it out. Afterwards wash them with hair conditioner let them air dry and they will be perfect! They work great and so affordable. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I need new brush and I just  fell in love when I saw these the color on them and bright and beautiful they came in  nicely packed and im very happy with them</li>
    <li> awesome brushes, great handles, nice caring case as well, plus it works for cleaning the brushes too! overall, they are great</li>
    <li> The brushes seemed nice but have an off putting smell. Plus the brushes do take awhile to come in so don&#x27;t plan on a week shipping here. However for the price they were nice especially if you like purple.</li>
    <li> This was a great gift idea! My friend really enjoyed this product. She really like the combination of brushes. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Serve their purpose. Not top of the line but that was to be expected with the price.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, although poor quality and does not look as pictured. Would not have a problem with it usually but color combination is terrible. Would not by again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome! Great set and arrived so fast! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great set! I want to buy more. I love the bag the product comes in and the different brushes are great and well made, I would not be afraid to buy this either for your own personal use or even professional use.</li>
    <li> Soft and affordable!!</li>
    <li> They are really good and there cute</li>
    <li> Super soft, very durable.</li>
    <li> My cousin bought these and when I go to her house I literally use them Bc they are so soft and v pretty lol so yeah I would recommend them to anyone 😄</li>
    <li> The picture I saw online wasn&#x27;t what I got when I ordered, I ordeded 36 brushes and instead I got 15</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore these brushes. I&#x27;ve had them for a year &amp; their still going strong.</li>
    <li> Brushes are definitely cheap, don&#x27;t pick up much product of any type, but can be dealt with in a pinch.</li>
    <li> In Love with these brushes! super cheap as well</li>
    <li> I love this set.LOVE,LOVE,LOVE</li>
    <li> I bought these based off the great price because I was making Christmas baskets for my family. They added a cute touch! I was left with a few of the brushes and I like them too:)</li>
    <li> They suck. Do not buy. Waste of money. They don&#x27;t hold product on the brush. Save your money. I don&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> got this in good time. the brushed are ok. they would be better if labeled. not everyone knows which brush to use with what makeup product.</li>
    <li> very good quality, i agree with the review that states the fan bruzh is too thin to pick up powder... but thd variety of other brushes, eyebrow brush, eyelashes and eye shawdow brushes make up for it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife after catching the subtle hint that she needed new ones. She loves them, they come self contained in a travel bag, they are of excellent quality.. she looks really good all the time so I assume they work well... but honestly she wakes up looking good. Bottom line here is they are wife approved and my daughters immediately tried to steal them while making the &amp;#34;OOOOOOH&amp;#34; noise of approval. Great price, fast shipping, reasonable packaging.</li>
    <li> Obviously not something a professional mua would use but for someone like me who enjoys makeup and likes to have a lot of brushes, it&#x27;s perfect. Minus one star because a couple of the brushes were pretty much exactly the same and there was not an eyeshadow blending brush included. I have very sensitive skin and my old brushes were too rough for me and irritated my skin. These are perfect and very soft. Get some brush shampoo and wash them properly first. Also the case is super convenient since I some times do my makeup in the car when I&#x27;m going on road trips with my boyfriend. I&#x27;ve been using them every day for months now and I&#x27;ve not had any falling out yet. :) they are definitely a bargain</li>
    <li> Cool brushes. Love the case. I didn&#x27;t really know which brush was for what though I&#x27;m new to make up. A little softer than what I expected but I&#x27;m working with them.</li>
    <li> I have fell in love with these brushes! I have very sensitive skin and many brushes either caused a break-out or made my face feel like I had rug-burn because the brush was too rough. I love the style of them and its portable holder. I do a minimal amount of travel between school, home, and a few other places and they are easy to carry on or put in my bag without taking too much space. I watch A LOT of youtubers to do different things with my make-up. SO...when I go to duplicate its hard because I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using the same brush as them or similar because they are not labeled with size or anything. Lastly they are super easy to wash and do not shed. IG: @najaak</li>
    <li> This is a great set of brushes for the lady who loves luxurious feeling brushes made with an eye to style.  The brushes all have long handles making them easy to use.  The bristles are beautiful in design and a delight on the skin.  If you prefer stiffer brushes then this set may not be what you are looking for.  My brushes are being used with BareEscentuals mineral makeups.  The brushes are as good as the ones sold by that company but at a fraction of the cost.  I am delighted with all the brushes but truly pleased to get lip brushes that are firm enough to outline my lips yet easy enough to clean for use in another color.  As to the complaints of others that the bristles are not secure, mine are snug and shed free.</li>
    <li> When i received it , it had a strong paint smell so bad and also some junk on one of the brushes but soft brushes and blend good .</li>
    <li> I love it! like the picture!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these application brushes. They are very sturdy, well made, and come in an attractive organizer case. The bristles are very soft and gentle for the most delicate of jobs. I would definitely recommend these and will buy these again!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very thin, especially the face brushes there is no &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; to them.  Jury is still out on these.</li>
    <li> i love it they are all perfect now i can really do my makeup to a T im very happy with these brushes</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product, the fluffy brushes are far to soft and the small tip brushes are very stiff and do not apply the makeup well, although it is a good offer, I am now going to stick with brands that I trust.</li>
    <li> These brushes were amazing at first but then the tips started falling off the wood handles and they don&#x27;t hold up very well.</li>
    <li> What else is there to say? They don&#x27;t leave bristles all over my face that I have to spend 20 minutes picking off with tweezers and they&#x27;re purple! I&#x27;m psycho for purple, so that was a major factor in my decision :P</li>
    <li> everything shown in pic is what you get .....16pc  same color as pic comes in a pouch(purplish bag with slots for every piece) every piece comes with a clear covering.  bristles are soft and don&#x27;t come loose like cheap brushes and handles are strong and thick...haven&#x27;t had them for long but to me they are durable and at a great price and they shipped quick really pleased!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I was very upset with this purchase.  The color is not true the picture. It&#x27;s more of a bright red chilidsh color</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Alittle on the soft side...like so soft they don&#x27;t pick up much pigment...but I don&#x27;t mind, I tend to be heavy handed with my application, anyway. Overall a nice little starter set.</li>
    <li> This set is okay to say the least. Way to much fall out. But gets the job done. If I had to make my purchase all  over again I would try to find something better.</li>
    <li> The brushes don&#x27;t pick up pigment very well. The bristles are very soft and feel like they&#x27;re glued in pretty well. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with bristles falling out. I got this mainly for the brow/lash comb and brush, eye shadow brush, and the blush brush. I&#x27;m newer to makeup and wanted something to help me experiment. This was nice because I don&#x27;t need expensive brushes at this point and since these brushes don&#x27;t pick up pigment well it helps keep me from applying too much.</li>
    <li> i took off one star because everything is nice pretty and cute then I took the cover off the fan brush and the brush was wavy it looked fine when I had the cover on it it just was wavy for some reason</li>
    <li> These bushes are so nicely organized in the purple case. They come wrapped in plastic so as not to lose their shape. They are very soft but I feel like they are missing a few eye brushes that I already owned. Like a blending brush and an angled shadow brush.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are AMAZING! They are super soft and interesting purple color. The color of these brushes help me see how much product is actually on the brush. Because the handles are long and thin, it makes it easy for me to use. If you don&#x27;t have a set of brushes already, I recommend this set of brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and helps apply your makeup on smoothly.  I recommend these brushes not only because they are packaged new,  they came before my estimate date which was great.</li>
    <li> poor quality brushes like 1 store quality</li>
    <li> This was very nice the color was great</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Perfect</li>
    <li> Love these! Ive had these for a few months and use them almost everyday. They are super soft and clean real easy! I fully recommend!</li>
    <li> i love these they are perfect for me. Will buy more of these brushes when they get old very awesome</li>
    <li> When I got these brushes I was stoked!! Sadly one of the brushes was falling apart. But! The rest of the brushes have done wonderful &amp;#60;3 I&#x27;ve had them for now 4 months and they have been my everyday brushes right along side my higher end brushes. I would recommend this!! :3</li>
    <li> It was horrible and it comes apart!!! Do not buy DO NOT BUY its real cheap and its none of the brushes you need!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I am obsessed with the color purple.  The bristles are very soft which is good for the delicate eye area but I found less useful for applying foundation, it seemed a little too soft.  I like the vinyl bag that the brushes are stored in as I can place something wet on it without having to worry about the surface below.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this deal. Very high quality brushes in a very handy carrying bag. A must have for every woman!</li>
    <li> For the price its an amazing product and good quality! feels great and they do look durable! Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> When I first opened the envelope that it was shipped in I smelled a strong paint like smell. I thought it would be the plastic the set was wrapped in; turns out it was the purple case. The smell is very overwhelming and is a huge turn off for this product, I&#x27;m hoping that it may fade away.&lt;br /&gt;Then as I was unpacking the brushes from their individual clear wraps I got a whiff of the brushes.. they have an overwhelming plastic smell that is not pleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smells, I really enjoy these brushes and they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them but they look like the pic and they are soft</li>
    <li> Terrible brushes &amp; 5 of them BROKE. I THREW IT ALL IN THE TRASH.</li>
    <li> its okay,, it doesn&#x27;t fall apart when you wash them, I just wished they were labeled for what their used for, because some brushes work better than others,</li>
    <li> I do not like these brushes.  They just dont work that well.  I like the color, but thats about it.</li>
    <li> some of the brush tips are a bit too stiff that are typically used for eye shadow. Basically got this to supplement my brushes and for easy travel seeing they come in a case that is already preslotted</li>
    <li> All were great except the skinny one for eyeliner was crusty. I had to peel each hair apart and wash it to get the gunk off.</li>
    <li> They shed and break easy. Had them for two month now and I had to throw out my blush, foundation and powder brushes plus the spoolie. They suck at holding product and the glue that holds them together starts to lose hold when u clean them. I cleaned them 2 times and the first time they started to fall apart and shed don&#x27;t get them waste of time and money</li>
    <li> The brushes come in a very convinient case, and its cute! I would have to say this is a great buy because of all the different types of brushes.</li>
    <li> Love how soft they are. Perfect</li>
    <li> They are a nice set of beginner brushes for a teen,  however they are not top quality.  They are pretty:)  I would rate them as good.</li>
    <li> These brushes looked so nice that I had to have a set for my daughter in law for Christmas. These looked the best of any I saw. The black mark here is the ship time is terrible. Ordered on December 11th and delivery could take until January 24th! Yikes. So no Christmas present came. After contacting the seller, he was very prombt with his response and gave me a full refund. But if you are willing to wait, I think these brushes are as good if not even better than what the pros use.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister in law and she loved them, I think she about cried.  Comes in a case that seems a little cheap but the quality is amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft! I do have to agree with another reviewer about the brushes not plling a great deal of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do prefer to use my older foundation brush, but the other brushes are soft and do not seem to shed like some brushes i have gotten. If you are used to brushes that pull a lot of pigment, it takes a bit to get used to these as they do not hold onto the powders as much as some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i think these are a great deal! They clean easily, and once you get used to them work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As i said, the foundation brush doesn&#x27;t really work for me, as it seems to just deposit finishing powder on the top of my skin, not really blending it. I may just need to get used to it, but i will use my MAC brush for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not put these to the really hot water cleaning test as of yet and hope they survive. My old eye brushes finally departed this world after years of soaking and cleaning. I am happily surprised these brushes are of such quality for the price i paid. I recommend them for anyone looking for a nice large long handled set that gives lots of options and does not break the bank!</li>
    <li> bought for my daughter, she likes them.</li>
    <li> Love this set!  :-)  im a cosmetologist in training so im just learning how to use brushes correctly &amp; this was the perfect starter kit dor me.</li>
    <li> They look great but 3 are hard as a rock and covered in glue. As you can see the eyebrow lash brush is broken upon opening the jtem. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Its a verry cute  product it s  also too soft with all type of brushes needed with all shapes and sizes  , great packing  .</li>
    <li> Got me self a pair of lucky brushes to apply my foundation and my blushes. Loved it! Me thinks u will to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ja</li>
    <li> brushes are poorly put together but as long as your doing easy make-up it will do just fine. it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the worst makeup brush I ever purchased the bristles shed first time I seen that btw and one of the brushes broke. Honestly this doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star 👎</li>
    <li> Love the color...description matched perfectly!</li>
    <li> Perfect for everyday makeup!</li>
    <li> Overall, it is an okay set. The brushes are extremely soft.</li>
    <li> Came sooner then expected. Very happy. But breaks easy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and she loves them and says they work great.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Love the color and amount of options.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes about six months ago and they have worked fantastically. They are quality made for the price they are being sold for. I have not had any problems with them. The hairs stay attached and they lay on makeup nice and evenly. They are easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft they don&#x27;t shed And they are very pretty. But the fan brush is very thin and small</li>
    <li> The amount of brushes and case are great.  I got these for my teen and she uses them regularly.  The brushes don&#x27;t shed (much - I mean every brush out there sheds a little) and they are good construction.  Be prepared - it&#x27;s a lengthy ship time.</li>
    <li> this set is great for a beginner. the brushes are so soft and apply easily. for the price I think they make a good set for a young lady to experiment with. i love the color and they feel so great. defiantly worth the money.</li>
    <li> very soft plastic brushes</li>
    <li> I like that there is a brush for anything and everything you need, they are easy to clean and come in their own case</li>
    <li> I think they are perfect. Been using for over a week and its has only shed one or two bristles. the stiffness in the smaller are perfect for detail work and lining !</li>
    <li> Ugliest thing ever and they don&#x27;t have a brush that&#x27;s between the large and small. Whatever</li>
    <li> It came fast! And everything as described!  I used my new brushes once but I love it :) I know they are not pro but it does the Job ! Thank youuuu</li>
    <li> The beautiful person in my family for whom these were a gift says this is a great set. And I thought a really great price.</li>
    <li> Teenage daughter loved it. Thought we wouldn&#x27;t get it in time but Amazon did a great job. Quality of the brushed are really good for the price. I have bought her some at Walmart - and the hair of the brushes kept falling out. So far these have been great. I would recommend this product -</li>
    <li> Well after waiting several weeks of waiting after christmas my daughters decided to put their brushes to use. One of the larger brushed popped off from the handle. Not sure if glue will work, maybe super glue.</li>
    <li> These are some great quality brushes, but I don&#x27;t have any clue what half of them are for. I was really excited about getting them, but it would have been nice if there was some kind of guide or recommendation on what to use each brush for...</li>
    <li> Its a great set of brushes, but if you want wants in the picture they are slightly off. The tips of the brush are purple, but the rest is white. As for the handles they are a very dark red, almost black. The holding case is nice and very durable but much more vibrant from the picture. Overall its a great set, giving it more stars if it was accurate to the picture.</li>
    <li> This is great why to apply makeup and the brushes are beautiful but weren&#x27;t the best but still can work for my brush collection! :)</li>
    <li> I got the product and i was super excited until i opened it. The white lining sew around the case wasn&#x27;t even on all the way, there were bits and pieces of it hanging out every where and the purple fabric tore the first time i opened the case. The first time i used the brushes they shed like crazy and two of the heads fell off in the their first use. i honestly just threw them away I was so angry. Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
    <li> if your just getting started doing makeup these are okay but if your looking for more professional brushes these arent for you. these are really flimsy and useable but not the greatest. but they look just like the photo and they came really quick in the mail.</li>
    <li> Got everything on time and look exactly how it appears in the picture</li>
    <li> very soft and lets you work with ease, lovely color and very sturdy. Yet got a extra navy blue brush?</li>
    <li> Love these! I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months and use them almost everyday. They are super soft and easy to clean. I&#x27;m not a professional but these work fine.</li>
    <li> These brushes are made of the most softest material EVER!  i was soo surprised when i stoke it on my face!  It feels like NOTHING!  They are so soft and very shiek.  The packaging is wonderful; in a little purple carring case, and they dont smell like anything bad, they carry a nice/clean/fresh scent! I tried applying powder with one and it might feel like you&#x27;re not applying anything but trust me it really is!! I gave it  four stars because they came out smaller than what I imagined (or am used to buying), but as long as they do the job im satisfied!!!  In addition its a cheap price for good stuff;)</li>
    <li> Decent brushes, great deal, cute pouch! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in these brushes.  They&#x27;re very stiff yet very soft, if that makes any sense.  The make-up doesn&#x27;t want to stay on the bristles because they&#x27;re so smooth, but the bristles are stiff and don&#x27;t feel nice when I&#x27;m putting eyeshadow on. I tried a few of the brushes for eyeshadow, but they were all the same.  I used the blush brush for my blush which worked ok, I guess.  But I went back to using my Mary Kay eyeshadow brush.</li>
    <li> Really strong point smell and as soon as I opened it the hair in the brushes was already falling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already had to glue one brush back together since the top silver portion popes of. They are &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; brushes. Nothing great.</li>
    <li> I love them .the casing is flimsy but beautiful it can last if you handle it with care .the brushes work well.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes is not the best, but they do the job properly. For the price it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> The quality is excellent and with 16 brushes it should last a long time...even if some do ever wear out.  Recipients were all very happy with it. The packaging is very attractive,,,,  made a nice gift.</li>
    <li> So pretty. Works well, arrived fast and organized.</li>
    <li> They dont break out the skin and are so cute to look at,they are not cheaply made even though I got em for cheap ,I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> good quality. Originally bout them for a friend but now I am going to buy a set for myself. They came in a thick protective case.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase. The bristles are very soft. The colors are beautiful and that is a plus. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> GREAT brushes would definitely recommend i love them soo much not an artists so dont know much but there really soft.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes came apart in my hand as I was opening them. The rest are pretty nice for the price</li>
    <li> Love it! Great price and product. Got I really quick and I love how I have a bag to hold them in.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected maybe even better . make you feel like a real make up artist. Would order again !</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re OK.  In some examples, they&#x27;re too soft to pick up any pigment.  I do use a few of these to apply my makeup, but none of these brushes take center stage.  You absolutely get what you pay for.  I would say these brushes are the right consistency to apply a light blush, detail eye areas, and take care of lip application.  I own many high-end and medium-end brushes and these are somewhat low end.  No worries, though.  They can still get certain jobs done without issue.  I use them for lipstick application, under-eye eyeshadow application, brow gel application, concealer application, and highlighter application. This brush set was well worth the price I paid, but I would not call it high -end.  If you are looking for investment pieces, this won&#x27;t satisfy you.</li>
    <li> Amazing !! Love love love them</li>
    <li> Got this for my teenaged granddaughter.  She said it&#x27;s better than any other collection of brushes, including the more expensive group she had bought one at a time.  I&#x27;m very happy to have bought them.  A woman can&#x27;t do without a good set of brushes!</li>
    <li> I returned and purchased a more expensive set and am much more happy with the new set!!</li>
    <li> Very good brushes! they don&#x27;t fall apart at all!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these brushes, they are cheaply made, they shed EVERYTIME you I used them &amp; they feel too soft</li>
    <li> Was missing a brush when I got it but was good otherwise</li>
    <li> Happy with my product!! (:</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but they look just as described.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I bought a set for myself and a set for my friend. They came exactly as pictured and they are so soft; they pick up makeup easily since they are so soft. They are the only brushes we use now. I wish they had bigger sets I would definitely get them.</li>
    <li> I love the color and style. I use all of them. Im glad i bought them. I use them at work and they work fine.</li>
    <li> To see what I use each of these brushes for read my blog post:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are basically the same brushes as another set I reviewed, white with pink tips--must be made by the same factory. I am a sucker for pretty things so I gave these a try. At first I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, yes the brushes are soft but the face brushes are slippery and don&#x27;t pick up powder very well and there are no fluffy eyeshadow brushes for blending. However, with some improvisation I was able to make these work. Use a light hand with the eye brushes, they are kind of stiff but you can build color and blend with a little work. Since there are no fluffy-type blending brushes, if you need more help blending use the fan brush or gently sweep with one of the largest eyeshadow brushes. If you add a tiny bit of hair gel to the fan brush when it is wet it will make it more useful to sweep away fallout under your eyes. The blush brush adds a light dusting that can be built up, and works fine for contouring with bronzer. The fan brush, angled to your cheekbone, is also good for applying contour and then you can blend it out with the fan brush or one of the powder brushes. These might not be what you are used to but you can definitely make them work. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too successful with is applying powder, if you like a light dusting these give you that but if you need heavier coverage you might want to try something else or just keep layering until you get enough coverage. The eyeshadow brushes work excellent wet or with a product like MAC Fix+.</li>
    <li> They are soft and everything!</li>
    <li> Just got these today! I love the quality and the purple tips! The case is a plus too! It helps organize and separate the brushes. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> This item was in excellent condition. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes and easy to clean. I love the pouch they come in to keep my brushes organized. Great value!</li>
    <li> There is a brush for everything! I love all the options I am able to have while I do my makuep</li>
    <li> Nice shipping, but the brushes are way too soft and don&#x27;t pick up powder all that well. I only use 3 of the brushes.</li>
    <li> These are really great bushes... i use them daily.  The only thing i can say is that brushes are a little soft but really nice</li>
    <li> When I got this there was a very strong smell of plastic/ vinyl (that smell you get with a brand new plastic stuff), but after using it and letting it set out for while it wears off. It&#x27;s mostly the case that stinks, the brushes are great, and have nice wood handles. I love the color and feel of them as well. I also bought the elf brush cleaner to keep them clean and sanitary, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I would recommend this set for a fellow makeup artist/ makeup lover. I gave it a 4 star for a good product but not a 5 due to case stink.</li>
    <li> I really love the make on this product. I bought this because I needed makeup brushes and wait for it they are my favorite color PURPLE!!! They don&#x27;t shed like some of the others I have gotten. They are soft I love them.</li>
    <li> Lots of variety.  Good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush set. For the price I expected them to lose bristles or fall apart but so far I&#x27;ve had them for months and they haven&#x27;t lost shape of fibers yet. They are extremely soft. They hold pigment well. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Pretty great makeup brushes. I&#x27;ve been using since December and the only one thats broken is the spooly. But that was easily fixed with a hot glue gun.</li>
    <li> Great so far brushes arrived clean and looking new however, there was a strong odor from the bag kinda like nail polish. A quick wash with dish detergent took care of that :). A good buy especially if just learning to use make up brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes were a waste of money. The tops of them came off within the first week. The only thing I liked about them was that they came a week early.</li>
    <li> The blending brushes are great had a hard time Working with the other brushes. But the color is gorgeous 😻.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I recommend it to anyone who want a makeup brush I really love this brush</li>
    <li> The brushs are amazing!! They are so soft and they apply makeup very well! For a cheep price, I would recommend this to everyone:D</li>
    <li> Smells weird. Soft and nice to use. But the case smells weird.</li>
    <li> Personally dont like them except for the eyebrow brush and one of the big brushes. They shed overtime. Not food for contouring either</li>
    <li> Love the kit it has everything</li>
    <li> Clearly for the price these are not top quality brushes, but they arebad and have held up really well.</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes I have ever used. Nice case also! Everyone saying the brushes are two thin don&#x27;t know what they are talking about they work perfect for me. Good price for such a good product</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with these brushes at all.  I have had three of them to fall apart. Will not order this brand again,  but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The eyebrow brush is the one I like to test the most, it top detached itself after a few uses.  Need to glue it back on.</li>
    <li> The brushes are cheap and the soft I use them everyday and I&#x27;m nothing close to disappointed it comes with everything in the picture and the case for them is amazing and it&#x27;s great to use when you travel</li>
    <li> I expected better quality, but they&#x27;re fairly reasonable for the price. The good thing about the brushes being as stiff as they are is that I use two for my eyebrows and it is easy to make very precise lines.</li>
    <li> The brushes are beautiful</li>
    <li> A wonderful assortment of brushes....one for every cosmetic need.  I&#x27;m really enjoying them.  I think you will like them as well.</li>
    <li> these came in the exact day they said it would, which was only 4 days after I ordered it with regular shipping. When I got them, as soon as I opened it, it didn&#x27;t have a plastic smell-they actually smelled like absolutely nothing- and I noticed that they are amazing quality. They don&#x27;t shed at all and they apply powders, foundation, eyeshadow, etc. with ease!! These are definitely some of the best I&#x27;ve used!!</li>
    <li> Very nice! Got everything in the picture!</li>
    <li> I love how soft and bright the brushes are. Some of the brushes hold make up well and some I don&#x27;t even wanna waste time using. Great for the price though. It arrived before the expected time which is always a wonderful thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend and she still use it</li>
    <li> I really got to say I was excited about getting this set.. and I am very dissapointed. This was my first make up brush set and I barely use make up anyways... so after two brushes broke already you probably know how I feel.. and I haven&amp;#34;t even used  it more than a handful of times... plus one was already broke when I got it :(</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality of brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> I like them they are really cute.. hold about of product for a good price.  I use them on clients</li>
    <li> For  my granddaughter, haven&#x27;t heard if she liked the set,</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this set as a detail cleaning set for electronics, but there were so many great pieces for makeup use, that I split the set and used it for makeup too. This is one I would buy again.</li>
    <li> came on time and description was accurate was a gift for son&#x27;s girlfriend.</li>
    <li> I got some really good brushes out of this, but not going to lie some of them feel more like paint brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice Looks exact like picture.</li>
    <li> I got my package in two days. That&#x27;s awesome. I love it and I&#x27;m happy.. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> happy with purchase. Not the greatest but better than average and certainly good enough for everyday use. Nice selection of brushes.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush set! I can&#x27;t believe what good quality they turned out to be</li>
    <li> Three stars from me. I was veryyyy optimistic about this product and open minded said that the nay Sayers were just being overly critical. They were. If you are thinking about buying this, try a different one. First, then brushes are sooooo soft and normally soft is amazing, but they are so soft they don&#x27;t pick up an product. So you have to spend extra time basically digging in your product to get it on the brush. Second, they break!!! The barrels on five of my brushes have just come off! Like literally they were put together with hot glue! And it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m rough with them! They are makeup brushes! All within two weeks of receiving them! Grrr. Third hairs do come out but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. Fourth shipping destroys the indicated shape of a brush!</li>
    <li> Really amazing quality brushes, I thought they might not be due to the low price, but the only downfall was the case (too flimsy)</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok for synthetic. Was not sue what to expect but I do use them. It&#x27;s not bad. The brushes just don&#x27;t pick up the eyeshadow very well but is a good first timer brush set. Not professional quality. And I agree with the spray paint plastic smell.</li>
    <li> Very soft and I love the color. It holds the makeup well and distributes it evenly on my face. I have not had any bristles fall out as previous people complained, but if and when I do, what do you expect it&#x27;s a bristle brush.</li>
    <li> This is the first set of makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I like them :) They&#x27;re very soft, which makes it a little hard to apply powder. I like the eyeshadow brushes a little better than the powder ones, because they pick up and apply product better. Overall, I gave 4 stars because these aren&#x27;t *perfect*, but they&#x27;ll last me a while.</li>
    <li> They were everything I thought they would be. I like that they are purple and soft. There alot of brushes to choose from.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the favorable reviews for this brush set.  The large brushes are way too soft to actually apply any makeup and the small brushes are all the same size and rock hard.  It is impossible to blend any eye shadow due to how stiff and small all the little brushes are.  I regret this purchase and will be using these brushes as paint brushes for my kids.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, everything arrived as shown in the picture. The quality is good as well as the bag it comes in. I recommend this to anyone who wants a makeup brush set at an affordable price. The brushes are soft and a little stiff, but are still usable and the make up will still be applied on well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are FABULOUS! They&#x27;re super soft and pick up powders and product very well. However, this brush set receives only 4 stars from me because one of the brushes arrived broken (the brush and metal had been broken off of the wooden handle), though it was easily fixed with super glue. The case is nice, but the button magnets look like they will rip off any moment. All in all, I like the set and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s also such a pretty color in purple.</li>
    <li> GREAT set for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many options and it is a great beginners set as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not great for sole use, but it is a perfect addition to a brush collection or a great set for beginners. :)</li>
    <li> In the middle of using one of the blush brushes, the head of the brush simply fell off. It was the first time using it. Since I have been using these, 3 other brushes have fallen apart as well. I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about brushes falling apart when I am in a hurry and having to superglue back together an item that is supposed to be brand new.</li>
    <li> A great variety of brushes.  The brushes feel really nice and applies makeup like it should. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It got here super fast and the condition of the brushes is great. I&#x27;m still using them now. They still look new.</li>
    <li> Adorable kit arrived quickly</li>
    <li> the photos of these brushes are either color enhanced to make the handles a deep burgundy or else i was sold a completely different product.  when the item arrived the actual handles of the brushes are a bright, hideous red color that does not show up in the photograph.  if i had known they had such ugly red handles i would not have wasted my money.  i was really excited to get this item but as soon as i saw what it really looked like i was very, very disappointed.  the handles clash with the brush heads in the ugliest way possible. like i said, i would NEVER have bought this item if i had known what it actually looked like.</li>
    <li> They are so cute, as well is the case that came along, but the brushes are just too soft. There should be a happy medium with makeup brushes. They should be soft, but hard enough to actually apply the makeup. When I use the blush brush, I have to squeeze the brush between my index finger and thumb to get it to apply. Plus, my one brush had a cracked handle when it arrived! I should have saved my money to get a better set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in no way a makeup artist but I do LOVE doing my own makeup and these work great. I&#x27;ve surveyed a lot of different brushes and these work great for the price. Of course they aren&#x27;t the 50 dollar goat hair brush you can find at Sephora, but they get the job done. They do have a strange odor so make sure you air them out and wash them before use. The shipping is VERY fast, I would recommend them to anyone who needs just a standard set, but doesn&#x27;t want to pay hundreds of dollars for it. Very good especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Yes! Thank you amazon for getting THIS order to me on time! they are amazing thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes at such a low price. Free shipping came faster than listed.</li>
    <li> Got these as a gift for my wife and they were a resounding success. She said that they are perfect and are holding up perfectly. Great product and great quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new brush set since the ones I had were old and falling apart everywhere I looked they were so expensive. which I fine if you do your makeup all the time or its your career. For me I put makeup on maybe 4-5 times a month! lol so I found this set ordered it got it in two days (prime) and love it! so many different sizes to play with and so soft! I would recommend these to a friend. the carry case is also cute :)</li>
    <li> Got here in a few days!! For the price, great quality &amp; so soft. Beautiful colors. Less than $1 a brush!! The only reason I put 4 instead of a 5 is that I have not used them myself. This is a gift for my sister-in-law. Hope she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I love these They work well and are well organized</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t recommend the brushes because the bag ripped by the second day and the brushes broke within the week.</li>
    <li> Great Product and packaging! I am very pleased! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Ok ladies this is a great inexpensive brush kit!! The brushes are very sturdy and the brushes themselves are of good quality. They do not shed at all. It comes with everything you need to perfect your make up look. I was impressed. There was a strong plastic odor when opening the package but it went away in less than 30 seconds. Each brush was sealed with plastic and each brush has a plastic cover to keep your brushes clean. The smell is the new plastic. THAT is all. The case is very pretty and sturdy. Nice magnetic snaps to keep your brushes safe. I was impressed. This kit is soo inexpensive and I put them next to some of my expensive brushes and no difference!! I am a make up enthusiast and also worked for a high end make up company so I do know what I am talking about :-). I honestly thought these were just going to be ok! I am pleasantly surprised!! The case is a very pretty metallic purple. The case also covers the top of your brushes along with the other plastic cover. They do arrange the brushes in order from foundation brush down to the eye brushes.The handles are wood and painted a metallic red. No uneven bristles in my kit. The brushes that need to be dense are and the ones that need to be soft are. I love these brushes and am extremely happy about the quality!! You have everything in here you need to make the perfect eye blend whatever its in this pretty kit. You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune on brushes!! This kit will exceed your expectations. I am kinda upset that I have these expensive brushes and they are exactly like these. I needed new brushes mine were done. I am thrilled with this!! I hope this helps. Please remember the smell people complain about is just new plastic!! It goes away. I do not work for this company. This is just my opinion. I am just so impressed!!</li>
    <li> Brushes were ok. Had some sort of funky paint smell and the bristles felt oily.</li>
    <li> Looks awesome! brushes are soft, the case got great reviews because it looks so nice.</li>
    <li> Good Product and came in a cute little case too.</li>
    <li> Excellent! High quality... My friend loves them... Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> A little too soft and can be slightly difficult but for the price theyre excellent!</li>
    <li> For the price and the variety this is a good set of brushes for people getting into makeup. I own two sets of these and they are fine. Sometimes they do not hold powder that well but for the price it is hardly an issue.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product when the delievery was expected. when i opened the package the purplecarrying bag smelled like paint. the eyebrow brush and comb broke the sexond timei used it. but i do love the other brushes. they are very soft !! overall decent. i use them onmyself every day.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful brushes and I get complements on them every time I pull them out but the glue is weak and some of the heads come off. This can easily be fixed by placing some gorilla glue where it comes apart but I expect it to happen to all of them eventually.</li>
    <li> I really like this little kit, the brushes work well and stay together well even after using them for months! Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Cheap. One of the brush heads broke off after using only a few times</li>
    <li> No labeling on the brushes.</li>
    <li> *w* they&#x27;re sooo cutee and soft &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The brushes seem nice but they smelled horrible when I opened them they smelled like fresh paint and the smell wasn&#x27;t subtle. I&#x27;m not sure if I will be returning them not sure what chemical was used to cause the smell but it makes me uneasy about using these brushes on my face.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be allot better quality.They also have a chemical like smell on the brushes.Also the case looks pretty cheap looking.</li>
    <li> Too soft but look just like the pic.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves make up and these brushes were a hit, she loves them</li>
    <li> synthetic. but pretty.</li>
    <li> so far so good. washed them a few times after uses and I they dont fall apart. I did leave the end of one in water by accident and the paint came off. The bag it comes in is very cheap I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are so soft. And the we&#x27;re really cheap, but still good quality</li>
    <li> I havent uses them yet but I have done a durability test on the brush heads and so far so good with no shedding. I oulled and tugged each brush and everything seems legit.</li>
    <li> Seem to function well for my sister, she loves them.</li>
    <li> Works well for applying make up. The quality of the products is fair It arrive nicely packaged and with in shipping time frame stated.</li>
    <li> Worst product. .did not like the quality</li>
    <li> All of the brushes are great. They look exactly like the picture. The brushes work really well. The colors are pretty and vibrant too.</li>
    <li> not very good quality, a little too hard to even use to apply make up. not recommended. buy better quality even if more expensive.</li>
    <li> Great set for the price. No loose brush hairs or weakness at the metal/ wood attachment so far. The brushes I have used from this set have provided a smooth application.</li>
    <li> love these they are so soft love</li>
    <li> Delivery  was  fast. Great brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes work very well for my make up sets and I lovvvvvvveeee the prouch purse that it came in 😊</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the brushes, I can&#x27;t believe I get this many makeup brushes for the price.  I now have all the brushes I need!</li>
    <li> brushes are nice but case is cheap</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift to my sister she absoultey loves them and uses them everyday.</li>
    <li> as soon as i open it i fell in love with it because it is exactly what you see and the packages is very nice and expensive looking. The brushes are soft and very nice, started to use it immediately but you have to use it a couple of times to use to the different size of brushes but as soon as you know what you are using for it would be easy. Thinking of buying as christmas gifts for friend so it is a good buy love it.</li>
    <li> Ummm softest brushes ever very proud of this purchase</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price! Got them December 2013, and still good as new.. Do not shed at all when cleaning (I use coconut oil &amp; dish soap) Great product</li>
    <li> Love them, they are so soft, and work great. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I bought to give as gifts &amp; to my surprise, it&#x27;s good quality for the $ I paid.</li>
    <li> The Brushes cool but i didnt like the red color of the handle</li>
    <li> Soft, durable so far, arrived on time and good variety for a smaller set.</li>
    <li> Love love love these flippin brushes they are so soft and I love the color of the bristles.</li>
    <li> I ordered them last Month and I finally got them today July 8th... Compared to some of the high end brushes they&#x27;re actually really soft in comparison I have yet to use them but I&#x27;m sure they will apply a great and blend just Just as well</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes so soft on d skin</li>
    <li> I purchased the same product from a different seller and loved it. I decided to get another but the previous seller didn&#x27;t have any left. This one is definitely different. The case has a strong chemical smell, the brushes aren&#x27;t the same and aren&#x27;t as soft, and some of the bristles on the brushes were trimmed unevenly. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product</li>
    <li> The brushes came just on time. They come in a cute purple case to keep clutter away. I gave it a five star rating because it doesn&#x27;t deserve any less. I recommend this for anybody who loves purple, neat beauty areas and applying make-up with brushes.</li>
    <li> AWESOME LOVE IT LOVE IT .. I NEVER USED MAKEUP BRUSHES BEFORE BECAUSE UM JUST NOW REALLY GETTING INTO THE MAKEUP PHASE</li>
    <li> These are great quality brushes. Mine have not broken, or had any fall out. They did have a plastic-y smell when you open them, but I don&#x27;t mind it. The brushes that are shown in the picture, are fully purple, mine came and are white with the tips being purple. Also the silver on the brushes, came as gold. I don&#x27;t mind. I think they are actually cuter!!</li>
    <li> Soft not durable, spoole is great but brushes won&#x27;t last long not good quality. Color is beautiful. Not for professional use.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I use this brushes everyday.</li>
    <li> the bag broke the 2nd day sad</li>
    <li> so soft n many different sizes. love it.</li>
    <li> The person I gave this to was very happy with it. She thanked me alot and was happy. with it.</li>
    <li> the brushes are really soft, they are gentle on my skin they are easy to clean and the bristles don&#x27;t come out</li>
    <li> as the title mentions, my loves the brushes but in the middle of her using them for the first time, the end completely fell off. Luckily we have a glue gun. May be something minor, but just keep that in mind when ordering this product.</li>
    <li> I bought each brush for $15, this whole case of amazing soft brushes with blue beautiful color  easy to wash and reuse. For price I got so worth to by it. Recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I not only love the color on these brushes but they are so soft. Some of the initial bristles come out a bit on first use on a few of the brushes but other than that i love them. I have been using them over a year and havent had any problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these... and my granddaughters loved them.  Both of them are 13 and are doing great with their makeup.  Now they have the professional brushes the are even doing better.  Thank you for this great product for such a great price.</li>
    <li> They are really good but smelt bad, but washing them once helped :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore these brushes!! Like most people before I buy anything on here I always read the reviews, I decided I would just get them and try them out. It was definitely worth the money and the price was great!!! They are extremely soft and makeup does STAY on the brushes. My only reason they are 4 star instead of 5 is because they do smell a bit like chemicals when you get them, but all it took was a little bit of air and using my face wash to clean them before use. I use them everyday, but I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> for the price its perfect and the are super soft, I&#x27;ve been using mine for more than 3 months and they are like new ;)</li>
    <li> Nice but some were not glued or pressed, however the brush were nice on the skin &amp;#34;soft but not to soft&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Brushes were really soft. I haven&#x27;t used all of the the brushes yet , but the ones  I have used I haven&#x27;t had any shedding .</li>
    <li> Should not be labeled as professional. Pretty but low quality brushes. Two broke the first week of use. Brush hairs are too delicate also.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, i use a couple of them but i just feel as though they do not hold the colors real well nor apply very well.</li>
    <li> Super Happy with this</li>
    <li> Had a strong paint smell, but the brushes cane early and were very soft.</li>
    <li> The right price!! These (with proper care) held up very well for my daily makeup applications :-)</li>
    <li> The picture did not match up with the brushes at all the handles are bright red and a couple of the brushes are light blue with a purple top I wanted them t of look exactly like the picture</li>
    <li> The brushes came just on time. They come in a cute purple case to keep clutter away. I gave it a five star rating because it doesn&#x27;t deserve any less. I recommend this for anybody who loves purple, neat beauty areas and applying make-up with brushes.</li>
    <li> Really nice for the price</li>
    <li> Loved it and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Great product. Got it for my 10-year-old daughter and she loves it. If you get withstand a 10-year-old it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> They shipped really fast and work nice but a few of brushes looked like they had been melted or something.</li>
    <li> I was hoping there would have been a better bristled brush for foundation, but they are too long, and flimsy for that. Otherwise, for eye shadow this set is great.</li>
    <li> The smelk was so bad I i couldn&#x27;t even use them</li>
    <li> Great kit. The brush itself works great but the surface of the handle wears off easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had them about a week but I must admit they work very well. I&#x27;m a fan of the color and how they feel they&#x27;re so dang soft and durable. I love them so much!!!! Nothing damaged when it came in and I thought they were almost over protected(not complaining).</li>
    <li> Beautiful and very soft it&#x27;s like putting your makeup on with a cloud</li>
    <li> Some where broken never orderin again</li>
    <li> They were damaged and one was broken</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got me this for Christmas 2014. I&#x27;ve been using them since. I love the set. The foundation brushes are the only downside. I still use them even though they don&#x27;t set the powder on like I would like. They are very soft seem to waste a lot.. but still they feel great on my skin. I love the case they came in . The few &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; item&#x27;s in the set were things I didn&#x27;t need.. we all have them from other products.</li>
    <li> for the price there awesome! gets the job done for me! i just thought i was getting a different color brushes, instead i got the red ones which arent my favorite but then again not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. No fall out. Loved the plastic covers over the larger brushes. The smaller brushes are a bit firm. But still soft. They are not good at blending but I have a go to brush for blending. Loved this none the less.</li>
    <li> I really liked these brushes. I actually received them sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week and cant complain. I think they re a really good deal for such a cheap cost</li>
    <li> I just got my brusher today and they are amazing, exactly what I was looking for and the price is awasome, this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> i choose this to my wife cuz she like so much make up and she was need those every day</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. The color is very pretty and the bag is very travel frendly too.  Mine are surprisingly good quality too.  Im really impressed</li>
    <li> NOTHINGGG like the pictures but it&#x27;s w cute little set I like the bag it comes in</li>
    <li> Amazon shouldn&#x27;t even be selling this item or have it listed.  It looks pretty but looks can be deceiving.  It smells like hard core lead painting from China please do not waste your money save it is horrible!  I threw it away can tolerate the smell I didn&#x27;t even give it to anyone because I don&#x27;t want to put their health at risk.</li>
    <li> Cleaning them removes the chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft, so depending on your needs, you may not like them.&lt;br /&gt;They fall apart. They seriously are all breaking. I&#x27;ve had them for a month and the brush/tip part separates from the handle. I have to glue it back myself. Seriously dudes? You couldn&#x27;t use better glue?</li>
    <li> Soft blush n all over face brush didn&#x27;t really like the eye shadow brush doesn&#x27;t pick up all the eye shadow</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. I&#x27;m enjoying them and for the price I think they work very good. I would buy them again. And the seller sent them pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a brush set and I wonder why I have not in the past!  I haven&#x27;t begun to use them all, but I do have my favorites!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with product. Loved it</li>
    <li> Brush was broken - shame !!!!!</li>
    <li> I personally love these brushes. They are soft, and hold up well. They do not shed. I washed these before applying any makeup, and didn&#x27;t lose a single hair! The fan brush as a few long hairs here and there, but nothing a snip of the scissors can&#x27;t fix. The only reason I knocked a star off this product is because the picture is misleading. The handle of the brushes it actually a true, bright red. It does not feature any logos on it either.</li>
    <li> Fortunately for me these brushes only cost me 3 dollars because I used an old gift card. When I first received these brushes the smell was overwhelming. After washing twice there was still a distinct odor. I had to let them air out for a few days before attempting to use them. I use a powder makeup and these brushes are not good for that at all. The bristles are entirely to soft for powder make up use. So far I have gotten the mostuse out of the eyebrow brush (a normal brush you can get at any drugstore). If you plan on using a powder makeup do not buy these brushes. Trust me it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and it would have been nice to have the brushes labeled or a page to tell us what each brush is. I realize this is a professional set and most people already know that information, however these were the only ones she said were pretty and I wanted her to have pretty brushes for her first set.</li>
    <li> These are a gift, the brushes are made of plastic but they seem soft. They do have a smell but nothing time won&#x27;t get rid off.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes, I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of make up so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a huge set. But this set fits my needs perfectly they provide you with every one you&#x27;ll need with basic make up application, I also like that the brushes are good quality and not that cheap synthetic stuff you find at most stores.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid I feel like I really got my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  I&#x27;m not a daily make-up wearer so I can&#x27;t say how they hold up under constant use.</li>
    <li> hey! so, I am just graduating beauty school and I wanted to buy these for my home because they are so cute!! Well let me tell you... THEY ARE TERRIBLE. E.L.F. Has better brushes. These brushes don&#x27;t pick up any makeup at all. All my makeup is high end, and I now realize why I should buy high end brushes. I threw these Away a week after I bought them. I only have the tiny ones for nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mix of all size brushes that are just terrible. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> the brushes are cute and soft and work well. the only thing i would want different is that for some reason the handles of my brushes are red</li>
    <li> My first impression of this product was that there is only one flaw? that the brush case was cheap. Although the brushes are much nicer they are very soft and feel nice on the skin. They are pretty good quality and I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> My 9 year daughter is obsessed with makeup this was perfect for her a little starter kit</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the price and after reading all feedback well i decide to order it. They say it stank bad ,well it did a little but after its opened it&#x27;s all good the smell goes away . The brushes seem ok and solid. So far nothing wrong with them who knows how long they will last but for the price this is a good deal , fast delivery too !</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!!!! The eyeshadow brushes are soft yet still for applying those perfect lines! I have washes them and they did not shed at all!!!! Truely amazing especially for $10!</li>
    <li> some brushes was messed up but overall good buy!!</li>
    <li> One of the reasons I ordered THIS item was the color of the bristles and the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; case. However, the case is more of a fuschia, and bristles are more blue than anything. Not returning as I don&#x27;t want the hassle, so I will keep the item for a future gift.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft! I also like that they have a long sturdy handle.  I really recommend them- especially at this price!! Best deal in town.</li>
    <li> The actual color is lighter then whats shown here and they have a cheap smell to them but overall they look nice. I havent used them yet.</li>
    <li> Nice set, wish the bristles were a tad bit stronger</li>
    <li> Love!!!!!!!!! They are soft and the case isn&#x27;t too big. I love the color and everything about it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my dad&#x27;s account that&#x27;s why it has his name... Anyways I bought these because I threw away my other set of brushes. The big brushes are too soft. They barley hold anything. And the little brushes are way too hard!! They hurt and don&#x27;t apply any eyeshadow on my eyelids. The are not that expensive but it still sucked and now I have to buy all new brushes :/</li>
    <li> The brushes are flimsy, no body. Considering that the description said &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;, I expected a better quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give the set to my little granddaughters to play &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These are good brushes, however I don&#x27;t find them to be great brushes. I was hoping for a little more variety in sizes.  It seems they go from small to huge in brush size.  Cute color combinations though.</li>
    <li> It came right on time; in a lovely pouch and that is more than likely where I will keep it for now. Nothing to not like about them!</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are ok. Very synthetic. You get what you pay for. One broke a week after I got it. The top simply fell off.</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of brushes for makeup.  I bought this because I needed a bronzer brush and it made sense for the price to get this set.  The purple color of the brushes really allured me.  The case it comes with is made out of a pleather material.  You can tell the brushes are not made out of expensive hair but for the price you pay, it is a good deal.  I&#x27;ve only used two brushes so far and I&#x27;m happy with what I got.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is for the people that are looking for expensive quality brushes.</li>
    <li> if your looking to start doing your own makeup i would recommend this product LOW PRICE AND GOOD QUALITY you won&#x27;t be sorry for getting these brushes  i love them they are amazing</li>
    <li> I just received this brush set as a gift for my younger sister. She is learning how to use make up so I thought this would be a good fit. I really love the purple tops they are beautiful. I just have a problem with the bottom part. It does not look like the picture it&#x27;s like a light pinkish color. I don&#x27;t think my sister will mind but it does look a bit odd. Also when it came out of the package it had a very strong odor. Other than that it is great.</li>
    <li> arrived suprisingly quick! i loooooove them!</li>
    <li> Shipping ans delivery perfect. I only had one concern about the brushes. The eyeliner brush is nothing like pictured but I love the color of the brushes and they are very soft thank you again for the fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I ordered the set on Oct. 23rd and expected shipping was between Oct. 29th-Nov. 3rd but I received it Oct. 25th! I loooveee me some fast shipping, I just about died of happiness. I&#x27;d say it looks exactly as depicted, the case was very compact. Some said their case smelled weird but it just smells like new plastic to me so if that&#x27;s a smell you don&#x27;t like, I guess it would smell weird, but I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell and it honestly does not bother me. I haven&#x27;t used them yet so I can&#x27;t speak on that, but the brushes are really soft and the ones that I felt should be a bit stiffer without being hard (like the eyeliner brush) were. It&#x27;s my first makeup brush set so maybe I&#x27;m not an expert but they seem pretty good to me. I just wish there was a list of each brush (with pics) saying its name and use ...but maybe I&#x27;m asking for a bit much lol. Overall good buy so far</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because I wanted a complete set of makeup brushes. Initially, I was attracted by the purple color but eventually decided to buy them because of the reviews and a hope that they would be good quality brushes. However, these brushes are horrible. They are so soft that makeup hardly stays on them and is super hard to apply. I would think that brushes that claim to be &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; would actually be able to apply makeup but the only resemblance they have to professional brushes are their appearance. I love the color but in terms of function these brushes are terrible.</li>
    <li> I am NOT  a makeup artist and im not about to say they are the best but for little ole me applying my daily makeup it works just great, they clean well and the colors are a fun little thing to see on my vanity :-)</li>
    <li> These are great makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;They are very nice to handle - easy to use and apply make up very nicely</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and nice but I like my brushes a little firmer then these. They kinda stink when you first use em and the case is kinda cheap but over all the brushes work well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great and sturdy. I recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Buy it made the day September 23 and it&#x27;s time to get nothing I want or I want my money order and are two sets of brushes</li>
    <li> I liked this product so far.  Soft brissels, easy on my face.  Good variety of brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are super soft and well built. They work pretty well for my normal every day use.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and very pretty. So far I have not had an issue with bristles falling out, anymore than what I would buy at the store for a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the chemical smell that the entire case gives off. I had seen people give similar reviews and I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal. But man, I could smell it the second I opened the package and got a bit of a headache while unpacking them. It is VERY strong, but I&#x27;m guessing the smell will go away in time. The bristles themselves do not smell, so it isn&#x27;t too big of a deal.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great if u just need some extra brushes, I jus like my old ones better</li>
    <li> sorry, It was not what I expected but I use it for my eyes makeup</li>
    <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting what I got. These brushes are amazing and soft. Some of the brushes have so many different uses and they are really good at doing what they need to do. They got here much faster than expected. The case it comes with it also really good quality and I love the color.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what to use all these brushes for but the three I do use work really well.</li>
    <li> These are very nice brushes, not identical to the picture but very close (the handles are lighter - the bristles are the same).  Just a head&#x27;s up that they are shipped from China.  They actually arrived a week earlier than the earliest predicted delivery date, but it still took 3 1/2 weeks.  I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and ordered them for a Christmas present - I got them today, January 6th.  Good product, good price - just be aware of where it&#x27;s coming from if you need it in a hurry.</li>
    <li> The brush popped off the largest one, but I was able to glue it back together easily.</li>
    <li> Love the color of the brushes, but they don&#x27;t pick up the powders very well. The eyeshadow brushes work better, but still not 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what all the brushes are for but not bad for what you get. Not really experienced with make-up brushes but this makes an excellent starter kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this! it was very fast and cheap. Affordable to get it, if you need an affordable set of brushes.</li>
    <li> My first set ever. I&#x27;m very satisfied and didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money. I love the purple and so soft. I&#x27;ll need to clean them before I use them of course</li>
    <li> Okay, so they came packaged nicely. They look exactly like the picture and they came quick. These brushes suck though! I do not know how anyone uses them. They are way too soft, there&#x27;s no stiffness to them (the big blush brushes). I cant use the big brushes at all. The small brushes are too hard! Total opposite. there&#x27;s no in between. If your someone that will be using these brushes all the time, I would definitely not recommend.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Looks the same as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Smelled like paint but they work well.</li>
    <li> Obessed and Ive only use a couple so far!.. since i have my old ones!.. so pretty and very nice colors! ..</li>
    <li> They were cheap but they&#x27;re too fluffy and don&#x27;t hold product well</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooooo soft I love it and they work pretty good only downfall is they give you about 4 of the same exact brush</li>
    <li> They were so soft and came just as seen</li>
    <li> I had ordered a quantity of two one for my sister and my mother...I only received one and this was super late.... They will only give me $4 back this is just unacceptable if you ever buy two just make sure there separate orders or they will rip you off !!</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for and needed. Love the purple color of the brushes.</li>
    <li> awesome brushes! I like that they also came in the purple little case thing :)</li>
    <li> good if you only want to make up at home! its not for professional people</li>
    <li> I like the variety and quality of these brushes. it&#x27;s certainly not high-end but for the price, I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find anything better. I like the pop of color too</li>
    <li> Thought they would suck, I&#x27;ve washed, sprayed with rubing alachol, used, still fluffy. I did need to fix the case tho.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and all but they are NOT THE GREATEST. I use brushes for my eyeshadow and these brushes aren&#x27;t for it! I want to return it or something because I regret getting them. But on one positive note atleast 2 brushes are useful....</li>
    <li> These brushes are durable and look to be a very nice quality. They will make a very nice gift for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Nice set of bruches. Very soft and ced in a car ring case</li>
    <li> I got this package about three days after I ordered it. Once I opened it I was very pleased with the packaging. The brushes look just like they do online. These brushes are soft and thick. I wanted to start using makeup brushes and this was the perfect product to get.</li>
    <li> I really want this set of Brush, but never got it.  Guess they ran out of stock. When purchase it, they said it was in stock. So I don&#x27;t know what is going on.</li>
    <li> i give this 5 stars since it is more than what i thought when purchased, i am very happy with the product and would recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> These came EXACTLY as advertised for me. I&#x27;ve read other reviews of people getting eyeshadow brushes that were hard and did nt match the picture at all but that was now the case for me! Everything came in an extremely timely manner and was perfect! I would definitely recommend these because even if you don&#x27;t get something accurate, it&#x27;s not a huuuge waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just received the bushes and purple bag. I love the brushes so far (I have not used them with the make up yet- but, I love the color purple and the brushes are soft). However, when I was looking at the bag I saw a big tear. Does not look like the stitching was done correctly. Kind of upset about this.</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft but there is plenty of them. Gave them to my 20 year old and she loves EM</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my girlfriend back on December 6th of 2013 and my payment went through on the 11th. I saw and understood that shipping may take up to January 21. I thought to myself, even that is a long time, but I&#x27;ve ordered from China/Hong Kong before and it&#x27;s only taken a couple weeks. This product however still has yet to arrive at my location. It&#x27;s really bothering me that the only shipping information I&#x27;m offered is to see that it shipped. It&#x27;s close to two months ago that I ordered this product. Why is it not here yet? Am I ever getting it? I understand some things aren&#x27;t on time, but for it to have obscene shipping and for it to STILL arrive late, or so far not at all? According to Amazon, the seller is no longer with Amazon so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even ever get them now.....&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t even know if the quality of the brushes is worth it yet being that I haven&#x27;t even seen them.. And the customer service so far is terrible.</li>
    <li> Like most of the reviews, it did have an odor, kind of like paint. But, a quick wash and air out, it was fine. Some of the bristles came out fairly early. Something that could help make this product better is a card with brush names and what they do. I hardly wear makeup, but I like to dress up every now and then, and I had no clue what the brushes did.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BOUGHT MAKEUP BRUSHES OFF AND ON FOR YEARS FOR MY DAUGHTER . BUT THESE BRUSHS ARE THE CHEAPEST MADE I HAVE EVER SEEN .. OUT OF THE HOLDER FIVE BRUSHES WERE MESSED AND ALL THE BRUSHES WERE REALLY THINED OUT .PROFESSIONAL ( NOT)</li>
    <li> Strong synthetic chimical smell, I recommend cleaning these brushes before use. The bag is decently made not the best but you get what you pay for. Overall decent brushes.</li>
    <li> Well, I was really excited about getting these and waited about two weeks or so just to find out they weren&#x27;t coming...I did get a timely reimbursement,  but I would have rather had the brushes. They looked cool, but I&#x27;ll never know how good they were.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft, and theres so many its pretty great. Theyre a bit too soft for my liking, but thats only a personal preferance i think. They pick up product pretty well, and i think they give enough product too. They havent shed yet since ive used them, and so far theyve done a pretty good job! Plus theres 16 brushes for such a reasonable price, i do recommend these if youre looking for plenty of brushes but not something thats of a super professional grade. i would think this was a perfect set for anyone starting in makeup.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft, I like that about the product. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because they are new, I didnt find them very manageable with applying the product. Since I apply eyeshadow everyday, I will turn to my old set, and look for a new one. My daughter will definitely be receiving these as a hand me down.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty and the recipient really liked this gift. A bargain for the price. Very soft.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are amazing</li>
    <li> these are amazing brushes they came in tact all the brushes look professional and the packaging is amazing I just love it it rolls up real nice and it is definitely worth your money all of them are very soft but they all very well pick up make up easily they&#x27;re worth your money</li>
    <li> I was Kind of disappointed with this product. While the look is catchy, they dont pick up/hold product well at all.</li>
    <li> So the reason I gave 4 stars was the smell when I first opened the package and the fact that a few brushes were still &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;. I let the set air out for about 6 hours with a dryer sheet folded in it and now I have to hold the case close to my face in order to even smell the weird plasticky smell.  I washed the brushes and they stopped shedding. I loved playing around with these just to see what they could do. They all work very nicely and feel so soft! If I know anyone who needs brushes on a budget I will suggest these!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set after reading all the reviews.. and took a chance and bought them. Some reviews were good. When I got them they came in a nice package. They were very soft.. but a few days later they started to fall apart. They are not worth to buy!!</li>
    <li> awesome brushes, great price!</li>
    <li> Excellet product, good quality and mi wife love it</li>
    <li> Brushes are pretty but not super good quality.</li>
    <li> Great deal and quality</li>
    <li> They are loose, bad quality very bad, they aren&#x27;t even purple</li>
    <li> Thought the brushes would be more of a variety.</li>
    <li> Great gift! Looked like girls loved it.</li>
    <li> This set has every brush you could ever think to have.  the carrying pouch is durable and holds up well even bring carried back and forth to/from friends and family travel long distance.  Would definitely purchase again as a gift or for personal use.</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes as a gift.  The birthday girl loved them! the purple made them extra cute and they work great she said</li>
    <li> The brushes were beautiful! Yaaaas! And they were so soft.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them and uses them all the time. Well worth the money, would buy them again! Thank you</li>
    <li> Purple Brushes!!!!! &#x3D; Fun Times!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush in this set serves a purpose and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy about it. My only issue is the carrying case, but then again its not really an issue.. but it would have been nice if it had more of a silky feel than a cheap plastic feel.. I&#x27;m not using the case to put on my make-up so it&#x27;s really not a big deal..</li>
    <li> Best bushes for the price!  The color is also very unique.  The quality is comparable to a more expensive professional product.  I still use some other Bobby Brown brushes, but these work just as well for way less.  Highly recommend purchasing this brand.</li>
    <li> My girl friend loved this! She uses it for her make up and is very happy with it! She likes all the different size brushes.</li>
    <li> Do not buy!!! Brushes r way to soft. Product does not go on the brushes.</li>
    <li> When I received the makeup set the purple brush holder was damaged it had a tear like some one had slashed it with a razor.</li>
    <li> these are good. i guess? I can&#x27;t really say because they are my first brushes im buying. I&#x27;m not quite sure that a lot of the brushes are and would have appreciate a list or something, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. They are very soft and the case look and feel very well made. The brushes arrive in individual wrapping in the case and all arrived in very good condition. For the price i couldn&#x27;t really as for anything else. Plus it arrived *a lot* earlier that it was estimated, the next day if i recall, but that could just be because of the origin of the package.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it, but again, i don;t know much make-up brushes</li>
    <li> THE MAKE-UP BRUSHES ARE JUST LIKE WHAT YOUR SEE! THEY ARE PRETTY AND THEY WORK GREAT! I LIKE THESE BETTER THAN THE MAC MAKE-UP BRUSHES</li>
    <li> These are really great brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes rub the makeup on very well.</li>
    <li> worth the money and lots of different sizes. I was actually excited when it showed up and I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> Its a cheap set.  because it is a cheap set.  Save your money and buy a better set.  It they sit in water at all to clean the brushes the plasticy covering comes peels off</li>
    <li> Second set we have purchased. They are great and are very easy to clean. Used by teenagers and are still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is a super pretty set, and the bag it comes in is cute too. 3 stars due to the fact that I have double sets of brushes and the minute I picked up the mascara brush it fell right off the handle.</li>
    <li> Their so soft and hold up well! At first I was iffy but now their all I ever use to put my makeup on</li>
    <li> Received the brushes on time,lovely colour brush set all the brushes was there,brushes work well in applying the make up</li>
    <li> They are very pretty. They don&#x27;t last long. The tops on most of them came off. but for starter brushes I would say its a great deal</li>
    <li> I found this product very useful, and with prime feature it arrive within 48 hours.  It consist of multiple brushes for anything you need to help make-up your face.</li>
    <li> nice quality for the price</li>
    <li> Big brushes are good for blending but not really dense enough for applying and the opposite for the small brushes. Which is good for putting product on but not for blending the eye area. All brushes smelled of spray paint until cleaned and had to throw pouch it came in away because it over powered my vanity. But they look wonderful displayed and are extremely soft. Looks almost exactly like picture and didn&#x27;t take too long to arrive. Overall not a good all in one set but good additive to a collection.</li>
    <li> Brushes are not as soft as my last set</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know CUZ I NEVER GOT MY BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> Worked very well and impressed a host of women at a make up party. These were well liked, soft and held our makeup on to the brushes just  like the more expensive ones.  They were a hit by all who attended.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it ever again. All the brush shades</li>
    <li> It was such a cute case and the brushes were as I expected</li>
    <li> LOVE my brushes. Got them quick and they work amazingly!</li>
    <li> Wow I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality of this brushes and the price was so low I&#x27;m a happy happy costumer.</li>
    <li> Great brushes they&#x27;re perfect and great quality!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the material</li>
    <li> These are SO soft! They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend you use them every day</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, exactly what I was looking for! and the price is awesome! Truly a great buy! :)</li>
    <li> I like the brushes. They came in only 3 days. The smell of the case is not appealing but overall they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> So soft. Picks up makeup products wonderfully. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money! It delivered on time!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, there are so many, they are so soft, and the pouch is so convenient. My old brushes irritated my skin but these feel great against my skin.</li>
    <li> very excellent charm me :)</li>
    <li> Many routines and some of them are too easy but it is gentle yoga. It is a pretty good DVD even at that, I am using it.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but poorly made. Brush falling apart already. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s professional, but more for practice.</li>
    <li> Never got it. Ordered this thing over a month ago. Been checking my mail about every other day or so. All my other purchases have come but not this one. Pretty disappointed and I will be asking for my money back.</li>
    <li> I Love this set. Cheap, cute, decent quality. (:</li>
    <li> I had a problem with shipping, but as soon as I emailed them to let them know I hadn&#x27;t received the package, they immediately send another out with no charge!! The set was even better than what I anticipated!! My daughter loves the set so much!! It&#x27;s great for her very first brush set sense she&#x27;s at that age of learning about make-up!!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!! It&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase! I love my brushes. Good quality and fast shipping! I highly recommend these makeup brushes!!😊👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I love the color</li>
    <li> I was very excited about these brushes, because I was purchasing the set to fill in and replace some brushes from my current set. My current brushes are a mixture of blue and purple bristles, so these should have matched nicely. The larger brushes do, but the smaller brushes did not arrive as pictured. Instead of being blue and purple, the bristles on all of the eye brushes are white and and purple(more of a pinkish-purple than the others though) The don&#x27;t really match the other brushes in the set and feel as if they are a different quality entirely from the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, these brushes get the job done. They are by no means GOOD brushes, but they are perfect for travel and the brushes that I needed from the set work as well as my current set. The eyeshadow brushes are worthless. They aren&#x27;t fluffy at all and can basically only be used for pressing or packing the eyeshadow because they don&#x27;t deposit evenly. The larger face brushes are nice, if not a little of the flat side. The spooly and brush/comb are good and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging will bend the fan brush! Badly! I had to leave mine out and press the cover for a week to get it straight again. It can be placed in the case(which is very nice) but it does need to be moved from its original spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is an okay set, mainly for traveling, but I am disappointed that it couldn&#x27;t beat a 4 dollar set from Ross quality wise. Some brushes will do the trick, some will require a little skill to use, and others are pretty useless, but if you are a beginning or looking for a set that you can travel with to spare your good brushes, this could work for you</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! my gf loves it</li>
    <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can really go wrong. I don&#x27;t love all 16 brushes, they are pretty ok for beginners or kids who have a interest in beauty or cosmetics. They can play with this and have a good time with it. First off, the case smells like plastic chemicals, not great, I wouldn&#x27;t use it. The brushes I do like are most of the eye brushes, the eyebrow/eyelash comb, the spoolie and the powder brush. The rest are ok and I would use just to finish up details, not so much use them for my daily routine. Overall, I think it would depend on your situation of whether or not you should pick this one up. Like I mentioned, for the variety of brushes you get, I think its decent.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described and in pictures. Very soft professional brushes.</li>
    <li> do not buy these. completely worthless. dont skimp on brushes and dont waste even 8 bucks. such a waste of money. NONE of them are usable.... the big face brushes are far too soft... and the eye brushes are too hard. worthless. pretty but a waste of money</li>
    <li> they work nicely and like the color</li>
    <li> love my new make up brushes ordering more.</li>
    <li> when they arrived, the pouch they came with was very cheap and it riped easy.the brushes(hair) falls out a lot and gets on my face..but they were purple and look cool that is why I gave it a 2 star</li>
    <li> Please buy it! I loved loved loved it! Very good quality brushes, and it comes with a case (that I wasn&#x27;t waiting for).</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast brushes feel amazing</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes in today and although I haven&#x27;t tried them yet. I love the packaging, I love the design and love how soft the bristles feel. I almost purchased a 7 piece set at Sephora for almost $70.00 when I was there on Tuesday purchasing foundation. Thank God I didn&#x27;t. However, I was a little diappointed that the set did not include a foundation or concealer brush so I had to run out to CVS and get them. I loved those too but that is another review for another product. Anywho...once I try them out for a month and they are still in good standing, I will write another review on these brushes.</li>
    <li> Product came in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are extremely soft.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality</li>
    <li> Daughter uses them every day</li>
    <li> soft and nice, i love the redish black handles with the purple blue brushes, easy to clean with olive oil and dawn dish soap to wash then let dry.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality.. get what you pay for</li>
    <li> its okay. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I love it don&#x27;t really care for the color of the handles on the brushes but their super cute</li>
    <li> the brushes work amazingly i would deffinatley order it for some one as a gift or just to have another</li>
    <li> Took awhile but I got them and they are so pretty good quality brushes&lt;br /&gt;And they are purple. Love it</li>
    <li> Great construction and I love the variety at this price</li>
    <li> Very cute! Came on time and work well. The bigger brushes are very soft, so they arent that great with putting on liquid foundations. But work really well with powders! I use majority of the brushes</li>
    <li> My brushes were not what I was expecting. One of the handles on my brushes looked like it had been broken and glued back together horribly. Only one of my handles were a deep purple color the rest were faded like they&#x27;d been in the sun for a while. I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> No problems came on time and looks just like the picture love it! The make-up came upon my face great!</li>
    <li> I love it!! When I first got them do have a smell  like it smells like paint on most but it isn&#x27;t that strong!!! I love my brishes</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes are poor. Not happy with the brushes. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The bristles on these brushes are soft. A nice selection for your needs. Plus I love the color.</li>
    <li> surprisingly good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft and are super easy to clean. Their is no hair loss on the brush and it smells like a new car. I give it a 10/10</li>
    <li> A gift for my Mom for her 54th birthday, she loves the brushes!! Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this set and it does do well with different make up types. I use this set every day and I love the travel case it came in.</li>
    <li> The brushed fall off of the stick&lt;br /&gt;My sister at multiple times had to hot glue gun them&lt;br /&gt;They pick up no pigment I had to crush up the eyeshadow to dust and then pick the shadow up</li>
    <li> The makeup falls right off the brushes , doesn&#x27;t hold well what so ever so your losing makeup before it reaches face ! The brushes also break off of the handles very easy ! Not happy</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price</li>
    <li> I bought these as a xmas gift and my thought thus far are, very soft, all the same color purple, good quality. My only flaw i have found yet is they smell seriously like the glue that holds the ferrel on and plastic but with a good washing they will be fine.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the brushes are so soft! My daughter will absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It did take three weeks to come but overall this is a good product!</li>
    <li> Would not suggest, purchase.</li>
    <li> it breaks very easily. seems to be very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really tiny I thougy have there&#x27;d be bigger &amp; don&#x27;t pick up as much make up. Good for the price though</li>
    <li> The smell of the brushes is not overwhelming. I&#x27;ve had them for a some time now and they have held up well.</li>
    <li> smells like spray-paint.... BUT they are cute and soft to the face.</li>
    <li> I love these for a day to day use, down sides are the plastic smell and they dont hold product very well. I saw alot of reviews saying the handle broke but i havent had that problem. Love them though &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Arrived a week before estimated date. They are a little stiff at first but after a couple of uses they work great</li>
    <li> Items came fast but  items fall apart fast the tops on the brushes stared coming off the 3rd day I used it and the brush bag also roped when I opened it the first day</li>
    <li> I love the purple bag these brushes came in but I especially love the purple tips of these brushes not to mention when I use them they make me feel like a real makeup artist because I can use these brushes for the right places on my face and with the right products for my face which makes them work well for me. Beautiful!!</li>
    <li> good variety but not good quality. Some of them broke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big makeup user.  I maybe wear it once a month, mostly because I hate removing it at night and I&#x27;m lazy.  I have never bought nor owned more than a big brush for power foundation and a little brush for eye shadow.  I didn&#x27;t even know they came in 16pc sets.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve made some new promises to myself, so when the opportunity presented itself, I bought this set of brushes.  I freaking adore them.  My sister thinks I should have went with real hair rather than synthetic, but I&#x27;m a bit of a boycotter on animal products and prefer synthetic for that reason.  I also don&#x27;t use/wear make up as often as she does so I feel like it won&#x27;t impact me the same way it will her.  They are not only aesthetically pleasing, they&#x27;re practical and easy to use.  I actually recommended them and got two other friends to buy them who also adore them.  The red and purple definitely fit my personal style and they&#x27;re so soft and easy to use.  They apply my makeup perfectly in my opinion and that&#x27;s all I really need them to do.  Will keep recommending them.</li>
    <li> As a stylist this is everything I could have wished for at a price I never thought I could find!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re beautiful brushes haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them yet but I cant wait .</li>
    <li> I got the brushes right on time, and they came in the brush bag with plastic covering the handles and the brushes. The bag smelled horrible, but after leaving it out and wiping it down once or twice, it toned down a bit. The brushes smelled a little bit, but I washed them and the smell went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are a little stiff, but I&#x27;m hoping with use that they will soften up some. The face brushes are amazing and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for $11, I feel like its worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great.. My girlfriend loves them</li>
    <li> very cheap brushs, look pretty but I don&#x27;t like the way they feel</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes. Nice quality. Only complaint is that they reeked of spray paint the first few weeks I had them. The smell has now gone away.</li>
    <li> I really like all the variety and they are so cute,they are very thin though so it&#x27;s hard to put makeup on with the brushes.</li>
    <li> The only thing that bugged me immensely was the smell. It was like paint and a permanent marker mixed together. Very strong, I couldn&#x27;t use the brushes it was so strong. But after a while it fades. I&#x27;ve been using then for a while now &amp; they are perfect!</li>
    <li> happy with these! the case is pretty the brushes are pretty and there is a variety, exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the strong smell of these so I returned them. I didn&#x27;t even bother trying them out. I opened the case and all I could smell was this horrible plastic scent. Yuck!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Love the color, the quality, the price, great deal!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are amazing if u are on a budget or just want some nice brushes. They are really good for traveling. I use them almost everyday and I totally recommend them!!</li>
    <li> nice brushes to use...</li>
