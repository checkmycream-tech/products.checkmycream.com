      <li>Dior Hypnotic Poison is a lovely pick-me-up kind of scent.</li>
      <li>I love this scent</li>
      <li>The vanilla remained the top note, overpowering everything else.</li>
      <li>I immediately fell in love.  </li>
      <li>Hypnotic Poison is my favorite, but if you would like to save some $$$</li>
      <li>A spritz before dressing should leave you smelling lovely most of the day.</li>
      <li>but i love it anyway.  </li>
      <li>ever since and it still continues to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have a $5 that smells and feels better than this.</li>
      <li>I hope you love it just as much as I love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this luxurious smell -- unconvetional mixture of almond, vanilla and musk.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Love rocks perfume or Body spray</li>
      <li>I have never received more compliments on a fragrance than this one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did -</li>
      <li>Thats what i do. :)</li>
      <li>I love it and everyone who smells it on me loves it.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about this scent.</li>
      <li>I love perfume and lean towards food and musk scents.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect scent, especially if you&#x27;re looking to attract someone.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>This is a warm rich woodsy smell.  </li>
      <li>the bottle actually kind of looks cheap and plasticky up close but from far away it looks great.</li>
      <li>If i am wearing it to go out, it never fails that someone will ask me what im wearing because i smell fabulous!!   </li>
      <li>It is by far my favorite, and I have loved it for years now.</li>
      <li>This smell is rather strong, but not an offensive chemical smell that often turns me off of floral perfumes.  </li>
      <li>It is incredibly sexy, but be aware, it may be too strong the first seconds you put it on; but after that it&#x27;s just the most sensual smell.</li>
      <li>The combination is not overpowering or too sweet, instead it reminds me of the lovely scent of a fresh corsage.</li>
      <li>unlike most vanilla fragrances, this is very much for WOMEN, not for girls - none of that oversweet bakery feel.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very sexy and alluring in a hypnotic, warm, dark sort of way.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>This is not a sugary sweet or foody smell despite the food references I have made.  </li>
      <li>That is not the way to get a true read from this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The vanilla is not cloying and super sweet, it reminds me of sugar cones that you put icecream in.</li>
      <li>This smell is super aromatic and i can GARANTUEE</li>
      <li>Maybe the perfume is better, I should&#x27;ve guessed that far!</li>
      <li>,it&#x27;s soft and imparts a wonderful and intense scent all day long.</li>
      <li>I have always been a vanilla girl,  and love all things sweet, but I wanted something extra special for my wedding day.</li>
      <li>i tried this out while i was in a perfume store in the south of France, and completely fell in love.  </li>
      <li>I went to Sephora and this is one of a handful they were able to direct me to try.</li>
      <li>Then came a powerful, powdery vanilla smell.</li>
      <li>I completely fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>It was not the simple vanilla smell of the kind used in baking, however.</li>
      <li>I have always liked Christian Dior fragrances.</li>
      <li>Liqorish, not spelled right, is one of the scents in it, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you what else.  </li>
      <li>The name is right.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of trouble with perfumes; I can&#x27;t stand most florals or anything light and sporty, and the majority of the woody/oriental types have a lot of patchouli (which makes me sneeze!)</li>
      <li>And as for the body lotion,which i own,it smells exactly like the perfume</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was that it smelled just like someone baking.</li>
      <li>This perfume should be named Seduction,cause that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this perfume the year it was first released.</li>
      <li>it lasts 24 hours the least, I just got the body cream and not only does it shimmer alot but the scent is really great!</li>
      <li>something i noticed that other people haven&#x27;t mentioned is that it smells very strongly of licorice to me when i first put it on.  </li>
      <li>I think it drys down nicely to a musky vanilla smell that reminds me of moms homemade cookie batter.  </li>
      <li>I tried this yesterday and am going to buy a large sized bottle today.</li>
      <li>It comes in an interesting red, apple shaped bottle with a black, rounded top.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the vanilla as much as he did, but what bothered me was the sickish undertone that I sensed when I sniffed closely.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t fool me, a real Hypnotic Poison fan.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect much from \\&quot;Hypnotic Poison\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It is a \\&quot;white floral,\\&quot; which means that it is made up of light floral notes such as white rose, iris and the lighter scented flowers.</li>
      <li>It is the real stuff.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the absolute weapon of seduction.</li>
      <li>If you spray too much, you might get &#x27;root beer and playdoh&#x27; from it, but if you mist it, and then wait, it should begin to work very well.   </li>
      <li>I could smell it straight away that this was NOT the real deal.</li>
      <li>not so on the real deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an overwhelming smell that didn&#x27;t let you concentrate on other things but drew attention to itself in an intrusive, pungent way.</li>
      <li>It dries down to a vanilla, exotic spice smell.</li>
      <li>Maybe part of this was just how this perfume reacted to my particular skin chemistry.     </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s unique and a rather strange scent, like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very rich smell, not mild but not overbearing either.</li>
      <li>It is nothing like the more subtle Diorissima or the polite and classy original Miss Dior.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money if you want the real Hypnotic Poison.</li>
      <li>It seems it use to last a long time on the skin as well, but not so any more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to wear to the office, but sexy enough for romance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unique and complex and very very modern.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely got a strong vanilla note, but it&#x27;s combined with unusual dark notes...</li>
      <li>Their product is clearly counterfeit.</li>
      <li>Not at all like old ladies.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so unusual that it definitely gets your attention, and</li>
      <li>It definately smells soft at first,almost powdery.</li>
      <li>Wow, who knew?  </li>
      <li>I somehow don&#x27;t think vanilla and musk are a natural mix.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This perfume should be named Seduction,cause that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like.It definately smells soft at first,almost powdery.You spray it on your skin and it starts smelling flowery and still powdery,but not tacky flowers,more like a bunch of black roses.One good thing about it,is that it doesn&#x27;t smell alcoholy at all.I&#x27;m smelling the perfume while i&#x27;m writing this review.Mmmm...feminine scent.Not at all like old ladies.It&#x27;s very unique and complex and very very modern.It&#x27;s a vampiric perfume in my opinion and it&#x27;s the absolute weapon of seduction.The red bottle with the black cap is simply mysterious and it keeps the dark secrets of this perfume well hidden.The name is right.While i was wearing this and doing the make up of a friend of mine,she was feeling so relaxed and hypnotized cause she was smelling my perfume.And as for the body lotion,which i own,it smells exactly like the perfume,it&#x27;s soft and imparts a wonderful and intense scent all day long.Hypnotic Poison is my signature scent and my most beloved famous designer perfume.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of trouble with perfumes; I can&#x27;t stand most florals or anything light and sporty, and the majority of the woody/oriental types have a lot of patchouli (which makes me sneeze!) or sandalwood (which I like but can&#x27;t wear). I went to Sephora and this is one of a handful they were able to direct me to try. I completely fell in love with it. It&#x27;s definitely got a strong vanilla note, but it&#x27;s combined with unusual dark notes... unlike most vanilla fragrances, this is very much for WOMEN, not for girls - none of that oversweet bakery feel. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to make it last, either - spritz it twice in the air and walk through it and you&#x27;re good all day.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this perfume the year it was first released. My co-worker gave it to me as a gift from his trip to Vienna. Even today I keep on wondering how possibly could he find my life-time perfume. I have consumed at least half a dozen bottles of \\&quot;hypnotic poisons\\&quot; ever since and it still continues to be my favorite. From time to time I wear some other perfumes, but I always go back to this one. I absolutely love this luxurious smell -- unconvetional mixture of almond, vanilla and musk. It&#x27;s a very rich smell, not mild but not overbearing either. It&#x27;s the best genesis of feminity.</li>
    <li> I walked into the Dior store and sprayed some of this on. The first thing I noticed was that it smelled just like someone baking. Then came a powerful, powdery vanilla smell. I waited for the perfume to mature. The vanilla remained the top note, overpowering everything else. It was not the simple vanilla smell of the kind used in baking, however. There was a thin, penetrating quadlity to it, like a million shards of vanilla crystalline powder penetrating your nostrils from all sides. After a while there was a sickish undernote. My husband hated it from the beginning. I didn&#x27;t mind the vanilla as much as he did, but what bothered me was the sickish undertone that I sensed when I sniffed closely. Maybe part of this was just how this perfume reacted to my particular skin chemistry.     I tried to wash it off twice with soap, but the smell, especially the sickish part, stayed on my hand. Like the other reviewer, I say, no, thank you very much. This is an overwhelming smell that didn&#x27;t let you concentrate on other things but drew attention to itself in an intrusive, pungent way. It is nothing like the more subtle Diorissima or the polite and classy original Miss Dior. Even the cloyingly sweet Miss Dior Cherie, which by the way smells very flowery, very much like J&#x27;Adore but with a slightly sickish undertone, doesn&#x27;t have the annoying, penetrating, powdery, ovewhelming vanilla quality this does. I guess the sickish undernote is the musk.     While I love eating cookies and cakes with vanilla and vanilla icecream, the vanilla smell of this perfume is not fresh or  edible but is rather loud, insinuating, musk-like and annoying. I somehow don&#x27;t think vanilla and musk are a natural mix.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume.  I am not a fan of the other Poisons, but this one is to die for!  It reminds me of fall, due to the vanilla and musk scents to it, but i wear it all year round!  If i am wearing it to go out, it never fails that someone will ask me what im wearing because i smell fabulous!!   My only complaint is that its a little pricy.  Ask for it as a Birthday or Christmas gift!!  Thats what i do. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Hypnotic Poison by Dior since 1999. This is the last time I will order it from Sephora. Their product is clearly counterfeit. The box looks different (they TRY to imitate the real box, but fail) the gold ring around the lid only exists on their version, it does NOT come on the real Hypnotic Poison. Their version has a darker bottom on the bottle- not so on the real deal.&lt;br /&gt; I could smell it straight away that this was NOT the real deal. Do not waste your money if you want the real Hypnotic Poison. I am sending it back, furiously and want a refund. What a waste of my time!! You can&#x27;t fool me, a real Hypnotic Poison fan. I will be telling Dior about this as well. pffft!</li>
    <li> I love perfume and lean towards food and musk scents. This has floral notes in it, it is NO WAY a floral scent. This is definately a vanilla scent with musks and woods. The vanilla is not cloying and super sweet, it reminds me of sugar cones that you put icecream in. I think what makes the vanilla so different is the bitter almond. Then later I still smell the vanilla some spices, and some myrhh and sandalwood. It dries down to a vanilla, exotic spice smell. All of the ingredients shouldn&#x27;t work together but do so well. I tried this yesterday and am going to buy a large sized bottle today. It will be my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Dior Hypnotic Poison is a lovely pick-me-up kind of scent. It is a \\&quot;white floral,\\&quot; which means that it is made up of light floral notes such as white rose, iris and the lighter scented flowers. The combination is not overpowering or too sweet, instead it reminds me of the lovely scent of a fresh corsage. &lt;br /&gt;Perfect for casual wear and occasions when a rich scent is too much. A little will last you a long time, so no need to drench yourself in this fragrance. A spritz before dressing should leave you smelling lovely most of the day.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I decided to try out a tester and see what it was all about. I have to admit - when I spritzed it on my wrist (don&#x27;t spray it on paper, it&#x27;ll react differently), I didn&#x27;t know what I thought. I couldn&#x27;t figure out if I liked it or not - I&#x27;d never smelled anything remotely close to it. After walking around for a while, I decided to buy it. I&#x27;m glad I did - I love this scent, it&#x27;s unique and a rather strange scent, like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried. People really DO notice it - there&#x27;s a constant flow of \\&quot;ooh\\&quot;&#x27;s and \\&quot;You smell so good - what are you wearing?\\&quot;. Like another reviewer stated, my nose is practically glued to my wrist when I wear it. This is the perfect scent, especially if you&#x27;re looking to attract someone. Use this with discretion - a little really does go a long way!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is my absolute favorite. It is incredibly sexy, but be aware, it may be too strong the first seconds you put it on; but after that it&#x27;s just the most sensual smell.</li>
    <li> This smell is super aromatic and i can GARANTUEE it lasts 24 hours the least, I just got the body cream and not only does it shimmer alot but the scent is really great!</li>
    <li> I bought the lotion for my girlfriend. Maybe the nice reviews that people have posted are for the perfume. The lotion hardly smells like anything and when you smell it it just smells like a Nivea moisturizer! Do not buy the lotion, it is not worth it - it smells very faintly and it is nothing special. I have a $5 that smells and feels better than this. Maybe the perfume is better, I should&#x27;ve guessed that far!</li>
    <li> I was never a huge fan of \\&quot;Poison\\&quot; so I didn&#x27;t expect much from \\&quot;Hypnotic Poison\\&quot;.  I was perusing my local mall one day and just happened to pick up the tester and give it a spritz.  I immediately fell in love.  The initial spray is strong and does have a slight playdough smell to it.  I think it drys down nicely to a musky vanilla smell that reminds me of moms homemade cookie batter.  This smell is rather strong, but not an offensive chemical smell that often turns me off of floral perfumes.  This is a warm rich woodsy smell.  I recommend trying before you buy.  This is not a sugary sweet or foody smell despite the food references I have made.  I love it and everyone who smells it on me loves it.  If anyone asks me what it is though I&#x27;m going to lie my ass off!</li>
    <li> This perfume is AMAZING!!!!  It is by far my favorite, and I have loved it for years now.</li>
    <li> I should begin by saying that about a year ago, I could NOT stand this scent!  But, I had only sniffed the spray nozzle and spritzed a piece of paper.  No no no no no.  That is not the way to get a true read from this fragrance.  Just recently, I felt like trying this out on my skin.  All of the rave reviews compelled me to give it a whirl again, but only on my skin.  I misted my wrist from a good distance, and walked by.  But immediately, I smelled this beautiful, alluring scent!  Yup, it was the Hypnotic Poison that I had just sprayed.  Wow, who knew?  I let it sit for about 10 minutes, and sniffed my wrist.  Three words: OH MY GOSH.  This is one captivating scent!  It is a vanilla scent, but not your typical sugary sweet vanilla scent.  It&#x27;s not foody at all.  Very mellow and deep.  I think the bitter almond note tames the sweetness of the vanilla.  If you spray too much, you might get &#x27;root beer and playdoh&#x27; from it, but if you mist it, and then wait, it should begin to work very well.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a sensuous scent, no doubt.  I can see myself wearing this at an evening occasion, or during the fall/winter days and nights.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey though.  The 1.7 oz retails at $56 and the 3.4 oz is I believe about $78.  It comes in an interesting red, apple shaped bottle with a black, rounded top.  You can&#x27;t really see how much fragrance you have left, so that&#x27;s a slight downfall.  Although I like heavy glass perfume bottles, this bottle truly suits the scent it holds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lasting power: AMAZING.  This will last you all day and then some.  I would go very, very easy on the sprays.  Too much will certainly ruin this fragrance and make you and others sick to the stomach. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Try it out!</li>
    <li> I have never received more compliments on a fragrance than this one.  It&#x27;s soft enough to wear to the office, but sexy enough for romance.  It&#x27;s hard to find but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Christian Dior fragrances. Hypnotic Poison is my favorite, but if you would like to save some $$$ try love rocks body spray or perfume by victoria secret. Love rocks perfume or Body spray smells similar to Hypnotic poison but costs far less. I like them both.</li>
    <li> I noticed now days the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long. It is the 3.4 I got that was not a discount place. For $80. in 2011. They sell a lot of different perfumes. It is the real stuff. Is it me or not that is noticing the difference of the lasting ability on this stuff. It is one of my favorites. Actually you can go onto other sites and they will describe exactly what the different tones are. Liqorish, not spelled right, is one of the scents in it, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you what else.  It is best for people to try it when they go out. You can find it everywhere they sell perfumes. You really won&#x27;t know if it suits you unless you actually try it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the smell lingers longer on clothing for days, than on me half a day. I would like for others to let me know how it is when they use it. It seems it use to last a long time on the skin as well, but not so any more.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this scent. I have owned and ran out of perfume over and over again, I continue to buy it because it is soooo wonderful. To me the scent smells dark, sweet, and mysterious. It is the perfect scent for a night out dancing and it is perfect for a night date. Enjoy! I hope you love it just as much as I love it.</li>
    <li> i tried this out while i was in a perfume store in the south of France, and completely fell in love.  the friend who showed it to me told me that they stopped selling it in major department stores in the US, so I knew i had to buy a bottle there.  it is very expensive, but totally worth it because you won&#x27;t use as much since it really does stay on.  it gets lighter as the day goes by but i&#x27;m still not sure if that&#x27;s because the scent is fading or if you just have a hard time smelling something on yourself.  i haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on it yet but i love it anyway.  something i noticed that other people haven&#x27;t mentioned is that it smells very strongly of licorice to me when i first put it on.  i usually hate licorice but it&#x27;s so unusual that it definitely gets your attention, and then when you smell the vanilla musky aspect of it, you just can&#x27;t help but fall in love--my two cents anyway... i think the name explains it all, it&#x27;s very sexy and alluring in a hypnotic, warm, dark sort of way.  even the bottle looks like a poisonous apple to me, evil but tempting.  the bottle actually kind of looks cheap and plasticky up close but from far away it looks great.</li>
    <li> I just bought this perfume for my wedding day, and I am so excited!! I have always been a vanilla girl,  and love all things sweet, but I wanted something extra special for my wedding day. You really can smell the \\&quot;white floral\\&quot; and the vanilla... it is a heady, sensual and anything-but-sharp fragrance! I think it will go well with my boquet of lilies and roses! As others have said, you will smell your wrists again and again!</li>
