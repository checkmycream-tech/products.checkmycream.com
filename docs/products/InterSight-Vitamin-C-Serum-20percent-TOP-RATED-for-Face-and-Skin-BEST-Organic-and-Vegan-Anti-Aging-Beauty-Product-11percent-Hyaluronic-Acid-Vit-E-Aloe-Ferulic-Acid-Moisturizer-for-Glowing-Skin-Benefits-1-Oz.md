      <li>Pretty good serum.</li>
      <li>So when I was offered this Vitamin C Serum from InterSight Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle to try.  </li>

      <li>I was able to use it to see it&#x27;s true work</li>
      <li>Although it is NOT a replacement for sunscreen, vitamin C protects against and may repair discoloration and fine lines caused by UV damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I see no difference on my fine lines.</li>
      <li>First I noticed about this Vit C serum is that even though it is packaged in an amber dropper bottle, the labeling looks very nice and all the ingredients are very visible.</li>
      <li>/&gt;InterSight Vitamin C Serum also contains MSM, which is one of the most effective skin softeners derived from natural healthy super food vegetables</li>

      <li>The first night receiving this I was so excited to have received it .</li>
      <li>Not too many products out that that don&#x27;t contain cetyl alcohol, but this appears to not having it and that is a super plus to me as I am sensitive to cetyl.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it! Only had it a week, but already have noticed a change in my skin. I&#x27;m only 39 but I have been using all types of anti-aging creams and serums since I was 19, I have always been concerned with keeping my face healthy and looking young and radiant. I like this serum, because it does not get sticky while smoothing around your face, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are being clogged or that I&#x27;m wearing a mask. You also don&#x27;t need much which is another plus. I got this item for free to try and to give my own unbiased opinion on the product. I normally buy store brand stuff because it&#x27;s cheaper, or look for the more expensive ones in stores that are on clearance, I feel this serum is worth the cost and will be buying it, when I run out. I definitely will be recommending this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it give me a good result , i recommend for all beautiful ladies out there try this for your youthful skin and edify your beauty..Really works for me, refresh my skin .</li>
    <li> Be careful missing oils</li>
    <li> Got here fast. Only used it for 2 days so far but it leaves my skin feeling soft. Not too many products out that that don&#x27;t contain cetyl alcohol, but this appears to not having it and that is a super plus to me as I am sensitive to cetyl.  If it had it, my skin would be a mess, but instead it is nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Amazing on the skin. Great for dry skin, and helped with my fine lines. My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It&#x27;s a little bit thick, but not at all sticky. It sinks into my skin quickly and leaves it very moisturized. I have not used it long enough for me to see if it helps with wrinkles but I will continue using it because I like how soft it makes my skin.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using and trying different Vitamin c serums.  This product works well.  This is  one of the watery type serums, very thin, but  It absorbs quickly and feels good on the skin.  It has a mild herbal scent which I&#x27;m not overly fond of, but it dissipates quickly.  This stuff does work and works well however.  The ingredients on this are exactly the same as a few other brands I have tried, for example, OZ Naturals and Purista so it doesn&#x27;t really seem unique.  Still good, none the less!</li>
    <li> You have to try this it is amazing!! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> If you only used two products, this and B5 are your choices. As an esthetician, I can tell you that this is an amazing product. My suggestion is to use this in the mornings and then apply moisturizer over too.</li>
    <li> Simply ........ affordable and Effective !</li>
    <li> I have reached my sixties, but I still take the time to look attractive and my skin care procedures are important. My main issue is dry skin. I live in the desert region of the southwest where the humidity is so low that any moisture from our bodies is absorbed into the air. Here in this area we do not sweat, instead the heat and dry winds leave our skin feeling dry and crispy. Furthermore, dry skin is due to my age because as we grow older, the capacity for our body to manufacture the necessary amount of our natural Hyaluronic Acid and collagen diminishes with age. Additionally, as we age, our skin cells lose the ability to fight off the damaging free radicals in our environment, due to the sun and all the normal air pollution. Dry skin is thin and weak, prone to premature aging such as lines, wrinkles and loss of elasticity, which affects both skin texture and skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several Vitamin C serums on the market, so the question is which serum to choose.  I have two criteria for skin care products; first, I look at the ingredients, and then check see if the manufacturer will stand behind their product with a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight is an Organic, and Vegan Vitamin C Serum made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight contains 20% of vitamin C, which is 5% higher than the well-known brand of Skin Ceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight has the following essential ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C – is an antioxidant that evens skin tone and helps build collagen, which gives skin its elasticity. During the aging process, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form. In stabilizing, the skin’s levels of vitamin C this can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C helps to diminish Age Spots similar to both chemical peels and lasers. Age spots are essentially sun damage, and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin. Although it is NOT a replacement for sunscreen, vitamin C protects against and may repair discoloration and fine lines caused by UV damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight Vitamin C Serum also contains both Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E – is an antioxidant, which helps to increase firmness while reducing wrinkles and the combination of Vitamin C &amp; E + Ferulic Acid has the capacity to extend the life and effectiveness of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight Vitamin C Serum includes Hyaluronic Acid - one of the most powerful hydrating and moisturizing ingredients on the market today. HA holds up to 1000 times its weight in water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight Vitamin C Serum also contains MSM, which is one of the most effective skin softeners derived from natural healthy super food vegetables&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe – has strong ANTI-BACTERIAL PROPERTIES to help with acne and other skin problems while providing properties to heal, soothe, and moisturize, relieve burning and itching, calms skin irritation, and helps to hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch hazel - has ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ASTRINGENT PROPERTIES - as an astringent substance, it tends to tighten, and dry out oily skin thereby reducing the size of skin pores.  Furthermore, witch hazel is just as effective as harsh alcohol; the difference is that witch hazel is a gentle natural product from plant extracts. Alcohol can cause skin sensitivity for some people, and although I do NOT have sensitive skin, I do experience redness, itching and burning from other vitamin c serums containing any alcohol content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil - contains almost all of the essential vitamins and minerals for healthy skin - vitamin E, B-complex, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine, and chromium. Jojoba is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum, which is the substance that we naturally produce from our own oil glands below the skin surface. It is anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and non-toxic, and its moisturizing and emollient properties are beneficial for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid is an important amino acid, a building block for every important tissue in the body, also known as L-arginine. This amino acid is crucial to maintaining healthy skin that defies common signs of aging and is naturally in many foods.  Therapeutically, L-arginine is useful for a number of purposes, including skin healing.  Research supports L-arginine’s ability to heal damaged skin, to help reduce symptoms of burns and rashes and potentially reverse environmental damage, including pollution, cigarettes and exposure to UV radiation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight Vitamin C Serum has every ingredient that I need and require for the best skin care health.  Similar to many vitamin C serums, it has an eye drop applicator, however, this is a little different from my usual water-like textured Vitamin C serums, and I like its slight silky feeling on my skin. I apply this serum twice a day, mornings on freshly cleansed and dry skin, and then in the evenings as part of my skin-care routine before I go to bed. In the mornings, use of this serum is necessary for healthy skin, it functions as an antioxidant, protecting the skin from damaging free radicals. I repeat the application in the evenings for the extra nourishment overnight. Research supports the theory that many of the major restorative functions in the body like tissue repair occur mostly, or in some cases only, during sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal results include better texture; smoother skin, diminished fine lines, and better skin tone; and my general skin color is more even and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time vitamin C Serum users may see some minor results within one to two weeks. Vitamin C penetrates down to the lower skin cell tissues, and better results are apparent after a month as the lower nourished skin cells from InterSight Vitamin C serum rise toward the surface.  Consistent use of InterSight Vitamin C may fade brown spots due to sun damage, help clear acne, and reduce some fine lines and wrinkles, resulting in smoother, healthier therefore younger looking skin.  Of course, InterSight works better when used in conjunction with other good skin care products, and positive results are faster with a healthy lifestyle, a nutritious diet, proper hydration and a sufficient amount of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InterSight Vitamin C Serum meets my first criteria for natural ingredients, it is Organic, Vegan, GMP certified and FDA approved, and made in the USA. Additionally, InterSight meets my second criteria, Guaranteed Satisfaction within 90 days or your money back…no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research, usages, results, statements and opinions are my own.important tissue in the body, also known as L-arginine.

Research supports L-arginine’s ability to heal damaged skin, to help reduce symptoms of burns and rashes and potentially reverse environmental damage, including pollution, cigarettes and exposure to UV radiation.  InterSight Vitamin C Serum has every ingredient that I need and require for the best skin care health.  Similar to many vitamin C serums, it has an eye drop applicator, however, this is a little different from my usual water-like textured Vitamin C serums, and I like its slight silky feeling on my skin. I apply this serum twice a day, mornings on freshly cleansed and dry skin, and then in the evenings as part of my skin-care routine before I go to bed. In the mornings, use of this serum is necessary for healthy skin, it functions as an antioxidant, protecting the skin from damaging free radicals. I repeat the application in the evenings for the extra nourishment overnight. Research supports the theory that many of the major restorative functions in the body like tissue repair occur mostly, or in some cases only, during sleep.  My personal results include better texture; smoother skin, diminished fine lines, and better skin tone; and my general skin color is more even and healthier.  First time vitamin C Serum users may see some minor results within one to two weeks. Vitamin C penetrates down to the lower skin cell tissues, and better results are apparent after a month as the lower nourished skin cells from InterSight Vitamin C serum rise toward the surface.  Consistent use of InterSight Vitamin C may fade brown spots due to sun damage, help clear acne, and reduce some fine lines and wrinkles, resulting in smoother, healthier therefore younger looking skin.  Of course, InterSight works betterwhen used in conjunction with other good skin care products, and positive results are faster with a healthy lifestyle, a nutritious diet, proper hydration and a sufficient amount of sleep.  InterSight Vitamin C Serum meets my first criteria for natural ingredients, it is Organic, Vegan, GMP certified and FDA approved, and made in the USA. Additionally, InterSight meets my second criteria, Guaranteed Satisfaction within 90 days or your money back…no questions asked.  I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research, usages, results, statements and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great smell, good product!</li>
    <li> Great product. High quality. My wife loves this vitamin C serum. Always glad to see it go on sale.</li>
    <li> I received this in an exchange for a review. I received the InterSight Vitamin C Serum 20% for Faces and Skin and many other things. The first night receiving this I was so excited to have received it . The product is Awesome I put it on my Face  and when I woke in the am I could already feel such a difference. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing great results with this Product and looking forward to getting many more oils. The package was very nicely and was secure no leakage and it arrived on time and I was very pleased with everything could not ask for anything better. Look forward to more orders.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly.  But I miss a vitamin c smell!</li>
    <li> so far I am pleased. I use it only at night, combined with high dose of VitaminC!</li>
    <li> the best serum to keep your skin radiant and youthfull in any age! Works great! :) I got this product at discound price, but the review is my own! Nothing related to discount and my own opinion!</li>
    <li> Really looking this product. When I put it on my face I can feel it for a few seconds, then it melts into the skin and does is job! No breakout, no weird greasy feeling. Just awesome.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the price.</li>
    <li> This serum is working great on my skin, face and body.  My face was very dry and flaky, now it is smoother and much better, I think it even made my skin brighter like the dark spots are lighter.  I used it on my back for healing benefits and it looks like it is working on acne type bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks mp</li>
    <li> First I noticed about this Vit C serum is that even though it is packaged in an amber dropper bottle, the labeling looks very nice and all the ingredients are very visible. It has a very nice consistency. Most of the ones I got are quite watery. This one is a tad thicker and easier to apply on your skin. It has a very slight scent that goes away fast. It is quickly absorbed by the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot. A little drop will go a long way. I top it off with a moisturizer, morning and night, and my skin is smooth and supple and dark spots are diminishing considerably. Purchased this bottle of Vitamin C serum at a huge promotional price to try and review. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-fifties, and usually my skin feels tight and dry by the end of the day.  This serum helps my skin retain moisture longer; even at the end of the day my face is soft and moisturized.  I combine this with Area Starr Organic Argan Oil morning and night, and am loving the results.</li>
    <li> So in order for me to use this product without any interference from my other products I did a lemon clean. Which I took a real lemon and scrubbed my face with it afterwards I was able to use it to see it&#x27;s true work and I can&#x27;t complain my face is glowing, even toned with no spots or dark circles. This serum is the truth and I will continue using it. I was given this product for a review and I&#x27;m happy I accepted to try it and I will continue to try products from Intersight. Thank you</li>
    <li> Product came with seal broke and the liquid was yellowish and cloudy which means it is not a stable form of vitamin C.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used it for over a month. I&#x27;m 43. I see no difference on my fine lines. It made my skin look worse and gave acne.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 bottles and missed the 30 days return window. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the product!  It goes on smooth and makes my skin fresh and pores are diminished.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff leaves skin super soft. And has a great smell</li>
    <li> For years, I have struggled with oily or dry skin, depending on the day. Not one lotion seemed to work the way it claimed to work. This serum is fantastic. Not only has it reduced the fine lines and wrinkles, it has really evened out my skin tone. I do not even use moisturizer in the morning anymore, because this does it all. It has also brightened my skin, and repaired the sun damage from over the years. It&#x27;s a great product. Do not hesitate in making this purchase.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin nice a smooth.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it eliminates any of the wrinkles around the eyes or smile area but making skin smoother helps them not be as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different kinds of facial products and have really liked the results that I had from using vitamin c serums. So when I was offered this Vitamin C Serum from InterSight Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle to try.  It arrived and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and plan on continuing on using it instead of my other serums. It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy feeling and didn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause any breakouts. If you are looking for a great Vitamin C Serum, I definitely recommend trying this one from InterSight Naturals.</li>
    <li> Strong smell that isn&#x27;t pleasant. And way too watery.</li>
    <li> Pretty good serum. I&#x27;ve been using it at night before bed once a week. This is my first time using vitamin c serum and I tend not to use too much of anything on my face but this feels nice. My face doesn&#x27;t feel super greasy when I wake up like I thought it would be. The serum comes in a small glass bottle with a dropper for easy application. I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change over the past few weeks so I&#x27;ll be updating with future changes as I use it more.</li>
    <li> Received this 2 days ago, gave it to my mother and she can already slightly see results! Crazy. I will write another update after she gets some more use out of it. But I am definitely impressed!</li>
    <li> In love with this serum! It leaves my skin feeling so soft. I have dry skin and this moisturizes it perfectly, I use it under my moisturizer and my skin seriously feels like perfection.</li>
    <li> The best 2 ingredients for anti-aging, in one product. Serum glides on easily, no burning or harsh ingredients....you will see improvement! Be sure to use daily....</li>
