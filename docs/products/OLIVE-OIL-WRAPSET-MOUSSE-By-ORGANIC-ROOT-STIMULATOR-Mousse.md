    <li> I LOVE this hair mousse! It gets rid of frizz, defines your curls, and when your hair dries it&#x27;s soft and light, not hard or sticky. And it&#x27;s ultra conditioning too!</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizing mousse! I have recently been making the change from brunette to blonde, which, has left my hair very dry. I am 45, so this could be a culprit as well. Either case, my hair has truly benefited from this Olive Oil Mousse. I have been trying several brands, name brands to lesser known. This is one of my two favorites that I rotate.....this too, seems to provide better hair days. Another plus is the shine that it leaves after using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently going through the process of growing out my perm, and this this is such a life saver trust me. It&#x27;s make your hair manageable and shiny without weighing it down. Love it!</li>
    <li> my hair is dry, but when I use this product, my hair become smooth and soft. I very like this product. BY the way, it not make my hair be curly, that make me feel a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this mousse!  The smell is awesome too and so many times people say, \\&quot;oh your hair smells nice!\\&quot;  My only complaint is that it is hard to find in the stores.  :-[</li>
    <li> Great wrapping lotion and it smells good</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this mousse and fell in love with it immediately.  It&#x27;s not the kind of mousse that leaves your hair feeling weighed down or hard.  Simply the best there is.</li>
    <li> The texture of my hair felt nice and soft. My hair was shiny enough, but there were too many little knots on my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used on wet hair and put my hair in rollers. I&#x27;m natural type 4</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and provides a strong hold.</li>
    <li> I use this as a wrap setting lotion or for when i rod my hair up and sit under the dryer. I love the results. It work just as good as the salon products and a hell of a lot cheaper. Sometimes ill mix it up with ORS Anti Frizz Olive Oil Glossing Polisher when im blow drying my hair and it works wonders. I also wrote a review on that, check it out if you like. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! Finally found a product that gives conditioning and straightening my hair has never felt so nice! (And I&#x27;m a product junkie)</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I can use on a daily basis with out having flakes in my hair. Great product</li>
    <li> Always use this product, it works great for me.</li>
    <li> seems to work just fine.....</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use mousse but it came in the relaxer kit so I tried it. It really holds you hair straight but yet soft and touchable even the next day. Will continue to buy from now on.</li>
    <li> I asked my husband to buy me this product a week ago, and I got it today. Aside from the fact that it was late I got excited because of all the 5 stars reviews on it. However, it looks weird, and it doesn&#x27;t have the thickness that a mousse should have. It is bubbly and watery like spits! I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it, but that&#x27;s what I thought of when I first saw it. I gave it a try despite the fact the I wasn&#x27;t too convinced. First, it was hard to cover my long hair with it, unlike regular mousse. Second, I put it on my hair and it didn&#x27;t help the frizziness and now it&#x27;s tangly. I am not at all happy with it, and I should have known better that cheap means bad quality most of the time. Try for your self...</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. I use this product on damp hair after shampooing, and usually let it dry naturally. It gives a great look, and really feels like it&#x27;s good for my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product plus smell delicious. Just a small amount is everything you need to get great results.</li>
    <li> This product is best used on wet hair that will be set under a drier or curly hair used like for a mousse. It works well.</li>
