      <li>which is a nice way of saying, &amp;#34;We found a way to make it</li>

      <li>Nice to have my Giorgio again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very strong.</li>
      <li>very strong and lingering scent.</li>
      <li>I prefer the more musky scents and this was kind of too floral for me.</li>
      <li>old school Giorgio she replied I love that smell !!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I love the sweet scent that always reminds me of those happy days.  </li>
      <li>I REALLY LIKED THE SMELL OF THIS FRAGRANCE, IS STRONG</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>When I lived in Los Angeles this was my scent for many years.</li>
      <li>Citrus top notes with a hint of spice not too over bearing like</li>
      <li>Moved to the Midwest many years ago and could not find it.</li>
      <li>To me it&#x27;s one of the top 5 in the world.</li>
      <li>There a better for this price in the market.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>Glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Within days my search of many years was signed, sealed, and delivered.</li>
      <li>mother&#x27;s  favorite.  </li>
      <li>This one is going to be added to my all time favorite.</li>
      <li>one of my favorite scents for my husband to wear.</li>
      <li>Love this scent -&#x3D;</li>
      <li>The first day I wore it a Lady stop me and said you smell really, really, really good</li>
      <li>First, the good news.</li>
      <li>Properly packed and great smelling perfume, will surely give it 10/10.</li>
      <li>thank you for making it affordable and easy to find</li>
      <li>I have had a couple of people tell me it was too strong.</li>
      <li>I have grown to appreciate this scent more since I have bought a bottle of it and the cost is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
      <li>I thought this fragrance was no longer available.</li>
      <li>A great cologne, especially in the summer.</li>
      <li>I bought it when it was available in stores and my now husband was my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I found it here on line.  </li>
      <li>it smelled like a mixture of Pine Sol, furniture polish &amp; cheap perfume.  </li>
      <li>I loved Giorgio for women and I love the men&#x27;s equally.</li>
      <li>The smart thing to do if you want the full effect of this cologne and many others is to use a non-scented soap like ivory in the bath or shower that way the cologne doesn&#x27;t collide with your scented soaps and shower gels!</li>
      <li>My advice is to forget this scent if you aren&#x27;t able to smell the bottle first.</li>
      <li>and with it came coupons for other good stuff!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it is no longer being sold in many retail outlets.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean scent that is not to overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I wear it on special occasions and get compliments from time to time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;very sweet smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true - this product is indeed hazardous....to your nose.</li>
      <li>It is a bit sweet as well.</li>
      <li>Way back in the 80&#x27;s this scent became a favorite, and I was really glad to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean</li>
      <li>It came so quickly....</li>
      <li>Quick service, no problems, on time.  </li>
      <li>After realizing the power of Amazon.com, I did a quick search, a quick find, and a quick order.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the stuff back in the day when it first came out</li>
      <li>This stuff is potent, sophisticated, inexpensive, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>product is considered &amp;#34;Hazardous &amp; Non Returnable,&amp;#34; but luckily, Amazon was nice enough to give me a refund, anyway.  </li>
      <li>If you prefer to be out of the mainstream with your cologne scents and don&#x27;t care to smell like every other guy in the crowd then this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>wearing it right now as I type this.</li>
      <li>A charming, elegant city of immeasurable wealth is Beverly Hills perfume to represnta well with its aroma of freshness and color super current; Green.</li>
      <li>AT LEAST make the good reformulation available again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s for intimacy not a casual night out or&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what was asked for and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.</li>
      <li>Yes, some ingredients are always present, but many others are not.  </li>
      <li>So glad it is back.</li>
      <li>This cologne is powerful - perhaps too much so some might say.</li>
      <li>This is pretty close to that smell.</li>
      <li>I was about to run out of my previous bottle of the exact same cologne, so I was happy to find this on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Time old scent that after 20 yrs of my 1st use I still love -- be careful though, the scent is a little more potent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d appreciate a REPLY to my query, such that I might buy a product exactly as the ORIGINAL and not a knock-off brand in a bottle like giorgio?????  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>gift well appreciated</li>
      <li>This is a very</li>
      <li>I will go back to my original purchases and reorder.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find it in any of the Major Stores for, almost, ten years.  </li>
      <li>Does not have the same potency and aroma as my original purchases.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very strong. A lot of patchouli in it. A bit dated. There a better for this price in the market.</li>
    <li> This magnificent fragrance was 15 to 20 years ahead of it&#x27;s time when introduced in 1984. It preceded CK1 as a perfect unisex fragrance, being used by many women as well. To me it&#x27;s one of the top 5 in the world. Wish they&#x27;d bring back the stick deodorant!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal !!!!! no knockoff here, smells just like I remembered it.  The first day I wore it a Lady stop me and said you smell really, really, really good, what is the name of the cologne your wearing, I replied old school Giorgio she replied I love that smell !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> gift well appreciated</li>
    <li> It came so quickly....and with it came coupons for other good stuff!</li>
    <li> I remember buying Giorgio for Men, about 20 years ago.  I have not been able to find it in any of the Major Stores for, almost, ten years.  It&#x27;s a clean scent that is not to overpowering.  I use it everyday.  The title says it all.</li>
    <li> Time old scent that after 20 yrs of my 1st use I still love -- be careful though, the scent is a little more potent that previous. 1-2 squirts is sufficent</li>
    <li> This is a must have for two of my adult sons I buy it every year thank you for making it affordable and easy to find</li>
    <li> I was won over by the original Giorgio of beverly hills scent (1985)and received many accolades from people,  but I&#x27;ve been disappointed by my more recent purchases  and after checking the ingredients listed by the various venders, in their listing of ingredients,,, there are wide differences listed.  Yes, some ingredients are always present, but many others are not.  I&#x27;d appreciate a REPLY to my query, such that I might buy a product exactly as the ORIGINAL and not a knock-off brand in a bottle like giorgio?????  lworthey@charter.net</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKED THE SMELL OF THIS FRAGRANCE, IS STRONG BUT AT SAME TIME IT IS A SOFT CITRIC SMELL</li>
    <li> I ordered it a few weeks ago along with 2 more (which were pathetic) and i absolutely love the fragrance. Properly packed and great smelling perfume, will surely give it 10/10. This one is going to be added to my all time favorite.</li>
    <li> Fresh and clean I thought this fragrance was no longer available. I bought it when it was available in stores and my now husband was my boyfriend. Citrus top notes with a hint of spice not too over bearing like it&#x27;s counter part in womens. When he saw it on the vanity he was totally surprised. I have enjoyed every minute he wears it!</li>
    <li> u can&#x27;t find this in stores hardly anywhere, great smelling, ur not gonna beat this price anywhere, especially in a store if u can find it.</li>
    <li> Quick service, no problems, on time.  Very good price.  One of the best smelling fragrances out there.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t wear this cologne very much in the 80&#x27;s as a young man. Back then it was too trendy if you know what I mean. I prefer the more musky scents and this was kind of too floral for me. I have grown to appreciate this scent more since I have bought a bottle of it and the cost is not bad at all. I wear it on special occasions and get compliments from time to time. If you prefer to be out of the mainstream with your cologne scents and don&#x27;t care to smell like every other guy in the crowd then this is a good choice. This product came packaged nicely and is not a knock-off cologne. And I might add also that not every man can wear this cologne especially if he bathes or showers in other scented body washes! The smart thing to do if you want the full effect of this cologne and many others is to use a non-scented soap like ivory in the bath or shower that way the cologne doesn&#x27;t collide with your scented soaps and shower gels!</li>
    <li> Giorgio fro years... great product</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful perfume.  Unfortunately, it is no longer being sold in many retail outlets.  Glad to have found it on Amazon. Amazon does not ship this perfume overseas, something about security regulations.  That&#x27;s too bad, but at least delivery to a U.S. address was quick.</li>
    <li> I have received more than a few inquiries about the cologne I was \\&quot;wearing\\&quot; and find this to be a pleasant and unoffensive aroma for most.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite scents for my husband to wear. Fresh and clean</li>
    <li> First, the good news. This stuff is potent, sophisticated, inexpensive, and lasts a long time. They seem to be using quality oils in the manufacuring process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The bad? It is actually too overpowering a scent for me anymore. It is a bit sweet as well. I have had a couple of people tell me it was too strong. This cologne is powerful - perhaps too much so some might say.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby. I loved Giorgio for women and I love the men&#x27;s equally. Great Scent. Try</li>
    <li> This did have roughly the same scent as the original, but it does not last quite as long, actually not long at all. I think if it was made in more of an oil base, this would last longer.</li>
    <li> I recommend this perfum, it&#x27;s very nice to use at night...wonderful, everybody like it&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t receive Eau D&#x27;orange yet...what&#x27;s happened?</li>
    <li> Love this scent -&#x3D; Smells wonderful lasts a long time - be careful though a little goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne</li>
    <li> After looking for this Giorgio classic cologne at such places at Macy&#x27;s, Dillard&#x27;s, and Younkers, I could not  find it anywhere and all clerks said it could not be ordered.  After realizing the power of Amazon.com, I did a quick search, a quick find, and a quick order.  Within days my search of many years was signed, sealed, and delivered.</li>
    <li> This stuff still drives my wife wild and we have been together for 19 years.  The constant compliments from other women in our social circle just drives the point home.  Great.</li>
    <li> I was about to run out of my previous bottle of the exact same cologne, so I was happy to find this on Amazon.  But as soon as I smelled it, I was unpleasantly surprised - it smelled like a mixture of Pine Sol, furniture polish &amp; cheap perfume.  It has obviously been &amp;#34;reformulated,&amp;#34;  which is a nice way of saying, &amp;#34;We found a way to make it cheaper.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is considered &amp;#34;Hazardous &amp; Non Returnable,&amp;#34; but luckily, Amazon was nice enough to give me a refund, anyway.  It&#x27;s true - this product is indeed hazardous....to your nose.</li>
    <li> When I lived in Los Angeles this was my scent for many years. Moved to the Midwest many years ago and could not find it. Imagine my surprise when I found it on Amazon. Wear it daily and brings back many fond memories of my days in LA.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the stuff back in the day when it first came out</li>
    <li> Classic scent...I live it!</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Arden discontinued this product so I have been trying to  hoard  all the\\&quot;overstock\\&quot; I can. The results have been horrendous. When this reformulation first came out it was one of the best reformulations (IMO) for any re -launched designer scent. In the past two weeks I have smelled roughly 6 different batches of this and they all smell different. There is ZERO quality control for this product. You never know what you are going to get and that is the TRUTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * Also be advised that the juice is a DARK GREEN or LIGHT GREEN color. Anybody trying to sell you a YELLOWISH GREEN juice is pulling your leg...been there done that a few times these past 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My advice is to forget this scent if you aren&#x27;t able to smell the bottle first. For me it is a tease even if I smell just a little bit of fragrance. You might as well bury this legend and let it rest in peace OR AT LEAST make the good reformulation available again. $2 fragrance oils work betetr than what I received.</li>
    <li> very strong and lingering scent.</li>
    <li> perhaps it is just me but I remembered this differently and when strolling down memory lane ...well I might have veered off the path with this fragrance - so I can acknowledge that the disappointment could be that it not you... its me... I am just not that into you....</li>
    <li> I used to buy Giorgio Beverly Hills when I was in college and actually had to go to the store on Rodeo Dr.&lt;br /&gt;to get it.  I love the sweet scent that always reminds me of those happy days.  This is a very and I mean&lt;br /&gt;very sweet smell so when you use it just spray once unless you want to smell like a woman that&#x27;s been all&lt;br /&gt;day shopping in Beverly Hills trying on hundreds of perfumes.  It&#x27;s for intimacy not a casual night out or&lt;br /&gt;a wear to work cologne.</li>
    <li> Lasting scent on hubby who wears it on week ends. Nice suttle scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this cologne for men. My husband used it for many years and so happy to find this cologne. Bought TWO bottles for him. Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> So glad it is back. One of my favorites! It was nearly impossible to find and was so expensive when it went out of production. A great cologne, especially in the summer.</li>
    <li> Way back in the 80&#x27;s this scent became a favorite, and I was really glad to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent !! Always used this years ago and hard to find.  Was exactly the same</li>
    <li> Thankful to still be able to buy this! It is my 96  year  old  mother&#x27;s  favorite.  Keep it coming for a few more years....</li>
    <li> i will buits just goody this  product again, my girlfriend loves it on my neck, an every place else!, it just smells good</li>
    <li> Cheaper, but really good, this juice is very strong, ideal for any ocassion, day or night, summer or winter.&lt;br /&gt;Tks Giorgio.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great shipper. What more can I say? I&#x27;ve been a fan of Giorgio for years. I will continue to be a fan.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this back in the day. It smells awsum and still get compliments. I was shock to have found it on amazon as people on e-bay want premium price for it as it&#x27;s not made anymore. you can&#x27;t go wrong on this one.</li>
    <li> A charming, elegant city of immeasurable wealth is Beverly Hills perfume to represnta well with its aroma of freshness and color super current; Green.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, long lasting, but doesn&#x27;t rock the room. Need deliver to pick it up. Doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. Love it.</li>
