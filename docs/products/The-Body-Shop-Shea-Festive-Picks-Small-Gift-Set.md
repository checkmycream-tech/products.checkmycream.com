<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast delivery and good product pricing</li>
    <li> Reading the other reviews I noticed that one of the biggest cons is that this shower cream doesn&#x27;t lather up enough. Since when does lather&#x3D;cleansing power? Often times other shower gels lather up because they&#x27;re stripping the skin of natural oils. I&#x27;d rather use a shower gel, in this case cream, that doesn&#x27;t lather but leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This us exactly what the body shop&#x27;s shower cream does. It leaves my skin so moisturized and smelling nice. The smell is almost like a perfume but it&#x27;s not overpowering. It lingers on your skin for the entire day but if you wanted to put on a scented lotion or perfume it wouldn&#x27;t interfere. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this shower cream (hopefully it lasts for more than a month).</li>
    <li> The Body Shop is my go to company for my skin regiments because their products actually work. This Shea Shower Cream has a sweet yet not overpowering smell that will linger on your skin throughout the day. It is made with natural ingredients such as sesame and sunflower oil which moisturises your skin without leaving any residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be tempted to use a lot because it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as typical bath gels, but a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a shower gel that cleans, moisturizes, and leaves you smelling clean throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like a gel-based cleanser does. You have to use a lot to get a good lather, so it doesn&#x27;t go a long way.</li>
    <li> This shower cream smells so fresh and clean, and not a heavy scent at all, very light.  l love the scent!  It&#x27;s not overpowering. I have dry skin, and love using this product because this shower cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after my shower. It is so moisturizing because of the shea butter! Yet, there is no residue and does not leave your skin oily. It is creamy and lathers well and a little goes a long way.  You feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I have always trusted Body Shop as a brand I trust. Generally I tend to use their products that are catered towards lips however I was pleasantly surprised with the shower cream. I tend to have a normal to oily skin which causes dirt to get trapped and gives me a sticky feeling, especially considering that much of my day is spent out in the sun and I tend to sweat quite a bit. I know the product description says that it’s best used for very dry skin, however personally I felt as though it worked very well on oily skin as well. It smelled good (good enough for me, as I like soft and subtle smells due to respiratory issues), and this has a lost-lingering scent without being overpowering. And most importantly, it left my skin feeling clean but not right and dry. I know people have commented on this not making enough lather, and while it did take me some time getting used to a &amp;#34;shower cream&amp;#34; without lather, however the pros outweighed the cons (of not having enough lather). Overall a product I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell. No residue. With it being a non-soap product, was thrilled with the way it suds. Really like how my skin feels after using.  Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Great for shaving.</li>
    <li> This is the best non soap cleanser I have found recently!  Smells and feels very smooth on skin. Don&#x27;t need  much.</li>
    <li> I have used this product almost every day since I received it a few weeks ago. It has a nice light lather with nice scent. You can feel the softness it leaves on your skin as your lathering it on. Once your dry you can still smell the nice scent it leaves behind. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shower cream for ages. It leaves my skin soft, not oily, never a residue. I love the scent, it&#x27;s very plain. As an added bonus, I have used it on my toddler who has lots of allergies and skin sensitivities. It has never irritated her skin! Love it, will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This shower cream doesn&#x27;t lather well, but lather doesn&#x27;t equal cleanliness. It cleanses well and leaves the skin soft and moisturized. It also smells really good.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this shower cream! I got some as a gift in a pack and have fallen in love with it!</li>
    <li> This is a great shower cream!  I love the smell!  I totally recommend this product and will definetly buy again!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a little easier to lather, but it&#x27;s not.  Definitely more moisturizing than a shower gel, but I just expected some bubbles.</li>
    <li> Lid was broken when it arrived. The wash itself is great, though.</li>
    <li> I liked the cream...put the wash just falls short. I don&#x27;t feel clean after using it..leaves me fee,king like a film is there.</li>
    <li> love it, my skin after shower feels smooth</li>
    <li> I love this shower cream. It has a nice soft scent that is not overpowering. It cleans well and moisturizes without feeling greasy. My skin feels soft after I use it. It&#x27;s great! I also love Body Shop products period because they do not test on animals and try to be earth friendly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shower cream. It&#x27;s very gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and feels super gentle. I add a pump spray (which I buy elsewhere) to the 8 oz bottle so it&#x27;s easy to apply. It has a subtle scent, not a strong perfume.</li>
    <li> I love that it has sesame and sunflower seed oil in it, as my skin it prone to severe dryness.  I found it easiest to use with a poof or loofa, rather than just applying it directly on my skin to get the most out of the lather.  The scent is amazing.  It is the most gentle, least harsh, moisturizing body wash I have found. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower cream.  I love it because not only does it clean my skin, but it also moisturizes at the same time without leaving that greasy feeling that you can get from regular lotions. It also smells really good!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this product, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily!</li>
    <li> I like this well enough.  I do feel like it gets me clean, although it barely lathers at all.  (Some shower creams/oils are like that, though, and this is a soap-free cleanser.)  I also think it&#x27;s non-drying -- actually quite moisturizing, probably because of the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I didn&#x27;t see them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, PEG-5 Cocamide, Coco-Glucoside, Fragrance, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Shea Butter, Sesame Seed Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Linalool, Tocopherol, Coumarin, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citric Acid, Caramel, CI 15985/Yellow 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is free of parabens, if that is of concern to you.  However, it does contain some preservatives, artificial fragrance, and dyes.  (For what it&#x27;s worth, I do not find this irritating to my skin, and it rinses off without leaving residue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really not sold on the scent.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent, but I&#x27;m sort of neutral on it.  I&#x27;ve certainly used other shower gels/creams/etc. that I liked the scents of a lot more.  I think maybe I just expected something warmer or more vanilla-like or almond-like, based on the color and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, if I can find other products from this line with different fragrances, I&#x27;ll definitely try them.</li>
