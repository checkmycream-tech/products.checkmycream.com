      <li>The scent is wonderful!</li>
      <li>I have great skin and will continue to Olay until I&#x27;m in my dotage!</li>
      <li>This oil has put a stop to that, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>However change is good, and this has been a very good change for me.  </li>
      <li>This is great for both face and hair.</li>
      <li>In any event...I think this is a great product that I use each night at bedtime and have noticed a difference in my skin as a result.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>LOVE this face oil!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>great light weight face oil.</li>
      <li>I was advised that retailers could set their own prices for the products...  </li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful smell, gives a moist soft glow.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, but most of all, I love the Amazon price!  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have used okay since I was 17.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin dewy and more plump.</li>
      <li>Use on top of moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I was worried the first day because i used 4 drops per directions and that was way too much, but after that i have used 2 or 3 and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>I had been using an Oil of Olay regenerist night cream that originally had a violet tint to it, but then it was like they changed the product</li>
      <li>It is a light and clean treatment that goes right into your skin, making it youthful and glowing.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>This facial oil is amazing 😍</li>
      <li>As for the olay I get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>My skin stays smooth and is getting more balanced and less oily every day.</li>
      <li>Very nice, especially during the dry winter.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, particularly during the dry winter, that I will definitely keep buying.</li>
      <li>The smell reminds me of Pure Citrus Orange air freshener.</li>
      <li>Most products are &amp;#34; nice&amp;#34; but I use for awhile and then try the next new one that Olay comes out with.  </li>
      <li>I have very break-out prone skin, and I&#x27;ve had no problem from this.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I use it twice daily, once in the morning, once at night, and my face has never been so smooth.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really see any difference in look.</li>
      <li>Will buy again for sure, but this small bottle should last for many months.</li>
      <li>The suggested retain price was SO much higher than the Amazon price that I actually contacted the manufacturer and asked HOW they could possibly list a retail price that was close to 4 times higher than the Amazon price.  </li>
      <li>I use Retin-a, and during the winter months in my cold climate, and even with a good moisturizer over the retinoid, I would still have some flakey patches on my face.</li>
      <li>Keeping my skin in good shape during the winter cold and wind.</li>
      <li>My face has always been super oily and a little dry.</li>
      <li>Not worth the money at any price really</li>

    <li> Excellent service-great product!</li>
    <li> LOVE this face oil! I use it twice daily, once in the morning, once at night, and my face has never been so smooth. Ah-mazing 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> This product is quite oily, but seems to moisturize like I was hoping it would. I use it only at night. The scent is wonderful! It has a slight lemon scent. Also a small amount goes a long way so its economical.</li>
    <li> Love it.Helps moisturize dry skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for this. Smells great. Not greasy. I wear it alone or under make-up. Makes my skin dewy and more plump.</li>
    <li> its too oily even i have dry skin make me like disco ball</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a recommendation for it in a magazine article about dry skin.

    <li> This is great for both face and hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, gives a moist soft glow.  Makes my skin supple no matter how dry it feels from winter cold or summer sun. Packed well, no leaking.  Hard to find in stores.  Use on top of moisturizer.  Not too Oily.  Most products are &amp;#34; nice&amp;#34; but I use for awhile and then try the next new one that Olay comes out with.  Not so for this oil-- it is a staple. Have purchased it multiple times.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I had been using an Oil of Olay regenerist night cream that originally had a violet tint to it, but then it was like they changed the product and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled.  So the search began.  However change is good, and this has been a very good change for me.  I only use it at night, and use it all over my face and neck. Been using it for about a month and hadn&#x27;t had any breakouts, which was a concern. Like others have mentioned it does have a citrus smell.  The smell reminds me of Pure Citrus Orange air freshener.</li>
    <li> I have used okay since I was 17. I have great skin and will continue to Olay until I&#x27;m in my dotage!</li>
    <li> My face has always been super oily and a little dry. I have tried products to absord and remove or reduce the oil to no avail. But this stuff seems to do the trick. I was worried the first day because i used 4 drops per directions and that was way too much, but after that i have used 2 or 3 and it is perfect. My skin stays smooth and is getting more balanced and less oily every day. Will buy again for sure, but this small bottle should last for many months.</li>
    <li> This facial oil is amazing 😍</li>
    <li> I love this product, but most of all, I love the Amazon price!

I was advised that retailers could set their own prices for the products...

    <li> As for the olay I get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Don&#x27;t really see any difference in look. Greasy but soaks in. Not worth the money at any price really</li>
    <li> great light weight face oil.</li>
