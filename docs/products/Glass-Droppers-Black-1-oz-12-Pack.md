<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> perfect for essential oils and for any other small measuring!</li>
    <li> These are ok.  Nothing to write home about.  I use these for measuring out natural oils for Hair, cooking etc.  The quality of these can use some improvement.  The glass part slips away from the bulb every time I use these.  This is annoying because it takes more time to measure simple things.  These will more than likely end up in the trash &amp; I&#x27;ll buy another brand</li>
    <li> didnt fit into any of my now food essential oil bottles :( so sad</li>
    <li> Quality is better then I hoped for</li>
    <li> Great quality...only thing that took my by surprise is that they are child proof.  Not really desirable, but, not a show stopper.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Perfect!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding the right length for the 1 oz Boston round bottles, but, here they are. The pipettes are well made and the lids and bulbs are soft and work well.</li>
    <li> I use these to mix and measure essential oil blends for lotions, roller bottles, my diffuser.</li>
    <li> not much to say other than it is as described and works good</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t fit all 1 Oz bottles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m leaving 4 stars because these do not seal the greatest but I only purchased them to get the contents out of the bottles,I put my original caps back on</li>
    <li> These droppers were just what I needed for 1 oz amber bottles I had on hand.  The droppers are good quality and they shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly for my bottles.</li>
    <li> I received this very quick and they are perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> Works great for my essential oils.  Great quality, great price for the amount you get and they are easy to clean.  The only negative thing (which is so irrelevant to me it didn&#x27;t even cost it a star) is that the tops didn&#x27;t fit right so they dont screw on to my essential oil bottles.</li>

    <li> Perfect for what I needed them for</li>
    <li> They are sturdy and strong.  Just wish they were a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought these for essential oils, and when I finally got around to using them I found they are too long and will not close onto the bottles! Oh, well, they are still nice to have.  I have to look for some shorter ones. My fault for not looking at specs to begin with.</li>
    <li> These are great glass droppers, but when you order the 1 oz. bottles to go with them, make sure you order the ones with the wider neck or larger cap size. Don&#x27;t do like I did and end up with droppers that won&#x27;t screw on the bottles because the cap size is too large.</li>
    <li> did not work for me, I have the wrong bottles and really did not think it would be a problem, the bottles look to be a standard size.  Make sure your bottle size matches.</li>
    <li> I got these are replacement droppers for the 1 and 2 ounce bottles I had ordered because I had read all the reviews and many talked about broken droppers in bottles. Well, I didn&#x27;t have any broken droppers in the bottles I ordered, but I&#x27;m keeping these anyway, just in case I break one!. No problems and exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent- fast delivery and very carefully packaged-, many thanks R maryland</li>
    <li> I use a lot of essential oils, and some of them don&#x27;t come with droppers. These work very well for my needs, although they don&#x27;t fit the really small 1/2-oz bottles. I had to find smaller droppers for those (cap size 18/400).</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Except for the screw top, these were just exactly what I needed.  I work with essential oils, and each oil needs its own dropper.  It is recommended not to leave the dropper attached to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was more than fair, and now I don&#x27;t have to wash and sanitize the one dropper I had.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how long glass tube was exactly but it was perfect for the bottles I have. Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> I received my order quickly and the droppers are new and in good condition. I use these droppers for aromatherapy. I can clean and reuse the 1 ounce glass bottles but I need to replace the droppers because they cannot be cleaned, which has created the challenge of finding only the dropper. The price is very reasonable. I am looking forward to reordering.</li>
    <li> They are great. I left them in my essential oils bottles and thrashed the original lids.</li>
