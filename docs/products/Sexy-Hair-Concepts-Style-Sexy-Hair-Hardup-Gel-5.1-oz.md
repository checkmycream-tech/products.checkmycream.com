      <li>Lets just say I am simply satisfied.</li>
      <li>Nothin&#x27; but love for this product.</li>
      <li>It works best on short hair styles.</li>
      <li>I read the description more closely and realized that this meant - and used - by people who want to spike their hair.  </li>
      <li>but my hair looks hilarious when I put this product in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked this product because it didn&#x27;t make my hair real sticky, it also washes out very easily, without leaving a residue.</li>
      <li>Easily washes out with shampoo.</li>
      <li>so I am grateful for the quick shipping!  </li>
      <li>Thanks Sexy Hair!</li>
      <li>Another great product that I have been using for the last 6-8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>A great product that lasts all day long and doesn&#x27;t give you the greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>and so glad I found it in a large size.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and haven&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>
      <li>It has excellent hold for my thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>I need some more and will try and order very soon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a very short and spikey hairstyle and have been using this gel for years now -- I love it!  </li>
      <li>This is not the hard glue that many reviewers report, but a good holding and styling gel for all lengths of hair.</li>
      <li>I think its worth it for a quality product.  </li>
      <li>and it works just as good and its not as wet looking.  </li>
      <li>I liked hair putty and have tried numerous brands gatsby</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t comb it out at night there is still some nice body left in your hair in the morning even after you comb it out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also comes right out in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it is its natural color, and is therefore very shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Holds up very will on my kids fo-hawk!</li>
      <li>and I love the blue color..</li>
      <li>After trying many different types, this hair gel works exactly the way I want a gel to work.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a long time and simply LOVE it..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much time to harden up and you can pretty much do whatever you want to with your hair.  </li>
      <li>I am a get ready in 10 minutes type of guy.  </li>
      <li>Rain really doesn&#x27;t either.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>While this gel is sticky, it&#x27;s the perfect amount of stickiness to keep my little guys&#x27;s hair spiky all day, but not flaky and too hard.  </li>
      <li>As such, I need something that will hold my hair quickly, and all day.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to friends and family.</li>
      <li>Makes my grey/black hair vivid!</li>
      <li>I chose this gel because I wanted to hold down my &amp;#34;baby hairs,&amp;#34; although I havent been a baby in a while, anywho, this product smells fresh, a little goes a long way, and I experienced no flakes.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this after I wash my hair.  </li>
      <li>This is the first hair gel that actually does what I want  </li>
      <li>like to write reviews about things that are fun, but I use this stuff literally every single day</li>
      <li>I place a small quick swirl in the palm of my right and and add just a drop or two of water and then glide my hand through my hair and in s short 20&amp;#34; I am ready to greet the world.</li>
      <li>I only have to use a small amount and the product washes out very easily</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much, holds like iron, frozen solid in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stiff enough that it works all day and easily washes out.</li>
      <li>I also have a giant, round head with shorter hair that requires some hair manipulating to not look like an original Chia Pet.  </li>

<li> The only hair gel that doesn&#x27;t cause flaking on their really dark hair half way throughout the day and really holds the style!</li>
<li> Another thing I like is no flakes from staying in to long</li>
<li> A little goes a long way so this product will last.</li>
<li> Once dry you can run your fingers through your hair and it will stay in place just the way you want it!</li>
<li> I am not completely sure why anyone would pay for the more expensive &amp;#34;Sexy Hair&amp;#34;, but this holds my hairstyle without flakes identically to the yellow-blue bottle.</li>
<li> that is something about this gel it will make your hair have the wet look which sometimes I like</li>
<li> When not available at the local salon, I find it here.</li>
<li> Well I have short hair and it was not sexy until I found this product.</li>
<li> , vo5 extreme were my favorites</li>
<li> this stuff is my go-to for extreme hold of any shape you desire.  </li>
<li> If I need it a little refreshed, I just wet my hands and apply.  </li>
<li> Mine is shoulder length, not short and not really very sexy as it is wavy and silver.</li>
<li> so sometimes I use the one in the black container</li>
<li> always looks black when I use it.  </li>
<li> You can even refresh the gel by putting a little water on your hands and restyling.  </li>
<li> Just a little dab will do it and you don&#x27;t have that look of hardness about your hair either.  </li>
<li> Not particularly fun for your mate to run his or her fingers through, because it SPIKES!, but</li>
<li> I have extremely thick hair and this gel still does the job with not much.  </li>
<li> This gives me just the hold I need without being to heavy.  </li>
<li> is that my scalp gets dried out when I use it too often.&lt;br</li>
<li> No strong smell and all it takes is a little bit though it is pricey</li>
<li> What this product has going for it that the others don&#x27;t is there is no lingering residue, it starts stiff and can still brush out.</li>
<li> This does not flake and is very very firm.</li>
<li> It holds very stiff and I guarantee your hair will not move.  </li>
<li> Rock Hard.  </li>
<li> but they tended to give a dull appearance.</li>
<li> just toss a little dab in there for max hold!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!!</li>
<li> so i have thick hair and of all the hair gel products i&#x27;ve tested this one</li>
<li> It is expensive, but it takes a very small amount to do the job.  </li>
<li> Received wrong product once again</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like this product and haven&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair spiked all day. Even when I forget and run my hands through it. And it never makes it feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This hair gel is the best I have used so far.  It doesn&#x27;t take much time to harden up and you can pretty much do whatever you want to with your hair.  Another thing I like is no flakes from staying in to long or if you sleep with it in your hair.  Three days is a stretch but overnight I added water to my hair in the morning and redid it and it looked perfect.  No strong smell and all it takes is a little bit though it is pricey I think its worth it for a quality product.  I have extremely thick hair and this gel still does the job with not much.  This is kind of shiny so sometimes I use the one in the black container and it works just as good and its not as wet looking.  Oh yeah that is something about this gel it will make your hair have the wet look which sometimes I like and sometimes I don&#x27;t.  I have brown hair and my hair always looks black when I use it.  One thing I have noticed but I have yet to determine its the gel is that my scalp gets dried out when I use it too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will be sticking with this brand over anything I can get at Wal Mart or wherever.  Try it and you might like it or you may not but I prefer it.</li>
    <li> I have fine, hard to hold hair and this holds like none other. Ir holds with weapon-like stiffness WITH OUT giving you that flakey look as the day goes on- because it hardens like steel.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel... Holds up very will on my kids fo-hawk! Thanks</li>
    <li> Makes my grey/black hair vivid! The hold is awesome! I only have to use a small amount and the product washes out very easily and I don&#x27;t even know it is in.</li>
    <li> A great product that lasts all day long and doesn&#x27;t give you the greasy feeling.  I like that it keeps my hair looking the same in the evening as it does in the morning.</li>
    <li> My husband and son use this daily and won&#x27;t use anything else. The only hair gel that doesn&#x27;t cause flaking on their really dark hair half way throughout the day and really holds the style! It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to order through amazon than any salon or beauty store and since you only have to use a tiny amount it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I got this product after using &amp;#34;Glued Styling Spiking Water Resistant Glue Unisex by Got2B&amp;#34; product and finding it too sticky for my needs.  While this gel is sticky, it&#x27;s the perfect amount of stickiness to keep my little guys&#x27;s hair spiky all day, but not flaky and too hard.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting &amp;#34;spiky hair&amp;#34; without the sticky feeling in your hair!</li>
    <li> This product is not sticky.  It keeps its hold all day.  If I need it a little refreshed, I just wet my hands and apply.  One of the best features is that it is odor free!</li>
    <li> Well I have short hair and it was not sexy until I found this product. I place a small quick swirl in the palm of my right and and add just a drop or two of water and then glide my hand through my hair and in s short 20&amp;#34; I am ready to greet the world. A little goes a long way so this product will last. 8 out of 10!</li>
    <li> My husband likes it. Very strong hold that lasts him all day, even when he&#x27;s running around at work all sweaty. This is our 2nd order and will continue when he runs out. Thanks Sexy Hair!</li>
    <li> This is the first hair gel that actually does what I want  my hair to do.  It puts me in control.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and simply LOVE it.. it works and since I never use a hair dryer anymore, this is all I need to put into my hair... and I love the blue color..</li>
    <li> My boys favorite hair product.  Stiff enough that it works all day and easily washes out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a very short and spikey hairstyle and have been using this gel for years now -- I love it!  Just a little dab will do it and you don&#x27;t have that look of hardness about your hair either.  Once dry you can run your fingers through your hair and it will stay in place just the way you want it!</li>
    <li> I have used every kind of gel out there nearly and this is the best. This does not flake and is very very firm. TRY IT OUT!!</li>
    <li> Another great product that I have been using for the last 6-8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I just toss a little dab in there for max hold!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!!</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it didn&#x27;t make my hair real sticky, it also washes out very easily, without leaving a residue.</li>
    <li> Not only do I smell like a blueberry but my hair looks hilarious when I put this product in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read the description more closely and realized that this meant - and used - by people who want to spike their hair.  I don&#x27;t spike mine; I just want to texturize it.  This product isn&#x27;t recommended for texturizing so don&#x27;t buy it if that&#x27;s what you want to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want to spike your hair - and smell like a blueberry - this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I am not completely sure why anyone would pay for the more expensive &amp;#34;Sexy Hair&amp;#34;, but this holds my hairstyle without flakes identically to the yellow-blue bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this hair gel.  After trying many different types, this hair gel works exactly the way I want a gel to work.  It holds very stiff and I guarantee your hair will not move.  It is expensive, but it takes a very small amount to do the job.  You can even refresh the gel by putting a little water on your hands and restyling.  It works best on short hair styles.</li>
    <li> This is a great product it keeps you hair in place with out looking like it is frozen in place.  If you don&#x27;t comb it out at night there is still some nice body left in your hair in the morning even after you comb it out.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;go to gel&amp;#34;...I can&#x27;t live without this after I wash my hair.  This gives me just the hold I need without being to heavy.  I get nervous when I am getting low on it so I am grateful for the quick shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wearing my hair short is great and this product keeps the spike in place beautifully.  Would highly recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Spiky.  Rock Hard.  Not particularly fun for your mate to run his or her fingers through, because it SPIKES!, but this stuff is my go-to for extreme hold of any shape you desire.  It&#x27;s the cement of the hair-styling world.  Nothin&#x27; but love for this product.</li>
    <li> This will set your hair and keep it in the style you want it. Humidity does not affect it. Rain really doesn&#x27;t either. Easily washes out with shampoo.</li>
    <li> The only thing that keeps my kid&#x27;s spikes up! We&#x27;ve used it for 8 yrs now.  But the 9 9 version. I don&#x27;t know how the 9 10 is.</li>
    <li> This is not the hard glue that many reviewers report, but a good holding and styling gel for all lengths of hair. Mine is shoulder length, not short and not really very sexy as it is wavy and silver. But it is its natural color, and is therefore very shiny and healthy. I like that this gel doesn&#x27;t build up a lot, and that a bit of water will help with styling. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m native american so i have thick hair and of all the hair gel products i&#x27;ve tested this one was the best. I like that even after a nights rest my hair looks great but i don&#x27;t make that a habit. I&#x27;m definitely sticking to this product.</li>
    <li> Great control and no flaking or &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; like effect</li>
    <li> Great!!!!!  I need some more and will try and order very soon.  Why do I need more words for this???</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 10 years and so glad I found it in a large size. It is almost the same price as the smaller tube..I will order this again ...I love it..</li>
    <li> I chose this gel because I wanted to hold down my &amp;#34;baby hairs,&amp;#34; although I havent been a baby in a while, anywho, this product smells fresh, a little goes a long way, and I experienced no flakes. Lets just say I am simply satisfied.</li>
    <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to write reviews about things that are fun, but I use this stuff literally every single day so I felt obligated.  I am a get ready in 10 minutes type of guy.  I also have a giant, round head with shorter hair that requires some hair manipulating to not look like an original Chia Pet.  As such, I need something that will hold my hair quickly, and all day.  This stuff is perfect.  Doesn&#x27;t take much, holds like iron, frozen solid in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes right out in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best gel product I have ever used and I have used a lot of them.</li>
    <li> Received wrong product once again</li>
    <li> This is a hair gel but works in your hair more like a putty and holds incredibly well. I liked hair putty and have tried numerous brands gatsby, vo5 extreme were my favorites but they tended to give a dull appearance. This gives a nice sheen to the hair and does not flake nothing. only need about a quarter sized circle if that for your short hair.</li>
    <li> If you are trying to find the best hair gel do yourself a favor and stop looking. What this product has going for it that the others don&#x27;t is there is no lingering residue, it starts stiff and can still brush out. It only comes in a 5.1oz size and from personal experience I recommend not trying to take it on the plane in your carry on.</li>
    <li> When I want to have my hair slicked back, I use this this gel. It has excellent hold for my thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t flake. When not available at the local salon, I find it here. It&#x27;s also cheaper here.</li>
    <li> On time delivery! Product meets description. Recommend!</li>
