<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unbelieveable! I have been trying to grow my hair long all my life! But it gets dry and breaks with styling. This shampoo has breathed new life into my hair! It is smooth and bouncy, and no longer dry. I am having total success In achieving my dream locks. I use the conditioner and shampoo together and would not be without it. Gonna keep buying it for as long as it works. Even the expensive salon shampoos never could do what this does. So excited with my new hair!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t do reviews, but this shampoo and conditioner its worth the review!&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of hair, curly and very fine hair. This S&amp;C did wonders for my hair. Its smoother, softer and it smelled wonderful. I used to buy very expensive ($25 per bottle) S&amp;C and i never got this results. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Shampoo because of the reviews.  I really didn&#x27;t like it.  Made my hair feel/look oily.  I have really thick long hair and around the scalp area, it just was heavy and oily feeling.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a solution to my damaged hair for quite some time.  My over 50 hair is color treated and has been looking and feeling frazzled of late.  The worst part has been that it feels stiff and brittle.  I started using this product along with its matching conditioner about a month ago.  I noticed a slight improvement after the first use.  However, after a month of washing my hair every other day with these products I see significant improvement in the look and feel of my hair.  My hair feels wonderful!  It is smooth and silky and tangle free.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I love sulfate free shampoos and this product is one of them. Biggest advantage: low price. This shampoo leaves a wonderful smell in the hair. Is it worth buying.</li>
    <li> It made my hair smooth and frizz-free.  But after a couple of weeks it made my scalp extremely itchy.</li>
    <li> I had a noticable difference in my hair after the first use, this is a for sure buy! I would deffinetely get all of the products to ensure it all works, the conditioner as well as the serum, all three of them gave me my \\&quot;noticable difference\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel soft without weighing it down. I love the Loreal brand. Also, a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need a lot to get your hair clean (like some cheaper brand shampoos).</li>
    <li> I have hair that is semi-curly sometimes and straight other times. I purchased the shampoo hoping to reduce fluff and flyways. I think it works really well. It doesn&#x27;t foam as much as normal shampoos and it rinses out really quickly. My husband even started to use it since he hates it when his hair sticks up a bit. We both use the conditioner with the shampoo and we are happy with the result.</li>
    <li> A good shampoo and smells nice (I can&#x27;t explain it. its a clean smell, not floral but salon-y) but you use a lot of product each time somehow. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again - for cheaper sulphate free shampoos look into Trader Joe&#x27;s - all of theirs are sulphate-free.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo on sale a few weeks ago and didn&#x27;t expect much.  I was pleased to see it was sulfate free as I have chemically treated hair but beyond that assumed it would just be a typical shampoo.    I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  I have noticeably softer, smoother hair whenever I use it.  It works great in conjunction with a flat iron and gives me a fresh from the stylist look.  I was so impressed I hopped on to Amazon today to buy the conditioner and smoothing serum, I can&#x27;t wait to try them out as well.    I have fairly fine hair that is mostly straight, with a few stubborn waves and curls.  This helped me smooth out my trouble spots but doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair look too thin or flat.  Go buy this product!  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I had religiously been using head and shoulders shampoo with the blue herbal essences conditioner for an uncountable number of years when I realized it just wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore and it hadn&#x27;t been for a long time. That is when I found out about sulfates and how they can be a skin irritant. I believe this could be a big part of why head and shoulders wasn&#x27;t helping my scalp at all anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a website that listed some sulfate free shampoos and conditioners which included this one and I decided to try it (if I hated it I was only out $6, that&#x27;s not too big of a commitment.)BOY am I glad I tried this! I have very thick, naturally curly, coarse hair. I have always struggled with friz and just overall bigness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got done drying my hair and I actually went downstairs to show my boyfriend a sight he had never seen before. Somehow I came away from the hair dryer NOT looking like a lioness! My hair is so smooth and straight and soft without even taking the iron to it! I can&#x27;t believe how great it feels. And it smells great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure,I had really low expectations for this shampoo. I hate to say it but I am programmed to need suds and foam to feel clean and this shampoo is neither of these things. While I was actually in the shower using the shampoo I was thinking, man this does not feel good at all, there is no way I&#x27;m going to be able to use this on a daily basis. Even the conditioner felt like there wasn&#x27;t much to it in my hands. But when you get out of the shower and dry your hair, that is where you are really going to be wowed! It is worth the not-so-fireworks in the shower I assure you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if sulfates turn out to be nothing to worry about skin-wise, I am sold on this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Para quienes tenemos el pelo reseco, para quienes se han hecho tratamientos con keratina y demás, es perfecto, deja el cabello suave y limpio. Tiene un olor muy agradable. Seguiré usándolo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the worst. My first impression of this shampoo was that it was REALLY watery. So watery to the point where I thought it was contaminated in the store. I didn&#x27;t even have to squeeze the shampoo bottle- tilted it about 45 degrees and &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; same pouring out. Since it was so watery it didn&#x27;t even feel like I had shampoo in my hair in the shower. I literally couldn&#x27;t tell if my hair was being cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to when I got out of the shower. I started to blowdry my hair and noticed a very &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; film over my hair that felt disgusting. Other Loreal hair products have done this to my hair as well. It makes the hair look oily even right after you shower. Not only was my hair feeling disgusting, the residue it left on my hair and scalp irritated my scalp and it started peeling and flaking all over. Also, my hair felt like HAY. It felt rough and was even difficult to brush through. I am never buying another L&#x27;Oreal hair product again for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Great smell, leaves hair super soft and sleek.  Also there are no sulfates, extra plus.  Only con is it isn&#x27;t so great to use every day on oily hair.  By the 3rd day I have to switch shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t get all my super oily hair clean.  If you have regular hair or dry hair than it should be fine.  I use it twice a week then use another regular shampoo and then I go back to it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon but at Target. For those who are wondering if this product is worth the money, let me start out by saying YES! Being a woman of Salvadorian and African-American decent, my hair is far from ordinary. I have curls and if my shampoo and conditioner can&#x27;t do the job, I&#x27;m pretty much screwed. My hair will stand up in a mess that resembles Gene Simmons! This, my friends, will be your best friend. When I shampooed my hair with other shampoos (Garnier, Pantene, Aussie, Suave, I tried them all!) my hair will mat up until I finally apply my conditioner. With this product, my hair will mat, in the beginning but as I work it in, I can feel a huge difference. My hair is easy to manage so when my conditioner comes into play, it&#x27;s not a war in my shower. The conditioner is also amazing. It smells great and I can completely wash it out, and not worry about my hair getting dry (when in the past, I left some of the conditioner in.) As soon as I get out of the shower, I dry it, then apply the anti-frizz serum and I can leave the house looking just like that. It&#x27;s great! My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz and it&#x27;s not goopy like the others. Lastly, I apply the leave in creme, and it leaves my hair smelling great, soft, in place and beautiful. Yes it&#x27;s sort of expensive with 7-8 dollars a bottle but once you buy them, they last and you don&#x27;t have to worry about buying hairspray, hair grease, or any of that stuff that is truly bad for your hair. Like Eva Longoria said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s my best hair yet!\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Last year, I got a Brazilian Straightening for my hair. My stylist was the one who told me to buy this shampoo line to take care of my hair afterwards. There were some higher priced sulfate free options but she said this line as just as good. This stuff is wonderful! I no longer get Brazilian straightening ( with all the hoopla about it being cancer causing) but I will not give up this product line. It makes my hair less frizzy and so soft. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I tried this and it made my hair way frizzier than it was before I used it. I hadn&#x27;t even gone outside and it was a really frizzy mess. Wierd!</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t look clean after using this shampoo and conditioner. It looked more oily than it has with most other hair products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Ever since I switched to L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate-Free shampoo and COnditioner I have loved how my hair looks and feels.  And, I do not have to wash my hair nearly as often.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always hated that dry feeling my highly processed hair gets the day after I wash it. Sure it&#x27;s normally soft for the first day but that tends to fade leaving it feeling almost crunchy. Since I began using this product (along with the conditioner) I have noticed a dramatic change in the way my hair feels 2 and even 3 days after it is washed. I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s soft and lays flat with fewer flyaways even in the hot Texas weather. It makes it so that I don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron, which is wonderful! I love my flat iron but from now on it&#x27;s for when I want my hair styled, not just everyday. I like it better than the sample of Wen I tried but I may have not used enough of the cleaning conditioner so I can&#x27;t say for sure that it works better for me. I hope my hair doesn&#x27;t get jaded with this shampoo as it does with others because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to find another one that I like as much for the awesome price!</li>
    <li> All the products of l&#x27;oreal Also this is very good and comes close to what promises but the L&#x27;oreal has better lines!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Left my hair feeling stiff and gummy, but still frizzy.  I threw this and the conditioner in the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Target on a whim when I wanted to switch to someting less expensive than Bumble &amp; Bumble. My hair is straight with a slight wave and moderately thick, but it has split ends and can be a little puffy because of the humidity where I live, so I&#x27;m interested in smooth and shine enhancement. This product seriously wowed me in that department. My hair has been very noticeably shinier and sleeker, but not heavy or lacking body. My hair honestly looks like it does in the ads, which I always assumed was only due to a good lighting designer. The only caveat is that my hair seems to get that piece-y, slightly oily appearance faster. Not full-on greasy-looking like some shampoos I&#x27;ve used, but it doesn&#x27;t look clean near the scalp after a day. I use both the shampoo and conditioner, and only condition the ends of my hair, not the down to the roots, so this seems to be from the shampoo. It&#x27;s not too much of an issue right now because I wash my hair mostly daily, but it&#x27;d be even better if that wasn&#x27;t a concern. Overall a really great product for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, fine hair that knots very easily and is extra-sensitive to sulfates, etc. This is literally the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Within two weeks of using it my long (to my lower back) hair could be combed out easily after a shower and was shiny, smooth, softer than I imagined possible, and had no frizz. I pair it with the eversleek condition or the everpure conditioner as the mood takes me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made my hair sleek and easy to brush. Definitely will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first but very surprised after using this product. It makes my hair very smooth and slick. I&#x27;m using the conditioner as well so that helps even more.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was not pleased with the product.  I have been using Hair Rules Daily Cleansing Creme, which over time has been really kind to my hair.  Unfortunately I ran out and so used this.  One time and my hair felt completely stripped and brittle and was very fly-away instead of holding curls.</li>
    <li> I would say this shampoo is very similar to Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo, it is easy on the hair and is sulfate-free. It doesn&#x27;t really make my hair much smoother for that purpose, I guess you would have to buy the conditioner for that. The shampoo itself is not heavily concentrated, so you might use more than necessary to get a good massage going. I only use this if I need to get excess oils out of my hair without wanting to actually do a \\&quot;full-on\\&quot; shampoo which usually leaves my hair dry and limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does the job well, but it&#x27;s not the best sulfate-free shampoo out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending it left and right to friends and family. I love how it makes my hair feel moisturized. I haven&#x27;t had my hair cut in two months, and I swear my hair has less split ends than normal.</li>
    <li> I have dry and brittle biracial hair. I&#x27;ve only used it once so I don&#x27;t expect dramatic results but.. COME ON. There did not seem to be any difference besides the extra frizziness I was getting.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this because I was using a Keratin straightening treatment and I needed a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to retain the keratin as long as possible. I LOVE this so much I have continued to use this even after my treatment has worn off. The one thing I did notice is that without sulfates, the natural oils your scalp produces to nourish your hair does not wash out as easily as with sulfate shampoos. However, my hair has never looked greasy or oily. I LOVE the scent. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and have even tried to talk some shampoo companies into making a fragrance-free items. However, the scent is pleasant with this brand and I have received many compliments on how &amp;#34;good I smell.&amp;#34; Always a plus. :)</li>
    <li> My hair is professionally processed, grows fast and has to be done once every 4-5 weeks to look it&#x27;s best.  I have used just about every high-end shampoo you can name with medium to good results.  I decided to give this shampoo a try and after the first use I was pleasantly surprised by the effect on my dry hair.  The frizz was down by at least half, it styled much easier,  looked the silkiest it has looked in ages and has good body.  Today is day two (I wash my hair every other day) and my hair is still bouncy, looks  freshly cleaned and still feels silky.  I used this with the EverStrong shampoo and conditioner, the EverSleek Frizz taming creme serum and my \\&quot;It&#x27;s A 10 - miracle leave-in product\\&quot; which is a must have for me and the one product I always use.  The EverSleek and EverStrong products and I are definitely enjoying a honeymoon period.  Glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Came across this shampoo and its matching conditioner at a time when I was afraid to use a brush due to hair breakage and loss. My hair just changed overnight -- curls got real tight and dry and it was like every product just got stuck in it. This shampoo washed everything out to where my fingers glided through again; the matching conditioner made it soft again and stopped the breakage after one use. I hope they always have this on the market. It is a very good product. I tried the green tubes first -- smelled like flea dip, but worked well. I returned those and settled with this one. Smells great -- a scent both guys and gals will like.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy, unruly hair that I would just flat iron in the past, but I just don&#x27;t have the time with an infant. I&#x27;ve tried several different products and methods (including no &#x27;poo), but nothing could tame my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some digging, I found that I needed something that was sulfate free and this was the product that fit in my budget. It&#x27;s fantastic - my hair has never looked better, and I can feel the difference. I used the shampoo and conditioner, along with the leave in creme, and was able to let it dry naturally without my hair exploding on my head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good to my hair</li>
    <li> The shampoo makes my hair dry, and makes it hard to really clean my hair since my hair is pretty tangled with the shampoo on.</li>
    <li> And this was on sale....figured why not.  So far so good.  Nice lather and love the smell.  Could run fingers through hair after rinsing and there is no build up in hair or scalp.  Will see how things look as time goes on.  Shame the larger sized bottles are so hard to find, I share a lot of my products with my daughters so I always have to buy two or three at a time.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that is also on the dry side and have found my hair is most manageable when I wash it 2 times a week.  Since I sometimes get Keratin treatments I prefer to use a shampoo that is sulfate free.  I was excited to see this product because it is cheaper than the Coppola Complex products I was using before.  However this shampoo makes my scalp oily after only a day so I have to wash my hair more often.  The first day after shampooing my hair is nice though, I just don&#x27;t like the oily buildup.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic!It  really smooths my thick frizzy puffy hair! It makes it shiny bouncy and smooth. Love it and highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> ...but if your hair is repaired after using this product, my daugghter prefers other products in this L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free line...particularly the ones that add volume and body.</li>
    <li> I had a severe burning sensation for at least 3 months after using this shampoo. I&#x27;m not sure if I just experienced an allergic reaction or if I actually developed seborrheic dermatitis. It felt like my head was literally on fire. I was in constant pain for at least 3 weeks and then had intermittent pain for 2 months. In addition to the pain I was also losing a significant amount of hair every time I showered. It wasn&#x27;t breakage, my seemingly healthy hair was falling out at the roots. This occurred every time I washed, brushed, and I attempted to dry my hair. I also happened to be using the EverSleek anti-frizz serum and EverStrong Shampoo in tandem with this product so I may have been mixing a dangerous cocktail of toxic hair products and applying it to my scalp almost daily. This nightmare began maybe 2 weeks after my purchase of this product and my condition was very stubborn to cure. I tried T-Gel which caused addition shedding, smelled horrible and didn&#x27;t stop the burning or remove the build-up of sebum on my roots. The only thing that finally ended the months of misery was washing my hair once with with baking soda, rinsing with apple cider vinegar and the following day sleeping with a mix of essential oils in my hair and washing it out with Pantene shampoo the following morning. What I think is absolutely horrible is that most of the people trying this product line are attempting to transition to sulfate free because it&#x27;s supposed to be better for your hair and scalp. I wish I had NEVER EVER tried this line of products. I was trying to improve the health of my hair and scalp and instead I lost about a third of my hair. If I&#x27;m careful and with a little bit of luck it may all grow back. BUT I find it upsetting that such a well known household brand would produce such a harmful product and have the gall to advertise it as better for you than the average run-of-the-mill drugstore brand shampoo. During my ordeal I scoured the internet looking up L&#x27;Oreal products and found that there are a lot of complaints similar to mine about a wide range of their products. I&#x27;ve also noticed that a lot of their products include extensive flammability warnings. Why should a non-aerosol shampoo or a sunscreen have a flammability warning? You&#x27;re applying it directly to your skin! Going forward, I will not be spending a single dime on another L&#x27;Oreal product or anything manufactured by a subsidiary company.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but it&#x27;s nothing special.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s any different than any other store bought brand that is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> great product love it</li>
    <li> I love love this shampoo! After using, my hair become soft and smooth, even without condition! My hair not easily become oily as well. There is few foam, and I need to apply more on my hair. In the future, I will choose this one for daily use! I love touch my hair.</li>
    <li> Nothing special and it smells not so good. Only used a little for the first bottle. Won&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and the conditioner. It is sulfate free which means it does not lather like shampoos with sulfate. I read several comments that it doesn&#x27;t lather and it takes a lot more shampoo than normal! That is true the sulfate is what makes other shampoos lather. After using this shampoo and conditioner I feel like my hair is softer and less frizzy. I have unruly curly hair I would not reccomond this product for someone who doesn&#x27;t have curly hair.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris products made in USA are the best in the world. If you don&#x27;t like to have a problems with your hear or skin,never buy made in the West Europe or worse is only from Russia.</li>
    <li> By far the best shampoo to use on bleached/colored hair. Doesn&#x27;t remove any color and smooths out the frizz on my bleached strands. Much better than even the Argan Oil shampoos/conditioners I bought from the speciality stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this shampoo enough. The only downside is that it smells so good, my boyfriend keeps using it and I usually run out of it before the month is over!</li>
    <li> I sent this to my sister and her color is lasting better.  She says that she also finds that she has less frizz.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this...based on some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  Picked it up at CVS (and yes, my hair does respond well in general to Sulfate-free Shampoos.)  My hair - btw - is fine, slightly wavy and cursed by frizz.  Honestly, this stuff really did nothing special.  General shampoos like Garnier were just as good.  So far, the best poo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used it Rockstar.  Though that isn&#x27;t the magic bullet I&#x27;m looking for, either.  But this?  Definitely not a recommend....</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients on the back of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s so called &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; shampoos.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate.  Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate.  Unclear as to how L&#x27;Oreal is getting away with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER spent 6.99 on a shampoo. I&#x27;m a SUAVE or VO5 gal. Well, I&#x27;ve upgraded to conditioner in Tresumee. But this shampoo, I tried tonight, my GOSH. My hair feels AMAZING. I&#x27;ve very active. I run, grapple, wrestle, dot/teach MMA etc.. I&#x27;m hoping to try this out for until I use it all. Upon my first use, I LOVE it</li>
    <li> This has a terrible strong perfume. I had to shampoo it with a different shampoo after it was all dry because my husband and I could not stand the perfume odor. The shampoo and conditioner both have this same fragrance. It&#x27;s such a shame because my hair did feel nice and soft but I don&#x27;t want perfume in my hair. I have tried many brands and only had this problem once before.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 3 months and I love it. I have straight hair and this works pretty well for it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  No extra un-needed additives.  Leaves my hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> My 2nd favorite of the &amp;#34;Ever&amp;#34; line from L&#x27;Oreal (after EverCreme)... I just wish it was a little thicker so it wouldn&#x27;t run through my fingers before I get a chance to massage it in.  Smells good!</li>
    <li> I thought this would make my hair feel softer but the shampoo is clear and I have to use a lot of it to get my hair to accept it.  Works ok but I think i&#x27;ll search for something that makes a more significant impact.  I had tried the pink-colored one in this line (cant remember the name of the scent...I think it&#x27;s juniper &amp; mint) so I think i&#x27;ll go back to that or try a completely different shampoo.</li>
    <li> Better than the other keratin products I have used.  Makes my hair silky but not oily.  Loved all the Loreal products for smoothing</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this shampoo. Like, really. I waited to write a review for about 6 weeks into using the reparative shampoo and conditioner and the leave in cream. The curls I get are gorgeous and BUT my hair feels like hay and the WORST part.. I have SERIOUS dandruff. Now, I&#x27;ve NEVER had dandruff before. Maybe some dry scalp when I was a teenager but nothing like this. I went from a perfectly healthy scalp to what I can only compare to when my kids were babies and had cradle cap. It&#x27;s horrible. It&#x27;s obviously just my hair type as I read every review in history before buying, lol. Good luck!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something without sulfites... this product might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is lighter in effect and does not leave a heavy residual in your hair. Better for fine hair???&lt;br /&gt;May be better for sensitive scalps as well..... I have not fully come to that conclusion yet,but it does seem to be less irritating.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with several different shampoos that make my scalp break out.  Last year I discovered that Aveeno&#x27;s sulfate free shampoo didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts...but I wasn&#x27;t in love with how my hair felt so when I saw Loreal&#x27;s line of new sulfate free shampoos I tried them out.  The one in the green bottle worked well for me but this one did not.  After using it for two days my scalp was beginning to break out more and more, switched back to my old shampoo and it cleared up in no time....my search continues for the right shampoo, this definitely isn&#x27;t it!</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves my hair dryeven when I used the conditioner. When I dried it, it was frizzy and the volume was overdone,</li>
    <li> I tried this out as an alternative to my favorite conditioner.  It didn&#x27;t do a thing.  I have long, wavy, dry hair and this left my hair very dry and tangled.  I had to use my normal conditioner to fix it.  Can&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Love it, is one of the few I can use due to allergies</li>
    <li> I buy this from my local store. I will never use another shampoo or conditioner on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product.  Every styling issue I have ever had with my hair is GONE, and I see a major improvement in my hair from a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on how healthy it looks and people are astonished I dye my hair every month and it still looks his way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cant beat the price for perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!:)</li>
    <li> Not all that thrilling for me - doesn&#x27;t do anything &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s ok.  I like it because of the lack of sulfates but other than that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything very exciting for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo daily, but when I do I use this and it keeps my hair color staying true longer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Black. My wife is Puerto Rican/Irish. Kids are mixed. This works great for all of us! You may be interested in purchasing it because you&#x27;d like to go sulfate free but, there&#x27;s a surprise inside. This also contains no MEA, DEA, or TEA. All of these are dangerous ethanolamines. I&#x27;m not going to preach to you here. Look it up for yourself and see what they can do to your brain. That way you&#x27;ll own the information in your own mind. I will include three addresses to the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[1]]] http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0044/0901b80380044789.pdf?filepath&#x3D;amines/pdfs/noreg/111-01388.pdf&amp;fromPage&#x3D;GetDoc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[2]]] http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0044/0901b803800447ea.pdf?filepath&#x3D;amines/pdfs/noreg/111-01401.pdf&amp;fromPage&#x3D;GetDoc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[3]]] http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_017d/0901b8038017d302.pdf?filepath&#x3D;amines/pdfs/noreg/111-01375.pdf&amp;fromPage&#x3D;GetDoc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are products I use, and have reviewed, with this item.

    <li> My hairdresser recommended I switch to sulfate free shampoos to improve the condition of my hair. The price was right so I gave this a try. Immediate results, my hair was smoother and less frizzy. I can run my fingers through my hair and not come away with multiple broken strands. I on my second tube and hair is getting better and better. Recommend.....</li>
    <li> I just recently switched to the sulfate free hair care as I was tired of other products overdrying my hair. This line is the best so far. I&#x27;ve been a long time L&#x27;Oreal customer, and as usual this product does not disappoint. I have a lot of very thick, wavy and somewhat coarse hair, and I heat style almost daily. This whole line of products is perfect for my hair. The texture and feel of my hair just keeps getting better, and it seems to be getting easier to get a good straight style with the flat iron. I expect to stay with this shampoo, and this whole line for a while. Especially because the price is so reasonable on Amazon!</li>
    <li> unless your hair is dry and damaged, using this frequently might make your hair oily.  I have a problem with dryness and frizz, resulting from graying hair, I believe.  I used this in conjunction with the conditioner and it helps if I don&#x27;t use it too often.  I use another less moisturizing product in between and it seems like I have hit the right balance.</li>
    <li> May be sulfate free but has other harsh, drying chemicals and additives</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, although the last two shipments I received seemed more watery than normal.  Not sure if it was a problem with the supplier or if L&#x27;Oreal has changed their production.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s sulfite free and definitely feel like it&#x27;s better for my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a shampoo that contains sulfites - it may take awhile to get used to when making the switch from typical shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love this sulfate and silicone free shampoo! It lathers nicely and makes washing my curly hair a breeze!</li>
    <li> wonderful sulfate free shampoo that won&#x27;t make your fizzy. Your hair will just look beautiful.</li>
    <li> It sounded great until I tried it&gt; It made my hair curlier and way frizzier than before. I have beautiful long but thin and naturally wavy hair. I was looking for something that would add volume and shine while controlling the frizz, since I live in a humid region. This product was not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the matching conditioner and the pair left my hair dull, dry and frizzy. Couldn&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;m going back to my Neutrogena Clean Volume shampoo (purchased from Amazon)and Dove Intensive Repair conditioner (grocery store). Until I find something better...</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not have *any* lather. I have used the other varieties (red, green) of L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate-Free shampoos and never had any issues with a lack of lather. But this shampoo was awful. I used it for a week and threw it away.</li>
    <li> Wife was initially using this shampoo but I ended sticking with it since it completely solved my problem of dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of l&#x27;Oreal hydrating shampoos in the past and this one is the best!</li>
    <li> The only reasons I bought this is it had great reviews, it was a great price and it&#x27;s SULFATE-FREE which is the only kind of shampoo for hair that&#x27;s had a Brazilian Blowout treatment. It&#x27;s a brand I think I can trust and it will last a long long time only washing once a week.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo as well as the L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate-Free conditioner for my graying hair.  It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and I really do like the product.  I&#x27;ve using it now for about 3 months and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s line of sulfate free shampoos and conditioners. That&#x27;s an absolute must for me. I have thick hair that&#x27;s prone to some frizziness. This product definitely helps to tone down the level of frizziness and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> my hair after washing are soft (I didn&#x27;t use a balm). too liquid, it does not take into Luggage</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It arrived on time. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I normally use this shampoo on my extentions and its the best shampoo ever. leaves my hair feeling better than it did when i brought it from the store. i also used it on my natural hair and it&#x27;s a great conditioner. LOVE IT MUST BUY :)for best result purchase conditioner also.</li>
    <li> I was using Aveda products and was reasonably happy with the results (not the price), but then I tried this and - WOW! What a difference! Suddenly my hair is smooth, shiny, silky and so easy to wash, dry and style. I have a blond weave, so my thick, wavy,  fine hair tends to be dry and frizzy, but that is now a thing of the past. My only complaint is the packaging. I would love to find this product in a big, pump container. When the tube is nearly empty, it is impossible to get the remaining shampoo out - so I cut off the end and let it drain into a cup overnight - and I wind up with enough shampoo for two more washings.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, super damaged and overly chemical treated hair. I already tried many kinds of shampoos but none of them can rescue my hair! I saw this one that is sulfate free so I just wanted to give it a try to see is there any different compared to regular shampoos. To my surprise, this shampoo really made a huge different and it works wonders to rescue my hair along with the conditioner of the same line! It has a really nice light smell! The only problem I have with this bottle&#x27;s  design is it&#x27;s hard to get the shampoo left in the bottle when it&#x27;s nearly empty. I hope L&#x27;oreal will come up with a bigger bottle design rather than just this smaller size and with pump so it would be easier.</li>
    <li> I usually use this shampoo after I have used Paul Mitchell Awapuhi. I have short thick hair. This shampoo does a great job of smoothing and conditioning and I don&#x27;t usually use a conditioner after I use this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;But I do believe that it does add to static. Use a serum once you shampoo with it to tame down the static.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair all frizzy, not a great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend and she&#x27;s been using it for couple of weeks now and is happy with it. I don&#x27;t know much about this shampoos and stuff but she hasn&#x27;t complained yet so I guess it&#x27;s a good shampoo. I believe she&#x27;s going to reorder again.</li>
    <li> It does not wash my hair very well even though i always wash it twice before putting on the conditioner. My hair already gets oily the next day. Maybe I just need a stronger product. The smell is not very mild. Their conditioner works great though!</li>
    <li> I treat me hair with a brazilian blow out and I can&#x27;t shampoo it with a regular shampoo it has to be sulfate free. This shampoo does a great job in mantaining my hair sleek and smooth cleaning it very well!  I would recomend it :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dislike this, I just like other L&#x27;Oreal products much better.  Will likely not repurchase, but will definitely use other products in the &amp;#34;Ever&amp;#34; line (like the EverPure).</li>
    <li> this one is pretty goog , such like what I bought in the real store. I do recommend this one to you. try it, come on!</li>
    <li> My hair feels healthier, and I love the scent. But, I have thick hair, and I have to use a TON of this to get my hair clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo my naturally curly hair, love it my curls form very easily after washing and conditioning.  In comparison I bought the cleansing conditioner from the blue evercurl line and I hate it.  My hair was left dry and dull looking.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, can go a few days in between washings, and my hair stays soft and bouncy!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo so much! I am a woman with very, very thick hair. It&#x27;s so hard to wash and rinse my hair because of it. My scalp is very prone to buildup and even the smallest amount of shampoo would leave residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the very first time I tried L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek I noticed a marked improvement in my hair and scalp. After about a week of using this shampoo, I had almost no residue and my hair was shiny. Now, about a month or so after first use, my hair is still shiny and I have no more residue problems! I am now able to condition my hair with the EverSleek conditioner, too. (I only need to use it about twice per month since the shampoo already leaves my hair soft and shiny on its own!)</li>
    <li> I do keratin treatment. So I must use a sulphate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Price wise and quality: perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I frequently buy either this or some olther shampoo from this same line.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good. My husband comments every time I use it. Works well too.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have tried many products to deal with my thick, curly and coarse hair. Some worked better than others. I do like the &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; line, but sometimes it&#x27;s a little expensive in my humble opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I recently tried Evercreme and thought it was okay. However, I like L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s products as a whole, so, I decided to give this a shot after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I find something else that&#x27;s better and within my budget--this does it for me. On my first use my hair is shinier, bouncier and much straighter than it has ever been when I fix it on my own. It looks like how my hair looks when I get a professional blow out, and I have never been able to replicate salon results even though I have tried for years. I used this along with the conditioner. I then blow dried my hair and sprayed it with the Organix flat iron spray. After that, I ran through it with my straight iron, and curled it a bit with my curling iron. I wish I had tried it sooner is all I have to say...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveda for years!  Just saw a girlfriend of mine before Christmas.  She has long, naturally curly hair that usually looks dull and frizzy.  Her hair was shiny, and the curls hung beautifully.  I asked her what she was doing different with her hair and she told me she stopped using hair products with Sulfate in them and recommended the L&#x27;oreal Sulfate Free line. When I got home I read the ingredients on all my Aveda products- shampoos, conditioners and styling products- ALL of them contain SULFATE, so I ran up to the store and purchased the L&#x27;oreal Sulfate Free Shampoo &amp; Cond.  I definitely noticed a significant difference after only one use.  I am off Aveda for good and switching to Sulfate free!! I&#x27;m also excited about all the money I will save as the L&#x27;oreal Sulfate free line is HALF the price of the Aveda Brilliant conditioner and shampoo I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the Sulfate Free brand you choose and the brand that works best for your hair- SULFATE FREE is the way to go for gorgeous, shiny, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  It takes about a week of use to start seeing HUGE results and differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After several months my hair started to get really limp and EXTREMELY Dry!!!  I have stopped using this product and gone back to Professional shampoos and conditioners.  I am liking the Brocato products and Paul Mitchell Awaphui &amp; Wild Ginger.</li>
    <li> Daughter has curly hair, dry on ends and scalp is greasy. She loves it and it makes her hair look so healthy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes me hair look shiny and sleek without a heavy weigh down or greasy feeling.  makes my thick hair feel nice and light after I heat style--No problems here.</li>
    <li> Tried it because it&#x27;s on the Subscribe &amp; Save program.  Using both the shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s low suds and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s even doing anything for my hair and my hair is still frizzy after use. I&#x27;ll be going back to my previous choices.</li>
    <li> I have very course hair and this really helps smooth it out. It has a nice foam and I&#x27;m very happy that its sulfate free.</li>
    <li> This is one of the first shampoo and conditioner that has worked on my frizzy hair. The conditioning shampoo is even better than this one. But you have to use both for results for thick frizzy hair. Great for everyday use. The price is so much better than all those others that are sulfate free and they work the same. Has to do with non-sulfate ingredient.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle. I would typically switch brands a few times a year as the affects would seem to wear off after a while or I would get bored with the product. I find this conditioner to be on par with or better than those products. I have now been using this conditioner exclusively (or others from this same line) for over a year and I have abandoned all other brands. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo (and the conditioner) and think both are a good value for the money.  The scent is pleasant and my hair really does seem smoother and more manageable.  This line has made a believer out of me when it comes to sulphate free products.  Keep in mind that this shampoo will not lather to the extent that some others do - but it&#x27;s getting your hair clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (with the conditioner) for a few months now.  It worked well for awhile (maybe a month or two), but now I have horrible buildup every time I use it.  I find myself having to clarify every other day, because it won&#x27;t rinse out properly, so my scalp doesn&#x27;t get clean.  I have even rubbed baking soda into my scalp to remove the buildup a couple times, but it instantly comes back the next time I shampoo.  Using the conditioner on the ends works fine, so I&#x27;ll keep using that with a new shampoo.</li>
    <li> Being a guy with bleached hair &amp;#34;by bleached I mean white like a snow&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m always looking for products that wont dull my blond, and this is it. Ever sense I began using this product i notice my hair is softer, stronger and my blond looks fresh dyed for 2-3x longer. So this is a must for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I love that it is sulfate free!  The only that I don&#x27;t like is that it seems that I have to use more of the shampoo than other shampoos to get throughout all of my hair.  I assume that&#x27;s part of going sulfate-free.</li>
    <li> This product just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It really weighs your hair down and makes it hard to manage.  I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the product either.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product.  Very kind  to my aging hair and leaves it feeling soft.  My hair has much more body.  L&#x27;Oreal is an excellent company and this is a fine product.</li>
    <li> this is one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used at first it seemed to make my hair very smooth then after a while it completely dried out my scalp and left  ENDLESS FLAKES,SCALES,AND PSORIASIS LIKE PATCHES all around my hairline my hair is naturally dry but this stuff makes it 10 times worse my scalp has never been this bad ever idk why it&#x27;s so drying since it has no sulfates or parabens but this shampoo is horrible I will never ever buy it again if you want hydrated, healthy, beautiful hair, don&#x27;t buy this crap it&#x27;s garbage buyer beware!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a nice shampoo to start my transitioning and this seems to be the perfect product! It takes away the dirt while leaving my hair feeling extremely soft and moisturized. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I wish I had known this product before. It leaves my hair moisturized and soft. I&#x27;ve got very dry, coarse hair which I treat with Brazilian Keratine. A friend recommended this product and now I&#x27;m totally hooked!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo and conditioner after reading several positive reviews. However, after using this for a few weeks, my hair is more dry and less manageable than before. Initially, I really liked the set, but i have been noticing a lot more dryness now, and am not happy with the prolonged result.</li>
    <li> This shampoo left a residue in my hair that formed clumps. When I tried to remove the clumps a small chunk of hair came out. Left my scalp dry itchy and flaky and that stopped the minute I changed shampoo and conditioner. Used it for 2 months. Get a sample before buying. It is a bad product. Left my hair dull and brittle.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and can not always find it.  I usually get it at Wal-Mart, but they are sometimes out of this one.  I have set this one up on subscribe and save so I get a couple every 2 months.  If you are not using sulfite free shampoo; you need to get this; you hair will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfites in shampoo such as sodium lauryl sulfate caused itchy scalp and hair loss.</li>
