### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Fits perfect around 14 oz wax pot.</li>
      <li>These are perfect for the GiGi 14oz warmer!</li>
      <li>Excellent value too.</li>
      <li>Fits Gigi&#x27;s perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great value for money.</li>
      <li>So, it does the job but its not the perfect fit.</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>These collars were a good price.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I like the price &amp; product is also good as well.</li>
      <li>These fit great on almost any warmer.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>Great price and came quickly.</li>
      <li>Leaves my wax warmer nice and clean every time!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it comes with a pack of 50.</li>
      <li>I bought these last month and they are just perfect for beginners like me.</li>
      <li>They fit perfectly on the regular size cans of wax, 14oz cans.</li>
      <li>It does its&#x27; job by keeping the wax warmer clean because these collars prevent the wax from dripping on top of the warmer.</li>
      <li>Fine.</li>
      <li>However, the container does fit in the wax warmer.</li>
      <li>Works well with Suddenly Smooth brand wax.</li>
      <li>Its a cheap buy.</li>
      <li>And for every waxer, you know how important these are to have.</li>
      <li>Very useful.</li>
      <li>Good for the price...just make sure u place them flat..maybe put something heavy on them...</li>
      <li>I need to always rip a little in order to adjust it to fit perfectly on the inner end.</li>
      <li>I would suggest making one yourself or spending more for a wider inner hole to fit on warmer and thicker edges to avoid spillage.</li>
      <li>they do their job just right</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of thickness and fits 14 oz wax.</li>
      <li>so when taking it off a cream it tears right away.</li>
      <li>, they feel a bit flimsy but they work just fine will definitely reorder</li>
      <li>They are unbranded and more sleek than ones with logos on them.  </li>
      <li>Very helpful product.</li>
      <li>Glad I opted for this instead of the more expensive brand name ones.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>But, if you&#x27;re ok with losing a few and adjusting it, go for it.</li>
      <li>Specially for beginners like me who are beginning to learn to wax and can mess around with the wax.</li>
      <li>So, I am not highly impressed with its fitting because I assumed it would be exactly the same as the collar that came with my GiGi wax warmer, since thats what a few people have reviewed.</li>

<li> Not a whole lot to say here</li>

<li> wide to avoid ruining the warmer and heavy duty so you can lift the wax out with the collar.</li>
<li> Helps keep the wax from dripping everywhere an making a mess.</li>
<li> Got a lot for a little bit of money.</li>
<li> What else can you say about a piece of round cardboard?</li>
<li> if they do not fit they can be cut or torn and then slipped onto the warmer.</li>
<li> The material itself is too think, it is not able to stick well on the waxing can like another brand</li>
<li> Too small for Gigi wax warmer</li>
<li> bend easy..not terribly thick</li>
<li> Fits just as well as the name brand and much less expensive.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard with these as they are so thin.</li>
<li> Annoying to have tear for wax pot</li>

    <li> Too small for Gigi wax warmer so when taking it off a cream it tears right away. I try to reuse them when not sticky and it&#x27;s hard with these as they are so thin. I would suggest making one yourself or spending more for a wider inner hole to fit on warmer and thicker edges to avoid spillage.</li>
    <li> Fits just as well as the name brand and much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Annoying to have tear for wax pot</li>
    <li> These were not the standard size.</li>
    <li> I see that a lot of people said it fits the GiGi wax warmer, which it does. However, I bought the cripeli blue wax and it does not fit well around that tin container. However, the container does fit in the wax warmer. So, it does the job but its not the perfect fit. I need to always rip a little in order to adjust it to fit perfectly on the inner end. Sometimes, they end up ripping on me, though. So, I am not highly impressed with its fitting because I assumed it would be exactly the same as the collar that came with my GiGi wax warmer, since thats what a few people have reviewed. But, if you&#x27;re ok with losing a few and adjusting it, go for it. Its a cheap buy.</li>
    <li> Got a lot for a little bit of money. And for every waxer, you know how important these are to have. They fit perfectly on the regular size cans of wax, 14oz cans.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my GiGi wax warmer. I bought this because I like the price &amp; product is also good as well.</li>
    <li> It is sturdy enough to hold the wooden sticks. Fits perfect around 14 oz wax pot.</li>
    <li> Fine. No problems. Fits the Gigi warmer. wide to avoid ruining the warmer and heavy duty so you can lift the wax out with the collar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad it comes with a pack of 50. Very useful. It does its&#x27; job by keeping the wax warmer clean because these collars prevent the wax from dripping on top of the warmer.</li>
    <li> Nice. Fits the 14oz waxes. They are not flimsy. They are as they are stated. Overall does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the GiGi 14oz warmer!</li>
    <li> Leaves my wax warmer nice and clean every time!</li>

    <li> These collars were a good price. The collars do the job.. What else can you say about a piece of round cardboard?</li>
    <li> Work well, as intended.  Good quality.</li>
