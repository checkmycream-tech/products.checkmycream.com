    <li> My favorite shampoo of all time!!! I have tried every brand out there-drugstore, Target, salon... All of them. I&#x27;m a product queen, and I love trying new stuff. This shampoo is perfect for my oily scalp and dry, color-treated, highlighted ends. Smells amazing. Pair it with Drench conditioner for awesome movement and shine.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend. I used it for just one week and enjoyed an outstanding improvement in my hair. Also, the customer service at this company was way above and beyond the norm! Way to go! I am a customer for life now!</li>

I love how this shampoo seems to pull all of that buildup off my hair without making it feel dry and how light my hair feels afterwards. It isn&#x27;t something I like to use all the time as it does nothing for the wave in my hair but it is a great in between, cleaning shampoo for me.</li>
