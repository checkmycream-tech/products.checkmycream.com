<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have naturally tightly curly hair but generally wear it straight. I&#x27;ve had generally positive experiences using it as a regular conditioner when wearing my hair curly. Absolutely love it as a daily for when I will have my hair blow dried straight, great moisture without feeling greasy, good for keeping hair from drying out. I&#x27;m pretty sure I purchased it for about $22 at the local CVS though, so am disappointed in Amazon&#x27;s price here.</li>
    <li> I was quite disappointed when I received this shipment.  I never have any problems with Amazon or Davines products. When I received the product it literally was only half full!  Keep in mind, I understand that the nourishing mask is never topped off.  I have ordered this product multiple times and I know it settles to about 3/4 full but this shipment was at half.  On a brighter note, the product itself is amazing as well as the quickness of shipping..I was just disappointed in the amount for this go-around.</li>
    <li> At last, I&#x27;ve found a product that works for my hair on a longterm basis! I&#x27;ve been using this as my regular daily conditioner for months now with great success. I have very fine, dry, color-treated curly hair and I need something with a lot of moisture and a little weight to it, to keep my curls in good shape. I love the way this product detangles my hair and leaves it feeling conditioned but not overly heavy and greasy. Truly I&#x27;ve not found another conditioner in years that has worked as well as this one. Even though it&#x27;s a little pricey, one container will last me for about 3 months making it well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love Davines products. I use the Naturetech Shampoo and Vegetarian Conditioner regularly. I bought this NouNou Repairing Mask to keep my curls healthy. I have long, curly hair. My strands are on the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; side, although I have a lot of hair so it&#x27;s considered &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; and I have a lot of volume. However, as any curly hair girl knows, the longer it gets the drier the ends get and more susceptible to breakage so treating you hair with a nourishing mask can be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use NouNou, I skip regular conditioner and just go straight to the mask after shampooing. I leave it in for about 5-10 mins, then rinse. NO TANGLES! I was amazed how easy my comb glided through my wet hair after I washed it. As it dried, it was very soft and manageable. I love this stuff. I will leave it in longer next time as I think once a week, a good 20-30 min mask would go a long way.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick, long wavy hair that is prone to frizz.  Lately it has been so dry out and my hair has begun to feel like straw.  Normally I don&#x27;t like to put leave in conditioners in my hair since it tends to look weighed down very easily.  I left this product in my hair for 20 minutes before my shower and the results just from one use are amazing!!  Baby soft and untangled.  This stuff also smells a little like dish soap or hand soap but oddly enough I love the smell, it just smells clean and not overpowering.  If my hair is going to be pulled up all day, I would definitely put this in my hair...it worked fabulously just after 20 min.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair repair mask for years and just love it. I have color treated hair and I also am out in the sun a lot during the summer so this is my go to to keep my hair nice and smooth and shiny. It is thick so you only need to use a little and it is a little more expensive, but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is very very good hair mask. The problem was with the packing and shipping. It came with several other items and was so poorly packed it had cracked and leaked on the other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called Amazon to inform them of this no effort was made to remedy the error, either by replacement or credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed in Amazon&#x27;s response to difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order it elsewhere in the future.</li>
    <li> I’m going through a hair recovery phase, and this conditioner amazing. My hair has experienced serious trauma through regular coloring, highlighting, and heat styling. This mask has made a huge different in the health of my hair. After a month of weekly treatments, I can air-dry my hair without it turning into a frizzy and unruly mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback (besides the hefty price tag) is the packaging. The application can get messy in the shower. But, the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> I once heard that Jen Aniston uses this. My hair is not the same without it. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is a mess. It frizzes if you even say the word \\&quot;humidity.\\&quot; It has been an issue that has stopped us from going on walks at night, getting in the hot tub, and doing many of the things we love. She tried so many different products she had given up, until a new hair-dresser recommended this product. Rather than buying it in the salon we ordered it here. It has lasted her about two and a half months and has been a miracle for us. She doesn&#x27;t have to do her hair nearly as often now (a two hour process) and has enabled us to spend much more time together. It has been worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I really like the NouNou shampoo and conditioner, and thought my long, fine, blond-tinted-copper hair could benefit from weekly moisture. Boy, was I disappointed! Not only does this mask not do anything for frizzy ends, it actually STRIPPED my color. My hair was noticeably blonder after one single use of this conditioner (as in, my husband asked if I&#x27;d lightened my hair). Sadly, it was NOT noticeably softer, smoother, or healthier. I also tried it as a leave-in conditioner, as other reviewers suggested, and found it just left my hair stiff, tacky, and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular NouNou conditioner is far, far better at keeping my hair healthy. As a rinse-out or leave-in, it performs where this one fails completely. AND it doesn&#x27;t strip my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works well, but as pricey as it is, not very wowed. Least favorite product of this incredible line so far.</li>
    <li> I have had frizzy, coarse hair for most of my life. Nothing worked. No amount of conditioning did anything. All the professional hair stylists recommended all these different shampoos which just dried out my hair more. All the conditioners they recommended just made my hair feel nice while it was wet and then when it dried it would poof again. This stuff is great. I get my hair wet, towel dry, then comb it in. I leave it in for 15 minutes, wash it out, and I&#x27;m set for a few days to a week. Now when my hair dries it stays smooth, and doesn&#x27;t get all frizzy unless I really work out hard and sweat a lot. I&#x27;m actually able to wear longer styles now and I&#x27;ve actually received compliments. They say they like the way it&#x27;s cut, but really, it&#x27;s this stuff that is behind it all. No matter how I cut it before, it always looked crummy. If you have dry or frizzy hair get this. I have tried every dry/frizzy hair fix you can think of and it&#x27;s all a joke compared to this. Girls have been way more enjoyable to flirt with. Everyone says I look better overall.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair which I have colored about 3 x a year. I started using this product as a recommendation from my hairdresser due to the fact that my hair was dry and I had split ends. This mask is amazing at rehydrating hair and keeping hair from drying out. I actually use it daily after I shampoo for soft defined curls. I don&#x27;t even own a comb or brush my hair. All I do is shower, apply a small amount of the mask to lengths and ends and finish off with Davines Absolute Beautifying Potion. I get complimented on my curls all the time now and love the feel and look of my hair. I started with this 8 ounce jar (which has lasted 5 months) and have now purchased the 1 L presentation.  TWO THUMBS UP!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where or when this product went so wrong. After reading all the reviews I was INCREDIBLY excited to get it and try it out. However, it is TERRIBLE. It looks great and smells great, but the moment I put it in my hair, it turns into a tacky mess that I can&#x27;t get my fingers through. Even after washing it out thoroughly, I am incapable of running my hands through my hair. After trying this product out three separate times, I have given up and am so sad to have wasted my money. Every time I have had to wash it out with my normal Herbal Essences &amp;#34;Long Term Relationship&amp;#34; conditioner to actually be able to run my hands through my hair without it feeling tacky and dry and disgusting. My hair wasn&#x27;t even particularly damaged before (just naturally dry and some split ends in my longer layers) but after using this &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; it felt DISGUSTING. Based on the other reviews, it seems like the product I was sent was faulty (bought it from seller crystalo*de*neve who is pretty unhelpful - watch out!). Anyway... try at your own risk. I wish it had worked for me!</li>
    <li> I researched SO many different deep conditioners. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the &amp;#34;salon price&amp;#34; to get my hair conditioned. I use this product at least once a week. I leave it on my hair with a plastic cap, for 1 hr &amp; 30 minutes or sometimes more. I usually just rinse it out in the sink. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now &amp; I love it! It makes my hair feel so soft. My hair was very dry and brittle from highlights. I also purchased the Argan Oil by Arvazilla. I use that before blow drying my hair.</li>
    <li> We use this to manage static and fly-aways in addition to nourishing our hair. A little goes a very long way, we don&#x27;t use much but seems to last us - my daughter and I - for many months. I&#x27;ve been using for over ten years and this is only my second tub. BUT, I don&#x27;t use it everyday or even every week.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair conditioner i use. You only need a wee little for each shampoo. I then rinse it out and put two pea size all over my hair when i get out of the shower, a perfect leave in conditioner. I highly recommend this product. I have naturally curly hair, and i can not go back to any other product! But the lady who had me try this, she has straight hair. So it&#x27;s for any hair type. Just try it. and again you only use a little each time. 5 star.</li>
    <li> My hair is very Soft Now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times before and do not believe this to be the correct item.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the packaging read NouNou, the product I received was peach in color not green as expected. Thinking Davines may have changed their product color, I opened it and it did not smell the same (not unpleasant, just completely different &amp; floral).&lt;br /&gt;Tried it this morning and definitely did not perform either.  Not sure if the product went &#x27;bad&#x27; or was mis-labeled, but definitely not NouNou.&lt;br /&gt;Unhappy to have paid so much and received the wrong item.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair conditioner I have ever used and I have tried many! It feels like butter when you put it on your hair &amp; smells wonderful! It leaves hair feeling very soft and manageable. You will never want to use anything else. Thank you for the speedy shipment!</li>
    <li> Was pretty excited to use this product.  It really didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair feel any better than the cheap stuff you can buy at the drug store.  Oh well</li>
    <li> Found my hair to be softer after first use. Really like using this product</li>
    <li> You might think because it is a mask, that it&#x27;s heavy and weighs the hair down.  I always have a problem with flat hair because my hair is thin.  I avoid conditioner because of this.  This products actually adds body and when I blow my hair our, it is far from flat.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, left my hair silky n looking healthy- will be buying again - I am recommending to friends</li>
    <li> Love this deep conditioner. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it even if your hair is long (mine&#x27;s about 6 inches longer than shoulder-length). I use it about 2 times a week and it keeps my hair conditioned and protects it from the dryness of winter. Definitely worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended this line to me when I asked about hair care products that would prevent my hair from breaking and help make it stronger. I 100% trust his advice and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> I dont think it did anything more then a regular conditioner. I have been using loreal and its much better then this. Plus I felt like you need to put on a lot so that it actually nourishes your hair.</li>
    <li> I swim and have highlighted aging hair, so my hair can get really dry and damaged.  With the right care, which includes weekly application of this product after a cleansing clarifying shampoo, my hairdresser said she would never know I swim.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure what it repairs... LOL but it is very nice for a leavin.  It moisturizes a lot.  I have 3C/4A hair and my hair usually drinks product... This lasted a bit longer... But to be honest good old Herbal Essence Hello Hydration works better and is about $15 cheaper.</li>
    <li> This conditioner did work quite well on my long, dry, damaged curly hair, but for the price and amount of product I&#x27;ve found better.  I was really on the fence about the smell.  I liked that it was earthy and not that typical fake perfume-y smell that most hair products have, but the intensity of the scent lingered for a little too long and was a little musky in a weird way.</li>
    <li> This is MY HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT OF DEEP CONDITIONER&#x27;S! This is very concentrated , my hair is medium thick and down to my waist , I only need about 1.5-2 Tblspns of NouNou Pak to attain soft as SILK hair ,not to mention shiny ,lustrous hair. Yes the kind you see in ad campaigns. I do leave on for at least 5 mins , and use only 1 x a week. We all respond differently to products , but THIS Mask I will NEVER using! I love the relaxing herbal smell as well.</li>
    <li> Works so well!! This was $5 cheaper than buying it from the salon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner that leaves my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the reviews were really good and I had hoped it would do my dry hair wonders- but it really isn&#x27;t that impressive in comparison to my usual buy- the Kerastase deep conditioning mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has kind of a strange smell that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. I think this is probably a good enough product for some people, but if you&#x27;re going to spend the money there are deep conditioners that work better.</li>
    <li> I have a autoimmune condition that has caused my hair to become a bit dry and brittle and Davines NouNou repairing mask was recommended by a friend in the industry. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks and it has helped my hair look much healthier without weighing it down. I left the first application on for a little over an hour and since have left it on for 30 mins weekly with great results. I also use Davines Love Shampoo and Conditioner but felt that my hair needed something richer from time to time and the NouNou mask fit that role perfectly.</li>
    <li> So Great for the hair, it works to me, i recomend this product for all the people with damaged hair</li>
    <li> Bunny soft hair! Wet ur hair, put it on-especially on the ends, clip it up &amp; put on a shower cap. I usually leave it on for an hour-45 min (the shower cap keeps the moisture so it doesn&#x27;t dry) &amp; rinse off in the shower. I have to use shampoo on my roots b/c my hair is fine/oily, but after my hair dries, it&#x27;s very very soft &amp; smooth!</li>
    <li> This product is over $30 at my local beauty shop.  I was thrilled to find it for such a great price. I love this conditioner and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  All of them are wonderful.  You can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
    <li> One of the beat deep conditioners I&#x27;ve found for my color treated curly hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural brunette who went blonde and that process definitely takes a toll on your hair. After years of getting highlights, my hair started to feel like hay and became absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to brush after my showers. My hair was super damaged, dried and fried and in desperate need of some TLC and major talent with serious skills. In my quest to find a new colorist that I could trust and feel safe with, I was sent to an extraordinary colorist in NYC. He recommended I use this as a daily conditioner and it worked brilliantly. My hair feels soft and healthy. Two years later, it is still my daily conditioner. The end.</li>
    <li> It took more time to receive than I expected but after the first use, I&#x27;m not going to let it affect the rating. This hair mask is wonderful. I&#x27;m going to order my next tub now. My hair is super dry and brittle on the ends. I have always had to condition in the shower and put in a leave-in. My ends still would be brittle!  I put this mask on the ends of my hair and left it in for a few hours. I  then used it after shampooing and I can not believe how much better my hair looks after one use. I didn&#x27;t need my leave-in conditioner either. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this mask-it has performed a miracle.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really moisturizes my dry, curly hair without weighing it down. (I use it sparingly; I bought a container in April from my stylist and still have about 1/4 of the container left.) I don&#x27;t like other Davines products, but this one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have long hair with all over color and highlights. I shampoo with Goldwell Kerasilk shampoo and conditioner (which I wholeheartedly recommend)  and after rinsing those products out, I put the  Davines on and wrap hair in a towel for 30 minutes. Then rinse, dry and style. This is NOT a leave in as one reviewer said it is. My hair is really silky using this product with the others I mentioned above. I love it. Not cheap...but you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
    <li> Love this deep conditioner! Great price too, highly recommended for soft, healthy hair! Perfect if you are growing out your hair or trying to keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> I have coarser hair and thought this could help with preventing fly-aways and making my hair look healthier throughout the winter, but it hasn&#x27;t been working as anticipated as a weekly mask (my hair was still dry). However, as a daily conditioner, I have been seeing a noticeable difference with how soft my hair is and I am updating this review because I will more than likely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and manageable.  Noticed less breakage after a few uses.  Overall a nice conditioner.  Good results but I was not blown away.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. My hair is curly, thin, dry, frizzy, and bleached so needless to say it needs a lot of help. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products that promised to smooth, de-frizz, and condition, but the problem is they weighed my hair down so it just felt greasy with a gummy residue. This stuff is amazing. It delivers on its promise! It deep conditions but does not leave a film. And, it does not contain sulfates, so it is not drying like most commercial products you find on the store shelves. It&#x27;s the best kept secret! You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to really get desired results, either. I use it every week or so and it really brings my hair back to life. Give it a try...well worth the money! :)</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner for deep conditioning of my hair. I color my hair so it needs a good  conditioner that doesn&#x27;t strip the color and this is the one I have been using for years. A little more expensive than your regular mask but you only need a little so it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Love it year round, summer when my hair is dry from the sun and winter when it gets dry from the heat in the house.</li>
    <li> Best Reparative mask stops breakage. moisturizing And safe For fine hair like mine..&lt;br /&gt;My sister also uses this product and she has very thick coarse hair it is a miracle the way that it works I&#x27;m different textured hair. I shared davines to my friends and family.. Love it..</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My hair had damage from hot iron and many years of coloring. I started using this product. Within a week my hair improved. Within a month my hair was restored.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it.  Makes my hair like butter and very shiny.</li>
    <li> For the price, not really impressed. My hair is still frizzy and breaking but at least it smells good. Plain old olive oil or coconut oil is better.</li>
    <li> All I get is complements leave on at least&lt;br /&gt;10 minutes while showering then rinse&lt;br /&gt;Use anti frizz after before styling it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!! You&#x27;ll feel like the celebrities!!!</li>
    <li> Been using your everyday supermarket conditioners for years, I developed some heavy duty dandruff and my doctor gave me a shampoo for it, with a warning that it will dry my hair out badly. So I googled around to see if there were any heavy duty conditioners that would combat the drying effect and I finally chose this one. So glad I did! My hair has actually gotten better even though I&#x27;m using the drying shampoo! Insanely soft, and my hair has gained volume as well, plus it smells great. I&#x27;ll be using this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product I bought it 4 yrs ago and wore as an daily conditoner I have naturaly curly hair 4b and it was in between stages from relaxer to natural and it did wonders to my hair it made it soft and non-frizzy I bought it at an salon it was only 10 bucks! Now its double but free shipping cool!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Leaves hair smooth and silky. Use it in a steam room to get really great results. Helps control friz for days.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have used the NouNou Pak before, when ordering online, I have learned to be weary of getting the real thing. This item is absolutely authentic. It is not old, has not begun to separate and is the full 8.45 ounces. I love this product, if you have damaged hair, this WILL repair it. It is a miracle conditioner!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is a little over priced, but it truly works wonderfully well. My hair is very healthy looking</li>
    <li> i love this product.  i tried their Melu shampoo and conditioner after trying and loving this one, but i didnt like Melu nearly as much.  i love the smell of this one and it leaves my hair feeling healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I use it on my hair every other day (every time I shampoo) and it is hydrating.  I use it on my children&#x27;s hair before and after swimming and it does wonders for the chlorinated hair.  I have gone through 3 jars in a year (I share with my daughters)!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect for dry/damaged hair. After one use, I was hooked, and would recommend this to anyone who is need of product to soften and smooth hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described -  fast delivery!</li>
    <li> My curls were becoming flat and dry. I use this conditioner daily and it rejuvenated my curls ... they are back !!</li>
    <li> This mask works so well for thick and wavy hair which tends to get frizzy.  Both my daughter and I have used it and it restores our hair to a soft shine.  The masks leaves your hair feeling silky strong.</li>
    <li> I love to use this everyday as an added conditioner. My hair feels and looks much healthier. I have thinning hair and a little frizzy, works great.</li>
    <li> Gold standard as far as I am concerned. Reordered this many times.</li>
    <li> Recommend by my hair stylist. The best conditioner.</li>
    <li> I heard really good reviews about this conditioner but something&#x27;s don&#x27;t work as well for certain hair types. It&#x27;s always a hit or miss. There was nothing wrong with it and the smell was good but didn&#x27;t linger in my hair. I found a PERFECT conditioner at the drugstore that smells really nice and only $5-6. Try the Aussie 3X moist conditioner or the 10X. Works really good and doesn&#x27;t make you cringe every time you run out because of the cost.</li>
