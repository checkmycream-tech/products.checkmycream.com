<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 1/2 drop around the eyes before bed helps keep the wrinkles away. I was skeptical at first, but thought WTH give it try its not that expensive. After several months of use, I have found it did smooth out SOME of the wrinkles. While I mention SOME wrinkles smoothed out, I can only guess that it did prevent new wrinkles from forming. So yes, im gonna keep using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosehip oil for the past month and I have seen such a great transformation in my skin.  I use it as my daily moisturizer, adding a few drops of lavender essential oils (for the calming and healing attributes of the oil) into it before rubbing it in the palms of my hands and applying it to my slightly damp skin post a shower.  The oil absorps relatively quickly into my skin and I lock it all down by applying a bit of aloe vera gel afterwards.  This has been my go to natural moisturizer and my skin looks so dewy, healthy and radiant.  I highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this stuff!  I use it all the time as a moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth.  A little bit goes a long way and it is not at all greasy.  It has the scent of fresh rose petals, which is an added bonus.  I&#x27;ve even heard Dr. Oz sing its praises on his show.</li>
    <li> wonderful product for the face - will order larger bottle next time - leaves face feeling soft and very smooth</li>
    <li> I think my skin looks better after using this only a few weeks.  I put it on every night.  I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil in conjunction with avocado oil as a nightly moisturizer and it&#x27;s great! I can already see my dark spots fading and a more even skin tone emerging. This is what I&#x27;ve been searching for, so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Since I used this, I still notice some breakouts when I have my period but other than that, my skin is super soft. It absorbs very well to the skin. Does not give me oily feeling at all. Good purchase. My skin normally is very clear so I&#x27;m not sure how it would help with acne skin.</li>
    <li> This wonderful oil delivered everything it promised. I have used it on face and simply love the way it keeps my skin moisturized and dewey all day! I plan to try it on my hair at some point, but right now I am concentrating on my face.</li>
    <li> Simply the best moisturizer I have ever used for my face. For an oil, it is not oily at all. Great for older skin as it reduces age spots &amp; acne scars.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any huge difference, but the product did not break me out. It is pretty moisturizing though for daily use.</li>
    <li> my wife loves the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is actually rosehip oil or just overpriced, watered down EVOO. I mixed some of this \\&quot;rosehip oil\\&quot; in with my regular moisturizer and I could immediately smell the oil, it smelled like EVOO and it even felt like EVOO on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I cook with olive oil all the time so I know the smell and consistency very well and these two oils are almost identical, only this \\&quot;rosehip oil\\&quot; felt thinner, like it had been watered down or mixed with something to make it thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, upon further research of \\&quot;Botanical Beauty\\&quot;, their other \\&quot;oils\\&quot; and the reviews it would appear most of them really are nothing more then glorified EVOO and vit E oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased Rose Hip oil because it supposed to be very nourishing for the skin and also can help improve wrinkles! I have only been using it for a few days so it may take a few weeks to notice any real difference. I add it to my moisturizer in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin is very sensitive and im very acne prone ve had no problems with this dry oil!</li>
    <li> No real noticeable change. Does make your face feel soft. The unpleasant odor was not expected.&lt;br /&gt;Will look for a better quality near.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on my face, neck and stomach(I have stretch marks), I used up all of the oil and didn&#x27;t notice a difference and I used it religiously. Smelled terrible and will stain your clothes.</li>
    <li> I ordered Rosehip oil and received Rosehip seed oil.  To me these two products are different.  Although it goes on easily it does leave an oily feel to you face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a real happy camper.  When I order something I want what I ordered not what you felt like sending me.</li>
    <li> Got it today, in a timely way. Nice packaging. Feels very refreshing on the skin, and I like the smell.(I also love the smell of rubber and gas) Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will most certainly reorder and recommend it.</li>
    <li> So I ordered a tiny bottle of this to put on my face at night in order to get dewy skin in the morning.  It definitely does that! I have oily acne prone skin, so I only use a few drops on my face every night mixed with tea tree oil (it also makes it smell nice).  I&#x27;ve been using this a week and so far have not had any breakouts. I&#x27;ve also learned that this has Vitamin A and antioxidants, so hopefully my skin will also show results of that soon too. I plan to buy a bigger bottle when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> This a great product and works very well. It is expensive though and didn&#x27;t last me long . The quality is excellent though.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really had a chance to try it on my hair but it seems to work well when mixed with my facial creams.</li>
    <li> I had surgery to remove a lipoma from my arm. I had an incision about 3-4 inches.  The rose hip oil is working wonderfully to minimize the scarring left from the incision and the stiches.  This oil also works great for the skin on the face to give it a more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> This stuff did nothing for me at all expect make my skin more oily than it already was</li>
    <li> I have no other brand to compare it to, but to me it smells slightly rancid - have been using it on my face and mix it with some coconut oil to overcome the strange, what i consider rancid smell.</li>
    <li> So far (3wks now) this oil works very nicely on my skin. I mix it with coconut oil and use that as my moisturizer. It&#x27;s very healing to troubled skin.</li>
    <li> I am sad that it&#x27;s such a small amount, but you don&#x27;t need a lot for putting it in products. Its awesome and I am happy that I bought it! It is a good one to start with if you haven&#x27;t used rosehip oil before.</li>
    <li> It is good products so far. It does not leave a greasy residue. It has a smell a bit weird but it doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin. so far its ok. I have not seen a difference yet.</li>
    <li> I actually like this oil. Haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic decrease in my hyperpigmentation but I am willing to give it another shot. It&#x27;s not overly oily and you can still wear it under makeup. Just give it a few minutes to soak in. U should try it too!</li>
    <li> I use this in place of my nightly moisturizer or as a supplement to vitamin C, and my skin feels great with it. Smell and consistency is great.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product.  Don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on serum.  All u need is this every day</li>
    <li> Great natural age defying tool at an affordable price. Amazed by the instant results both on my face and my hands.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Its helping with my skin problem ( too much drying skin). The price so reasonable and the product is worth using.</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair and body to give both a little extra vitamin c.helps the hair grow fast and strong.gives the body that natural glow it needs.</li>
    <li> I am almost out. Saving the rest until i get more. Very moisturizing but the smell is a little fishy.</li>
    <li> I saw a show on Dr. Oz featuring this type of oil for my skin and I have to say, he was right, it works wonders.</li>
    <li> This oil is great as a moisturizer on hands and face.  I like that it is organic.  I would order more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> This so far is my worst order,from  amazon!when it was delivered,it.looked rily smaller than d image shown secondly,d smell was rily bad,it smells awful,d day I summoned courage to use it on my skin,I smelled soo bad,dat no perfume could take d smell away!-</li>
    <li> It made my cheeks flaky and dry. I think it is a good product but it was not suitable for my type of skin.</li>
    <li> I used the first bottle &amp; I&#x27;m impressed with the result.  I will recommend this product to my friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I expected this oil to smell so good, it&#x27;s just okay. I would order this again nor would I recommend it. Sorry</li>
    <li> love this oil.. i use it all the time especially as a moisturizer after cleansing my skin and derma rolling.. it really gives my skin that glow and softness.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Mother-in law because she saw Dr. Oz talk about this oil....Alot of health benefits!!</li>
    <li> What can you say about an oil.  All I can say is that I have received it and am in the process of using it.</li>
    <li> my skin feel  much better  fresh and humetact. I add few drops  in my dayly moisterizes lotion fo r face and  is very  good  and nnot expensive at all</li>
    <li> I love this oil it has made a huge difference in my life I feel more confident now. I used to have a lot of acne scars on my face and bad acne. At first I was scare to use this oil because I though it was going to break me out  and make it worse because I have oily skin. But after 2 months I saw results and it&#x27;s almost been eight months that I been using it and my skin is  acne free and the scars are less visible and my pores are much smaller. .And  it&#x27;s also anti aging Iam 24 years old and my skin looks great  now.</li>
    <li> My face was very soft after using it, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. This oil smells very bad.  :(</li>
    <li> Use it during the day before applying makeup.  Makes my skin so smooth and takes away the redness.  Will order several more bottles so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I like that it reduces wrinkles and smell nice. It is easy to mix with another lotion or cream too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if others have found this true but my face feels softer and the bags under my eyes have improved as well. I mix three drops with my moisturizer and blend that over my face. I have also started to use a satin pillowcase. I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i wanted to start taking care of my skin. I&#x27;m 26 and I&#x27;m all ready getting fine lines around my eyes, and some laughing wrinkles and so on. Mostly due to heavy sun exposure when i was younger and lots of reading and computer usage, which forces the skin to contract with muscles. Anyways, I used petroleum jelly for a number of weeks at nights, to see if it would help preventing fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I read that petroleum is not great to put around your eyes, plus it contains some kind of chemical that is bad for your hormones. So I searched for more natural products and many pointed to these natural oils. So i applied it to my eye skin for about 5 straight days. No negative effects and of course no improvement on my fine lines (Obviously nothing works overnight). But I came across several people stating that adding oil to your eye skin at night actually contributes to sacks under the eyes, because the oil heats up at night. I&#x27;m not sure of the details, but this got me scared. So I only use it on my skin, like around my mouth and stuff. I haven&#x27;t had any negative effects at all, no acne or anything like that, and I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the good part is that just one drop covers a lot. Plus it dries out really quick and it&#x27;s organic so it can&#x27;t really hurt. I&#x27;ll use up this little bottle and probably wont order if I don&#x27;t see any kind of improvement on my skin.</li>
    <li> It is ok my brown spots seemed little lighter but so far nothing major. I am not sure if I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t break me out and has helped fade acne scars. The price is cheaper to compared to other companies.</li>
    <li> I received it by stated date that I would at a good price. Love the oil it&#x27;s a wonderful thing to use on your hair, face &amp; skin before bed. Will order it and from them again.</li>
    <li> I put 2 drops in my shampoo and I hope it will clear my scalp psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve got very delicate skin and it has not caused any breakouts.  It has a very, very light scent that I really not notice.  The package arrived in a bashed up box with one of the two bottles missing.  Although it took a while and a couple of follow up emails to the seller, a replacement did arrive in a sturdy box.</li>
    <li> Been using this for maybe three weeks, can&#x27;t say the results are dramatic for my face,but I&#x27;m sure I need to give it more time, really don&#x27;t know what my expectations are for this. It does go on smooth and nourishes the skin so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helping some, better than not using it at all.</li>
    <li> It seems my lines and skin are improving greatly. I even notice the brown spots are lightening. Love it. It smells fishy but I feel its doing the job.</li>
    <li> I Would probably order a bigger bottle next time. I think the rose hip oil is good for your skin</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much results since I&#x27;ve been trying this product.  A little disappointed. The price is good if you want to try.</li>
    <li> The oil had a strong smell and heavy color compared to another previous rose hip oil brand I used. I use just 1 drop of oil for my face, and the results are AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Started to use it on March 19th and so far I have definitely seen results. This is coming from someone with bad acne scars. I imagine someone with less complex skin to see greater results. My sister mentioned my expression lines/ parentheses on my face to have improved in such short period. I don&#x27;t know if it would actually help those with winkles. The odor of the oil was questionable at first since others mentioned it can go rancid and only recommended to use within a year of the date. This bottle did not have an expectation date and after email vendor back and forth on that, they just stopped replying and showed no concern. However, as I started to use it the smell definitely improved. It must be because it was seal. In conclusion you will not regret getting this oil and will benefit of better skin tone and anti aging benefits (I assume depending how much your face have aged). I noticed many gave a 5 star review upon receiving the oil. How can you tell how good it is if you don&#x27;t give it time to notice improvement first. It is worth every penny but give it at least two weeks for noticeable change. In my case I assume complete transformation in skin tone will take more time. So far I think this oil will always be part of my regimen. I don&#x27;t think those who use the one that isn&#x27;t 100% pure organic and unprocessed will get such great result. I do not mix it with anything. I evenly distribute a drop or two on my face daily. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Rosehip Oil was featured at some point on the Dr. Oz Show as being beneficial for the face, body, etc. Unfortunately, when I tried it on my face, I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell and had to wash it off after a short time.  This is one product I would not recommend unless you like the smell of fish on your face.  It may have beneficial results for your skin, but, unfortunately, I will never know if this is true!</li>
    <li> I was happy that it dissolved into my skin, and did not leave a oily or sticky feeling.It really helped the skin around my nails.But it was not any wonder  treatment for my face.</li>
    <li> I must have read 100 reviews from several different sites about the &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; of Rosehip Oil. Well, there are no miracles! It will help soften skin and I like to put it on my feet at night. I can&#x27;t really see any greater benefit with this product than using Vitamin E on my face. It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t mix well with a moisturizer like the Vitamin E. I gave it 4 stars because it did soften skin, like it said.</li>
    <li> thank you amazon - good supplement</li>
    <li> Love oil. This product is good.</li>
    <li> Nothing works on me, too old.</li>
    <li> This got recommended by Dr.Oz so I have to try.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can see the result yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased the oil on a recommendation from Dr. Oz for reducing wrinkles.  It has helped, but not as fast as I had anticipated.  I am happy with the results I have  achieved, but  want more firming.  I am in hopes that my further use will be the answer.</li>
    <li> I am a 43 year old and my skin so smooth. I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> when I was young my mother used Rose Hip oil all the time and swore by it.  wish I had listened before now, I&#x27;m 71 now and find it wonderful for my wrinkles</li>
    <li> I enjoy wearing this. My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when I put it on after my shower. I feel good with it on my skin, especially those dry elbows and my feet. I pamper myself with this oil every single night. Get yours now!</li>
    <li> I love this. The change isn&#x27;t overnight but my face is softer and the dark areas are getting lighter. I am ordering again as this is 100% pure and a little goes a long way.  Love this, have put away all the expensive moisturizers that haven&#x27;t worked for many years</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product, use it on my face and hands along with my vit E oil. Have been using it almost a year now and I really prefer it over face lotions.</li>
    <li> I used it for brown spots and eczema but i noticed a lot of hair growing all over my face so i stopped useing it, It didn&#x27;t help with nothing</li>
    <li> Works well in my facial beauty products!</li>
    <li> very good product, Iam happy to the result in my skin! dry for tratament acne... but this is wonderfull!! glow natura instant before day day makeup! the seller 5 stars in speed packaging attention. thank!  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my skin..like zero inspite the daily use for two months now.</li>
    <li> This is great for stretch marks. Really good!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product which makes your face brighter. I have some old acne scars from my teens and this product has worked wonders. I actually purchased this product over a year ago and forgot about it. It was sitting in my medicine cabinet. I started using it and WOW! I wished I had been using it from the beginning! It is a great product and I plan on purchasing it again because my bottle ran out!</li>
    <li> I have only used product for a couple of weeks, so i haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin..  but i love the way it feels when i apply it</li>
    <li> The oil is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I saw it on Dr. Oz. My 66 year old skin never looked better. Also, it is not greasy like argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;All natural and not expensive- what more could you want?  I have been using it morning and night during this cold winter.Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I love it!!!  I wish I knew about this years ago.  It isn&#x27;t expensive and it works.  It goes to show that natural is better regarding this oil.  no more wrinkles or bad acne scars.  I would recommend this highly.  Also, a little goes along way.  I&#x27;m definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS  FOR ECZEMA ON MY FACE.  IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ECZEMA BUT I&#x27;M STILL USING IT AS A BEAUTY REGIMINE.............TOO SOON TOO REVIEW FOR THAT.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it is a little thicker then the other rosehip seed oil and gives my complexion a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I been using the rosehip oil for 4mos.,My skin is so smooth &amp; soft.The oil has given me a even tone. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Did what it said it would do.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> On the Dr. Oz he mentioned Miranda Kerr uses Rosehip oil to keep her skin looking flawless. The cost was $10. I have oily skin and get the occasional breakout (before menstruating). Used it after I showered, before bed so it absorbs well into the skin. First week of using I started to have more breakouts but I thought that was normal and would go away, but I was wrong. Five weeks in I have more breakouts than ever and stopped using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day for almost a month. My face feels firmer &amp; looks better. I&#x27;m going to continue using it in hopes it will diminish some fine lines.</li>
    <li> This was very hydrating.  I think it smelled nice.  I liked it best when I mixed it with my moisturizer, I found it was less greasy when I mixed it with my Cerave facial moisturizer as opposed to using it by itself.  They worked great together!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I mix it with my moisturizer and my face feels wonderful and so soft and I just have a glow I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz.  a few drops on the dark spots will lighten them if you continue using..and they will disappear.</li>
    <li> i used this oil to make an eye cream for myself and my mom. we both have dark circles under our eyes. we have tried everything with no result. once i made the cream and we used it we saw INSTANT results in only 2-3 days! next time i&#x27;m buying a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;this is also the real deal, the color is a nice dark amber and although it doesnt smell like a rose it does have a lovely faint scent. i would describe it as smelling almost like earl grey tea but its so lite you dont notice it unless you really go for a big sniff right from the bottle. haha i&#x27;m going to make a lotion bar with it to put on the rest of the scars i have. :)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I chose four stars because it is too early to tell if it is doing anything or not. The actual product is as it was described and what I was expecting to receive.</li>
    <li> I love this product! By itself or with my face cream its a much needed bonus! I told my sis about it too!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.. I mix it into my face cream.  Very mild scent. Infact I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Rosehip oil, but I received Rosehip Seed Oil instead, when I reached out to let the company know that i received a different item not the item I ordered and paid for, their respond was to read reviews that were left by other people that its all the same.&lt;br /&gt;If it is all the same why can I get what I paid for ???? this is bull......</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL FOR DRY LIPS.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product, so glad that I have found it.Found out about it&#x27;s uses on Pintrest and I am so happy to have the information.</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised by the results I got from using this oil. I was skeptical at first, but I began noticing changes after only 2 weeks. I began rubbing it on my dark circles and a couple of dark acne scars on my chin, and I started noticing diminished color and firmness of my skin in the mornings when I woke up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered, it came when promised and you can track the progress! Works good, one spot on cheek is almost gone. I will buy again if you send a reminder from your shop!</li>
    <li> I do have to say my skin feels great after using rosehip oil  I saw it on Dr. Oz  I use it once a day</li>
    <li> I love the feel it gives when I use it on my face and hair. It makes me feel alive</li>
    <li> Fast service.  Product combined with a moisture cream takes away the itching. Only 2-4 drops is all that is required</li>
    <li> Learned about this oil watching the Dr Oz show. It&#x27;s a great moisturizing oil! Not sure about it clearing up my 20 year old blemishes. I guess I better keep looking.</li>
    <li> The worst product I have ever ordered.  It smells like crude oil and rancid.  I emailed company and they said it is suppose to smell like this.  Really?  They can put on their face, I&#x27;m not putting on mine.  Never buy products from this company again.</li>
    <li> very excellent organic rosehip oil</li>
    <li> At 67 years of age, I have tried many products...few do what they promise. This does...I have never been able to keep the skin under my eyes from being dry until now. The advice is to put a drop or two in your own moisturizer...well, I put  the drops directly on my skin and...what a difference. I never want to run out of this and this particular product is a very good price, too.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I like how my skin under my eyes feel. Refreshed skin and less dark under eyes! Will buy more for my small Christmas gifts for co-workers.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Just as advertised and of very high quality.  I&#x27;ve been using it as part of my skincare routine for about a month and it&#x27;s fantastic. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very excited about it.Fast delivery , good price. Removes waterproof mascara at the same time keep my skin radiant . I mostly use it at night as is or mix it with clay masks .</li>
    <li> I have been using it but I cannot honestly say I have seen a major difference!&lt;br /&gt; guess time will tell if it removes some of my scars...I like the texture and the smell. I mix it with my facial lotion.</li>
    <li> Had heard about Miranda Kerr using rose hip oil for her skin so I went out to purchase some. Didn&#x27;t look to much when I found this. Claimed 100% pure natural organic rose hip oil. With the reviews so high and almost 5 stars i went ahead and purchased it. It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve been looking more into essential oil and researching. I went and grabbed my bottle to look at the ingredients in it. No where on the bottle does it had and ingredient label. You see what is printed on the front and on the side it mentions &amp;#34;cold press carrier oil&amp;#34; not knowing what carrier oil was I began googling. Apparently it&#x27;s basically like a vegetable oil. It carriers the EO to the skin. I noticed lots of low reviews saying it smelt and had similar textures of olive oils, fish oils etc. This explains it. I was disappointed with this bc I just order 3 more oils from them over the weekend. I still haven&#x27;t done much research and maybe rose hip needs to be diluted I don&#x27;t know. Also as mention in other review I also receive the rose hip seed oil. Not rose hip oil.  Just be aware and if anyone has more knowledge on this topic please tell. Only giving 2 star because I&#x27;m just not educated enough to know if it is good or not</li>
    <li> I use on my face.  Face feels soft and has a bit of a glow.  Not too crazy about the smell, but works fine.</li>
    <li> I have used it now for 3 weeks. While my skin is softer and better hydrated, it has almost an olive oil smell. When I got my cold pressed olive oil to compare scents and consistency, it was practically the same. I am going to go to my local health food store and try the one they have and see if its similar.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to use it. Do i use it full strength or mix it into lotion? Not really any directions for use.</li>
    <li> Seems I got an old bottle of this.  Very fishy and unpleasant smelling.  I think I will buy local and try to get fresh.  Also, the bottle I have says Rosehip Seed Oil which is not what I ordered.  Not sure if it is the same.</li>
    <li> I add a couple of drops of this to my face moisturizer &amp; my body moisturizer.  It is suppose to have the same benefit to the skin as Retinol, but less harsh on the skin.  Dr. Oz recommended it on his show.  It is not expensive, and I do see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this because miranda kerr (victoria secret model) said she wears rose hip oil on her face every night before going to bed. Now i do it.... Its makes your skin feel healthy and soft. I think it brightens up my skin....</li>
    <li> This did not do anything that it claimed to do.  It felt nice on my face but I did not see any changes to fine wrinkles or helping to clear dark spots.  I used it alone every night and it as moisterizing but no results were seen.  I did not expect miracles but was hoping for something.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like this .  It help clear my skin of small bumps on my face and the dryness and itching i was experiencing. I will buy this again. And the reason I bought it was It was mentioned on the Dr. Oz show.</li>
    <li> I have used about 1/2 of the bottle and so far I like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but it seems to be a high quality oil. I was concerned it would smell fishy, as some reviewers of this particular item (and similar products from other sellers) have warned about. While the smell is slightly musky and woody, it&#x27;s not fishy. I can see how someone might think it has a fishy nature to it&#x27;s smell, but my product was fresh regardless. I keep it refrigerated and it absorbs nicely into my skin. Great value.</li>
    <li> Turned my skin orangeish looking. Threw it away. Not sure if I received a bad batch or what but will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous! I use it on my face and neck nightly before going to sleep (a few drops goes a long way) and it hydrates all night, giving my skin a velvety glow in the mornings. My boyfriend has noticed this change in my skin enough so to compliment the radiance lately! It&#x27;s good to know not only do I see the difference in my skin, but so do others! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this once my oil runs out! :)</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer and I mix it with a cream then&lt;br /&gt;put on your face.  I don&#x27;t notice any changes in skin&lt;br /&gt;texture.  I am looking for something that removes&lt;br /&gt;brown and sun damage.</li>
    <li> I been using the oil for about three weeks. I love the way the oil make my skin feels and look!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Saw it on of course Dr Oz tried it, it takes continuous usages to work not just one bottle like i bought, I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I find the smell off-putting and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look better.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day on my face and so far very happy. Dr Oz says to use on face twice a day and you will see difference in skin and diminished wrinkles I do feel it is working.</li>
    <li> I saw on dr. OZ that this would help wrinkles n skin.  Have used it for little over a month n have noticed progress.  I highly recommend this product, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I use like a serum. Smells faintly of citrus, is a bright orange color which indicates the  pigment that has such healing properties, but does not stain the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Adds a bit of moisture and is pleasant and penetrates well.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Just add two drops to my face cream and apply.  I truly love the results on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> So far I like the organic rose hip oil.  I gave only 4 stars since I have only used for a few days and don&#x27;t know yet how the final results will be, but it does make my skin feel softer.</li>
    <li> Recived broken and was refunded .</li>
    <li> this oil is so nice. in fact all their oils are wonderful. i use this rose hip oil for face and hair. the scent is an authentic earthy one.  i should also mention the customer service of this company is very good. i have purchased many oils from them.</li>
    <li> works great, have been using this onlyfor a week on my face for acne scars and already see a difference. its not the best smell but im fine with that. would definately reccomend this product</li>
    <li> A bit fishy smelling. I have heard that the best Rosehip oils should not have a fishy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it in with my facial cream so it is not noticeable. I do notice more smoothness to my skin.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a change/improvement.</li>
    <li> got it but haven&#x27;t used it all that much.. I don&#x27;t quite care for the smell.. I was not anticipating it would smell weird.&lt;br /&gt;so I&#x27;ll have to give it some more time to see if it works.. if I can get pass the smell..</li>
    <li> This oil has been a staple product for many women over the years.&lt;br /&gt;And due to Dr. Oz recommendation sales have increase. I have been&lt;br /&gt;using it for some time now and find that my skin is responding well.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good as a body oil as well. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I am using this oil and I let it</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but when I apply couple drops of this oil on my face, it does not cause breakouts! Leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized! Love it! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether it reduces wrinkles or crows feet but I am sure I&#x27;ll reap the long term benefits soon!</li>
    <li> My skin is so terribly dry due to nearly six years of cancer treatments.  I take medications to inhibit estrogen production in my body.  I had always had beautiful and flawless skin but within a month of the medications, my skin was so dry and flaky with small brown scaly spots.  I tried lots of different (and expensive) products and nothing helped.  My mother-in-law told me she had heard that Rosehip Oil worked well.  I received my oil,  I was surprised by the odor because I expected the scent of roses but the smell isn&#x27;t pretty but it goes away in a few minutes. However, the oil felt great on my skin and really helped with the dry patches. After trying different ways to use this oil, I found perfection!  After cleansing my face, I put the Rosehip Oil on, then I use Oil of Olay on top of that and then when putting my foundation on, I add a bit of Oil of Olay to it.  Now my skin is back to normal.  My skin looks so much younger and healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought rose oil because of all the hype and wonderful properties it has and usage.  Used this product for months.  Do not see any changes other then dry skin patches.  Remember you need to mix these with you regular moisturizer to apply it  helps with a smoother application. Still waiting for the miracle change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than two years now and I love it!! As we get older our skin gets drier and we need to replenish the natural oil on our skin. This product help me achieve it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Recently I became interested in natural oils, particularly interested in skin and hair care. I’ve ordered several oils from Botanical Beauty Company. Now I would like to share my experience about Organic Rosehip Oil. I don’t use it in its pure form I prefer to mix it with other oils. I add Rosehip Oil to Macadamia Nut Oil (approximately in the ratio 1: 5) or any other oil, and then apply it to the hair.  The longer you wait the better results you get. My hair very shiny, keep their freshness longer and really easy to comb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 weeks and have noticed my dark spots have lightened up! Face feels smooth afterwards too!</li>
    <li> My husband uses for eczema and I use it to reduce dry scalp. We love it</li>
