      <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>I have skin that&#x27;s basically fair, and I don&#x27;t generally wear foundation.  </li>
      <li>I have light skin with golden undertones.  </li>
      <li>product came quickly and was just as described</li>
      <li>I have tried the Smart Shade concealer and foundation in light.  </li>
      <li>; is rather light, I find that if i don&#x27;t rub it in too much</li>
      <li>Cream blushes are more natural looking than powders.</li>
      <li>Got the product quickly and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>

      <li>just the right amount on color and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

      <li>It blends perfectly for subtle natural looking color.</li>
      <li>Just bought this today at my local drugstore, put it on in the car, and I was instantly pleased.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend loves this product and had been unable to find it anywhere in this area, so she was very happy to get it!!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>It is a creamy liquid which works well with my aging skin, and I can control exactly where it goes.</li>
      <li>I use it along the top of my high forehead to make it less prominent, as well as on my cheeks.</li>

      <li>Blends very well</li>
      <li>This product has been a favorite of mine for a long time and suddenly wasn&#x27;t available any more in the usual stores.  </li>
      <li>I use liquid foundation (lightly) and I like the way this blends into my skin without looking dry or caked on, like some powder blushes can.</li>
      <li>This has decent staying power, I do not need to touch up a lunch.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, just like their under eye concealer, so it&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>Both the concealer and foundation were too yellow and would not blend into the right shade for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this blush for several years and like it very much.</li>

      <li>it blends well and lasts for a considerable length of time.</li>
      <li>Came early and as described.</li>
      <li>A very affordable product that is suitability for various skin tones and skin types.  </li>
      <li>You also need to be careful and make sure you apply the same amount to both checks or you look a little funny.  </li>
      <li>As a more &#x27;mature&#x27; woman with dark hair and pale skin, I need a blush and really like the idea of a cream product.  </li>
      <li>However, like others have mentioned, the makeup itself is pink rather than clear, and yes, I agree, if you put too much on, you can look like a clown.  </li>
      <li>It is very light, creamy, and gives a delicate pink glow to the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this blush for a long time and then Almay decided to stop production.  I searched all stores and by chance found it on Amazon.com.  Am sooooo glad!!</li>
    <li> This product has been a favorite of mine for a long time and suddenly wasn&#x27;t available any more in the usual stores.  When I finally discovered it on Amazon I bought several so as not to be without it.  Cream blush is impossible to find and I like the way this is just the right color and consistency.</li>
    <li> This is is the best blush ever. Looks so natural.</li>
    <li> As a more &#x27;mature&#x27; woman with dark hair and pale skin, I need a blush and really like the idea of a cream product.  Unfortunately, this went on a cream color and blended right in with no discernable change at all.  What&#x27;s the point?  Hate to be negative, but for me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying that I like my makeup as natural-looking as you can get while still wearing makeup.  I also hate feeling powder-y.  I have skin that&#x27;s basically fair, and I don&#x27;t generally wear foundation.  I love just a hint of color on my cheeks.  This blush is perfect for me!  It goes on easily with a fingertip, and I don&#x27;t notice that I have to wash my hands after using it as some have mentioned.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed it rubbing off through the day.  On the other hand, if you like your makeup bold or pronounced, this may be too subtle for you.  For me, though, it&#x27;s perfect every day!</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for my complexion.  Even though I am 78 and within the last year had squamous cancer on my fact ..... this product covers my surgery beautifully!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Got the product quickly and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Just bought this today at my local drugstore, put it on in the car, and I was instantly pleased.  It is very light, creamy, and gives a delicate pink glow to the skin. I like that it&#x27;s in a tube, so my fingers don&#x27;t touch the product directly.  The person who said it was sticky must have gotten an outdated tube. I found it to be the creamiest blush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this makeup. Blends very well and I will continue to purchase. The base is great too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blush for several years and like it very much. It is a creamy liquid which works well with my aging skin, and I can control exactly where it goes. The color is subtle; you would need to apply another coat if you want something more blatant. But the amount of color suits me -- I have very pale skin. I use it along the top of my high forehead to make it less prominent, as well as on my cheeks. Unfortunately, Almay has discontinued it, so it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blush, but it is no longer available in the dept. stores. I looks natural, not cakey or greasey.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product! A little goes a long way, just like their under eye concealer, so it&#x27;s a good value for the money. I use liquid foundation (lightly) and I like the way this blends into my skin without looking dry or caked on, like some powder blushes can. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Smart Shade concealer and foundation in light.  I was very disappointed with both of those products.  I have light skin with golden undertones.  Both the concealer and foundation were too yellow and would not blend into the right shade for my skin.  This blush is the only one of the three products I would consider buying again.  This is a great shade and it blends smoothly into the perfect shade.  Apply this product can be a little messy.  You also need to be careful and make sure you apply the same amount to both checks or you look a little funny.  This is easier to do that with traditional blush because it is liquid.  Overall this is a great color and feels great on.  This has decent staying power, I do not need to touch up a lunch.</li>
    <li> I love this blush, and I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s not in stores anymore. I was glad to find it on Amazon. I have fair skin, and this blush has enough color without being too bright for me. It lasts well on my fair skin. I love that it&#x27;s creamy instead of powdery, and that it doesn&#x27;t have those little glittery bits that so many powder blushes have. I wish I could still get this in the store.</li>

    <li> Love this product but can&#x27;t find it anymore except online.</li>
    <li> I like my face to look dewy and this product works better than any powder or cream blush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Altho the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; is rather light, I find that if i don&#x27;t rub it in too much it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is the best blush ive ever used! It blends perfectly for subtle natural looking color. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have looked for this product everywhere and have decided that it must be discontinued.  Consequentley I was thrilled to be able to get it from this vendor.  I have been using it for years and hate to change so being able to still get it was a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly and was just as described and I am one happy customer.</li>
    <li> A very affordable product that is suitability for various skin tones and skin types.  it blends well and lasts for a considerable length of time.</li>

    <li> It is a shame they are discontinuing it; goes on lightly &amp; perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> just the right amount on color and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy and pleased with the product and the prompt delivery.&lt;br /&gt;will order in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this blush as it is a light cream and blends in beautifully. I have not been able to find it anymore as manufactures insist on making products that are in powder form. Cream blushes are more natural looking than powders.</li>
