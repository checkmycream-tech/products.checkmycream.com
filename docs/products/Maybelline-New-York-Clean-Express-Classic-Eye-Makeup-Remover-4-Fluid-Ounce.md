### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy I have discovered this gel makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I do however have a perfect use for this.</li>
      <li>fantastic !!!!</li>
      <li>I just keep ordering, works great</li>
      <li>and I loved the scent</li>
      <li>This is a really good Makeup Remover.  </li>
      <li>Buy the waterproof version as it&#x27;s a much more effective product.</li>
      <li>this product is very nice and fresh, but it still doesn&#x27;t remove my waterproof mascara with just one cotton pad :)</li>
      <li>Gets the job done but does burn more then others.</li>
      <li>The bottles I purchased 2 months or more ago would remove all makeup including waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>Love this eye maker remover.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Be sure to read front label.</li>
      <li>I like the waterproof version MUCH better.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>If you are someone who cleans your brushes once a week or longer, you may need to use a better cleaner.</li>
      <li>The maybelline New York clean express makeup remover works really great.</li>
      <li>It is easy on the eyes and removes all my eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>The first time I bought this product off of amazon, it was amazing.</li>
      <li>I bought this because the waterproof version wasn&#x27;t available, so take this review with a grain of salt.</li>
      <li>Works great and only takes 2-3 swipes to get it fully off my lashes.</li>
      <li>but I find the gel far superior.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure the company is aware of the defect in some of their product.</li>
      <li>It works great to clean/soak your makeup brushes in, as long as you clean your brushes after everytime you use them.  </li>
      <li>The scent is not unpleasant,  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live anymore, so I am super glad I found it on here.</li>
      <li>But it feels so much better than liquid and in my opinion takes my long wear make-up off so much better.</li>
      <li>it is just as good as i expected.</li>
      <li>read the other two reviews that raved about how good</li>
      <li>it is gentle and can clean the makeup thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I thought this product worked pretty well</li>
      <li>OMG how much I don&#x27;t like it!</li>
      <li>now I just use coconut oil which is much gentler!</li>
      <li>And it removes makeup less effectively than soap and water.</li>
      <li>Eh... I really don&#x27;t want to end up in hell</li>
      <li>This product is the classic</li>
      <li>the classic is thicker.  </li>
      <li>The front of the bottle said it was a new formula.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be finding a new makeup remover and throwing this one away!!!</li>
      <li>since the bottle is almost exactly the same.</li>
      <li>The second bottle was nothing like the first.</li>
      <li>Being in this state makes it easier for me not only remove the makeup, but it also feel very soothing to my eyes.</li>
      <li>This makeup remover really falls short on my list.</li>
      <li>I too thought it was a liquid, was surprised that it was a gel..</li>
      <li>You only need a pea sized drop otherwise its too much.</li>
      <li>However, if you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend this product - it will cause burning.</li>
      <li>I would have bought it from Amazon if I wasn&#x27;t out of remover completely.</li>
      <li>What is in the last bottles I purchased barely removes eye shadow and eye brow powder.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really swipe 74 times... only 15 or so back and forth motions, until I gave up and used the last little bit of my trusty Neutrogena Oil-free makeup remover.</li>

<li> This is not what I want, I felt a little pricking after using it and it didn&#x27;t remove eye mascara clearly.</li>
<li> Also Maybelline has several different products with such similar looking containers that it is confusing.</li>
<li> Be careful.....</li>
<li> If I could give this a minus rating I would.</li>
<li> Sadly the first bottle worked like a dream.</li>
<li> The old product was as thin as water but it worked.</li>
<li> The second bottle is extremely thick, almost doesn&#x27;t even want to come out of the bottle.</li>
<li> I recommend the other one--it&#x27;s liquid that works!</li>
<li> This stuff is the consistency of half set gelatin.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> (Sorry for being too graphic)</li>
<li> I previously left this review on the wrong product</li>
<li> but it used to burn the skin around my eyes like crazy and leave them red and stingy for a few days after ...</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like to write a negative review.</li>
<li> Really, I&#x27;m trying to find reasons to keep this around,  because I hate to be a whiner,  </li>
<li> I guess one could chalk it up to a difference in eye makeup brands used or maybe even the fact that I use an eye primer, but sadly, I looked like a crying raccoon after trying to swipe the glob of GEL (on a cotton pad) across my lids 74 times.</li>
<li> The consistency is similar to cold snot or cold jizz.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I now have to have plastic surgery to remove the self-inflicted wrinkles that occurred.</li>
<li> but this product is making it rather difficult to stay optimistic.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also a really weird consistency, almost gel-like.</li>
<li> However, this product has become increasingly difficult to purchase.</li>
<li> I hate wasting money, and I feel everything has a use....</li>
<li> This gel remover is so horrible: doesn&#x27;t remove the makeup, and it irritates the eyes!</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s disgusting!!!</li>
<li> Bad product!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The maybelline New York clean express makeup remover works really great. It always gets off all of my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to write a negative review. However, this product has become increasingly difficult to purchase. I was signed up for the subscription and I thought that I could continue to receive it that way. Now it&#x27;s back ordered but it seems to be in stock if you order it the regular way. Also Maybelline has several different products with such similar looking containers that it is confusing. Some of the reviews are saying that the product has changed. Today I bought a Neutrogena eye-makeup remover at Target and it works just as well. It&#x27;s around the same price also. I would have bought it from Amazon if I wasn&#x27;t out of remover completely.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. I like the waterproof version MUCH better. This is a jelly substance that just stings my eyes. I recommend the other one--it&#x27;s liquid that works!</li>
    <li> I thought this product worked pretty well and I loved the scent but it used to burn the skin around my eyes like crazy and leave them red and stingy for a few days after ...now I just use coconut oil which is much gentler!</li>
    <li> I saw this at walmart on clearance for just $1 so i figured why not try it. You only need a pea sized drop otherwise its too much. Works great and only takes 2-3 swipes to get it fully off my lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this eye maker remover. Wish Mabelline still made it.</li>
    <li> this product is very nice and fresh, but it still doesn&#x27;t remove my waterproof mascara with just one cotton pad :)</li>
    <li> I previously left this review on the wrong product **sheepish grin** since the bottle is almost exactly the same. This review is for the GEL remover... not the bi-layer solution that one has to shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the other two reviews that raved about how good this \\&quot;waterproof eye makeup remover\\&quot; is, but I did not have the same experience. I guess one could chalk it up to a difference in eye makeup brands used or maybe even the fact that I use an eye primer, but sadly, I looked like a crying raccoon after trying to swipe the glob of GEL (on a cotton pad) across my lids 74 times. Needless to say, I now have to have plastic surgery to remove the self-inflicted wrinkles that occurred. Eh... I really don&#x27;t want to end up in hell so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t lie. I didn&#x27;t really swipe 74 times... only 15 or so back and forth motions, until I gave up and used the last little bit of my trusty Neutrogena Oil-free makeup remover. So, the only thing (IMO) that this \\&quot;EXPRESS\\&quot; cleaner is a short route to is your local plastic surgeon. OH, and it stung too, when some of the GEL leaked between my lids. But go ahead, buy it... I double dog dare you.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live anymore, so I am super glad I found it on here.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover really falls short on my list. The scent is not unpleasant,  but it&#x27;s not great either. The consistency is similar to cold snot or cold jizz.  (Sorry for being too graphic) And it removes makeup less effectively than soap and water. I do however have a perfect use for this.

If you are someone who cleans your brushes once a week or longer, you may need to use a better cleaner.

    <li> This only works on regular makeup, nothing waterproof</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that this was a gel and it&#x27;s disgusting!!! When I saw that it was &amp;#34;fluid ounces&amp;#34; I assumed liquid. I will definitely be finding a new makeup remover and throwing this one away!!!</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is a gel instead of a liquid. Being in this state makes it easier for me not only remove the makeup, but it also feel very soothing to my eyes. I have tried the liquid type but I find the gel far superior.</li>
    <li> The formula has changed on this. The bottles I purchased 2 months or more ago would remove all makeup including waterproof mascara. What is in the last bottles I purchased barely removes eye shadow and eye brow powder. It would not remove the waterproof mascara at all. The front of the bottle said it was a new formula. The old product was as thin as water but it worked. This stuff is the consistency of half set gelatin. Suddenly, I had to figure out a way to remove the mascara and ended up using a body oil then switching to olive oil recently. If I could give this a minus rating I would. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> it is gentle and can clean the makeup thoroughly. it is just as good as i expected. recommend to buy it.</li>
    <li> Removes eye makeup well and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.  However, if you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend this product - it will cause burning.</li>
    <li> I just keep ordering, works great</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this product off of amazon, it was amazing. I ordered another bottle as soon as I got low. The second bottle was nothing like the first. I swear it isn&#x27;t even the same stuff. Sadly the first bottle worked like a dream. The second bottle is extremely thick, almost doesn&#x27;t even want to come out of the bottle. This bottle is not transparent fluid, it is milky. I wanted to make sure the company is aware of the defect in some of their product.</li>
    <li> I too thought it was a liquid, was surprised that it was a gel.. But it feels so much better than liquid and in my opinion takes my long wear make-up off so much better. I am very happy I have discovered this gel makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This is a really good Makeup Remover.  It is easy on the eyes and removes all my eye makeup.  This product is the classic but there is also a formula for waterproof makeup removal.  Be careful.....packaging is the same except the classic is thicker.  Be sure to read front label.</li>
    <li> This gel remover is so horrible: doesn&#x27;t remove the makeup, and it irritates the eyes! I bought this by an accident, because I thought I was getting the double layered liquid one, but OMG how much I don&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> fantastic !!!! I love it</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but does burn more then others. Not greasy which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the waterproof version wasn&#x27;t available, so take this review with a grain of salt. It does not work, even on non-waterproof mascaras! I get the same impact from soap and water. It&#x27;s also a really weird consistency, almost gel-like. Buy the waterproof version as it&#x27;s a much more effective product.</li>
    <li> This is not what I want, I felt a little pricking after using it and it didn&#x27;t remove eye mascara clearly. Bad product!!</li>
