    <li> It clearly states that it is not for the genital area but the product I used before this one said the same thing and it worked great. I tried this one because I can&#x27;t find the other one I used This one works great for the genital area. I followed the instructions on application and time limits and the hair came right off. If your looking for something to get rid of pubic hair in the  lower regions this works great. I&#x27;m smooth and hairless from my balls to my, well u get the picture.</li>
    <li> Burns a bit and stinks to high hell. Doesn&#x27;t work on legs as expected. Burned my pits - need to keep hair off of pits to prevent cysts from sweat - left me unable to use deodorant for a week.</li>
    <li> Wow! That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to say! This is a wow product! I applied a thick layer like it says on the instructions and removed with some cloth and I was wow this thing really works! And it left my skin oferta smooth. Im definitely buying another one!</li>
    <li> Did not work as promoted and it smelled horrible. The smell was Similar to a old style permanent and I was disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> works the best, and will do the job for you, i have used others so far this is number 1</li>
    <li> Smells like s*** but does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. But smells like toxic waste. But here&#x27;s a question: Why would they name the product after an area the directions specifically tell you to avoid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well. But let&#x27;s just say, I&#x27;m in the market for a better alternative.</li>
    <li> does what it says and gets rid of unwanted hairs</li>
    <li> Not strong enough. Leaves too much hair behind.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin burning. They say you can&#x27;t use it on your private parts. Why is it called Nads? Well I used it and it was fine. No burning after. Didn&#x27;t have to let it on six minutes rather than the four but removed all the hair. Worked so well I ordered more so I&#x27;d have it as needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with some optimistic anticipation but was sorely disappointed. Simply put it works no better than my razor.  Nads DOES NOT remove all your hair. Stubble is as pronounced as that left after shaving with a Fusion Pro-Glide razor. Too much for my personal taste. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Great size, works well and good deal for the price</li>
    <li> The first time my husband used it didn&#x27;t work so well so he left it on longer the next time and the hair did come off</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. And the solution smells awful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I had tried the nair version which was horrible. I advise to leave it on the maximum ten minutes as i have found this works best. The only thing i miss is they no longer have the version with the hands free applicator. I had a couple of those but lose them in a move. It was very convenient. A high quality product.</li>
    <li> Nair does just as well and can pick it up in the drugstore.  I just was not impressed in any way.  Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> It does not work well</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Crusted on the top. Didn&#x27;t work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it&#x27;s name, it&#x27;s not intended for your genitals per the warning on the label. So don&#x27;t buy this for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I would never buy again!!</li>
