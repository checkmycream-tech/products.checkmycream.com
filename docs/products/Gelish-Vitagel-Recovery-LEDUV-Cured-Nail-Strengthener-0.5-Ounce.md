      <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product!!</li>
      <li>I have had the product on my nails for 7 days without any peeling or lifting of any kind!</li>
      <li>However, my nails feel strong, look healthy and stay polished!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>I have really loved all gelish products.  </li>
      <li>This product is not as good as I though it will be.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff my nails of never look so beautiful.</li>
      <li>Like i say: I truly love the Gelish polishes and this is great for damaged nails.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I have used the Recovery Vitagel 2X now and LOVE the results!  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more!</li>
      <li>Makes them even more resistant than gel color alone!</li>
      <li>Love the stuff!</li>
      <li>I am in love!  </li>
      <li>Gel polish has long-lasting durability, but it&#x27;s also kind of a pain to remove.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
      <li>It is kind of an all in one.</li>
      <li>They were peeling and cracking very easily.</li>
      <li>a must have :) will always have this handy from now on.</li>
      <li>It goes on quick and easy and it cures to a great shine.  </li>
      <li>i went ahead and applied my color gel on top and then followed by the top-it off finishing gel and my nails look and are as strong as a rock!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I love all the gelish products</li>
      <li>but it sure does make an effort.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I then applied the foundation cured, 2 layers of color cured, and finished with the Top It Off.</li>
      <li>Ok, so here is my take on the vitagel recovery product.</li>
      <li>You need to make sure that you use a thicker coat that you would expect and you have to make sure that you cap the end of your nail when you put this on</li>
      <li>When I discovered that my favorite brand Harmony had a &amp;#34;recovery&amp;#34; product that purported to strengthen and restore my nails, I jumped all over it.</li>
      <li>Love the thickness of this gel.</li>
      <li>I had been using gel polish on my nails for about a year and love the strength &amp; durability it provides, but have been noticing my nails seem weaker.  </li>
      <li>after a couple more months of use:  I am finding another technique works even better and the polish stays on my nails (and my nails are still not crumbling).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to have the option to just use it as a clear coat if I don&#x27;t feel like color, it has a nice mirror shine to it without the top</li>
      <li>Took it off &amp; just applied my foundation &amp; top it off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This has helped them get the strength they need to look healthy and not peel off</li>
      <li>Off top coat.  </li>
      <li>So far I am extremely happy...</li>
      <li>so im sure its going to be fabulous</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and so far I am happy with it.  </li>
      <li>And btw, this works great as a clear polish</li>
      <li>The right kind of oil.</li>
      <li>It does come off easy with  </li>
      <li>best part is that it soaks off twice as fast, and leaves smooth happy nails behind.</li>
      <li>When I tried curing this under LED light, it would lift within a day.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it, and the customer service was fantastic.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never done your own nails you should really try.</li>
      <li>This Gelish vitagel is a great idea, help nails heal and recover from damage, but if the product cured properly maybe it would do</li>
      <li>The first time I tried just one coat (not even a top coat), with nail prep using a medium fine grit file.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>I am truly excited.</li>
      <li>came super quick !  </li>
      <li>I am new to doing my own gel manicures.</li>
      <li>I did try to put one coat of Recovery then one coat of Strengthener in this same line, with good results, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>cure the full 30 seconds</li>
      <li>It works just as good and nourishes your nails at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to do my manicure again &amp; try vitagel recovery 1 more time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of new at this DIY gel manicures, but I dived in head first.</li>
      <li>Maybe for the first time in my life I will have some longer nails!</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced and genuine.</li>
      <li>BUT -- my nails then began to crack lengthwise (instead of just breaking across the \\&quot;smile line.\\&quot;  Enter Recovery.  </li>
      <li>it peels right off and doesnt seem to leave the nail any healthier.</li>
      <li>THE RIGHT HAND STAYED A WEEK.  </li>
      <li>I stopped trying to get this right.  </li>
      <li>By the 2nd treatment, my nails have become very strong again.  </li>
      <li>I thought gel polish was the answer and bought my own LED light (takes less curing time that UV lights).  </li>
      <li>This polish peels off more gently than the regular foundation, and that&#x27;s important.  </li>
      <li>I currently have it on under a polish color and so far so good.</li>
      <li>My nails feel strong and any self-inflicted damage from &amp;#34;chiseling&amp;#34; off old polish is growing out.</li>
      <li>Received a very fast</li>
      <li>I am a dancer and want my toes to be pretty all the time, not just 3 months at a time (while I wait for my formaldehyde damaged toenails to heal).  </li>
      <li>It is really helpful!</li>
      <li>I applied it exactly as per the instructions in a Harmony Nail video on you tube.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.</li>
      <li>This product improved my nails after the first treatment.  </li>
      <li>I applied my first coat and cured it for 1 min (led lamp).</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>I love to use it when I want to do a color but don&#x27;t want to wait the 2 weeks that regular Shellac lasts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very thick and even though I&#x27;m quite experienced at applying Gelish, I struggled to coat my entire nail and not miss spots, particularly the ends which are the most important.</li>
      <li>My nails crumble like crackers if I have polish (gel or regular) for more than three months straight.  </li>
      <li>Item came fast, was was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I always used gel products in the past with good results, but switched to acrylic to save money.  </li>
      <li>After almost giving up on soak off gels because of the mess they turned my nails into, &#x27;recovery&#x27; is my ticket to nice shiny nails without the damage.</li>
      <li>The additional coats really worked well.  </li>
      <li>But using the Recovery really does make the nail stronger during wear.</li>
      <li>, it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I actually have a free edge</li>
      <li>Though some people may complain about the way this polish may peel off, I really don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
      <li>It comes off MUCH easier &amp; faster than</li>
      <li>But, I only cure this (the Recovery) for 15 seconds using this LED light</li>
      <li>Get as much gel off the brush as you can, and use what remains on all five fingers.</li>
      <li>my nails have not broken....</li>
      <li>I removed shine from nail, used the cleaner, then a used the bonder under nail tip, on free edge, and over entire nail.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really admit that this extra step helped the health of my nails.</li>
    <li> Despite the reviews, I wanted to try this and see how well it works. It chipped like crazy, both on me and my friend. I dont have these issues  with the regular foundation. I will use it on those days for just quick manicure, natural nail look, due to the fact it is one step system, but I know it will have to come off in a few days. It does come off easy with  the soak off solution.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!! This is my second bottle because I don&#x27;t want to run out!! I&#x27;m kind of new at this DIY gel manicures, but I dived in head first. I have 6 or 7 base coats and at least as many top coats. Vitagel is all I have used in MONTHS!! My longest manicure lasted 12 days but that is because I WANT to change my polish-not because I need to. My nails feel strong and any self-inflicted damage from &amp;#34;chiseling&amp;#34; off old polish is growing out. Sorry, but Vitagel hasn&#x27;t repaired damage. It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s not a panacea for all nail issues!! 😉 However, my nails feel strong, look healthy and stay polished!!! Oh! And btw, this works great as a clear polish too - just wipe with alcohol - no top coat needed!!</li>
    <li> This works well as a nail protector before putting on my colour.  You need to make sure that you use a thicker coat that you would expect and you have to make sure that you cap the end of your nail when you put this on</li>
    <li> Gelish recovery lasts about two weeks on my nails, longer than the regular foundation. It strengthens my nails, they are a less bendy, so I get less lifting and peeling, and they are finally growing to a nice length. It&#x27;s great to have the option to just use it as a clear coat if I don&#x27;t feel like color, it has a nice mirror shine to it without the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to this product is to apply the first layer super thin, just like the regular foundation. Get as much gel off the brush as you can, and use what remains on all five fingers. I heard some professional nail techs use the short stubby brush that comes with the regular foundation for the first layer. The next coat can be a little thicker, but not by much. I use three coats on my thin bendy nails, than color gel, followed by &#x27;top it off&#x27;. No more need for  &#x27;structure&#x27; for added strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still have trouble with chipping or lifting, try some gelish pro bond (not to be mistaken for ph bond, similar name, different product) on the tips, it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it soaks off twice as fast, and leaves smooth happy nails behind. After almost giving up on soak off gels because of the mess they turned my nails into, &#x27;recovery&#x27; is my ticket to nice shiny nails without the damage. Love the stuff!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I love this product. I use it occasionally when I take off the acrylics for a rest. Gelish recovery is truly the only strengthener I have found that not only stays on for two weeks but works too.  it helps leave my natural nails conditioned and returns them to their natural state. I also can use color gel or lacquer over Gelish Recovery if I choose to..</li>
    <li> I am new to doing my own gel manicures. I bought the Vitagel Recovery and the Gelish Basix kit. I followed the directions exactly. I prepped the nail, used the pH bond, applied 1 layer of Recovery and cured. I then applied the foundation cured, 2 layers of color cured, and finished with the Top It Off. I am in love!  My nails are much stronger and I have had absolutely NO PEELING!  I haven&#x27;t been this happy with a manicure in years.</li>
    <li> Love the thickness of this gel. Used it once and did not have any nails break. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> When I tried curing this under LED light, it would lift within a day.  Once I bought and started using a 36 watt UV lamp (with the CFL tube bulbs) It cures in two minutes under a UV lamp and stays on my nails. It does seem to gradually strengthen my nails.</li>
    <li> The directions suggest using this as a base coat, but when I followed them the polish peeled off within a couple of days. Was disappointed but decided to have another go.  I prepped nail as normal, but this time applied approx 4 very thin coats followed by Top it off and WOW.  I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did. Within 2-3 weeks I&#x27;ve went from having weak short peeling nails to strong long ones. I actually have a free edge 😃  this stuff is fab.  Be patient and persistent.  I recommend trying this if you have weak nails that break easy.  I&#x27;ve added a picture, this is the longest my natural nails have ever been in my entire life.</li>
    <li> Though some people may complain about the way this polish may peel off, I really don&#x27;t mind.  This polish peels off more gently than the regular foundation, and that&#x27;s important.  The regular foundation usually peels off and tears my nail into such a thin, weak nail, but not the Vitagel.  When this peels off, the whole thing comes off like a fake nail, but I have an LED lamp and polishes handy, and I don&#x27;t mind repolishing.  My main concern is the health of my nails.  The product does what it was meant to do: assist my nails in recovering from months and months of soak-off gel nails.  I add a coat of color, and I use both the pH bond and Top-It-Off top coat.  I would recommend it for anyone hoping to give their nails a break without going bare.</li>
    <li> No matter how I apply this, it will peel off in 2 days</li>
    <li> I love this stuff my nails of never look so beautiful. If you&#x27;ve never done your own nails you should really try. Received a very fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this does anything and it sucks as a base coat for any other colors which sort of makes it a failure in my collection</li>
    <li> I have really loved all gelish products.  However, this one tends to lift quicker for some reason &amp; it only happens on my dominant hand (i&#x27;m right handed.  I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This product really helped my nails to heal in a very short period of time. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My nails crumble like crackers if I have polish (gel or regular) for more than three months straight.  I thought gel polish was the answer and bought my own LED light (takes less curing time that UV lights).  BUT -- my nails then began to crack lengthwise (instead of just breaking across the \\&quot;smile line.\\&quot;  Enter Recovery.  I read about the fact that it might not adhere to my nails.  Since I work at home, I figured I could just reapply and took a chance.  The first time I tried just one coat (not even a top coat), with nail prep using a medium fine grit file.  Two days later all five nails on my left hand had peeled off.  THE RIGHT HAND STAYED A WEEK.  The only difference is, I had surface flaws in the right hand and had buffed the flaws out and put a second coat on the the right hand.  i have now used this for over a month and can HIGHLY recommend it, but have adapted these \\&quot;stay\\&quot; procedures.  I am very careful not to have had my hands in water or oil for at least 3 hours before I will use this.  I prep with a coarser grit file.  I cleanse my nails,  I use two coats of Gelish ph bond and let that dry.  I add one thin coats of Recovery and LED cure the full 30 seconds (I do not cleanse until the end).  Then another thin coat.  Then two coats of Simple Sheer and then a top coat curing in between).  The last time, this stayed on my nails until I needed to change because of nail growth,  A bonus is that it soaks off so much faster than regular foundation -- so I am getting less time in the acetone soak.  My nails look great!  I almost cannot believe this.  Please do not stop making this.  I did try to put one coat of Recovery then one coat of Strengthener in this same line, with good results, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had a pedicure professionally using this a base on my toenails, using the matte top coat, then using regular polish on top (to protect my nails from the evil formaldehyde in the regular polish)  I am just adding the polish as it gets dull and will take the Recovery off at home before I go again.  Again, this has been on two weeks! Yeah!  I am a dancer and want my toes to be pretty all the time, not just 3 months at a time (while I wait for my formaldehyde damaged toenails to heal).  I am thrilled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit after a couple more months of use:  I am finding another technique works even better and the polish stays on my nails (and my nails are still not crumbling).  I still use ph bond first and this product second. But, I only cure this (the Recovery) for 15 seconds using this LED light [[ASIN:B00AXSQCGK MelodySusie 2013 Upgraded 12W Violetili LED Light Lamp Gel Nail Dryer for Curing LED Gel &amp; Gelish Nail Polish Black + MelodySusieTM Nail Nipper]].  This lamp has a default 30 second cure time, so I am only curing for half the time (as in other instructions for gelish foundation.  Then, after that 15 second cure under an LED lamp, I apply a thin layer of Gelish regular foundation and cure that for 15 seconds.  Then I wipe the surface of the nail with a clean completely dry flat brush and THEN I apply the Gelish polish and top coat.  The gel manicure done this way is lasting just as long as with the regular foundation only and does not destroy my nails.  I am so happy!</li>
    <li> I use this when I&#x27;m too lazy to do the layers of gel and I just want a clear coat to protect my nails.  It goes on quick and easy and it cures to a great shine.  I usually go about a week before it starts lifting on me.</li>
    <li> I love this. When I was pregnant, my nails became super weak from many Shellac uses and hormones. It was impossible to grow my nails out. It wont bring your nails back to 100% but it&#x27;ll help speed the process. It took maybe 2 separate applications to get to about 85%-90% normal strength. It doesn&#x27;t wear as long as Shellac does but it sure does make an effort. If applied by itself it&#x27;ll last about 3-5 days. Applied in place of the Base and with shellac on top and sealed with a Top Coat, I&#x27;d say 5-7 days. I love to use it when I want to do a color but don&#x27;t want to wait the 2 weeks that regular Shellac lasts. Overall I&#x27;d recommend this product and be patient with it.</li>
    <li> came super quick !  have not used it yet but I love all the gelish products so im sure its going to be fabulous</li>
    <li> This Gelish vitagel is a great idea, help nails heal and recover from damage, but if the product cured properly maybe it would do it&#x27;s job.  Gelish knows there are issues with this product and they refuse to answer any questions, and blame the user on their application process.  It&#x27;s funny that all my other gelish products can be applied just fine, but this stuff just will not work.  It peels off within an hour and takes parts of your nail with it.  HORRIBLE!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product,  your nails will be better off without it.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time last month &amp; followed instructions on harmony&#x27;s website.....went on thick &amp; layers peeled away from my nails. Took it off &amp; just applied my foundation &amp; top it off. I&#x27;m ready to do my manicure again &amp; try vitagel recovery 1 more time. some sites said use 2 thin coats, curing after each &amp; then dry brush....will try &amp; post my results.</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as I though it will be. The instructions are not clear stated on it. They don&#x27;t explain the users that you can not use this product in combination with any other Gelish porduct or it will pill off next day.</li>
    <li> It is really helpful! My nails were getting very thin and damaged. They were peeling and cracking very easily. This worked immediately.  My nails look and feel healthier now.</li>
    <li> My nails were getting weakened from the acetone use to remove gel polish, i tried this and definitely saw a difference in my nail strength. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and so far I am happy with it.  I had been using gel polish on my nails for about a year and love the strength &amp; durability it provides, but have been noticing my nails seem weaker.  Gel polish has long-lasting durability, but it&#x27;s also kind of a pain to remove.  I started using the Vitagel Recovery treatment as a base under regular polish and so far it&#x27;s working great.  There have been a couple instances where a nail would start to lift, so I removed the polish &amp; soaked off the Vitagel with the foil method &amp; reapplied.  It comes off MUCH easier &amp; faster than regular Gelish polish - wrapped about 5 minutes &amp; it was totally peeled off.  My nails seem to be getting healthier as well.  I&#x27;ve been applying 3 very thin coats on my bare nail after applying either alcohol or nail sanitizer, making sure to cap each nail to prevent lifting.  I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Had this done at a salon - the thumb nail peeled off in its entirity after 3 days.  then slowly the others started to life and peel.  On returnign to salon was told &#x27;oh it only lasts a few days&#x27;???  Now have to soak rest off with neat acetone.  How beneficial is that for the nails?!</li>
    <li> I am a Gelish fan. this product works as stated!! Like i say: I truly love the Gelish polishes and this is great for damaged nails.</li>
    <li> I am using this product in place of a gel base coat.  My nails are damaged from acrylic products and some fungus picked up at a salon.  Gel products are easier on your nails.  The gel products hide my damaged nails and I am hoping the product will help restore the new nail growth.  I always used gel products in the past with good results, but switched to acrylic to save money.  BAD choice.  Stick with gel products.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions on the box and applied the product directly to my cleansed nail.  I applied my first coat and cured it for 1 min (led lamp). Then I applied a second coat and cured it again for 1 minute. Cleaned the nail. It&#x27;s been 48 hours with no signs of peeling. I think it works best when you apply it directly to your nail without any other base coat.</li>
    <li> My nails are really thin due to the fact that I love peeling gel nail polish off. This has helped them get the strength they need to look healthy and not peel off</li>
    <li> I have used the Recovery Vitagel 2X now and LOVE the results!  I use it as the base coat and like it better than the &#x27;original&#x27; Gelish base coat.  It works just as good and nourishes your nails at the same time.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Keeps nails from breaking while using this product!</li>
    <li> My nails were in terrible condition.  Weak and peeling.  This product improved my nails after the first treatment.  By the 2nd treatment, my nails have become very strong again.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> So far I am extremely happy...I have the worst nails, and have always had a horrible time with conventional polish, and I work hard with my hands and can&#x27;t keep my nails from breaking to the quick.  I read all of the reviews about this product peeling off....I am a total beginner to gel polish....mine has stayed on so far (it has been 1 week) my nails have not broken....I have a terrible break below the quick I am trying to grow out using super glue and a tea bag.  The Vitagel sealed it in, it is smooth and you hardly can see the repair.  Maybe for the first time in my life I will have some longer nails!</li>
    <li> I purchased the light, a pack of colors, base and top coat.  I stopped trying to get this right.  It didn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I put on it didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Item came fast, was was exactly what I was expecting. Reasonably priced and genuine. Highly recommend seller.</li>
    <li> Very thick and does not stay on the nail. it peels right off and doesnt seem to leave the nail any healthier.</li>
    <li> I have been really tough on my hands lately, helping out at my father in laws farm in cold weather, and it hasn&#x27;t been kind to my nails. When I discovered that my favorite brand Harmony had a &amp;#34;recovery&amp;#34; product that purported to strengthen and restore my nails, I jumped all over it. I was so excited to receive the product, and as soon as it arrived, I prepped my nails and applied it, following the directions carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within an hour the polish was peeling off in nail-bed-shaped chunks. It simply sloughed right off of my nails. I was pretty annoyed, did a regular mani, and put this on my shelf to sit for awhile as I stewed. I tried it again last week after reading a few prep tutorials, except this time putting Harmony color over it as well. Cured, prepped, etc just as the directions and tutorials suggested. Alas, again, within an hour, my nails were sloughing and peeling off...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it, and the customer service was fantastic. I will definitely not be buying this again, and steering folks away from it. It&#x27;s not as good as the regular gel base, and is more trouble (and cost) than it is worth.</li>
    <li> Ok, so here is my take on the vitagel recovery product. I tried this product three times and with each attempt, the polish peeled off in 24 hours! so frustrating! I followed the directions explicitly and had the same problem each time, just as some of the other reviewers described. After watching a few tutorials online I finally found a method that works like a charm! My nails were incredibly weak from trying many different nail enhancement techniques at home. The way I apply this product is as follows: First, I cleanse my nails and push back my cuticles. I buff the surface of my nails with a nail buffer and cleanse again. Then, I don&#x27;t apply the ph-bond as suggested by gelish. I apply a nail primer instead called (NO Lift Nails). This primer requires that no other nail prep or ph bond be used. It is kind of an all in one. I think this step has been the trick to keeping this product bonded to the nail. Next, I apply three to four coats VERY thinly curing between each coat. Gelish only suggests applying one to two coats. That did not work for me. The additional coats really worked well.  I have had the product on my nails for 7 days without any peeling or lifting of any kind! Three of my nails were split all the way into the nail plate before applying this product. One nail has completely healed and the other  two are almost there. My nails feel and look stronger already and it has only been a week! I am truly excited. Hopefully this helps.</li>
    <li> I love Harmony Gelish and this is the first product I&#x27;ve been disappointed in. I had such high hopes for a UV cured strengthener, but this disappointed. It was expensive, but the price didn&#x27;t translate into quality. It&#x27;s very thick and even though I&#x27;m quite experienced at applying Gelish, I struggled to coat my entire nail and not miss spots, particularly the ends which are the most important. It didn&#x27;t stay on well and I&#x27;m having trouble finding any benefit to this product. Just use the foundation gel and leave it at that.</li>
    <li> use it as your base coat before adding the gel nail polish, or wear it alone to keep natural nails strong</li>
    <li> I am new to gel polish and had no problems with this item. I applied two layers with no top coat  and it wore for 2 weeks. I currently have it on under a polish color and so far so good. I applied it exactly as per the instructions in a Harmony Nail video on you tube. I removed shine from nail, used the cleaner, then a used the bonder under nail tip, on free edge, and over entire nail. When wearing under a color I used a dry brush on the second coat of recovery before applying color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails peel and when I removed this after 2 weeks the tears were lower down on my nails and the nail above looked healthier. Wearing recovery alone I still nicked the end of my nails so structure is still needed to prevent breakage if you are rough. As a reference I tried another hybrid polish and due to my nails it peeled off in less than 24 hours. No peeling with this gelish product and I actually had to remove it.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Hardens my very weak nails.</li>
    <li> This is a mini bottle.  It does not say that in the description but it says it on the bottle when it arrives. If you are not aware of the ounces in a normal size bottle you would not know this.  The item should go back but of course I will lose the shipping charges so not sure it&#x27;s worth the return.  This is not the same size bottle you see at the salon!!!  Buyers beware!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is for trained professionals to use, so instead of crying out that it doesn&#x27;t work, you need to realize that application is a trained technique with Hand and Nail Harmony products. We are trained to prep properly and to trouble shoot. This product is great when you know how to use it. It&#x27;s not the product it&#x27;s you. Also this product again cannot deposit any vitamins or nutrients into your nail plate. It is scientifically impossible. The nail is made of keratin and the only topical product that helps the nail is OIL. The right kind of oil. But using the Recovery really does make the nail stronger during wear. Your nails will go back to their original condition when it is removed. Use it OVER your foundation or light cured base coat of choice and not as the base coat or it will peel right off. Makes it easier to transition from nail enhancements to natural nails as it gives those much needed layers of strength and flexibility the nail needs in order to be protected from breaking. Again when you soak it off your nails will be just like they were. There is no treatment or absorption by the nail plate from vitagel. It is a temporary- while wearing it- fix. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I had initially gotten acrylic nails and once i removed them it left me with thin, dry, and brittle nails! I needed a miracle(or glue) to keep my nails from breaking. I purchased this item and applied the coat and cured it but noticed that it didn&#x27;t stay evenly on the nail so i applied a second(Thick) coat on top of the first uneven one and voila! nice and thick glossy nails! They didn&#x27;t peel! i went ahead and applied my color gel on top and then followed by the top-it off finishing gel and my nails look and are as strong as a rock! Definitely recommend if u have weak nails that you are trying to grow out. Makes them even more resistant than gel color alone! a must have :) will always have this handy from now on.</li>
