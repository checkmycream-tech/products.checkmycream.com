      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mirror!</li>
      <li>Love this mirror!</li>
      <li>Once you get over the horror of seeing yourself up that close you&#x27;ll love these mirrors, too!</li>
      <li>It is a good mirror and works great for this special application.  </li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s so easy to assemble, it is great for travel, too.</li>
      <li>I own three of these mirrors (upstairs bath, downstairs bath, and one for travel).</li>
      <li>Kind of a pain when you are using it as a table vanity.</li>
      <li>Since I am handy with tools I am going to figure out a way to limit its rotation problem by applying bandage tape in the holder.</li>
      <li>It would be perfectly suited as a useful, non-travel, bathroom counter or bureau top mirror.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to assemble to either hang up or use on top of a vanity.</li>
      <li>They were all delivered quickly in very secure packaging.</li>
      <li>I love the 10X side.  </li>
      <li>Great for people that cant see very well.  </li>
      <li>In reality, most places I&#x27;d like to stick the mirror aren&#x27;t fitting for suction cups.  </li>
      <li>They love them, too, and now are either ordering more for themselves or asking where I got them so their friends can order them.  </li>
      <li>Great quality and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I was able to use it, and sometimes not.  </li>
      <li>wish I had bought more as gifts.</li>
      <li>So it is just suctioned to my glass top desk.  </li>
      <li>Most hotel walls are painted with texture or wall papered.  </li>
      <li>This would have been better if the bottom mirror which has the largest magnification would be more easily accessible.</li>
      <li>Very good mirror, several magnifications for all my needs.  </li>
      <li>make up which is great because that hurt my back.</li>
      <li>I prefer 1X magnification because I find distortion very distracting; this was the only gooseneck mirror I could find that has 1X, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>and love it so much</li>
      <li>I get 3 different ones in one product that is lightweight, adjustable, and better looking than most of its cheap counterparts.</li>
      <li>The suction to my big mirror on the wall is my favorite with the extension arm is the bomb!</li>
      <li>Nice idea in theory only.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t review the mounting portion as I use it as a stand, but compared to other vanity mirrors with various magnifications, this is perfect!!  </li>
      <li>The only drawback is that, since the mirrors are interchangeable, they screw off very easily.</li>
      <li>other than that it is a pretty good mirror</li>
      <li>Above quality for the price and easy installation for anyone!</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t seem to have very much range in the goose neck.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first mirror like this at a bath store.  </li>
      <li>It really allows me to see EVERYTHING!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
      <li>Truthfully when I buy a magnified mirror I do NOT want it to come with a regular mirror at all.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because it had a two mirrors with magnification in addition to a regular mirror instead of just one with magnified mirror as many do.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Now I can put my makeup on hands-free, and it really speeds up the process.</li>
      <li>I also find that I do not use it as much as I would have since it is not lighted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine mirror, but a little pricey for only being able to use it sporadically.  </li>
      <li>Loved it and looked at that same store later for a second one and couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
      <li>Anyway I would like this a lot more if the magnified mirrors were back to back that way</li>
      <li>The gooseneck allows one to change the angle of the nirror to match the location of the particular hummingbird nest being observed.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this mirror</li>
      <li>My whole bathroom is completely covered with tile and its a rental</li>
      <li>The only way to get the 10x mirror to be useful is to stick it to something.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
      <li>While I liked the goose neck, I found the whole thing with &#x27;three mirrors in one&#x27; tedious, especially because the magnification levels I needed most were on opposite ends, i.e. one of them was always on the bottom.</li>
      <li>However, suction cups only grip onto a smooth, flat surface.  </li>
      <li>You pretty much need to go to your bathroom or use a slick flat surface to utilize the 10x mirror.</li>
      <li>I am short and the mirrors that fit flat on the mirror made it hard for me to see correctly.</li>

<li> Much larger than I expected.  </li>
<li> you will see that the pole is situated in the center to support the goose neck and other double sided mirror.</li>
<li> I like to get up close to the mirror to apply my makeup--a habit I developed when I used to wear glasses--and that usually entails holding the mirror and makeup in one hand while applying it with the other.</li>
<li> Versatility is amazing with the suction cup base.  </li>
<li> Suction cups were not secure enough for mounting the mirror on the wall.</li>
<li> the magnified portion is not strong enough.....</li>
<li> All bathrooms have regular mirrors so why would I need another one - esp a small one?</li>
<li> I was not sure how it would work with three separate mirror surfaces, but it is so simple and you don&#x27;t have to remove one mirror surface to use the other.  </li>
<li> Poor design IMO and could be much better (or) separated in to two products with a normal base.</li>
<li> it starts becoming loose from it&#x27;s post which is annoying.  </li>
<li> base is the 10x mirror which I love</li>
<li> It does not stay in place and the arm is a little flimsy for the weight.</li>
<li> Item to heavy to carry on a plane in suitcase.</li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t want to waste wall space</li>
<li> This product is too heavy to use for travel nowadays with all the weight restrictions.  </li>
<li> To heavy to mount on mirror or wall with suction cups provided.</li>
<li> There is no way to use the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; as a secure table base.</li>
<li> One problem I faced is the heavy side causes the thing to swivel downward.</li>
<li> ...unless you usually carry something this cumbersome when you travel.</li>
<li> Arrived broken from having a frame inserted the wrong way down on the 1x mirror.  </li>
<li> I found it slightly heavy, awkward and inconvenient to even consider packing it in suitcase.</li>
<li> Scary, but I can see it all.  </li>
<li> I read some of the reviews before buying but still thought the item would work, but i was wrong.</li>
<li> Unfortunately that was not what I was looking for or needing at this time</li>
<li> but it is impossible to use it without holding</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to have very much range in the goose neck.  The 10X is on the lone side and I even tried to swop the positions and that didn&#x27;t work either.  I think the goose neck flexibleness is because it is too short.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great.  I was not sure how it would work with three separate mirror surfaces, but it is so simple and you don&#x27;t have to remove one mirror surface to use the other.  I love the 10X side.  It really allows me to see EVERYTHING!  Scary, but I can see it all.  However, I did not get my travel bag, come to think of it.</li>
    <li> My friend had a mirror like this and I loved it. I even take it on vacation...I can&#x27;t live with out it. The suction to my big mirror on the wall is my favorite with the extension arm is the bomb! Bought 3 wish I had bought more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Just the travel mirror I have been looking for. I am short and the mirrors that fit flat on the mirror made it hard for me to see correctly. Great quality and fast delivery. It&#x27;s very easy to assemble to either hang up or use on top of a vanity. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken from having a frame inserted the wrong way down on the 1x mirror.  Returned.  Got another brand altogether.</li>
    <li> Love it! Mounted to my bathroom mirror and now I can see to put on makeup without glasses.</li>
    <li> This would have been better if the bottom mirror which has the largest magnification would be more easily accessible. other than that it is a pretty good mirror</li>
    <li> The mirrors are nice and a good size.  However, suction cups only grip onto a smooth, flat surface.  In reality, most places I&#x27;d like to stick the mirror aren&#x27;t fitting for suction cups.  I wanted it for travel.  Most hotel walls are painted with texture or wall papered.  Sometimes I was able to use it, and sometimes not.  It&#x27;s a fine mirror, but a little pricey for only being able to use it sporadically.  There are 3 good quality suction cups.</li>
    <li> Well made and comes with a magnification for everyone. The neck could be a touch longer, but no big deal. We bought 3. They were all delivered quickly in very secure packaging.</li>
    <li> Very good mirror, several magnifications for all my needs.  Since it&#x27;s so easy to assemble, it is great for travel, too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review the mounting portion as I use it as a stand, but compared to other vanity mirrors with various magnifications, this is perfect!!  I get 3 different ones in one product that is lightweight, adjustable, and better looking than most of its cheap counterparts.</li>
    <li> Much larger than I expected.  Versatility is amazing with the suction cup base.  I have it on the bathroom mirror and I no longer have to bend over the counter to do my eye make up which is great because that hurt my back.</li>
    <li> Excellent shipping, great product, would buy again. A+++</li>
    <li> the magnified portion is not strong enough.....and I didn&#x27;t want to waste wall space so the mirror went in the closet</li>
    <li> Above quality for the price and easy installation for anyone! This product should be a must have for the powder room!</li>
    <li> This product is too heavy to use for travel nowadays with all the weight restrictions.  Further, it did not come with a travel bag as advertised. I sent an inquiry asking where it was and could i get the travel bag.  I am still waiting for a repy which means no one bothered to respond back.</li>
    <li> Great for people that cant see very well.  I have had one of these for several years and lost it and bought another of the same</li>
    <li> I like how it has a stand and I can use it either way on my desk.  I was planning on mounting it when I bought it but I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s held by 3 suction cups, and no nails/screws.  So it is just suctioned to my glass top desk.  Every time I turn it it starts becoming loose from it&#x27;s post which is annoying.  And sometimes it slides out of the stand too.</li>
    <li> Perfect it is what I have been looking for. My whole bathroom is completely covered with tile and its a rental so I do not want to break the owners tiles to put one of the others up. The suction on these cups are great. One problem I faced is the heavy side causes the thing to swivel downward. It does not stay in place and the arm is a little flimsy for the weight. Since I am handy with tools I am going to figure out a way to limit its rotation problem by applying bandage tape in the holder. this should give it a snug hold</li>
    <li> ...unless you usually carry something this cumbersome when you travel. I found it slightly heavy, awkward and inconvenient to even consider packing it in suitcase. It would be perfectly suited as a useful, non-travel, bathroom counter or bureau top mirror. Unfortunately that was not what I was looking for or needing at this time so it was returned.</li>
    <li> This mirror was purchased to mount on the end of a telescoping pole for the purpose of visually monitoring the inside of hummingbird nests.  It is a good mirror and works great for this special application.  The gooseneck allows one to change the angle of the nirror to match the location of the particular hummingbird nest being observed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mirror! I was wanting a mirror that could be used like a side mirror that suctioned to the front/regular mirror in a bathroom for when i travel and need to see the back of my hair free-handedly so that I could put hair pins in or whatever. This works PERFECTLY! This will be perfect for when I travel! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I already have a mirror like this and it is excellent for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror however because of the way the thing is made to attach to a mirror, it falls off. MY sister has one but hers is made a bit differently and works like it should. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Almost immediately threw out the wall mount. Suction cups were not secure enough for mounting the mirror on the wall. Like the versatility of the mirror though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it had a two mirrors with magnification in addition to a regular mirror instead of just one with magnified mirror as many do. The drawback is that the magnified mirrors are not on opposite sides of each other, but on opposite ends. Truthfully when I buy a magnified mirror I do NOT want it to come with a regular mirror at all. All bathrooms have regular mirrors so why would I need another one - esp a small one? Anyway I would like this a lot more if the magnified mirrors were back to back that way I could mount it on the wall and have access to both magnified mirrors. I also find that I do not use it as much as I would have since it is not lighted.</li>
    <li> Item To heavy to mount on mirror or wall with suction cups provided. Item to heavy to carry on a plane in suitcase. I read some of the reviews before buying but still thought the item would work, but i was wrong.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this mirror but it turned out that it wasn&#x27;t for me. While I liked the goose neck, I found the whole thing with &#x27;three mirrors in one&#x27; tedious, especially because the magnification levels I needed most were on opposite ends, i.e. one of them was always on the bottom. The goose neck also ended up being too short when the mirror sat on the table. Nice idea in theory only.</li>
    <li> I bought my first mirror like this at a bath store.  Loved it and looked at that same store later for a second one and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I finally found it  on Amazon.com.  Whoo hoo.  I own three of these mirrors (upstairs bath, downstairs bath, and one for travel). and love it so much I also sent one to each of my five sisters or sisters-in-law last year.  They love them, too, and now are either ordering more for themselves or asking where I got them so their friends can order them.  These mirrors are especially great for those of us who no longer have perfect eyesight and need that magnification.  Once you get over the horror of seeing yourself up that close you&#x27;ll love these mirrors, too!</li>
    <li> Very handy.  My wife likes it for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> I have one in each bathroom. I especially like the 1x magnification and the flexibility in placement. Exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
    <li> I like it as a table top vanity but the bottom part it stands on is essentially useless as a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is the 10x mirror which I love but it is impossible to use it without holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look you will see that the pole is situated in the center to support the goose neck and other double sided mirror. There is no way to use the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; as a secure table base. The only way to get the 10x mirror to be useful is to stick it to something. Kind of a pain when you are using it as a table vanity. You pretty much need to go to your bathroom or use a slick flat surface to utilize the 10x mirror. Poor design IMO and could be much better (or) separated in to two products with a normal base.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! I like to get up close to the mirror to apply my makeup--a habit I developed when I used to wear glasses--and that usually entails holding the mirror and makeup in one hand while applying it with the other. Now I can put my makeup on hands-free, and it really speeds up the process. I prefer 1X magnification because I find distortion very distracting; this was the only gooseneck mirror I could find that has 1X, and it&#x27;s great! The only drawback is that, since the mirrors are interchangeable, they screw off very easily. Sometimes, when I&#x27;m trying to adjust the angle of the mirror, it unscrews a bit. I don&#x27;t use the wall mount, so I can&#x27;t speak to that function.</li>
