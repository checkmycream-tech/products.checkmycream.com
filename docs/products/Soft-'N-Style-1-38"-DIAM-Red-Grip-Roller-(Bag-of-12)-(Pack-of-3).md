<li> have used velcro rollers before, but they are always hard to get out of your hair, Not with these, they stay put in your hair but they don&#x27;t pull all your hair out when you remove them.&lt;br</li>
<li> The rollers are hard but stay in your hair...</li>
<li> I have very thick hair.  </li>

    <li> Pack of three includes a very generous amount of rollers.  They stay in place and are the right size for my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Good rollers but NOT for long hair.....The amount they send you is generous! The rollers are hard but stay in your hair...This size was a bit small for what I wanted so I bought the pink color which was the correct size. I ended up using this size as well. The rollers are comfortable. Not comfortable enough to sleep in but easy to use with damp hair and a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I am pleased with these rollers. They are not truly soft, but they work very well. I need to add that the price was not bad,for three packages.</li>
    <li> SHAME, SHAME....The package of velcro rollers that arrived were clearly marked 1-3/8&amp;#34;. May not seem like a big deal but I have used velcro rollers in my hair for most of my life. To an expert, the difference is huge. AMAZON PRIME...I am very surprised.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers. GREAT price and you get 36. I find the key with taking them out is to let your hair cool (I dry my hair with curlers in under a hair dryer) then begin removing them from the bottom up. Take bottom ones out gently unrolling them pulling down and out, the next layer pull up and out. No hair sticks and they don&#x27;t get caught or tangled in my hair then.  These curlers give me a little smaller curl than I like so I also bought the 2&amp;#34; ones. I mix and match them for a nice look.</li>
    <li> These are great! I have shoulder length finger curled hair and these made my hair turn into loose curls. They stay in place and do a good job.</li>
    <li> I have short curly thick hair (About 5 inches long, but curls up to bang length. I am growing it after chemo.) It looks like Dr. Suess naturally right now. I tried the 2&amp;#34; rollers, but they were too big for my hair length-returned those. I then tried these (1-1/2&amp;#34;) and it helped, but didn&#x27;t straighten it enough. I finally settled on the 1 3/4 inch roller. Some people report using about 6 curlers. It takes about 12 to do my hair.</li>
    <li> Roller was not as soft as expected.</li>
    <li> Got them quickly but the wife said they were not the size she wanted. They are fine just ordered the wrong size.</li>
    <li> Great curlers for the price, arrived well packed and exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;velcro rollers&amp;#34; for decades and have always liked them a lot.</li>
    <li> Love these!  I have very thick hair.  These are the only curlers that will grab and hold.</li>
    <li> I Like the size. Wish I could find a 3 incher for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing value! 36 rolls for under $12! I had been buying these at Sallys in packages of six for $6.99! These were a steal and work exactly the same.</li>
    <li> These rollers are exactly as described.  After purchasing I realized that I needed a 2-3&amp;#34; Velcro roller to get the look I was after.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good, but some stay in and some don&#x27;t. The curl brushed out after I took the rollers out like I never had them in, but I only kept them in maybe 10 minutes, probably should have tried longer.</li>
    <li> Expected these to be just a little larger but the rollers are fine and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Great deal on rollers!  Good quality.</li>
    <li> They stay in well. I don&#x27;t know if it is them or the operator (aka me), but I haven&#x27;t quite got the curl from them that I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I was getting 36 rollers at this price, but they came in 3 bags of 12 rollers each.&lt;br /&gt;I have used velcro rollers before, but they are always hard to get out of your hair, Not with these, they stay put in your hair but they don&#x27;t pull all your hair out when you remove them.&lt;br /&gt;Great Buy.</li>
    <li> Grips very well. Sleep w them on and when you wake you&#x27;ll have soo much volume... Love them to</li>
    <li> Love Them.... Thank You</li>
