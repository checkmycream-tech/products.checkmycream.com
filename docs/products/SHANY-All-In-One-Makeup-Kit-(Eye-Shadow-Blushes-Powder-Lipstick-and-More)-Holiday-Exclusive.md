<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A great one gift for those in need of makeup!!!!!</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> In addition to the subject I would have expected more lipticks  , nail colors etc than blushes which would have worked better as a combination I think</li>
    <li> my mom had bought me this 2-3 years ago for xmas and it was my first time messing around with eyeshadow ever in my life I was 19 yrs old. That same xmas my dad had got me a sephora palette and so right off the back I had two very different palettes and of course the colors in this palette didn&#x27;t come close to how awesome the sephora palette is. so here&#x27;s my review on this item now that I&#x27;ve had it for close to 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow: top&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I have never been able to pick up the colors in this palette w/any eyeshadow brush! I tried countless brushes, i even tried the little eyeshadow applicators it came with and it just wasn&#x27;t working, I even tried applying them wet and I just got no progress, so the only way I had been able to use this product was by using the pads of my finger and rubbing as much color as I can onto my finger and padding it on. Idk I didn&#x27;t bother reading any other reviews on this product so idk what other ppl are saying maybe I just had a bad palette im not sure but application of these eyeshadows sucks in my personal opinion. Needless to say once u manage to actually get some on ur eyes it does look nice and wears well I just was never able to do a complete eyeshadow look using this palette alone, Only for the base color all over the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lips: middle&lt;br /&gt;Ive never been a fan of lipgloss type things bc they are thick and sticky and my hair just gets stuck and just yuck u get the picture so I never used any of these on myself but when I&#x27;ve done other peoples makeup I do use them and they do show up well they aren&#x27;t sheer.&lt;br /&gt;If I remember correctly eyeliners came in here too (I&#x27;ve lost them now lol) I think they were half colors like one was blue and brown another was black and something im not sure but those colors never really showed up when id line my waterlines so instead I use them as eyebrow fillers and it worked in that way for me and also to map out designs on my face for halloween but as far as wearing it as eyeliner, no... didn&#x27;t do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blush/concealer/powder/bronzer: bottom&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE ONLY PART I LIKE ABOUT THIS WHOLE MAKEUP KIT.&lt;br /&gt;Blush: There is a lot of different blushes and I&#x27;ve used them all and still do til this day and its great for different makeup looks, day or night.&lt;br /&gt;Concealer: two different shades.  I personally don&#x27;t like this kind of concealer bc its a little tacky so I have to set it w/a setting powder but it did work for me n my under eye area. I also have used it as a highlight in my eyeshadow. This was the first thing to finish in my kit lol my friend has ap darker skin tone and I was able to use the dark concealer on her and it worked great, just the same as the light one that I had used up.&lt;br /&gt;Powder: I speak for myself when I say that the powder that came in this palette was my color so it worked for me and it was full coverage. (For me at least) I&#x27;ve always been the type of person to wear light foundation if not a bb cream and just put some translucent powder finish over it and I have a flawless face, so this powder was the first powder I&#x27;ve used and it worked great. Ive also run out of this, I used it more as an eyeshadow base when I did a pin up winged eyeliner look and not so much as the intended purpose as face powder&lt;br /&gt;bronzer: its a bronzer what can I say? I use it as an eyeshadow bc the shade of bronzer is the wrong shade for my skin tone it makes me look orange but this looks beautiful on my friend who has a darker skin tone. It brings a nice warmth to her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, about 3 years later. I still have this but I&#x27;ve taken it apart and cut out all the plastic and all I have are pretty much all the blushes and bronzer and I still use them and love them. The eyeshadows I also still have but never use them bc I have 3 other palettes that just work way better. same with the lip colors I was going to throw them away but I decided to hang on to them and let my little cousins use them since they are tweens and beginning to have an interest in makeup. In short I only used and loved 1/3 of this makeup kit and for the price I wouldn&#x27;t buy it, there&#x27;s so many great eyeshadow palettes here on amazon but this one definitely isn&#x27;t one of them sorry.nce they are tweens and beginning to have an interest in makeup. In short I only used and loved 1/3 of this makeup kit and for the price I wouldn&#x27;t buy it, there&#x27;s so many great eyeshadow palettes here on amazon but this one definitely isn&#x27;t one of them sorry.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s a big box of makeup...</li>
    <li> Great for a teen to play. Fir a mommy--Splurge on Nars. Even Revlon is good stuff. This is more toy-like. Fun but impractical for a day to day natural face. Good way to try crazy colors though.</li>
    <li> Product buy a gift for my wife is delighted with the product. Excellent presentation I congratulate you.</li>
    <li> I took a chance with the Cameo All In One Makeup Kit (Eyeshadow Palette, Blushes, Powder and More)... but when it arrived my wife was surprise and very happy, it was pack very nicely. I recommend to produce to everyone</li>
    <li> Daughter loves her &#x27;very own make-up set&#x27;</li>
    <li> Recieved as mentioned</li>
    <li> My step daughter is turning 15 and I wanted to get a special gift from me.  She has been hinting about wearing makeup because some of her friend have been awarded that privilege.  Mom is on the fence about this subject.  This purchase was solely on reviews.  My gift was the last one she opened and was shocked, thrilled and surprised at the same time.  According to my source this is the best makeup ever.</li>
    <li> Great set, small kit&#x27; found same at Walmart cheaper. Literally.</li>
    <li> I love this make up kit!  The eyeshadows are great with so many colors to choose from. My favorite is the lipstick.  Stays on and appears to be long wearing. This kit has everything, including eyeliners, blush and powder.  The case is a pretty red vinyl one with a mirror.  This would make a nice gift for anyone.  Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this makeup kit for my best friend&#x27;s relative and she loved it. Am happy with it :)</li>
    <li> I love the design of the case. It&#x27;s easy to use, unfold, and re-fold, and holds everything in an organized way. I also like that it&#x27;s lightweight but feels sturdy. The makeup is PRETTY good, the only issues I have with it are that the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t seem to go on very well (it&#x27;s a little dry and hard to use) and that the applicator brushes/ sponges that come with it aren&#x27;t good quality. If you have your own brushes this product is still quite nice and usable. Liked the lip gloss, bronzer, blush, and eyeshadow a LOT!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and hoping she like it I have no idea with this thing so can not say much about it hehe,, I&#x27;m a man sorry</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 11 and 13 year old as one of their Xmas gift, and they love, love, love it, and I also do. Colors in this set are perfect for them because they are not too bright as neon colors. Great gift for teenagers who are just starting to wear makeup.</li>
    <li> This is very nice. It is so convenient to bring around without packing a whole lot of stuff. The eye shadow color could be more vibrant tho.</li>
    <li> Good value. Looks the same on a face as the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> You really get what you pay for.. pretty crappy..doesn&#x27;t really stay on longer then 20 min. If that! Maybe the best part is the box it came in</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 3rd grade granddaughter as a \\&quot;Strait A\\&quot; present. She wants to be a makeup artist. She LOVES it! The colors are beautiful, the case is lovely. Everything arrived early in perfect shape. I only shop for bargains and this saved me $10. It was on sale, plus I bought it using \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a professional dancer and I bought her 6 different things for Christmas. This was one of them. She said that they arrived on time, in good condition and that she was very happy with ALL items. I live in another country, so I have no personal knowledge of each item.</li>
    <li> item had broken mirror and many missing parts...what a shame.&lt;br /&gt;it was a gift for my wife and is broken.</li>
    <li> There are more shimmers than I wanted, but overall it&#x27;s nice.  A lot of colors I&#x27;ll probably never use.  I should have stuck with the nude pallet.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter to play make-up with.  It&#x27;s ok - the packaging is very flimsy and the back of it broke to stand it up after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> this was purchased as a gift and once all make-up is used this can be used as a make-up carry all or whatever. The box itself is very durable and it has a lot of great colors. We were very impressed.</li>
    <li> Its terrible!! The eye-shadow is not as bright when you put it on. You can&#x27;t even tell you have any on until you put 5 pounds of it on, and even then it&#x27;s still hard to see!! Your better off buying makeup from lancome or Mac! Don&#x27;t waste ypur money on this cheap makeup!!!</li>
    <li> For this price I was expecting a lot more make-up. Each spot on this plastic tray is very shallow. Doesn&#x27;t give you much make-up. Difficult to get to the colors in the rear of each tray. You have to pull out each tray and then force it back in again.&lt;br /&gt;The container is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying something like this again.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!! Great value for all that came in this kit.  I am so excited, can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my friend and she LOVED it! Thinking of getting one for myself too!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cosmetics set to give to a distant relative.  Just like the sets available during christmas time.  I checked all the stores but none had the sets with everything in them.  So I decided to look on Amazon and &#x27;Wallah&#x27; I found what I was looking for. Its a great case with a range of colors included.  Although I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of cosmetics since I am not the end user but everything looked good and everyone praised the bride&#x27;s beauty case a lot</li>
    <li> I have a 7 yo and a 14 yo daughters and they both loved it. They are still using it actually. So nice I actually bought my wife one!</li>
    <li> The makeup is good...especially for a beginner like me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case makes it hard to access the makeup...also, the cheap plastic holder makes it even harder to gain access to the makeup...if you tear the plastic, you tear the part the makeup actually sits in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away the star for having something of good quality in a bad place.</li>
    <li> This box of make up is perfect for my 12 year old for testing colours and styles its the perfect size box</li>
    <li> She loved the All in one Makeup Kit.  It was packaged nicely and she is pleased with the variety and make up line.</li>
    <li> my eyes look pretty now because of this! exemplary kit from Shany that I WILL RECOMMEND TO ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW</li>
    <li> bought it for someone  and she really likes it</li>
    <li> excellent gift to my daughter</li>
    <li> nice i like it alot reccomened by me so buy it bc i said so ok? ok. swag doe aye</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she is in love with it. She says she feels like a make-up artist. The price was reasonable and it showed up on time.</li>
    <li> Very good selection of colors.  The kit is small and very portable for taking on trips.  The color lasts, don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get coverage.</li>
    <li> Kind of small but I guess it was ok.  My granddaughter liked it.</li>
    <li> This product was what I was looking for a 14 year old granddaughter and I know she will love it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> However I understand from the &amp;#34;gift receiver&amp;#34; that it arrived on time, in perfect condition, and was everything it was promised to be.</li>
    <li> eye shadow kit that my wife loves and needs for her beautification needs.</li>
    <li> Comes in adorable box ; it was actually a gift and she loved it . I would really recommend this product</li>
    <li> My 9 year all loved it!  She got it for Christmas.  It arrived in perfect conditions and it has a huge variety of colors</li>
    <li> This makeup kit was perfect for my 6 year old. Needless to say, it just may last her forever! There is so much makeup, here! Very nice and worth the cost as it comes with the case and mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 13th birthday. She loves it!</li>
    <li> A little small.exepected to use this as extra storage tote. It should state the size when posted. Otherwise pretty good.</li>
    <li> box is cute, and the makeup is ok.... but the age range is highschool.... i would have loved it then!</li>
    <li> Searched under Make Up Made Inn USA and this was listed but it is all made in China. Sending it back.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift and she&#x27;s so in love with it.  She took a trip just so she can carry this cute case with her.  She says it has everything you need.</li>
    <li> She loved it. Was up the next day trying out the different colors and glosses. If it had more brushes it would be a 5star</li>
    <li> My niece loves this for a birthday present! She is 14 and it was her first makeup kit, she uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> Good day , I have made ​​the purchase of a product ( Shany All In One Makeup Kit) , I deducted from the credit card , you have not yet been loaded payment and have not sent me the product , please to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good day , I made the purchase of Shany All In One Makeup Kit, I made ​​the discount card and you have not even sent me the pro[[ASIN:B008PW0PY6 SHANY All In One Makeup Kit (Eyeshadow Palette, Blushes, Powder and More) Holiday Exclusive]]duct</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife and she loved the selection of make up that came with the box. The only bad thing about this product is that the brushes that are included are not the greatest.</li>
    <li> gracias, excelente todo tal cual lo describen . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous.  The quality is pretty decent, however the quantity could be better.  The shadows are pretty shallow.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my granddaughter&#x27;s sixteenth birthday</li>
    <li> Lots of makeup in this case, great price, happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Daughter loved it, good for playtime and dress up</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> My wife loved getting all the makeup as a gift but the lip is cheat and ripped off the first time she tried to carry it.</li>
    <li> I got this kit about 3 years ago as a Christmas present. The eye shadows lack pigment, but show up with a few layers (a lot of fall out though)&lt;br /&gt;For a beginner getting used to make up, this is a good idea to get them started.&lt;br /&gt;For someone with more experience hoping to get a bundle of make up, not for you.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the kids to play with, they love it.  Very cheap quality makeup.  All in cheap plastic packaging that pulls out.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Now I finally have all the make up in one place, and it all fits. There was even room to put my powder make up in the top of it, so no more digging through the drawer to find what I want. Makes me feel absolutely spoiled, and I love it!</li>
    <li> all came at the appointed time and undamaged recommend&lt;br /&gt;everything was as I saw on page are respopnsable and fast deliveries</li>
    <li> Not impressed. You can&#x27;t get to the make-up in the back. The plastic holders are very flimsy!! More like paper</li>
    <li> nice little set for a young girl. (12)</li>
    <li> Looks bigger online .....good for travel  or for a young girl... Can add on to this set .... The price is great</li>
    <li> There is nothing high quality here. You get the bare essentials(and a lot of them) for next to nothing. It makes a good starter kit and is worth the next to nothing paid for it. for starters the lipsticks that come with the kit are very hard(unlike My cover girl that goes on like butter) It&#x27;s like a crayola. The eye liner isn&#x27;t much different than a #2 pencil. I like the lipgloss and the sheer veriety of colors make this kit worth buying. I will stick with my Makeup This is good for the price. Belive me If you buy what I usually use you will spend a whole lot more for a whole lot less. just though i&#x27;d try something else and this is great for the price. I may give it to my neice to play with(After throwing away the eye liner).</li>
    <li> This kit turned out to be smaller than I had thought, but the case is adorable and it has plenty of makeup to keep a tween busy getting pretty.</li>
    <li> The case is good, however I have sensitive skin and everything burned. I had several patches of red bumpy skin for days.&lt;br /&gt;even with the lipgloss</li>
    <li> First the good. The case is cute and sturdy. Has a lot of options. I love the lip stick and gloss it includes. The bad stuff. Case was not designed well at all trying to get to the product in it is a pain. The product it self seems good but the trays are very cheap.</li>
    <li> The kit is very pretty! I bought it for a present and it turned out perfect !!! Great makeup kit for a teenager .</li>
    <li> So, this kit is almost totally unusable as delivered. Because of the way the case opens, there&#x27;s no way to get to the make-up in the back of the two bottom trays at all. I had to force them out and trim as much of the plastic off as I could so that my daughter could take those trays out to get to the back colors. When the make-up is gone this will make a great jewelry box, which is why I&#x27;m giving it three stars. But as is, it needs a redesign.</li>
    <li> You need to really apply more than one coat for makeup to actually show a tint! But otherwise not the worse production I have bought!</li>
    <li> I love this make up kit it has all the things I needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a play kit, but the colors are so beautiful, it could easily be a great gift for someone more sophisticated. The red croc lining is very elegant and the canteliever shelves are highly attractive for displaying all the makeup. Grea gift I highly recommend it for young girls just having fun to teenagers with a little more of a refined taste in makeup.</li>
    <li> i would have given five stars but the strap broke as soon as i opened the case. With that being said, I bought this for my 19 yr old. The colors are perfect for her olive skin tone and it seens to last forever! After looking long and hard I am satisfied with this product :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was so excited about getting it. When I opened the box it was beautiful, exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Nice value for the money, it&#x27;s a small case looks big in picture</li>
    <li> Gift daughter says good deal.</li>
    <li> colors are pretty, case is nice and seems durable. the makeup itself comes in flimsy plastic trays, almost like a child&#x27;s makeup would, Other than the trays I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I like the product ...the size is just what i expected combination of make up is pretty good..The only problem is the box  which i  cant open too wide so i can reach some of the make up and you need to remove the whole make up from the box so you can use them well..</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the many colors, I loved the price.  Will recommend to anyone who is looking for great value.</li>
    <li> I wish it i had a little more access to the make-up a little better but thank you alout i liked it</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my daughter to play with around the house when her and sister play dress up and it was perfect for them and I have actually used a product or two myself so I think it would be good for anyone. Lots of variety</li>
    <li> I got it for xmas wasnt all that good. The face stuff worked kinda... the eye shadow was much to dark for my liking and the lip stuff burned and dryed out my lips the eyeliner made a mess and masscra was to wet.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for one of my children, and according to my daughter-she&#x27;s pleased w/the contents of this kit.</li>
    <li> 10 year old asked for this and is VERY happy with it.  Case is nice.</li>
    <li> Very nice make-up kit for the price. Came well packaged and in one piece.</li>
    <li> I bought this Christmas of 2014, it is May of 2015 and this make up is still kicking but! It has every shade, the quality is great. Definitely a great buy!!</li>
    <li> My 8-yr old daughter was always getting into my good makeup.  I decided to get her her own kit for Christmas &amp; this seemed to be the best bargain for the price.  It definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint either.  The colors are great &amp; go on well.  The box is too cute too.  Amazing purchase for a girl wanting to try out &amp; play with her own set.</li>
    <li> I got this for a teenage girl and she loved the variety of makeup. The case is very cute and she will be able to use it for something else after she has used all the makeup. She got a lot of makeup for the price.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> Everything came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> for my girlfriend&#x27;s make-up collection.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my fiancee.&lt;br /&gt;She really loved it but it was a little tricky as the trays won&#x27;t completly open so she had to take the whole plastic shelf to reach the inner contents.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such great product.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you would regard the little defects in the future.</li>
    <li> i bought this for wife for christmas. she likes it. she uses most of the stuff in it. comes with a lot of stuff</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift for my daughter as she loves to experiment with makeup and this gave her so many options! I was thinking of ordering one of my own so mommy and daughter can get ready together!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful set.  Smaller than expected but nice. One eye shadow broken or would have been 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my cousin, I haven&#x27;t given it to her yet, but I opened it and played around with it, the eyeshadows are very pigmented and they have a really good quality, the best part about it Is the palettes are removable, so when the eye shadows are all gone I can remove the tray and just store my own makeup in it, unlike the picture, the exterior is crocodile Red, which is better than I expected. The case is small and it fits right on my dresser, now im thinking to keep this and get her another one.</li>
    <li> my daugther love that</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.I got it for her as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> it was very good. it looked very nice. it was exactly like the picture. the lipstick are very soft and buttery.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter LOVED it.  I read the other reviews and while you can&#x27;t reach all the way to the back of the tray -- there isn&#x27;t anything there to get to...little brushes.  We bought the the $12 brush pack Amazon recommended and all is good.  The brushes are awesome too.</li>
    <li> Maybe I am not opening the box right, but getting the second and third tray out to get the plastic off was not an easy chore and the box does not open far enough to get to the three trays. I would leave them out and just covered if it were not for my troublesome cats in the middle of the night. I think the box would be good for storing loose makeup and small facial care items, but I will not be putting trays of makeup in it.  Honestly I will be buying my make up from my normal representatives I know what I am getting there I wanted to check out something new.  Gave it four stars for the box and the good idea, but the design needs work. Thanks anyway.  Happy Holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update]&lt;br /&gt;I cannot change the stars I would give the product three stars just for the really bad design. I am having difficulties getting the trays out of the box to use the makeup. I will be transferring the trays into some other form of storage when I get one. The box is nice to put small things into but not for what it is being used for. I am a bit irritated.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product....and shany cosmetics does NOT test on animals!!!!!  Red case has three separate compartments. Many colors for variety.  Great!</li>
    <li> gave as gift was very nice product as described,all different colrs all in good shape not broken or damaged at all</li>
    <li> Nice product but the lid does not stay up . So you have to tilt the case at an angle .&lt;br /&gt;Then it works fine.</li>
    <li> I like quality of the cosmetics, but I do not like quality of boxes and drawers do not open completely, which is a bit inconvenient</li>
    <li> Value for money. the layers can be re arranged and the art-leather casing will be of good use for other articles too.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my daughter and she loves it Would buy it. Again</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no mascara on my items we just received, and then the 1 lipstick I got is not good it&#x27;s broken....</li>
    <li> Its too bad the drawers don&#x27;t open all the way otherwise this would have been a great set of make up. You cannot reach the make up in the back of each tray. Now I have to find something else to keep the make up in.</li>
    <li> I looked at several of these types of products when I was going to buy one for my 13yo daughter for Christmas. I eventually chose this one because I liked the variety of colors, choice of colors, variety of product and quality of case. Everything arrived on-time and in great condition. It was all packaged very securely. The case itself is good quality. When you pull out the lower shelves, the upper shelves shift backward so you can access more product without having to remove the trays. I thought the color choices were fairly modern and the quality of makeup to be good. Brushes are included with this set, but I also bought a set of matching brushes to go along with it. Overall, I am really happy with the value of this item and my daughter loves her new make-up case!</li>
    <li> I loved this makeup kit! The case is beautiful and glamorous. The colors were amazing( although they could&#x27;ve been a tid bit shinier). The eyeliner works great and so does the other makeup. Terrific job!</li>
    <li> i love it except the problem is, it is soooo compact that you cant get the middle drawer out or the bottom and half the items, a whole row on each level, bottom and middle, are completely covered where you cant just use it while in the box, you have to take it out of the box and then crunch the container the makeup is in which breaks it, and put it back again crunching it again.&lt;br /&gt;love the concept but this gift is inconvenient and wont last long for this reason. very pretty though. love the red leather look even though its most likely plastic of course. havent tried the make up itself yet. the lipsticks, comes with two sticks. these were both out of their container and stuck to the cover. i had to put my fingers on the lipsticks and put them back into the containers and so lost some of both sticks doing this instead of having them be used like on my lips. otherwise they would have had to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> My thirteen year old loves this set.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT 100% RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT WAS AS EXPECTED AND BETTER THANKS, CONTINUE PAYING A GOOD WE WERE PLEASED WITH THE MERCHANDISE</li>
    <li> The only real issue I have with this is the case itself, its like they tried to stuff to much into it. When its open all the way I can&#x27;t get the eyeliner or the brushes for the lip gloss out. Otherwise its a nice set.</li>
    <li> Nice product, Many colors and ship.</li>
    <li> Case is surprisingly smaller than it appears. In itself is really not an issue. Makeup quality is typical of Shany, great value as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Case design is a major issue. When case is extended, as seen in photo description, it does not open fully to allow access to all products. Except for top tray, two lower trays must be removed to access all items on tray. About the trays; they are of the cheapest plastic and will not withstand repeated removal. The makeup is poured directly into the trays, which increases the chance the makeup will crack when removing the trays.&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Removing the tray is required to access most of the items. This action will result in cracking makeup over time. Trays are cheap, flimsy plastic.</li>
    <li> Good quality wife loved it, lots of stuff in a small package&lt;br /&gt;wife want me order 1 more for her</li>
    <li> i bought this for my niece she is 17 she loves it, she says it has eveything she needs and more. she reccommends to her friends</li>
    <li> I was looking for a makeup pack and looking everywhere when i read reviews, so i settled on this. I got it today and like everyone said it is smaller than expected. but that doesnt make it bad. Its small enough to put on my dresser and not get in the way. and the draweres are abit small it takes abit to get the makeup in the back. you have to pull it out to get to it. But i do like it and am happy that i got this.</li>
    <li> Did not come with over half the stuff listed. Top tier is completely empty, no mascara as advertised. Complete waste of money!</li>
