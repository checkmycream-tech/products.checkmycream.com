<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the typical dandruff shampoos in the past and wanted to try something more gentle on my hair.  This stuff works really well for me and the scent is pleasant in my opinion.  It does leave my hair feeling a bit rough but the Silk 18 conditioner works great!</li>
    <li> The shampoo packaging is very goood. The shampoo smells excellent . I use it at least twice a week and i am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> After trying another Maple Holistics shampoo I decided to give this one a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped for itch relief. I have Keratin-treated hair, and thus have to use sulfate-free products. I have washed my hair with this about 4 times (I wash twice weekly) and saw no dandruff control or itch reduction. Their other shampoo worked much better for me to that end. They have yet another shampoo that is supposed to be good for flakes I might try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathered a little and the smell was alright. This is an okay product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> I have struggled off and on with extremely dry scalp/psorisis for years.  I have never found a shampoo that worked as quickly and effectively as the Maple Holistics Tea Tree Shampoo.  I received it on Wednesday and have been using it for the past 3 days and already, I am noticing a remarkable difference.  My scalp is noticeably less flaky and itchy and my hair is shiny/healthy once again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo left my hair and scalp feeling great! It has a great scent too! And I love that its sulfate free!</li>
    <li> slightly unpleasant smell. Left my hair dry and stringy. I suppose it depends on individual hair types, but didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> Really unpleasant smell. Use this to wash your hair, then another shampoo to wash out the smell of this one.</li>
    <li> I have dandruff and have been using head and shoulders for years but recently dyed my hair pueple and needed a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t rip out my color. Love the shampoo!</li>
    <li> I noticed a reduction in dandruff and softer hair when using with the Maple Holistics conditioner for dry hair.  This product smells nice and does not leave any residue.  It also lathers nicely.  I have used this for six months and plan to continue as a remedy for my dry scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo. It cleanses my hair without drying it out. I have unnatural hair color and it does not strip the color out of my hair!! I&#x27;m just left with squeaky clean beautiful shinny blue hair.</li>
    <li> Love, LOve, LOVe, LOVE this shampoo it is an amazing product that I stumbled upon on accident,  obviously I found it online and wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy it or not bc I have tried many tea tree products to clear and get rid of dandruff and not one worked out for me I did everything that those bottles recommended and I was disappointed and broke. So I started to look for organic based products on Amazon.com,  and found the holy grail of dandruff shampoos and just one wash cleared the flakes and left very little behind. Great Job and can&#x27;t wait to try more products from this company!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.I felt so good after use.</li>
    <li> a good shampoo.  i think it has helped my scalp.</li>
    <li> When this arrived I was pretty disappointed in the size of the bottle for the price.  It&#x27;s so tiny!  But honestly this shampoo is so thick that you end up having to dilute it in your hand before putting it in your hair.  And my hair has been so soft since I switched!  Last summer I tried the Wen system and my hair got just as soft (instead of the dried out hay that I feel like I normally have).  But the Wen system left my hair so dirty that I thought it had changed color.  So after three months of Wen I finally washed my hair and like a miracle it was blonde again!  But I digress.  The point is this shampoo leaves my hair just as soft as the No-Poo method but waaaaay cleaner than that just conditioner mess.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works as described.  It definitely helps with dandruff and the added Tea Tree Essential Oil leaves your scalp feeling cool and refreshed.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have problems with dry scalp and I get sores on my head as well. Since I started using this shampoo my head does not itch, show flakes, and I only get the occasional sore. I only wash my hair every other day and I love this product.</li>
    <li> COMPLETELY VITALIZES YOUR HAIR!! PHARMACEUTICAL SHAMPOOS CONTAIN CHEMICALS THAT STRIP YOUR HAIR OF ITS NATURAL NUTRIENTS, THIS COMPLETELY NATURAL A GREAT CHOICE!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo twice so far, not long enough to see dendroff disappear i guess(but hey, they say stress is the main reason why it appears in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;It does the job leaving hair clean, smells great (pine trees), and I love the fact that is made of all natural ingredients including tea tree oil, which is proved to have positive effect on skin.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in less than a week! Great smelling, I love the tingly feeling while using this shampoo. It cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo is pretty terrific. I am always seeking shampoos to achieve healthy hair with natural and holistic ingredients. This one works great. It is a nice lathering, opaque product with a light and lovely scent. Suds up and rinses well. As for results, my hair is definitely soft and my curls are bouncier. I use a curls and waves conditioner that I love, but I don&#x27;t use the corresponding shampoo because I like to use a shampoo that clarifies and cleanses more than I think that would. This one does. I had to ding a star off because I don&#x27;t get a lot of shine from using this. I will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;As a reference, my hair is long, fine and wavy/curly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this product does not work!!  I have a keratin treatment on my hair so I was trying to avoid any sulfate shampoo, but still control seasonal dandruff.  Very disappointed and wished I would have never spent this much money on this  product!!</li>
    <li> Understand that dandruff treatments do not work out the same way for everyone. This one did not stop my dandruff....aw shucks, will keep looking.</li>
    <li> This is a great organic shampoo. I love using it because it leaves my hair soft, shiny (not greasy), and smelling great. It is sulfate and preservative-free, which is a major plus. On top of the great feel and the organic ingredients, it takes very little to wash my full and thick head of hair. Unlike many other organic shampoos, this also lathers very easily. This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone that has hair to wash.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I noticed a difference in my itchy scalp and the flakes. It smells great and I only use it once a week for complete control.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to find a more natural alternative to my usual T-Gel, but it isn&#x27;t strong enough. It smells pretty and might work for someone with less severe dandruff, but it is just not for me. Oh well. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Smells great but it has not done anything for my dandruff even thought I followed the directions exactly for several months.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works for my dry scalp and leaves my hair soft and smooth. Great product, would recommend</li>
    <li> Led to increase in hair fall. Stopped using it after couple of days.</li>
    <li> I need in big size 33 oz</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people are saying this doesn&#x27;t sud. I was a bit worried. For me it produces bubbles and feels nearly like regular shampoo. It is not like wen. This will clean your hair and make it feel clean but you need to use conditioner afterwards because it does have the possibility of drying out your hair. That&#x27;s a given for me since I&#x27;m AA but I figure not so for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend wash rinse repeat to get that really clean feeling. A little goes a long way with this one, I&#x27;m saying this as an AA with a lot of natural hair. I personally added some tea tree oil that I got from trader joes (6.99) to it to make it more effective at getting rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it worked for dandruff. But it would still come back after about a week. Much longer than before but still unwanted. So I decided to add 100% tea tree oil this this shampoo directly and to my conditioner. I figure with more frequent use, like at least twice a week, this could cure my dandruff problem which started when I got to my mid 20s. Plus I love the smell. It&#x27;s not a nice and flowery smell but I kind of like the smell of sage. I would say it smells like herbs. The smell does go away after drying. Personally my hair smelled like tea tree oil more than the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Try the tree oil shampoo personally the smell is not strong  fades after applying smells very eucalyptic  makes you feel clean. Read the ingrendients  and it has alot of things that are &amp;#34;said&amp;#34; to be bad for your hair  but not completely sure like cocamidopropyl betaine</li>
    <li> Effective and gentle. Lathers well too</li>
    <li> This is an OK shampoo I liked it at first but it seems to dry out my hair. I&#x27;ve since switched to Acure and I l prefer that. That being said this is still better than the chemical shampoos available at the supermarkets.</li>
    <li> This product is not as advertised. The main ingredients it shows are at the bottom of the ingredients list and nothing is organic. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned these products are all about the individual, and what works for one person, doesn&#x27;t work for another. I&#x27;ve tried some other products, but never liked the way they made my hair smell, and I would still have flakes and itchiness. Someone recommend tea tree oil as a possible solution, and i decided to try it. I found the smell of the shampoo to be pleasant not overpowering at all. Within a week of using it, the itching and flakes were gone. I used it everyday until it ran out. I switched to a clear shampoo, and the itching and flakes are back. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shampoo that my wife and I enjoy using.  It makes our hair feel clean and soft without all of the added ingredients that many shampoos come with.  It is a natural shampoo that also helps to get rid of dandruff and we like it because it is preservative free made from organic ingredients. It has a very light lavender fragrance it foams nicely when using it.  My wife likes that her hair feels clean and not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use very much to wash your hair and it works well.  Both of us like this product and the results we have gotten from using it.  I like it because the fragrance is not overwhelming and my hair just feels clean and soft.  This is a good product and I rate it at 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> I had a horrible chemical burn from using esalon hair dye and had tried everything- including expensive brands... So before chopping my hair off I decided to go natural products. This shampoo and the silk conditioner have literally changed my hair back to normal within one use. I am a customer for life!!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I really like it.  My head doesn&#x27;t seem to itch anymore and my hair isn&#x27;t falling out like it was.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and skin... and several years ago, my scalp started itching terribly. I sought relief through a choice of shampoos designed for this issue such as Selsun Blue. They&#x27;d provide relief, but it was often short-term before the itching would resume and the results just weren&#x27;t impressive like no softening of my hair.. During my trial with shampoos, I came across Maple Holistics shampoos.... I went with tea tree oil (the special formula) and ever since over the last few years - I have never looked back... I love using this shampoo for the very simple reason that it gives me long-term relief from itching. And it leaves my hair feeling so good. I do use a conditioner to de-frizz the ends of my thick dark hair... and just now noticed that Maple Holistics has come out with their own conditioners. I ordered the Silk18 to try with my tea tree shampoo. I guarantee you will love this shampoo providing it is the right kind for your hair. I did try Maple Holistics&#x27; other shampoos but this one has given me the best results for my hair type and scalp issues. You will need to do some trial with their shampoos to find the one that best suits your hair. By the way, I live in Texas in the city of Houston where the weather is humid... which is conductive to producing oily hair and skin - but this shampoo has cured all that for me over the last few springs and summers long-term. When pollen levels are high and my scalp begins to itch - I would wash my hair in this shampoo and it would calm the scalp... removing the allergens from my hair. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I was so glad to come across this product.  My adult daughter suffers from a medical condition which causes small sores to develop on her scalp.  Previously, washing her hair was an ordeal since other shampoos irritated and burned the already painful areas.  The Maple Holistics shampoo had none of these effects, possibly due to the lack of chemical ingredients, and now the sores seem to be healing as well.  What a blessing that would be.&lt;br /&gt;After observing the effect Tea Tree had on my daughter’s hair and scalp, I decided to try it myself. Call me crazy, but my hair feels softer now, and not as brittle.  I’m happy with the results.  This shampoo has a mild fragrance, and is sulpher- free, a plus in my book.  I also like the fact that it fights dandruff.  I’m glad someone recommended this product.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for a shampoo that would help my scalp acne and itching. I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with their Degreaser Shampoo (have greasy scalp) alternating days and my hair feels and looks 100% better and I can say it has improved my scalp. This is the happiest I&#x27;ve been with my hair in years. It&#x27;s improved the texture of my hair along with helping it shine more and feel softer. This shampoo makes my hair feel very conditioned without feeling heavy and weighed down. I will never go back to store bought shampoos again as long as they continue to make these. I can&#x27;t recommend this shampoo enough!</li>
    <li> Really nice scent and shampoo.  Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in scalp dryness.  I like it, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a week and my dandruff has is pretty much gone. I waited about a week to review it so I could give an honest opinion. The smell for my personally, is not that great but it is not bad either. I would recommend to someone that wants to limit their dandruff.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this shampoo because it has tea tree oil in it. When I was growing up my mother first introduced me to this oil. My hairstylist is also using tea tree shampoos on her clients and raves about its benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated, straight, long hair and this shampoo works very well for me. I like the fact that it is sulfate free and natural. I would buy this again and again and again!</li>
    <li> I have been using maple holistics for a bit. I think I like the sage one better. This one does not leave my hair as clean, and it gets oily quicker. I would still recommend the brand; just not this particular product.</li>
    <li> Was not a life saver as I had hoped. I had the hardest time finding sulfate free shampoo for my awful dandruff. My hair has been overly damaged by sulfates and I thought this would fix it. My scalp did not adjust easily but Its a great shampoo if you need to wash your hair but it is not quite oily yet as it is very gentle. Otherwise I have to sometimes go behind it with a more cleansing type of shampoo after using this. The smell took a while to get used to also. I still have mild flakes when using this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any scalp blemishes but have had a build up on my hair that seems to be a form of dandruff. I gave this shampoo a try and it has worked great to leave my hair feeling  soft and clean again. I am very picky about products that I use and the ingredients in this one meet my standards. Very happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used so many types of product but my dandruff did not seem to go away until I started using Maple Holistics. My hair is heavily beached and treated by chemicals so I wanted to have a product that is both color safe and sulfate-free. This product does it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not too fond of the scent but as long as my dandruff goes away I don&#x27;t care much.</li>
    <li> Postpartum I am experiencing hair loss and dandruff. Yes, glamorous, I know. It&#x27;s the truth though and this shampoo seems to be helping with the dandruff issue. Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> Why are their toxic chemicals in this?? One of many  PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate&lt;br /&gt;  http://healing-scents.com/toxins.html</li>
    <li> Dried out my scalp severely. Liked the smell. Just not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--from a male perspective</li>
    <li> I have tried a few tea tree shampoos but this is by far the best one i&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Enlightenment in a bottle you say? Who knows. All I can suggest is that you try it. Or not. Do whatever you want. Just enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I bought and tried Maple Holistics brands: [light blue]Hydrate (made a mistake and left in hotel room), worked great at the time when I was able to use it... Next, I&#x27;ve had the Sage brand, also worked pretty well, but got tired of the Rosemary smell of it, but my wife and I finished it. Finally,this Tea Tree brand, Im not feeling anymore and going to go back to my first purchase next. Im back to having dry skin flakes when brushing my hair and itchy scalp since buying the Tea Tree. I washed my hair last night.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the shampoo at all!! Make your hair feel like straw and you can&#x27;t get a brush through it( even washed with my mormal shampoo and conditioner after using it) Would never buy again.</li>
    <li> Its a grate shampoo it really makes your hair smother and definitely takes the dandruff away I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it</li>
    <li> My teenage son has had some dandruff and this is the one thing that has really worked. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but positive things to say about this product. I absolutely love the smell, as it reminds me of lavender/tea tree essential oils. I have a sensitive scalp so I had been using head and shoulders, but i also had a brazilian blow out so i couldn&#x27;t use a shampoo that had sulfate in it. I struggled to find a product that could do both of those things well, but i finally have.</li>
    <li> Have tried this based on the positive reviews, but unfortunately does not work for me after using it every day. Will be going back to Selsun Blue as it is actually effective at treating moderate dandruff. This company should really think about claiming this shampoo is for &amp;#34;moderate dandruff.&amp;#34; Please do not buy solely on that claim as I have, which is why I am posting this review. Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> Great SLS free shampoo for dandruff. My scalp itching is gone!</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this shampoo even though I don&#x27;t have dandruff, because I have a sensitivity to a lot of shampoos on the market that have too much fragrance. I also like the fact that it is sulphate free.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been feeling dull and lifeless lately and after using this shampoo a couple of times I notice that it feels cleaner, and has more body and shine.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a small amount. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is one of my new favorite shampoos of all time! I love the smell and how healthy and shiny my hair has been after using this for the past month. It leaves my hair shiny but there isn&#x27;t an oily residue. During the winter my skin and scalp tend to be on the drier side and I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s less itchy but it&#x27;s not completely gone yet. The only con is it&#x27;s not soapy enough but that&#x27;s probably because of the more organic ingredients they use.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have bad dandruff and head and shoulders was really drying my hair out. And its gentle enough I can use it daily! I live natural products and you nailed it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I love my hair after every use. Its works great on dandruff .</li>
    <li> Helps with my dandruff and nice smell.</li>
    <li> A great shampoo for dry scalp. It leaves hair looking shiny but no oily residue. The smell is amazing if you&#x27;re a lavender fan and lingers through to the next day. The only complaint is that it&#x27;s not soapy enough but that&#x27;s probably because it more organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very creamy.  Goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly, and it&#x27;s frizzy most of the time. I switched to sulfate free shampoos in the last year, and have noticed a difference. This is by far the best shampoo I have used. It made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable. I had orange flakes of dandruff, but it&#x27;s cleared up. The shampoo is thick, and the bottle last a long time.</li>
    <li> I read all the pros &amp; cons customers wrote and decided to make my own decision.  I really like this shampoo.  I use nothing but sulfur free shampoos and the added plus of this one being a dandruff shampoo makes it even better.  Some people didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I like it.  Smells clean.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for those who have itchy scalps.&lt;br /&gt;I do and I use this shampoo and I am very pleased with it and definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been softer or healthier since using this product. It has all the ingredients I was looking for (tea tree oil, jojoba oil, and argan oil)and it&#x27;s sulfate free. As a man I didn&#x27;t want a shampoo that had a strong fragrance and this fit the bill with a very light and natural smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. Even shampoo for men you can get at the store has to strong of a scent. I don&#x27;t want to smell like my shampoo I have excellent cologne I would like to use. In addition to my hair, I also purchased this product to use on my beard and it does a wonderful job and it is gentle enough for my face. All in all a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok with hair color, but I am doing this per my dermatologists&#x27; recommendation for scalp acne. Not sure I am seeing a difference there.</li>
    <li> I just got this shampoo, and I already love it! It smells really good, and my hair feels great afterwards. I noticed less dandruff already after only a few uses. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo to help with dry scalp. Works so much better than store brands , without unnecessary and potentially harmful chemicals. This is a great company to do business with as well, and they truly care about the customer. To me, that is worth the few dollars extra that I pay for their natural products.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is by far the best shampoo I have ever used. the smell is great and natural. you really only need a tiny drop when you shower so this bottle can last you for months. I am hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I found this product while searching for alternative shampoos for my horrible dandruff. I had used off the shelf stuff for years and it never really worked. I am so happy to have found this product as it works really well for me. It is very gentle, smells amazing, and is the only thing that has worked at reducing the itchiness and flakes of dandruff. I also have curly and dry hair, it works really well at managing frizz and improving moisture. I cannot recommend enough!</li>
    <li> Every winter my scalp becomes extramly dry and flakey. I have tried many many different dandruff shampoos, multi step kits, and home remedies to clear up my scalp. Not only did this shampoo clear up my flakes but it didn&#x27;t break the bank in the process. Plus the smell is quite pleasant!</li>
    <li> i have been looking for a sulfate free dandruff shampoo to no avail until i found this product, along with the Silk 18 Natural conditioner by Maple Holistics. I am really impressed. My dandruff is practically all gone (a huge improvement), and my hair feels so clean and soft. I know I sound like a commercial, but I am not getting paid for this review. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I have read a lot about the benefits of Tea Tree oil for many different health issues. This shampoo is a nice alternative to that H&amp;S  stuff that is full of chemicals that I can&#x27;t even pronounce</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s as good as the original, but sulfate free. Leaves my hair and scalp feeling amazing. It&#x27;s pretty concentrated, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my problem with itchy scalp after using this product.</li>
    <li> NICE PRODUCT  Great on the hair worth the mnoney to buy it</li>
    <li> My scalp is finally happy again!  For the last couple years I have been dealing with an extremely itchy, dry, yet oily scalp. I get breakouts on my scalp and hairline, so I don&#x27;t use any products other than natural oils after I wash my hair. I also shed A LOT. Super frustrating! My hair is dark, and fairly long (mid back).  I have been using this shampoo (as well as the Silk 18 conditioner) for a couple weeks now.  My scalp feels so clean, refreshed, but not stripped.  I have almost no flakes, and oil production is greatly reduced.  I&#x27;m so happy!  It smells nice and fresh. I follow the directions to use a quarter size amount, work it in, let it sit for a minute or two and repeat (the second time I maybe use a dime size or less (seriously, so little is needed).  I get a ton of suds when I use it, which I didn&#x27;t expect (and really not needed to clean), not that I&#x27;m complaining! I thought I would need to purchase more often, but the 8oz size is going to last way longer than I thought it would.  I sometimes use the suds to clean my face and body as well, so a little bit really does go a long way! They have a customer for life.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of their products.  I have also been trying the Vit C Serum, Dead Sea Mask and the Winter Blend Shampoo/Conditioner and I am loving everything so far.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It smells wonderful and really did help with dandruff!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after reading information that the chemical used in most shampoos to give it the pearl-like-luster can lead to scalp acne. I typically breakout along my hairline and on my scalp. I tried this shampoo because it is clear and as far as I can tell doesn&#x27;t have that chemical giving it a pearl-like-luster. It did a good job of clearing up the blemishes on my hairline and on my scalp. I saw a noticeable improvement. I really like the smell of this shampoo as well. It&#x27;s not a typical perfume smell, but I believe the smell is the tea tree oil. I find it very refreshing. I have very short hair so this small bottle lasted me quite awhile but I was also very conscious to not use too much.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I took it straight from the box to the shower, very relaxing, very soothing.  Special shout out to Willow Smith, who provided my shower time beats.  I am no longer afraid to whip my hair back and forth.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shampoo! Initially I was put off by the scent it was very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; but after subsequent use I don&#x27;t notice it as much. I do not suffer from dandruff but decided to try the tea tree oil blend for its benefits to the overall health of the scalp and ultimately to your hair. It leaves my hair feeling clean and shiny without drying it out like other natural shampoos I have tried. I would definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cured my dandruff with one use, after having tried several organic and conventional products to no avail. It leaves my hair very clean and shiny. I am also able to use less of it than most shampoos. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tea tree shampoo to help with a dry, flaky scalp. I really notice a difference using this shampoo. I love that the formula is sulfate free and safe for my color treated hair! I love this shampoo, will definitely be repurchasing and trying other products from this company. Highly recommend for anyone with dandruff, flakes or a dry scalp!</li>
    <li> What a great shampoo! I&#x27;m so happy I found a shampoo that is natural, gentle, smells good, and helps my irritable scalp. I used to add tea tree oil to my regular shampoo, but with this product, I don&#x27;t have to do that extra step anymore. I love how this shampoo cleanses and lathers better than any other organic shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s my go-to shampoo for sure!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a wonderful fragrance and is gentle enough to use every day.  It leaves my hair and scalp feeling clean and refreshed.  I even use it as a body wash in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for about a week now but so far I Love it!! It gives your scalp a cool, fresh feeling when applied.  It is great for an everyday shampoo, or an occasional use. I definitely recommend this shampoo, and will purchase again. I look forward to doing more business with this company. Not only is the product great, but the customer service is the best I have ever experience. I personally do not have dandruff so I can not say if it works for that, however it leaves my hair feeling naturally clean. My husband has suffered with a dry itchy scalp forever and I have been through so many different shampoos, trying to find one that gives him relief. He has been using this shampoo for the last week as well, and has not had an itchy scalp at all compared to having problems daily before using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it is a nice,more natural way to get my scalp clean and free from flakes! I have a leave in conditioner I use which I would recommend just to make it easier to comb your hair after the shower. I will definitely be purchasing this shampoo again…it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Helped with itchy scalp almost immediately.  Still have flakes, but less than before.  Will continue to monitor.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable. Excellent, will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Not great but decent, then again dandruff is chronic so this is as good as any thing else I would buy again</li>
    <li> This does the trick for my occasionally itchy scalp.  No &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smell which I like.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft and dandruff free!  It also has a nice mild smell.</li>
    <li> Dealt with bad inching and dandruff for 3 years, it really wasn&#x27;t dandruff but flakes and a lot of it! I tried everything I thought would help but nothing worked. I had my doubts this but I saw results from the first day I used it. It has been 5 days now and there is still remarkable improvement. The dandruff  and flaking is gone and the icing is going away. I plan to buy more of this product if it still does this good.</li>
    <li> When I first discovered that I was losing quite a bit of hair that was medication induced. I investigated my hair care products and learned that the SLS in most shampoos available on a commonly used basis was loaded with this chemical and in most cases, also promoted hair loss!!! Imagine my alarm!!! So, back on November 30, 2013, I went on line and began researching organic shampoos and conditioners. Once I&#x27;d completed that research, I then began my search for that just right product. I spent hours reading labels that stated what the shampoo provided in use and what ingredients were in it.: Fragrance, was it for dandruff care and on and on and on. After all those hours of reading and comparing I finally clicked on this Tea Tree shampoo for moderate dandruff with, in my opinion all the organic ingredients I wanted, What a find!!! I purchased it through Amazon. When I received it, I tried it that very day! It had a  wonderful herbal fragrance that leaves my hair with a clean herbal smell, my husband loves it. And the best part of all, it controls the dandruff well. Have really had NO instances of any dandruff at all!! Since that first purchase, I&#x27;ve continued to buy this product to date, my 3rd time, It lasts a long time if used as directed, a small dollop goes a long way especially if you have short hair. So, lets see, purchased first bottle 11-30-13, 2nd bottle, 3-18-14 and this last bottle 7-22-14. So about 4 months in between purchases, that makes this monetarily about a cost of $4.50 a month, WOW! Exceptionally cost effective, I say! and lastly, along with the conditioner for hair loss, I&#x27;ve had minimal loss and again NO dandruff. BTW: It can be used for both men and women. I definitely recommend it. It really does work for me.OH! one very last thing, it IS safe for color treated hair, my hair is color treated and I&#x27;ve had not problems at all. No discolorations, no stripping of the color in a short time span like most common shampoos do. It really is a great product, for me anyway. Good Buy!</li>
    <li> This is a nice one. My hair is naturally smooth after using it even without conditioner! And it stay smooth after using the hair dryer. Also, the smell is not that strong that you can feel it is natural formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for over a week now. I am extremely happy with this item! I used to have a lot of dandruff and since I started using this item I haven&#x27;t noticed any. Even if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a few days.</li>
    <li> the main ingredients are harsh and damaging, causing dryness, irritation, and itching. I do not recommend this shampoo it is not organic. I urge you please look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have a long history of having a dry scalp and dandruff flares that can be pretty intense.  I also recently began coloring my hair so I absolutely needed something sulfate free that would also manage my scalp issues.  I have only used this shampoo about 3 times, and so far I really like it.  Typically when I switch dandruff shampoos (even switching within brand) my scalp goes a little crazy and dandruff comes back in full force after the first use of the new shampoo, and takes about 3 washes to go back to being entirely flake free.  I have not had that issue with this shampoo so I am quite happy.  Before I purchased this product, I was worried about how it would smell.  While I personally do not mind the smell of tea tree, my bf cannot stand it.  In my opinion it has a very light scent and he has yet to complain, so there are no issues in the scent department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to someone if they were looking for a dandruff shampoo, sulfate free or otherwise.</li>
    <li> So amazing. I just wish it was cheaper. I will buy this product again!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought this product or any product from Maple Holistics.  At first I was a little concerned about the size of the bottle because it was small (8oz) but I didn&#x27;t have to use much of the product to wash my hair. There wasn&#x27;t a strong smell to it but it worked great! I have only used it once so I can&#x27;t comment how well it does for dandruff but has high hopes for it.</li>
    <li> I washed my hair(day 0). This shampoo made my hair feel heavy. By day 1, the hair was oily and limp. Tried it twice again. Same results. Did not seem to affect dandruff at all. Amazon was kind enough to take it back. Great customer service.</li>
