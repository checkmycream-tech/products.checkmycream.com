      <li>It&#x27;s a good, pleasant, mild cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the popular \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cleansers on the market.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>i like to moisturize, spf and keep my skin healthy.</li>
      <li>anyhow this product feels more like lotion when washing your face.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this face wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using this.  </li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve ever used Cetaphil you&#x27;ll find it comparable, except it lacks the parabens and smells better.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve already got oil on your face, in fact, you need some to keep your skin healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, but if you&#x27;re looking for a gel or liquid cleanser that foams and cleans deeper, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>but it cleaned my face and smelled pretty good :)</li>
      <li>This cleanser makes my skin so soft--yet very clean.</li>
      <li>I am willing to pay for a product that is superior to its competition, but I don&#x27;t think it is.</li>
      <li>and they gave it good ratings for women over 40 interested in anit aging qualities.  </li>
      <li>It removes my makeup just fine, but I mostly just use eye makeup and bronzer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It IS more creamy than most cleansers but a good cleanser is NOT supposed to strip your skin, especially an anti-aging cleanser.  </li>
      <li>The only downfall I have noticed is that it is not the best for removing eye make-up but one can always use something else for that first and then use the cleanser.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to help with fine lines.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, and leaves your face feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>This literally doesn&#x27;t touch it, and I use fairly light makeup.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, non-irritating and effective.  </li>
      <li>this is great especially since 1.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin smooth feeling after use but seems to promote acne.  </li>
      <li>* See original review below.</li>
      <li>and I felt like it wasn&#x27;t getting my face clean.</li>
      <li>It is an efective cleanser that leaves my skin clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Basically a cream cleanser is a moisturizer that removes dirt and oil while leaving a moisturizer on your clean skin.</li>
      <li>But what I want from a cleanser is clean skin, and Yes to</li>
      <li>But as an evening cleanser it is fantastic - my face is fresh and I have seen a remarkable change in skin texture, even though I am only 27.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this, but so far so good.  </li>
      <li>at first i thought the product was so dense it will not come off the face easily but</li>
      <li>I started noticing my skin looking older, and thought I&#x27;d try this and the face oil, they have balanced my skin out and made it more youthful.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought that I didn&#x27;t like this product, but when my face felt so clean and soft after using it I decided that I liked it enought to order some for my mom and sisters.  </li>
      <li>its amazing for the drunken nights where i can barely make it to the bathroom to wash my face and wont need to moisturize before i pass out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my cosmetics and use more natural products</li>
      <li>I think that the needs of faces vary greatly from person to person and I have always had trouble finding something that worked well for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However,</li>
      <li>So it has everything I look for in a natural cleanser :)</li>
      <li>I like the smell and enjoyed this as a soft cleanser in the winter.</li>
      <li>MY SKIN LOOK HEALTY AND FRESH</li>
      <li>I have very fair, freckled, sensitive, normal to dry skin.  </li>
      <li>If you any kind of make up, even if it is just a light dusting of powder, it will not clean it off.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced that, but cleansers can have different results for different skin types.</li>
      <li>im a 20 years old female and take fairly good caution when it comes to my skins health.</li>
      <li>will note here that I used the Burts Bees for several years and had great results, and this cleanser gives me the same results as the BB did before they changed their recipe and made the orange oil cleanser &amp;#34;soapier.&amp;#34;  Really soft, smooth skin and no irritation.</li>
      <li>This is the first cleanser that has truly cured that once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>sure enough it says cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I went to Target and browsed their \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skincare section since I have sensitive skin and specifically looked for sulfate free products.  </li>
      <li>On a positive note, my face was super moisturized and super soft to the touch and didn&#x27;t need any additional moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I have used the makeup remover wipes in the past and really liked them, but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t clean my skin</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced, readily available in stores and online, made of natural ingredients (EWG score of 1), and Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free.  </li>
      <li>Most of them do a fair job, but I still suffered from dry, uneven patches on my skin sometimes.</li>
      <li>someone who occasionally wears a lot of eye make-up, this cleanser would not do the job as a make-up remover since this is more gentle.</li>
      <li>People who complain about it being like Vaseline, you must not have dry skin because if you do its so refreshing.</li>
      <li>I initially liked this product very much, until a recent switch to white towels.</li>
      <li>It did nothing for my large pores, the tone of my skin, or my blackheads.</li>
      <li>mind you my dad is a plastic surgeon and he has access to some of the most expensive and amazing products and ive had the chance to use a lot of them</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still amazing, and I would say it&#x27;s 10x better than expensive face washes i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It just clogs pores way too much.  </li>
      <li>I really like that.</li>
      <li>Like others, I was stunned at how much this felt like a lotion.  </li>
      <li>It is very creamy, but still leaves a refreshed feeling after.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it soothes my skin (with rosacea problems), cleanses very well and is not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>It did rinse off better than expected</li>
      <li>I was probably drying out my skin so much it produced excess oil.</li>
      <li>It is really a case of &amp;#34;I</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because it doesn&#x27;t suds/lather as I have been previously accustomed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cleanser makes my skin so soft--yet very clean. It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> It cleanses and moisturizes. It is very creamy, but still leaves a refreshed feeling after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get really oily on my face through out the day when I used other cleansers. I was probably drying out my skin so much it produced excess oil. This helps balance out my skin so I don&#x27;t get an oily face through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who occasionally wears a lot of eye make-up, this cleanser would not do the job as a make-up remover since this is more gentle.</li>
    <li> kind of stinks and really isn&#x27;t smoothing anything</li>
    <li> I thought they accidentally packaged lotion in the cleanser tubes when I used this. I want to like it but it felt like I was clogging my pores when I used it. It is like rubbing lotion on your face and does not clean deep enough for me. I had to wash it off of my face. It just felt dirty. If you any kind of make up, even if it is just a light dusting of powder, it will not clean it off.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product (unless you&#x27;re allergic) is its delightful fragrance.  But what I want from a cleanser is clean skin, and Yes to Blueberries Smoothing Cleanser falls short.  It deposited a suffocating layer of hard, waxy grease that wouldn&#x27;t entirely scrub off, even with soap and a washcloth.  This &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; left my skin feeling dirtier, not cleaner. It has a faintly gritty consistency that may irritate sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Alot of people have been complaining about this cleanser leaving their skin feeling like it has a film left on it. I was a bit surprised when I first used this cleanser since it isnt like most facial cleansers, being that it doesnt leave the skin dry feeling afterwards. It leaves it feeling like you cleaned it and then applied some facial lotion. I really like that. I have dry skin, so the sort of moisturized feeling I get after I use the cleanser is nice. Ive only used it a couple times so far, but I really like it. Plus it smells really great and is animal cruelty free. So it has everything I look for in a natural cleanser :)</li>
    <li> Fair results. It&#x27;s a bit oily for my skin.</li>
    <li> I really liked the creaminess of the cleanser and how it made my skin feel after.  I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I think that the needs of faces vary greatly from person to person and I have always had trouble finding something that worked well for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However,Yes To Blueberries Smoothing Cleanser works perfect for my skin. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because it doesn&#x27;t suds/lather as I have been previously accustomed but I find that it helps keep my face clean and blemish free without the excessive drying of my skin.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that I didn&#x27;t like this product, but when my face felt so clean and soft after using it I decided that I liked it enought to order some for my mom and sisters.  I don&#x27;t usually like the cream cleansers I like the sudsy soapy ones normally.  But I read about this is Self Magazine and they gave it good ratings for women over 40 interested in anit aging qualities.  The blueberries are an amazing anti aging addditive. Like I said...I am ordering my mom and two sisters a tube.  I think they&#x27;ll love it.  I know my mom will. :o)</li>
    <li> im a 20 years old female and take fairly good caution when it comes to my skins health. i like to moisturize, spf and keep my skin healthy. however im also a college student and i cant quite afford the antioxidants fruits to prevent aging. i did a ton of research and learned that blueberries as loaded with antioxidants as well as other fruits. i purchased this product to test it out and im extremely impressed. mind you my dad is a plastic surgeon and he has access to some of the most expensive and amazing products and ive had the chance to use a lot of them so i have a bit of experience in comparing. anyhow this product feels more like lotion when washing your face. i like to wash in circular slow motions all over my face and spend a little more time around my mouth, eyes and forehead. once you wash it off you feel a layer of thickness on your face which takes some getting used to. at first i thought the product was so dense it will not come off the face easily but learned thats its actually meant to moisturize my face. this is great especially since 1. you dont actually need to go and purchase a separate moisturizer (even though i still do) and 2. its amazing for the drunken nights where i can barely make it to the bathroom to wash my face and wont need to moisturize before i pass out. overall im a huge fan and highly recommend it. and the price is great.</li>
    <li> This is a cream cleanser and feels as such. Basically a cream cleanser is a moisturizer that removes dirt and oil while leaving a moisturizer on your clean skin. I use it because my skin gets dry and is pretty sensitive. I found out a while ago that cream cleansers are the way to go for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 30 and am in the sun a lot. I love this stuff, but if you&#x27;re looking for a gel or liquid cleanser that foams and cleans deeper, this isn&#x27;t for you. It removes my makeup just fine, but I mostly just use eye makeup and bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever used Cetaphil you&#x27;ll find it comparable, except it lacks the parabens and smells better.</li>
    <li> ** See original review below. I initially liked this product very much, until a recent switch to white towels. After washing my face (twice, due to a full face of makeup) I felt the same clean and refreshed feeling I noted before, until I dried my face with my new white hand towel - which came away with a disturbing amount of makeup smeared all over it. I was surprised, washed my face again, and dried off again, to STILL see makeup residue.   I am thoroughly disappointed and have discontinued using it. Regardless of how my skin feels after, if it&#x27;s not cleansing, why keep using it?  **I&#x27;ve been attempting to find natural and organic products to use for my skin care, and I bought this on a whim at a local store. I use it exclusively in the evening, followed by a Lumene brightening serum, Yes to Cucumbers Soothing Night Cream, and Yes to Blueberries Firming Eye Cream.  The cleanser itself is extremely moisturizing, which is part of the reason I use it before bed. It does not go well under makeup, especially for people with oilier skin like myself. But as an evening cleanser it is fantastic - my face is fresh and I have seen a remarkable change in skin texture, even though I am only 27. It is really a case of &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t know I needed improvement until I improved&amp;#34;. I like this formula a lot, and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth feeling after use but seems to promote acne.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to help with fine lines.</li>
    <li> We have hard water and that might be the cause, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t wash off... It leaves a film on our skin. My husband and I both noticed it and were bothered by it. I have used the makeup remover wipes in the past and really liked them, but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t clean my skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good, pleasant, mild cleanser.  I like that it is natural and has no sulfates and &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; things for your skin.  Does a good job in cleansing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 years. If you&#x27;re expecting a sudsy cleanser, this isn&#x27;t for you. It&#x27;s light, and leaves your face feeling refreshed. I also use their other products as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using this.  I always had oily skin and I am a sweat-a-holic, so I never thought I would needed the &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; type lines even though I&#x27;m 38.  I started noticing my skin looking older, and thought I&#x27;d try this and the face oil, they have balanced my skin out and made it more youthful.  Picture is my 38 year old lady face, no filter, no foundation just powder.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT FOR ANTIAGING SKIN AND GOOD IN COMPINATIONS WITH THE DAY / NIGHT CREAM MY SKIN LOOK HEALTY AND FRESH</li>
    <li> Once I tried this there was no going back.for me this is one of the best cleansers on the market it smells nice and cleans great. Leaves  your skin looking refreshed.</li>
    <li> Sent back first product and second was the same. Don&#x27;t know if batch was bad or old but it left a film on my face it was disgusting and had to use my fingernails to get off ... Gross</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and how it makes my skin feel!!!!</li>
    <li> it soothes my skin (with rosacea problems), cleanses very well and is not greasy at all. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> great face wash...its extremely moisturizing and was a life saver this past winter.  my skin was so dry before using this and after one wash my face felt so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed by the blueberries smoothing cleanser. One problem I had was that it is so thin and non-lathering that the cream seems to disintegrate in your hand before you can even get it to your face. It did nothing for my large pores, the tone of my skin, or my blackheads. I also found the smell of this cleanser unappealing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the popular \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cleansers on the market. Most of them do a fair job, but I still suffered from dry, uneven patches on my skin sometimes. This is the first cleanser that has truly cured that once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s creamy and smells great, leaves my face healthy and glowing. Some people have complained that it felt like there was a film left on their skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced that, but cleansers can have different results for different skin types. I have combination skin - oily with some dry patches. For me, this has been the most amazing cleanser!</li>
    <li> My face feels fat and sleek when I use this product. However, I should state that I am only 29 and have not rigorously evaluated it as an anti-aging product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser.  It is an oil based cleanser, so feels a little heavy and leaves a film on you skin, but that is one of the reasons I like it.  I know it sounds counter intuitive but using and oil based cleanser is good for even oily skin.  I have had no break outs, and it leaves my skin so soft and supple.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does not irritate my sensitive skin and dry skin. It smells really nice and cleans while also being moisturizing. I would also recommend the yes to blueberries face wipes when you are not able to use the cleanser - like the cleaner, the wipes will not strip your skin. This cleaner is not the best at removing make-up but for that I use DHC cleansing oil and then follow up with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I went to Target and browsed their \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skincare section since I have sensitive skin and specifically looked for sulfate free products.  My skin can get weird and flaky when the weather starts cooling so a moisturizing cleanser was a must.    There were a lot to choose from, and I believe I chose this out of exhaustion. I figured it would leave my skin moisturized and it leaves out the bad stuff.    I tried it in the shower and immediately I thought I made a mistake because it felt like I just squirted lotion in my hands instead of cleanser.  I looked at the label and sure enough it says cleanser.  So I continued and it just felt WEIRD.  Cleaning your face shouldn&#x27;t feel like rubbing lotion or vaseline all over.  It did rinse off better than expected but I didn&#x27;t feel my face was \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.    On a positive note, my face was super moisturized and super soft to the touch and didn&#x27;t need any additional moisturizer.  But I would not buy this again, in fact I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and enjoyed this as a soft cleanser in the winter. It is too thick and the coconut oil doesn&#x27;t wash off during the summer in the south.</li>
    <li> If you have combonation skin (like I do) this product is not for you.  I broke out terribly after using for 2-3 days and I thought &amp;#34;surely it can&#x27;t be this wonderful product&amp;#34; but after I stopped, the acne went away.  Probably a great product for some, but not for me.</li>
    <li> When I wash my face in the evening I am trying ro remove my makeup. This literally doesn&#x27;t touch it, and I use fairly light makeup. No heavy foundations or anything. Just a powder and a bronzer. I had to wash my face with something different after using this (I tried to wash it twice, it did nothing). I gave it two stars because it smells good and is probably a nice morning cleanser pre-makeup.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like it... It was replaced.</li>
    <li> I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people less familiar with cream cleansers. These don&#x27;t work the same way a foaming cleanser would, and for aging dry skin this is a positive. I think this is a great cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle, non-irritating and effective.  There is a feeling that something is left on your skin, but it&#x27;s moisturizing and the feeling goes away once dry.  The fact is foaming cleansers leave residue on your face as well, it just feels drier which is why your face is sometimes tight after using a foaming cleanser. Here the residue is non-drying and made with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Nice product, smells good, works well enough, but I do not see a difference in other items on the market that are far less expensive. Just under $10 at Target, this simply is not worth it to me. I am willing to pay for a product that is superior to its competition, but I don&#x27;t think it is.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time, I like it, creamy, can use it as face wash or just wipe it off with a clean wash rag,  doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all. I have dry, mature skin, leaves it smooth and soft. Natural as well. I&#x27;d buy again and again!  I use morning and night.</li>
    <li> I like all the items in the Yes To...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it was anything to rave about but it cleaned my face and smelled pretty good :)</li>
    <li> Like others, I was stunned at how much this felt like a lotion.  I tend to be on the oily side and prone to breakouts.  I&#x27;m over 40 and believe though that part of the reason I am so oily is because I&#x27;m overdoing it on the products.  I have to say that I was quite surprised by the results after using this.  I&#x27;m not oiler or shinier than a normal day.  If anything, I&#x27;m less so.  This is my first time using this, but so far so good.  Good price and I&#x27;m happy that I can pronounce everything in the product.  Three stars since I&#x27;m not through the tube yet.</li>
    <li> does not remove any makeup. i am not sure whether it cleans ur skin or no, it is more like an oil, than moisturizer. maybe u should use it only in the mornings, when you dont have makeup on.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash. I&#x27;m 20 years old with dry skin and this is seriously the best face wash I ever used. It makes your skin glowing and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I use it in the morning before I put my makeup on, and I use it at night if i don&#x27;t have makeup on my face, if i do have makeup on I&#x27;ll use Avalon Organics Vitamin C Orange face wash. Even though this face wash doesn&#x27;t remove makeup it&#x27;s still amazing, and I would say it&#x27;s 10x better than expensive face washes i&#x27;ve tried. People who complain about it being like Vaseline, you must not have dry skin because if you do its so refreshing. Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it , if you actually have dry skin.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better!  It IS more creamy than most cleansers but a good cleanser is NOT supposed to strip your skin, especially an anti-aging cleanser.  I use this with my clarisonic and use the serum on top of it and after a month, my skin is glowing and absolutely beautiful.  I&#x27;m amazed because I&#x27;ve paid a fortune for high end skin products before this.  The only downfall I have noticed is that it is not the best for removing eye make-up but one can always use something else for that first and then use the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have very fair, freckled, sensitive, normal to dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been trying to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my cosmetics and use more natural products so I went looking for a creamy cleanser to replace my toxic chemical-laden one I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am so happy I found this!  Reasonably priced, readily available in stores and online, made of natural ingredients (EWG score of 1), and Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free.  I feel like I hit a home run with this face wash.</li>
    <li> Awful!  I washed my face with this cleanser and it didn&#x27;t take off my makeup even after doing it a 2nd time.  Unpleasant scent as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been purchasing at retail and have been using it for about a year now.  It is an efective cleanser that leaves my skin clean and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Wow i have never had a product make me break out with pimples as badly as this did.  I have dry skin and am not prone to acne. I just wanted a healthier cleaner that did not smell harsh and would not dry out my skin.  This smelled great..like creamy smarties candies..not like chemicals.the texture is a thick cream.  It just clogs pores way too much.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using yes to products! I love them! I&#x27;m 24 and have started using anti aging products as a precautionary measure. This product was too creamy and I felt like it wasn&#x27;t getting my face clean. I switched to yes to carrots exfoliating wash in the morning and the blueberry wash at night.</li>
    <li> Be forewarned: this is not for the suds-addict.  Like the Burt&#x27;s Bees orange oil cleanser, this is actually a very lightweight facial oil product.  &amp;#34;Put oil on my face?&amp;#34; you say.  &amp;#34;That will be horrible and turn me into a giant pimple!&amp;#34; - well, no, it generally won&#x27;t.  You&#x27;ve already got oil on your face, in fact, you need some to keep your skin healthy.  What this cleanser does is gently sweep away some of the excess oil without drying your face out the way that cleansers that suds up and actually strip the oil off your skin do.  This is especially valuable for aging skin, when you really need the extra moisture to combat dryness and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for skin that&#x27;s already heavily oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note here that I used the Burts Bees for several years and had great results, and this cleanser gives me the same results as the BB did before they changed their recipe and made the orange oil cleanser &amp;#34;soapier.&amp;#34;  Really soft, smooth skin and no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, this works.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Washes off easily and leaves my skin soft, not tight and dry.</li>
