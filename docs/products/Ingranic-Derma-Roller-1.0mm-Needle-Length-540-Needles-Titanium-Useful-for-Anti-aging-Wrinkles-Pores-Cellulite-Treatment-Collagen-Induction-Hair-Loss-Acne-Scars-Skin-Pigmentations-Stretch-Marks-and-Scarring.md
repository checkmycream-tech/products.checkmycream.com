      <li>It really liked that it came double wrapped.  </li>

      <li>Only used it once but love it already.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to using it more and seeing a bigger difference!</li>

      <li>Fast shipping.</li>

      <li>I was very nervous about</li>
      <li>I stopped using because it just made my skin super red and irritate.</li>
      <li>I read several reviews on how to use it properly and the amount of pressure that was appropriate.</li>
      <li>I thought that they might be a little bit more rounded on the ends</li>
      <li>It tickles a bit to me, just feels weird but seems to do a great job.</li>

      <li>It was still managable both times and my skin felt so soft the next day.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I was a little freaked out about trying this derma roller, I read up on the internet of all of the possible things that may happen, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it the first time.  </li>
      <li>At first I feel a little bit worry about the needle........</li>
      <li>I have only tried it once, and it left my face a little itchy and red, but, I believe that that is the purpose because it is supposed to open up and clean your pores.</li>

<li> I was a little skeptical about this tool before purchasing but have been really pleased so far!</li>
<li> Purchased to try to heal a long surgery scar on my inner arm.  </li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t so long that they cause bleeding</li>
<li> The first time I didn&#x27;t press to hard although the second round I did.</li>
<li> The roller like other reviewers claim that it came with a double wrap protection.</li>
<li> It was a somewhat uncomfortable feeling, but not painful in anyway.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t that bad as long as you apply it with light even pressure and don&#x27;t stay or roll at one spot for too long.</li>
<li> It was carefully packed.</li>
<li> so I just wanted to try it, because I have cellulite on my inner thighs that goes down all the way down to my calf.  </li>
<li> I have only used this once, but I think I saw a little difference!</li>
<li> I used it on some acne scars on my face, and they seem a little less red.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost about a week every other day and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks.  </li>
<li> I started using due to my stretch marks on my stomach.  </li>
<li> As to it actually doing what it says, I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
<li> I have had a red random spot on my face for months that is almost gone, and I pay extra attention to the pores on my nose, they have shrunk.  </li>
<li> The cleaning part is not really easy (we are soaking into alcohol), other than cleaning, it seems to work as described!</li>
<li> I am very anxious to see the long term results, but I can already see a difference in the texture and the appearance in my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is part of my weekly routine , very excellent results</li>
    <li> I use the product as directed. After watching videos and following the instructions on the packaging, I began to use it. Besides my skin looking irritated I do not see a positive difference. The ingranic derma roller is very nice and the quality is decent (it squeaks when it rolls but doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy  or cheap). I will continue to use and update my review if I see a positive difference.</li>
    <li> Received at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have only tried it once, and it left my face a little itchy and red, but, I believe that that is the purpose because it is supposed to open up and clean your pores. I will continue to use and review my review if needed. So far, it has worked OK</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this tool before purchasing but have been really pleased so far! I thought it would be painful,but it&#x27;s not a bother at all. It&#x27;s not a massage, but it&#x27;s not painful. I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and bottom.</li>
    <li> These are actual needles on a roller. I thought that they might be a little bit more rounded on the ends but they are not. I stopped using because it just made my skin super red and irritate. I do have sensitive skin so you may want to reconsider if you do as well. I received this product for a discounted price in return for my honest review.</li>
    <li> At first I feel a little bit worry about the needle........but it works great.</li>
    <li> The derma roller came on time. It was carefully packed. It is inside the sanitized plastic and it came with the case as well. I used it first time and it was good. I have been using roller for months now so I&#x27;m used to it. I love my roller and I&#x27;m glad that I got it on a discounted price.</li>
    <li> I was really scared to use this and I stared at it for quiet a while before I got the nerve to use it. But man oh man do I love it. I read several reviews on how to use it properly and the amount of pressure that was appropriate. I started on my forehead and crows feet and the laugh lines around my mouth. It was a somewhat uncomfortable feeling, but not painful in anyway. It felt like a mild sunburn after I was finished and I soothed my face with the a nice vitamin C moisturizer and some chamomile spray that I have from one of my facial peels. I am very anxious to see the long term results, but I can already see a difference in the texture and the appearance in my skin. I will continue to use this and post an update of any results.</li>
    <li> Works as described, rolls nicely on skin. Looking forward to the results!</li>
    <li> Great dems roller. Only used it once but love it already. The roller rolls real smooth and easy to move along your skin. Very thorough instructions as well.</li>
    <li> There was a deal on amazon for this product so I just wanted to try it, because I have cellulite on my inner thighs that goes down all the way down to my calf.  I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect because I&#x27;ve never heard about a roller. The packaging is really nice because it comes with this white sterile seal and the roller has a case to it.  I read the directions and I don&#x27;t have treatment or lotion for my cellulite.  So I just tried rolling the derma roller on inner thigh 4-5 in all directions.  It stings! But what do you expect when you have needle going on your skin.  I just started trying it so I don&#x27;t know hwo the results will turn on.. I honestly don&#x27;t like the feeling on my cause it hurts.. but pain is beauty!</li>
    <li> I have only used this once, but I think I saw a little difference! I used it on some acne scars on my face, and they seem a little less red. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it more and seeing a bigger difference!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend. She has the scar on her faces and hopes some treatment can help her to get rid of those scars. Many you tubers recommend the derma roller, and she also seems to love to try it out, so I purchased this. The roller like other reviewers claim that it came with a double wrap protection. It seems very sanitized and new and safe to use. She is still trying to figure out how to use it and prepare some cream stuff, so we haven&#x27;t seen the results yet. She is super excited for sure about trying this product. GREAT SURPRISING GIFT ~ could update more after she tries it out. I received this in a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical able this product when I read that the word &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; was associated.Im laughing at myself now because the needles feel like strong little hands that are massaging my face..My skin feels soft smoothe after each use. It feels as if it takes away layers of dead skin...I.love using my derma roller after giving myself a facial. Im no longer skeptical. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest  opinions on this product.</li>
    <li> Good quality derma roller. Love it.</li>
    <li> Just started using the roller, it doesn&#x27;t feel as bad as I thought it would. As to it actually doing what it says, I&#x27;m not sure yet. Will try to update review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I was terrified of this Derma roller at first but once I read a few reviews I knew I had to at least give it a try.  I have been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s really helping clear up some of my acne scars and smooth out my face!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what true long term use is going to do!</li>
    <li> Works very well, important to clean with alcohol before and after use to avoid infection. It tickles a bit to me, just feels weird but seems to do a great job.</li>
    <li> My first time using a derma roller and I must say it wasn&#x27;t as scary as I thought it would be. I did feel the penetration of the needles on my skin but nothing that was too unbearable. The first time I didn&#x27;t press to hard although the second round I did. It was still managable both times and my skin felt so soft the next day. I will continue to use the roller and see where it leads to.</li>
    <li> I have been using derma rollers to help with my acne scarring and I am pretty happy with the results.  I was very pleased when the Ingranic Derma Roller arrived.  It really liked that it came double wrapped.  The box was sealed with plastic wrap and the actual roller and carrying case was also sealed in the same type of wrapping that surgical supplies are sealed in when they have been sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1.00mm needle is just right for me.  They aren&#x27;t so long that they cause bleeding but they definitely do the job.  I sterilize my face with rubbing alcohol as well as the needles before I use it.  You don&#x27;t want to press germs into your skin when you puncture it with the roller!  The instructions say to roll the derma roller back and forth 4-5 times in each direction - horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.  When you are done, moisturize your face and clean the roller with rubbing alcohol.  The handle makes the device easy to hold without slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I bought that to help stimulate hair growth. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little beauty for about a week. I do actually see a visible difference in my thighs. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love it awesome product</li>
    <li> I received this to review. So far so good. Doing my face for acne scars. In just a few days of use I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is smoother. At the moment the only thing I am doing is basic wash and this so I know what&#x27;s working. So so far so good.</li>
    <li> Awesome product does exactly what it says</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what I was getting myself into when I ordered this.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised with the results.  I&#x27;ve used this twice on my face along with a Hyaluronic Acid Serum to deeply moisturize.  My skin is sooooo soft following 2 treatments.  I&#x27;m pleased with my results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my thigh for my stretch marks and also on my stomach. I was kind of intimidated when I first received it but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt and it definitely works. I got it while it was on promotion but I&#x27;m going to get another for my mom. I definitely recommend it for stretch marks, cellulite, and wrinkles. I think I will try it on my face next.</li>
    <li> This derma roller works great. I had my doubts, but after testing it out I can see results.  Woo hoo!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a little freaked out about trying this derma roller, I read up on the internet of all of the possible things that may happen, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it the first time.  I soak mine in rubbing alcohol for about ten minutes while I prep my face by washing it thoroughly and excoriating.  I go very slowly, the only place that is tender for me is the forehead, I have been using it about three times a week for two weeks and I see a difference!  I have had a red random spot on my face for months that is almost gone, and I pay extra attention to the pores on my nose, they have shrunk.  I will continue to use this derma roller, the 1.00mm needle is the perfect size, I would recommend this to a friend without a doubt!</li>
    <li> Purchased to try to heal a long surgery scar on my inner arm.  After using the derma roller it opened the pores and with the addition of using shea and coco butter, this 10 year old scar has faded quite a bit.  Will continue to use every other day hoping it will eventually go away completely.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. Love it</li>
    <li> I started using due to my stretch marks on my stomach.  I&#x27;ve been using for almost about a week every other day and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks.  The first time I used the roller it was a little weird and a little painful.  But once I got used to it I enjoyed how it felt and my deep stretch marks have gotten lighter.</li>
    <li> This was really scary to use at first because I am afraid of needles but I decided to give it a try. It definitely takes some time to get used to it. I used it on my arms and a little bit on my face. It wasn&#x27;t that bad as long as you apply it with light even pressure and don&#x27;t stay or roll at one spot for too long. This product came in a very sanitized package with specific instructions on how to use it.</li>
    <li> Helps with dark spots and fine lines. Will take a few treatments to see results</li>
    <li> The cleaning part is not really easy (we are soaking into alcohol), other than cleaning, it seems to work as described!</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about this purchase lol But it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought. I did research on the benefits of a roller and since I work as a skin care specialist at Sephora I said why not. So I purchased it and love it. My hubs looks at me crazy when I use it lol But it&#x27;s absolutely great.</li>
