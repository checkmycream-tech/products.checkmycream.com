### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Feels great on the skin!</li>
      <li>/&gt;And by the way, their shampoo and conditioner are also the best in class.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful lotion.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>It is lightweight and absorbs great!</li>
      <li>which adds great scent.</li>
      <li>This lotion used to be great.</li>
      <li>Good lightweight moisturizer with a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a LOT of GOOD lotion for that price &amp; even the price on Amazon</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling good.</li>
      <li>I love applying it and the ingrediants make me feel good about it!</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff - non-greasy, MUCH better ingredients than most chemical-laden lotions.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It is lite and doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming scent!</li>
      <li>I love this brand of lotion!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>After trying the baby bubble bath and loving it for my kids, I thought I&#x27;d try this lotion on them as well.  </li>
      <li>Has a not too nice smell as well.</li>
      <li>It also has a very great smell and moisturizes really well.</li>
      <li>way I love it and am going to try more from this line!</li>
      <li>it is by far the best body lotion ever!</li>
      <li>Look at the ingredient list and you&#x27;ll realize this is the best natural lotion on the market.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light scent.</li>
      <li>This moisurizer is very light in consistancy.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell, too.</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>Smells quite ok, nothing too fragrant about this lotion.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking more for a cocoa butter consistancy which tends to be thicker, then you won&#x27;t find it here.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found an Alaffia product I don&#x27;t love.</li>
      <li>Figured I&#x27;d try it out since I love coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>This seems to be an okay, lightweight lotion.</li>
      <li>Also this brand does wonderful work and gives back to the communities they work with.</li>
      <li>In the best way possible.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
      <li>Usually love the smell</li>
      <li>I find this lotion to be slightly more hydrating for my skin than the Shea lotion, and the coconut smell is very mild and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I would say this probably isn&#x27;t the best for severely dry skin.</li>
      <li>If your skin is super dry, you may want to reconsider, as this is not the &#x27;greasy&#x27; kind of lotions but perfect for balanced skins.</li>
      <li>Smell of cream is not as much coconut as I would have wished, but it is definitely a good cream.</li>
      <li>Much as I loved the Shea lotion, I might have found a new favorite.</li>
      <li>I like a moisturizer that my skin will absorb - this absorbs easily.</li>
      <li>It is light and ceamy, it absorbs without leaving a greasy or waxy residue like shea butter can.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this, my skin is in great condition, even my uh... lover has noticed.</li>
      <li>I thought this lotion would be odor free</li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance that resembles almost a citrus-sy smell, but not the coconut you think of.</li>
      <li>The ingredient list is super short, and it has great ingredients, like virgin coconut oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very light, great for everyday right out of the shower!  </li>
      <li>Better than expected, does not smell like coconuts which is a good thing,  </li>
      <li>Love the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>It has a light smell; not really reminicent of coconuts but nice and tolerable.</li>
      <li>is worth it.</li>
      <li>the smell is too light, I added a ton of Sweet Orange essential oil (also purchased at Whole Foods, where I got this HUGE bottle with a pump!)</li>
      <li>Definately worth the price though if you need light moisturization for normal skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, I smooth a ton on and it sinks in quickly, but still leaves my tight skin REALLY smooth and moisturized!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Everyday Shea which is good but doesn&#x27;t absorb nearly as quickly as this.</li>
      <li>I typically use California Baby and loved that..</li>
      <li>Creamy, non-greasy and very gently on my eczema ridden skin.  </li>
      <li>I love shopping on Amazon and benefit myself from reviews left by others.</li>
      <li>first ingredient is coconut water.  </li>
      <li>The ingredient list on the shampoo is super short, better than anything I&#x27;ve seen and the price is super low for what you get.</li>
      <li>I love how quickly the lotion absorbs into my skin, and how soft my skin feels for a long time after.</li>
      <li>In fact, I think it may have even made my skin more dry.  </li>
      <li>My husband has dry skin and cocoa butter formulas tend to works better for him then coconut oil formulas; and when he switched temporarily to try this</li>
      <li>Perhaps you could add a few drops of a favorite essential oil to make it more fragrant.</li>
      <li>You can get it at whole foods for $10 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Light enough that my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind using it.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and subtle.</li>
      <li>You usually have to warm that a bit so it&#x27;s not convenient</li>
      <li>If my skin is extra dry I do need a little more moisture, but this is just right for most days.</li>
      <li>I recommend highly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, the ingredients are better than anything else on the market, it does moisturize and it smells a little nutty.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I like this lotion.</li>
      <li>My favorite everyday lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super moist, but I have dry skin, and live in Wisconsin, so in the winter I apply 2 layers</li>
      <li>Rubs into skin easily compared to many other thick &amp; stubborn lotions.</li>
      <li>Kind of a sweet smelling artificial nearly coconut smell.</li>
      <li>This product is very soft, fluffy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I bought this at a local grocery store seeing that it was natural and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>No customer service:&lt;br /&gt;I visited their direct website to find contact info to speak to them about their product.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
      <li>SO FAR</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that that pump dispenses a lot at one time, so if you were just looking to hydrate your hands, you&#x27;d have to use it on the entire arm ;)).</li>
      <li>No other brand of lotion comes close to this quality for this price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good moisture that works very well for the dry skin of winter and cold.</li>
      <li>I now use this instead of the thick chemical filled Aquaphor after showers and have had zero reaction.  </li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin, and I also get bad eczema flair ups, so I am usually super cautious about what I put on my skin.  </li>
      <li>It dries out my skin more than any other product I&#x27;ve used, causes itching, and although the scent is mild, it is unpleasant.</li>

    <li> No customer service:&lt;br /&gt;I visited their direct website to find contact info to speak to them about their product. The phone number listed is out of service, and the only other way to contact them is by mailing a PO Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality: Yes the ingredients are as natural as they come, but the lotion itself is extremely watered down. It dries out my skin more than any other product I&#x27;ve used, causes itching, and although the scent is mild, it is unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all..</li>
    <li> This lotion used to be great. Now it is made with some harmful chemicals, such as Phenoxyethanol. I am looking for another brand to replace this.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin, and I also get bad eczema flair ups, so I am usually super cautious about what I put on my skin.  After trying the baby bubble bath and loving it for my kids, I thought I&#x27;d try this lotion on them as well.  I typically use California Baby and loved that.. until now.  I can&#x27;t put lotion on my kids because the California Baby (CB) burns my skin and leaves temporary little red bumps on my hands.  I fully expected this lotion to do the same.  It disappointed.  In the best way possible.  I now use this instead of the thick chemical filled Aquaphor after showers and have had zero reaction.  It&#x27;s kept my skin from being itchy as well.  I will say that the lotion is thinner than the average lotion.  Or maybe it seems so because I&#x27;ve been using thick petroleum based lotions!&lt;br /&gt;Either way I love it and am going to try more from this line!</li>
    <li> Some hand lotions sting if your skin is chapped, this one does not sting our family. The scent is pleasant and subtle.</li>
    <li> This product is very soft, fluffy and smooth. It also has a very great smell and moisturizes really well. However, I like to add coconut oil or castor oil to my lotions for extra shine and moister.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion.  Naturally terrific fragrance.  I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of lotion!  It is lite and doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming scent! It also doesn&#x27;t break my skin out!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling good. Smell of cream is not as much coconut as I would have wished, but it is definitely a good cream.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Personally, I use it on my face and over my body as an after shower moisturizer.  Creamy, non-greasy and very gently on my eczema ridden skin.  No real scent to the lotion at all.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My search ended as I recently spotted this in a health food store for only $8.99. That&#x27;s a LOT of GOOD lotion for that price &amp; even the price on Amazon is worth it. I had been looking for a coconut based lotion without other oils or aloe vera. This seems to be it! It&#x27;s not too greasy. Rubs into skin easily compared to many other thick &amp; stubborn lotions. Smells quite ok, nothing too fragrant about this lotion. Perhaps you could add a few drops of a favorite essential oil to make it more fragrant. The only drawback is that that pump dispenses a lot at one time, so if you were just looking to hydrate your hands, you&#x27;d have to use it on the entire arm ;)). If your skin is super dry, you may want to reconsider, as this is not the &#x27;greasy&#x27; kind of lotions but perfect for balanced skins. Although I did not buy it on Amazon, I felt like adding to the reviews to help other customers. I love shopping on Amazon and benefit myself from reviews left by others.</li>
    <li> I usually can&#x27;t stand coconut lotions because you smell like a pina colada. It has a light fragrance that resembles almost a citrus-sy smell, but not the coconut you think of. It&#x27;s a good moisture that works very well for the dry skin of winter and cold. I love applying it and the ingrediants make me feel good about it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like a moisturizer that my skin will absorb - this absorbs easily. It is light and ceamy, it absorbs without leaving a greasy or waxy residue like shea butter can.  (I realise some peope like greasy, but not me.)</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product!  It&#x27;s moisturizing ability lasts for about ten minutes and then my hands feel like sand paper again and I have to reapply it repeatedly.  I DO NOT recommend it !</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion would be odor free but it definitely is not.  The odor is a little unpleasant and not fresh smelling.  I wanted to add some essential oils to the lotion but was put off by the odor of the lotion and did not want to waste the essential oil in case it smelled worse...</li>
    <li> This toxic chemical should not be added to any personal product.  It has been banned from products in Japan.  I was unaware of the toxicity of this chemical until after I had already purchased it.</li>
    <li> Usually love the smell but This time smells like glue.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I AM GLUTEN INTOLERANT SO HAVE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH LOTIONS.  SO FAR NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ONE.  ONLY PROBLEM IS THE PUMP DIDN&#x27;T WORK AND I HAD TO GO BUY ANOTHER PUMP AT A SALON SUPPLY STORE.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  I  thought that it contained some coconut oil for my very dry skin.  You put it on and you never know or feel like it does anything.  Has a not too nice smell as well. Do not know if the list of ingredients is not in the correct order or what but it does not soften and you cannot feel it at all on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy something else.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff - non-greasy, MUCH better ingredients than most chemical-laden lotions.</li>
    <li> My favorite everyday lotion. If my skin is extra dry I do need a little more moisture, but this is just right for most days. Love the smell, too. Also this brand does wonderful work and gives back to the communities they work with.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body lotion for months and I love it! Feels great on the skin! It is lightweight and absorbs great! No greasy residue! I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> The lotion does moisturize. Look at the ingredient list and you&#x27;ll realize this is the best natural lotion on the market.  The ingredient list is super short, and it has great ingredients, like virgin coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Coconut (cocos nucifera) water*, coffee berry (caffea robusta) extract (aqueous), virgin coconut (cocos nucifera) oil*, stearic acid, vegetable emulsifying wax, copra (cocos nucifera) extract, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate, citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient is coconut water.  I don&#x27;t think there is any lotion on the market that has that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the ingredients are better than anything else on the market, it does moisturize and it smells a little nutty.  And the price is borderline ridiculous for the product you are getting.  No other brand of lotion comes close to this quality for this price.  You can get it at whole foods for $10 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, their shampoo and conditioner are also the best in class.  The ingredient list on the shampoo is super short, better than anything I&#x27;ve seen and the price is super low for what you get.</li>
    <li> Good lightweight moisturizer with a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Very light, great for everyday right out of the shower!  Love the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Everyday Shea which is good but doesn&#x27;t absorb nearly as quickly as this. It&#x27;s nice and light, I smooth a ton on and it sinks in quickly, but still leaves my tight skin REALLY smooth and moisturized! the smell is too light, I added a ton of Sweet Orange essential oil (also purchased at Whole Foods, where I got this HUGE bottle with a pump!) which adds great scent. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this, my skin is in great condition, even my uh... lover has noticed.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I haven&#x27;t found an Alaffia product I don&#x27;t love. It has a very light scent. Light enough that my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind using it. It&#x27;s super moist, but I have dry skin, and live in Wisconsin, so in the winter I apply 2 layers</li>
    <li> I was surprised how much I like this lotion. I had been using the Everyday Shea for a long while before, but decided to try something new out. I find this lotion to be slightly more hydrating for my skin than the Shea lotion, and the coconut smell is very mild and refreshing. I love how quickly the lotion absorbs into my skin, and how soft my skin feels for a long time after. Much as I loved the Shea lotion, I might have found a new favorite.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local grocery store seeing that it was natural and reasonably priced. It has a light smell; not really reminicent of coconuts but nice and tolerable. This moisurizer is very light in consistancy. If you are looking more for a cocoa butter consistancy which tends to be thicker, then you won&#x27;t find it here. It works wonders on my skin; but my skin is also normal; so it gives me the moisturization I need without feeling greasy or thick. I would say this probably isn&#x27;t the best for severely dry skin. My husband has dry skin and cocoa butter formulas tend to works better for him then coconut oil formulas; and when he switched temporarily to try this he was back to his dry itchy skin throughout the day. Definately worth the price though if you need light moisturization for normal skin. It has made some improvement in mine since I started using it.</li>
    <li> This seems to be an okay, lightweight lotion. I have to use it a few times a day.</li>
    <li> Better than expected, does not smell like coconuts which is a good thing,  it is by far the best body lotion ever!</li>
    <li> I like the Everyday Shea unscented lotion but accidentally bought this one time at Whole Foods.  Figured I&#x27;d try it out since I love coconut oil.  This product does not hydrate; however.  In fact, I think it may have even made my skin more dry.  :(  Back to the shea variety.  :)</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the recipient loves it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but sadly it didn&#x27;t deliver. For starters it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin well. Then the smell was that of a Boxed Cake Mix. Kind of a sweet smelling artificial nearly coconut smell. I should have just purchased a jar of coconut oil. You usually have to warm that a bit so it&#x27;s not convenient but it does soften my skin, this doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
