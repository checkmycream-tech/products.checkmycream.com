      <li>and I found this set of nail clippers to be the most amazingly well-made set of clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
      <li>by far the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>These are so nice, I just need to not lose them :)</li>
      <li>But as my wise grandfather once told me, &amp;#34;buy cheap, buy twice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Far and away the best clippers I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Simply the best nail clippers I have ever owned.  </li>
      <li>you do you will be searching this company&#x27;s inventory to see what else they make BETTER than the U.S.A.s 4th-world standards...</li>
      <li>(SS-108).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said: I love the quality of the items.</li>
      <li>I have used many nail clippers over the years and this is better then all the rest.  </li>
      <li>So, what more can I say.  </li>
      <li>It leaves pieces of fingernail everywhere because you have to make so many cuts to finish one fingernail.</li>
      <li>Thank the Japanese to make a wonderful clipper.</li>
      <li>Even better than L.A.</li>
      <li>I have owed many many many...and throw them out , try something else , they so suck...</li>
      <li>If your fingernails are curved like most people, look for another solution.</li>
      <li>i had so many kinds, i don&#x27;t think i would buy anther one, very clean cut, me and wife love it.</li>
      <li>It is a very handsome gift and well worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be buying the cheap ones any more.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the version pictured here in the photo does not match the version I received from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Each clipper has a fine, metallic nail file built into the handle.  </li>
      <li>It is a precision clipper and must be used like the fine instrument that it is.</li>
      <li>KEEP THEM CLEAN  AND EASY TO FIND.</li>
      <li>The cut the nail so smooth that you do not even have to file them afterwards.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Perfect heavy duty instruments.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- smooth transformation</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great home for these two grooming tools, encouraging my husband to return them on the occasions he uses the larger clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ones I received do not have the nail file and do not cut smoothly.</li>
      <li>Elegant and smooth, worth</li>
      <li>- I went through many clippers before I found these, including a pair that looked like Metal and turned out to be painted plaster of some kind!&lt;br /&gt;These are truly a good grade of metal and work very well on normal nails</li>
      <li>I would normally give this a 1-star review because of the bait-and-switch, but since many folks ignore or never read 1-star reviews, I thought I&#x27;d post this 2-star review so that it might be seen by more people.</li>
      <li>(can&#x27;t remember if I got him toenail or fingernail originally, but now we have both).</li>
      <li>Beautifully packaged, easy to handle and very sharp.  </li>
      <li>They fit great in your fingers, little pressure to cut, very even cut, look great, the files on them leaves a smooth surface, and the case is very well made.</li>
      <li>They were heavy and sharp and felt great in my hand and were perfect in every way.</li>
      <li>NO SNAGGING NAIL CLEAN CUT.</li>
      <li>Great sharp nail clippers that cut rather than tear the nail.</li>
      <li>And the reviews seen here are mostly for the older set of clippers.</li>
      <li>My experience over a period of more than 20 years is that they make excellent products which, though expensive, are well made and wear well.</li>
      <li>The clippers are very pretty.</li>
      <li>However, very sharp and works great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d previously purchased the Seki Edge Ss-109 Satin Slim Clipper, and was extremely happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Very smooth action.</li>
      <li>While it comes in handy at times, I prefer the larger clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because these are totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I also got him the Seki Edge Smart Treezer that fit right into this case.</li>
      <li>But worth every cent.</li>
      <li>However, it has proved to be unexpectedly useful.</li>
      <li>worth every cent...</li>
      <li>Nice quality without the expense of the German products.</li>
      <li>Rather pricey but worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These clippers are incredible. They fit great in your fingers, little pressure to cut, very even cut, look great, the files on them leaves a smooth surface, and the case is very well made.</li>
    <li> Alas, the curved edge large clipper is not available except in this two piece grooming kit. IMHO, the kit is worth buying for that piece alone. When I initially ordered the kit, I thought that while the leather case is nice, I could live without it. However, it has proved to be unexpectedly useful. It&#x27;s a great home for these two grooming tools, encouraging my husband to return them on the occasions he uses the larger clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller clipper does not have a curved edge, and its cutting edge is shorter than most. For some reason, it&#x27;s straight. While it comes in handy at times, I prefer the larger clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, both Seki Edge and Greenbell/Green Bell are manufactured in Japan by the same Japanese entity. My experience over a period of more than 20 years is that they make excellent products which, though expensive, are well made and wear well.</li>
    <li> Elegant and smooth, worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with these after a year or so of use.  They are very high quality and precise in their cutting.</li>
    <li> Simply the best nail clippers I have ever owned.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to purchase another pair again.  These are so nice, I just need to not lose them :)</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe i paid so much for these, and said to myself after ordering it ....you have totally lost your mind...loooool...when I received it..I was blown away at how nice they are...even packaged  to the max...the leather case is so well made , the clippers are so well made and well just like nothing I have ever seen like this....I have owed many many many...and throw them out , try something else , they so suck...so much wasted money for them, cause they never work well ..........well meet the macdaddy of all chippers when you get these....they are da bomb! worth every cent...really....I have now ordered 5 sets as gifts...Trust me ...you will be happy with them..</li>
    <li> These clippers are very well constructed and sharp.  Work very well and should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Far and away the best clippers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  They clip finger and toe nails with very little effort required.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great quality clippers and.found em. I was sick of the poor and cheap products you get everywhere now days which leave your nails chipped</li>
    <li> Quality tools, quality case. I do not regret.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful for clipping fingernails and toenails</li>
    <li> The clippers are very pretty. Nice case, very sharp. But I agree with some reviews. I have a tough time getting a clean cutting edge, requiring a follow up file.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who travels a lot for his job. I also got him the Seki Edge Smart Treezer that fit right into this case. Hasn&#x27;t used them yet but like the idea and liked the case they came it. His comment was &amp;#34;Oh that&#x27;s fancy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Buyer beware of false advertising! The kit I got  did NOT have the satin clippers with the nail files. They were entirely  different models.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He has very hard nails and has found that traditional nail clippers do not make a clean cut.  He was thrilled with the sharpness of these clippers.  He said that they cut beautifully and do not leave any fray.  It is a very handsome gift and well worth the cost.  These clippers will last a lifetime</li>
    <li> I received curved nail clippers instead of straight clippers. The curved clippers are the exact same item as the SS-106 Seki Studio branded clippers. The Toenail clippers are not the exclusive unavailable separately clippers mentioned and pictured elsewhere; they are the SS-107 clippers (Greenbell G-1007).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should be in the kit is toenail clippers that are as described, and fingernail clippers that are straight (SS-108).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said: I love the quality of the items. I have SS-106 and 107 clippers separately, as well as a few other Greenbell/Seki items. The quality is absolutely unsurpassed. I am reviewing the kit for having the wrong items, not the quality of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this kit shipped with the *wrong clippers*. I can&#x27;t really blame the vendors because there are many selling the same set, and the boxes are sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictured are the clippers I received in my kit.</li>
    <li> These are a very good quality and work great on fingernails.  Unfortunately, the opening that slide over your nail is not very wide...so if you have toenails that are thicker, they do not work.&lt;br /&gt;Not sorry I bought them - I went through many clippers before I found these, including a pair that looked like Metal and turned out to be painted plaster of some kind!&lt;br /&gt;These are truly a good grade of metal and work very well on normal nails</li>
    <li> SHARP AT CUTTING, FINE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Item received as described and on time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product very excellent condition and is with high quality&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Best regards</li>
    <li> The family loves it.  My wife made fun of me spending so much on it.  But worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a (side gift) for my wife because you can&#x27;t give clippers as a present and stay married.  I introduced it as a &#x27;silly side gift&#x27;, but really I was looking to get ride of the crappy clippers around the house.  Now a few months have past and I&#x27;ve heard nothing about these, so I asked today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;They&#x27;re awesome!  Because my nails keep chipping I&#x27;ve been using them a lot lately and they&#x27;re really really sharp!  They work great!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it was more than one sentence, led me to believe she&#x27;s happy with them.  Tonight begins the tossing of the old crappy ones.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality and a very nice case.  This was right in my price range and I read a lot of reviews.  I really think these will last a long time.  Note the small file Seki sells will also fit in the case.  There is a little pocket on the top and it fits on an angle so you can keep it in there.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  Oh and they cut nails with ease!</li>
    <li> - Super high quality&lt;br /&gt;- Nice cover&lt;br /&gt;- really sharp&lt;br /&gt;- tough joints&lt;br /&gt;- smooth transformation&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money and care about having a fine product which will last you ages, buy this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t try it for enough time but it&#x27;s a very nice product, excellent leather case and gift type Japanese style package.</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong clippers. They are not as pictured and perform worse than the ones pictured. The only reason I ordered them is a friend had a set and they worked extremely well. The ones I received do not have the nail file and do not cut smoothly. I didn&#x27;t think I could be this dissatisfied over nail clippers, but this feels like a bait and switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning these unless the vendor can work with me to fix this.</li>
    <li> Got tired of cheap clippers that simply tore at my nails, read the great reviews for this set, and tried them.  Simply awesome.  Hubby tried them and wanted his own set too.  So, what more can I say.  Highly recommend these clippers that cut your nails smoothly and with ease.</li>
    <li> Quality item. Super sharp. Very well crafted. Well worth the money. Best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item first on November 2, 2013 and I found this set of nail clippers to be the most amazingly well-made set of clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen. They were heavy and sharp and felt great in my hand and were perfect in every way. I could not have loved them more. And even though they were pricey, I decided to buy a second set for travel on August 17, 2015. Unfortunately, the maker appears to have changed the design or manufacturer of this item and the newer version of this product seems cheap by comparison to the originals I purchased at the end of 2013. The clippers in the newer set are not as heavy and don&#x27;t have the same quality feel as the older version. They aren&#x27;t bad as far as clippers go but they certainly aren&#x27;t worth the hefty price for this kit. Most importantly, the version pictured here in the photo does not match the version I received from Amazon. Buyer beware! The manufacturer is not shipping what is seen here! And the reviews seen here are mostly for the older set of clippers. I would normally give this a 1-star review because of the bait-and-switch, but since many folks ignore or never read 1-star reviews, I thought I&#x27;d post this 2-star review so that it might be seen by more people.</li>
    <li> BEST CLIPPERS SET I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. HAS NICE NAIL SET INSIDE CLIPPERS. NO SNAGGING NAIL CLEAN CUT. FILE SMOOTHING EDGES. HEAVY DUTY STEEL. GREAT HANDLING. EXTENSION ON TOE CLIPER.And nice leather case with TKK ZIPPER. KEEP THEM CLEAN  AND EASY TO FIND.</li>
    <li> Very nappy with these.  Nice quality without the expense of the German products.</li>
    <li> I got this item and was really excited, because I bought my husband Seki clippers and he loved them so much he bought the other (can&#x27;t remember if I got him toenail or fingernail originally, but now we have both). They feel high quality and are SHARP! My dad always misplaces his clippers and must have a dozen pairs of cheap Revlon, so I thought ifI got him a quality set with a cute little case, it&#x27;d be harder to lose. Well, I was disappointed in the clippers because they weren&#x27;t identical to what my husband has - they didn&#x27;t even say SEKI on them, which had me wondering.... so I returned them and elected to think of a different gift. Wish I could have just bought the case...</li>
    <li> Very well made with truly sharp cutting edges. After buying a single clipper I purchased these sets for wife &amp; daughter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how serious you can be about nail clippers. These are fantastic!! The cut the nail so smooth that you do not even have to file them afterwards.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the straight edged fingernail clipper. It leaves pieces of fingernail everywhere because you have to make so many cuts to finish one fingernail. If your fingernails are curved like most people, look for another solution.</li>
    <li> This is as nice as I have seen. In fact it is so nice that my wife took one look and said here, you can have my old set  and thanks for getting this for me. The perfect ploy. I can&#x27;t say anything as my name would be mud. Ah well, AMAZON always has more!</li>
    <li> Excellent made in Japan quality pair of nail and toe clippers equal in quality to the German brands at half the price.</li>
    <li> Best clipper set I&#x27;ve ever used. I won&#x27;t be buying the cheap ones any more.</li>
    <li> Why would anyone pay about $50 for nail clippers?  OK, there are both fingernail and toenail clippers and they come in a very nice case but what&#x27;s the big deal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big deal for me is their extraordinary quality.  They are so sharp that they cut through some pretty tough nails like a knife through butter.  Each clipper has a fine, metallic nail file built into the handle.  The design and construction is pure elegance.  These are the &amp;#34;Kobe beef&amp;#34; of nail clippers compared to the hamburger clippers that I have struggled with for years.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Sharp and strong. Great look too.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Clips with no need to file. That is what all clippers should do. Thank the Japanese to make a wonderful clipper.</li>
    <li> High quality, excellent case, elegant</li>
    <li> Precision instruments - I&#x27;ve been looking for this quality at an affordable price for years since I lost (senior moment) my 60 year old Solingen Steel set from Hoffritz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d previously purchased the Seki Edge Ss-109 Satin Slim Clipper, and was extremely happy with it.  This Grooming Kit adds a straight-edge fingernail clipper and a toe nail clipper, and they are both every bit as excellent as our original Ss-109 purchase.  I highly recommend them all!</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers...by far the best I have ever used. They are very sharp, sturdy, high-quality, and effortless to use ...much easier than another brand that claims to be the &amp;#34;Best Nail Cippers for Men &amp; Women&amp;#34; (also purchased on Amazon).</li>
    <li> These nail clippers will cut nails like butter and they will stay sharp for a long long time. I owned a lot of cheap nail clippers and none of them stayed sharp for a year. I owned this nail clippers for over two years now and they still cut nails like butter. I actually bought a second kit for my brother-in-law as a gift and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably sharp.  Takes very little pressure to cut a nail.  The toenail clippers are slightly curved, while the fingernail clipper is straight edged.  I would rate it higher if the latter were curved, also.</li>
    <li> Why spend so much on a nail clipping set? Because these are totally worth it. I have purchased the $1 ones at the store for a long time before I got fed up and decided to splurge on this. These cut through your nails like butter and I have been using mine for 7 or 8 months and they work as well as the day I received them. The packaging looks very cute and would be great to give as a gift. The case looks high quality. I have even purchased another one for my dad! These will last me years.</li>
    <li> well made elegant case, very sharp cutters. it would be nicer if the clippers come with the plastic covers on the side, likes my other models they make, to catch and hold the cut pieces of nails.</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to purchase such an expensive pair of clippers but these are worth every penny.  I bought them for my husband and he has been very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I have had many, many sets of nail clippers, but these are the best I have used.  Beautifully packaged, easy to handle and very sharp.  If I don&#x27;t lose them, they will be my last.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are precision surgical-implement level clippers. I choked on the price initially but these are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great sharp nail clippers that cut rather than tear the nail.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. Even better than L.A.</li>
    <li> Worth the price.  I feel like they are so well made.  I could pass it to my kids.  Lol</li>
    <li> Very nicely crafted, but not branded with Seki name anywhere (not on packaging, case, or either set of clippers). This should have been noted in the product description. Also, fingernail clippers were straight, not curved...maybe description said this; if so, I missed it.</li>
    <li> i had so many kinds, i don&#x27;t think i would buy anther one, very clean cut, me and wife love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect heavy duty instruments. Only funny thing is the fingernail clipper has a bigger file than the toenail clipper. &amp;#34;course,I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t file my toenails all that much, but still...I&#x27;m getting back into playing my classical guitar-need smooth fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this as a lifetime investment.</li>
    <li> I have used many nail clippers over the years and this is better then all the rest.  It is a precision clipper and must be used like the fine instrument that it is. It will cut your nails with ease. Take your time and don&#x27;t over cut.</li>
    <li> Great product. Extremely sharp and pleasure to use. Nice leather pouch. Especially the finger nail clipper lets you cut exactly the way you want. No more sore fingers. Rather pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Completely orgasmic.  For things that matter I ALWAYS look for Japanese products, no matter what the cost...  Everyone in the USA struggles with those cheap drug-store clippers.. dull blades... fingers hurt from pressing down so hard, and that JOKE of a &#x27;file&#x27; that is more suited for auto mechnics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres the deal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) REAL stainless-steel - not zinc or fake chrome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) SHARP BLADES - if you never thought about being &#x27;cautious&#x27; with nail clippers, you will with these!  Its like playing with the butchers knives -- the REAL DEAL... handle with common-sense...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) FILE IS BIBLICAL - this is a REAL nail file!  Not that jagged mess on your &#x27;typical&#x27; Chinamerican clippers.  In fact the file deverves its ow subheading:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  a) unbelievably EFFORTLESS to file your nails... just BARLEY strike your nails and INSTANTLY they are smooth as butter&lt;br /&gt;  b) Super-fine abrasive... you cant even see the &#x27;file&#x27; reliefs, but BOY does it work...&lt;br /&gt;  c) UN-FRICKING-BELIEVABLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The CASE.  This case ain&#x27;t junk.  This is a REAL case with a REAL YKK zipper.  And there is an extra pouch for your extra&#x27;s...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) No &#x27;dirt-digger&#x27; on the clipper like on Chinamerican clippers.  BUT there is a pocket in the case for your accessories...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are SICK of cheap Chinamerican throwaway, expendable, disposable, Cracker-Jack-Box, GARBAGE, spend the debt-notes for this FINE Japanese work of art...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after you do you will be searching this company&#x27;s inventory to see what else they make BETTER than the U.S.A.s 4th-world standards...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Sharp, curved toenail clippers.  Built in files and the case are an extra bonus!!</li>
    <li> The sharpest nail clips I&#x27;ve ever used.  Also love the case that helps makes sure the clippers don&#x27;t get misplaced.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Note: These are European style. Straight toenail clipper, curved nail clipper (the opposite of the US).  However, very sharp and works great</li>
    <li> These are a bit pricey, but the quality is superb.  I would buy them again,</li>
    <li> Okay.&lt;br /&gt;As a guy who usually doesn&#x27;t give a darn about tools of this nature, I just have to put in my .02 on this set.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, YES. Worth it, ABSOLUTELY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the brand that most folks get from the local drug stores and have a drawer full of worn out ones that need to be recycled into these works of art. And that&#x27;s what they look like. The feel of the cut and the feel of the finished nail edge has to be seen and felt to believe. No nail snags and the unique built in file system is very handy and safe. These tools are something you will want to hand down like a fine watch or jewelry. Okay,maybe I&#x27;m going a bit overboard but really, these are very high quality and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case that the clippers nest in is also of high quality and heavy duty with a YKK zipper. What is a YKK zipper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the world&#x27;s largest zipper manufacturer, YKK Group is most famous for making zippers; however, it also manufactures other fastening products, architectural products and industrial machinery. This zipper is very industrial and robust, opens and closes with ease without binding. Very smooth action. Typical Japanese quality on both the clippers and the case. Everything about this nail clipper set oozes quality which is something that is lacking in todays cheap disposable environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah this set not cheap and you probably could buy a lifetime supply of the lower quality brands, but you get what you pay for. But as my wise grandfather once told me, &amp;#34;buy cheap, buy twice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never have to buy nail clippers again.</li>
    <li> They have the best of sharpness, shape, and size of any I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Wow, are these sharp! Nicely packaged.</li>
