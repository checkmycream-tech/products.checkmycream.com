<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 20% Vit C, hyaluronic acid and Jojoba oil. Very little Vitamin C and that is what it is advertised as. I guess I should have looked at the ingredient list closer. Won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says it does and more.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product two weeks but I already see a definite fading to age spots on my face.  I only see one drawback to the product, I am not wild about the smell.</li>
    <li> Noticed a slight difference after 1 month of use around my eyes which is great however it did cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> I was out looking for a product to help me get rid of blemishes,dark spots and acne marks. Even though the product description higlighted the anti aging properties of the serum, I thought of giving it a shot. I m 26 n wrinkles is not a problem for me as of now nor i m a spendthrift person who would spend money on just any product. I ordered the product reading the positive reviews and after one or two use didn&#x27;t notice any difference but continued applying the product on a daily basis after a week&#x27;s usage i noticed my dark sports had started diminishing . Its been a month now  and  I have started receiving compliments. Not only did my blemishes faded this product transformed my face. My skin never looked so even tonned before and the skin glows from within. I have tried various other natural remedies and several products available in market. But trust me guys this one product is the solution to all ur skin problems. Try n u will believe me. This is one product i will use mylifetime.</li>
    <li> My skin would sting a bit but no significant improvement</li>
    <li> This product is as described...and I&#x27;m enjoying it very much...I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I have paid hundreds of dollars and this is the best product I have used for my skin.  If you are like me and try everything and anything - STOP. You will find what you are looking for here!</li>
    <li> I first heard about the combination of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid from Dr. Oz show.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and when I run out, my skin starts to look dull and the small spider veins show.  When I start using it again, I immediately get compliments.  The other day, my husband said &amp;#34;you are glowing, you must have had a good day!&amp;#34;  Wow, to me cause and effect are evidence it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using the vitamin c serum on my face for 3 days and I see a beautiful glow more and more w very day...love it</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. So far disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works well. Skin is brighter. Freckles are lighter. Gentle.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of vitamin C serums. I&#x27;m 51 but peoply usually think I&#x27;m at least 10 years younger - I have a youthful-looking family, but also take good care of my skin and weight.  I have seen age spots, scars and general face/neck darkening lessen and disappear. I also think Vitamin C helps fight sagging. I began a somewhat more intense skin program when I turned 50 and was dismayed to see a slight jowly effect - yikes! My daughter and husband both saw an improvement after a month or two. I use it in conjunction with several other treatments such as retinol and collagen masks and serums, however I always make sure to spread them out and I&#x27;m careful not to overdo products by applying them in rotation. Typically I use vitamin C in the morning after I wash my face.  I apply it and wait a few minutes before using sunscreen and makeup.  If I use a derma roller, I  use it afterwards. I am currently using vitamin C on my forearms and the backs of my hands morning and night to reduce marks there. I  have used a couple of different brands as well as bought my own powder to mix for myself. I have recommended vitamin C to several friends and they report similar results.  This brand feels great going on - I like its silky feeling - and the hyaluronic acid combats the C&#x27;s tendency to dry out your skin.  I am planning to continue buying this brand  It works great!</li>
    <li> This has done absolutely nothing to improve my skin in any way. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this Vitamin C Serum, I was looking for a Serum that was within my budget.  What a surprise I got when I tried it.  It feels so silky on the skin, and absorbs quickly.  I happened to watch a segment of Dr Oz&#x27;s show on Utube when he was asked which products were the best one could buy for the skin.......guess what, it&#x27;s Vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid.  The product he was selling costs about 3 X as much, as the Go Radiance Vitamin C.  I feel so lucky to have found this product.  Anyone who takes pride in taking care of their skin should get this.  It&#x27;s affordable and really WORKS!!!!!  I am 75 years young, and not looking for a miracle, but my skin glows (no other way to describe it).  Do something good for your skin, and get this product.  If I&#x27;m glowing, imagine someone 30 years younger and how good they will look!</li>
    <li> love this vitamin c serum.I have tried many and this is my favorite.Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I just love it , it&#x27;s not greasy , absorbs in the skin , unlike other similar products in the market which are sticky, I use it Twice a day , i say go for it.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described. Works very well with my regiment of face cocktail. The company seems legit as well with product feedback.</li>
    <li> I have been trying lots of serums and this is the best</li>
    <li> My skin really sucks up this serum.  Helps minimize my wrinkles and make a wonderful base for my makeup.  It glides on smooth and even .</li>
    <li> Like the feel! It is totally absorbed into my skin with no residuals, my skin is now smoother</li>
    <li> Skin products are as different as each person using them. Vitamin C happens to work well on my skin. I saw some improvement in just a few days. I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of anti-aging products, some good, some not so much. While La Mer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I have to say that adding the vitamin C has given La Mer a little boost. Short of a face lift, this is as good as it&#x27;s going to get.</li>
    <li> This serum works just as it is advertised. Several friends and I decided to give it a try and all of us agree that it tightens and  adds moisture to our skin. I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> it is not for an over night change. But, change, for sure.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working....have used other Vit C Serums for quite a while and strongly recommend using it.  Not a fan of the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; citrus smell, but not annoying enough to not use it! Will probably go back to my other brand when time to reorder.</li>
    <li> Helping to make my complexion look brighter and healthier</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product! I had been using a product from the dermatologist and I like this better. And the price! Will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Is in the using of it! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and a little to my surprise, both the lady at the store where I usually buy my make-up and my dermatologist said that they noticed an improvement in my complexion.</li>
    <li> I just received the serum three days ago and so far I really like it. The serum is not to thick and I know I will have to give it more time concerning wrinkle reduction and skin discoloration. Although since I have been using this product twice a day for three days I have noticed some skin lightening and I like that and my skin feels a lot smoother already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I like the fact that the company sent me an email on how to apply the serum that is great customer service! I also like the fact that the company told me to give this product up to thirty days to see more results. Very true as Rome was not built in a day, with any skincare regimen you need to give it time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have watched DR. OZ and he mentions that vitamin C is an anti aging skin property. I use this skincare product with my Diva D Titanium Derma Roller which I also received that product three days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will keep you posted as to how this works by giving it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the big size of the bottle I get more product for my money and when you are on a budget that is nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product in the mornings after washing my face and prior to make up application. The only thing I can validate for anyone is that you do only need a little bit with each application, it does dry quickly and it does make my face feel tighter. I am going to continue to use this product every day. Well worth the reasonable price here compared to other brands with equivalent ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great product. I can already see the difference</li>
    <li> This is twice the size of most Serums for the money. It is a beautiful product and my skin loves it!</li>
    <li> Very good product with a very reasonable price.  This is better than similar products that cost twice the price.  For this price, try it and I think you will like it. Works for me.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and even economic price, I&#x27;m in test phase, but in accordance with the little time I have using it I&#x27;m already seeing good results</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C serum!!! My skin feels smoother and softer. I will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is great and it leaves my skin feeling soft</li>
    <li> Great product. Patients love that it is twice the size of other similar products. Everybody loves it so far.</li>
    <li> Only used it twice so far, will update about progress. What I loved immediately was that a.) it soaked into the skin very fast, and b.) it left skin silky smooth for hours. Looking forward to see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it in the morning after cleansing and before applying moisturizer.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and healthy.  After trying too many harsh and allergenic products, I now use this and coconut oil with the best results every.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for an excellent price!  It has reduced the fine lines on my cheeks, improved the look of the skin around my eyes and has really made a difference on my neck and décolletage!  I also appreciate the follow-up email on the product&#x27;s use.  This is a company who cares!  (Even if you improve the labeling, the necessary small print will still be difficult to read for the consumer who stands to get the most benefit from your product.)</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Even at my age (66) I am prone to get an occasional pimple and by using this product, the healing process begins immediately, leaving my skin with a more radiant look. I would certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> makes skin very smooth  no allergic reaction  will order again</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel wonderful</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Fine lines have improved, overall tone has improved. I had a dark spot on my cheek that has faded and reduced in size!! I&#x27;ve tried countless products to get those results. Products work differently for each person, but this is well worth the try - looking forward to what my skin looks like when I reach the end of the bottle!</li>
    <li> Two weeks and I can tell my pores are smaller and nothing to extract.  Also made my acne scars fade fast too.  My face looks more radiant,  even when I drink alcohol twice weekly.  Awesome product!  Great price makes it more appealing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this would repair my dried out face, but it&#x27;s made a difference people notice.  They aren&#x27;t screaming and running now.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum and you get twice as much for the same price!</li>
    <li> This product takes a few months to see results but age spots are becoming lighter and my skin looks healthier and younger.</li>
    <li> Well priced liquid vitamin C serum.  Not greasy or drying, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected of a serum.  I&#x27;ve purchased other vitamin C serums from Amazon before, but they were all in gel form and had added fragrance.  It was very difficult to get the last bit of serum out of the bottle when it&#x27;s in gel form so I prefer BEST Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Hello, It is my pleasure to give a review on the Vitamin C serum.  This is a new product that I have added to my daily routine and I absolutely love it!! I love the feel and the results I&#x27;m getting my face feels smoother looks healthier and brighter, I wasn&#x27;t expecting results so quickly.   I actually felt that my skin was pretty good already, but it is that much better how amazing!!.  I am so pleased about how I feel when I use my vitamin C every morning and every evening, and the amount that you get for such a low price, is a really great deal.... I will be purchasing it from now on, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Have used this company&#x27;s products before and am very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum daily for the last 2 years. It makes a difference on my look!! The face is clean, radiant, no aging spots. I also use it daily on my hands to prevent getting the aging spots. As a tip, before you apply it on your face and hands use a toner to clean you skin to prepare it for the Vit C serum. Apply the serum and after, apply a hydrating or moisturizing cream, at least 30 SPF.</li>
    <li> I bought this twice now because it is a good product and the price for 2 oz is great!  The serum is a thick fluid that stays where you put it and dries quickly.  Smells like citrus too.  Real Vitamin C gives you a glowing and clear complexion.</li>
    <li> You get like double the amount of other serums for the same price. I think this is working to reduce age spots on my face.  Time will tell, but so far I really like the consistency of this, goes on easily and absorbs fast.  Hoping for great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used C Serum in the past and have seen results within a few days! I ran out &amp; haven&#x27;t used in a while but decided to order again~This C Serum has given me no results whatsoever!!! I feel like I wasted my money~No tightening, no tingling, nothing at all! Please try a different brand &amp; don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
    <li> Very GOOD!  Great Price</li>
    <li> I do not have photo at this times</li>
    <li> Hard to write a review without using for 1-2 months and see changes in skin. Anyway, product feels great on so I&#x27;m excited to see where it goes.</li>
    <li> Just OK, will not order any more.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and need some time to give a verdict. So far, I like it.</li>
    <li> Awsome product!!!! And the founder emails you great tips!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working nicely</li>
    <li> This really does a good job at evening out skin tones and lightening up dark spots on face.  I also noticed after about 5 weeks a softening up wrinkles around my eye area.  I use it every night after my shower.  I gently apply to my face and neck area.  Then once it dries I follow up with a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I actually see the same results using this brand versus the higher priced ones.  Will continue to use this product daily. Very  happy with the results.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  feels good going on, tightens a little (I think that&#x27;s the aloe) and I feel good about using it.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped quickly and as far as I can tell (at the moment--one week out), all seems good.  The one area I was concern with and would highly recommend to the producers, is that the labeling and letters identifying the ingredient, etc. is written in the same or similar to the background.  Therefore, you can NOT read anything other than the front Large print....which makes me a little concern as to &amp;#34;what&#x27;s really&amp;#34; in this bottle.  That is the reason I gave the product 3 stars.  You can not read the any of the labeling on the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent really work if you looking for even your skin tone. Absolutely worth it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, Love the feel on my face and hands.</li>
    <li> I was amazed with this C Serum from the first time I tried it.  I have very sensitive skin and cannot use most beauty products because my skin reacts easily.  This C Serum does not make my skin red or even pink, just a lovely overall healthy glow.  I was so pleased by this I immediately ordered another of the generous 2oz bottles.  It’s a healer not a moisturizer so I use it after the toner and follow with rosehip or argan both of which compliment the C Serum’s nourishing properties.&lt;br /&gt;I have just begun my second bottle of this exceptional Serum that has brought results with removing and fading brown spots on face and hands. These are all quality products, but this one is perhaps the best of them all.</li>
    <li> I have used this everyday (twice a day) and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on even the fine lines on my face.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> This serum has too many ingredients and unfortunately caused my skin to break out. Could you possible make a more simpler solution with just&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C 20% with just Hyaluronic Acid?</li>
    <li> This is the only vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried, but it is making my skin softer and it is giving me that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that it advertises. I wash my face with a Clinique sonic brush, so that constant exfoliating helps too. This is a fairly large bottle so I would call it a very good value. I would not pay a lot of money for a facial supplement like this, which is why I have stayed away from the makeup counters!</li>
    <li> great for having a bright skin</li>
    <li> I noticed a lightening of dark spots and brightening of my complexion within a week. Not too strong but does the job.</li>
    <li> BEST Vitamin C Serum For Face.  Wonderful product!  Absorbs easily and is not a heavy product that simply lays on top of your skin.  Not greasy, and most important to me as well, is that there is NO frangrance.  Wonderful feedback from the seller on how to use the product.  Will order again!!  Very pleased!!  5 Stars</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love this product very much. I plan to keep it on hand and when I get low on last bottle I plan to keep ordering..this is the best product I have ever used on this 71 yr. Face. Lines are disappearing as well as brown spots..best investment and fast service. Glad I found it.  Marilyn Alcorn</li>
    <li> Love the product! Applies easily and is non greasy. Leaves my skin feeling tight once absorbed!</li>
    <li> I love it. If feels so nice on my face.</li>
    <li> Just OK...  I used this after using InstaNatural and wanting a bigger bottle, but I am switching back.  I prefer the thicker quality of InstaNatural over this as far as vitamin C serums are concerned.  This was very watery and I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much. I noticed a difference right away with InstaNatural</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for around a month now, and I can really see a difference in my skin texture. I have always heard that vitamin c is good for your skin, and I now see that it is true!  I have tried so many other skin care products in the past, and none of them showed results on my face like I&#x27;ve seen with this product.  Also, great price for such a large bottle!  I will definitely order another bottle of the same serum when this one is all gone.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I apply it in the morning to protect my skin from the strong sun in Vegas. I break out from the sun and heat, I have to put antibiotic cream on the sores, so they don&#x27;t get infected. I use a 50% sunscrean and the vit. c helps.</li>
    <li> Really like,it thanks for the price</li>
    <li> This is 2nd Time that bought this serum, and I love it, first time was like water but worked and this time looks like more serum, Im using this product for 3 months, my skin had hyper-pigmentation and acne, and now looks soft</li>
    <li> Works great, cant&#x27; beat the size and value!</li>
    <li> we lliked it so much the first time, we had to get more to have on hand. thank you.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and it is well worth the price I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell... So far it makes my skin feel better,smoother,fresher. Lets see how it&#x27;s impressive in a week or so. So far ,so good!</li>
    <li> I receive it just as expected waiting to try it in soap making.</li>
    <li> It seems to tighten real well. Not sure if the wrinkles are disappearing yet. May have to use it for a while before I see results. It is affordable.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used it as the instruction said on the label and the seller emailed me the direction to use. in 1 week, the results are my pore on my face is tighten up 50% that i can see. i live in florida, so i always have heat rash on my cheeks (even i apply sunblock SPF 50 everyday), and some breakouts on my t-zone from time to time, this serum calms down and nourishes my skin, my face looks better in the morning right away after i apply at night with the good amount of it. the serum looks like water without any kind of smell. but it works well. it leaves my skin soft just like everybody said on their reviews. only one thing that i don&#x27;t get the result at all is my sun spot (dark spot, age spot), there&#x27;s no improvement. but i will try to take more time to use this serum another week. at least 2 weeks, i should get some better result. i have sensitive and combination skin. this serum does not harm my skin at all. hope to see my damaged spots fade away soon. thank you.</li>
    <li> Really love it. I have a dark spot on my cheek left from acne for three years. It bothers me a lot and I bought so many expensive products but did not work. I use vitamin C serum for a week and see much better result.</li>
    <li> Great product I can see and feel the difference on my skin would buy again</li>
    <li> The best vit c out there and I&#x27;ve tried them all&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service</li>
    <li> While I am not sure of any results - I&#x27;ve only just recently received the product - the seller was very prompt and it came as shown. thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used the product for approx 8 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement in my skin.  I am African American and was hoping to reduce pore size and fade some recent acne scars- as some of the reviews indicated it helped with both.</li>
    <li> Thank you Go Radiance!  I love this product and I am anxious to try the others.  High quality without the high price;&lt;br /&gt;making beauty products affordable for everyone :)&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to your new website!!!</li>
    <li> Im 26 ywars old and i been using it since may 16 and so far not noticing any difference in my skin..  will update later</li>
    <li> Thank you for the prompt delivery, I have only been using it for about a week so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is, maybe I will do a follow up in a month.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference in my skin almost immediately!  My skin is firmer and definitely brighter.  I have not seen a difference in dark spots, but I have only been using it for a few weeks.  I will definitely make this serum a regular part of my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations. The ingredients actually made my face itch and also caused breakouts. I will not be buying this again.  Buyer beware of the lowest priced products.</li>
    <li> Works great and you get more for your money.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Cold cream works as well</li>
    <li> Great product! 69 yr. young male who loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> delivery was quick and I find the product leaves my skin soft and reduces wrinkles.  it is not a cure all, but it does a great job compared to a lot of other stuff out there. I would definitely recommend. also, the price is very reasonable.  I cannot say it will help everyone, but it is helping me.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. I generally have healthy skin, heals from within, until about three years ago, one month use of Clearasil Ultra facewash damaged it deeply. My skin, particularly around the nose up to the area between the eyebrows and partial of skin where eyebrows grow, down to the area surrounding my lips, suffered from extremely dry conditions that caused redness, rashes, and flakes. Looked terrible. I used traditional remedial oils, olive oil, argan oil, castor oil, tea tree oil, and they all failed. I used Eucerin, Aquaphor advanced therapy, cocoa butter, and they only helped reducing the redness, rashes and flakes. I thought I had no choice but would have to go with expensive physician visits and prescribed medicines. Thanks goodness. I came across articles about Vit C serum, and searched for it in my Amazon account. I first bought and use TrueSkin brand. The result was immediate and my face skin is gradually showing improvements within the first two weeks. Then I bought one bottle of this brand (lower price) and use them interchangeably. Those &amp;#34;f&amp;#34;ugly rashes, redness and flakes are disappearing. I guess this Vit C serum with hyaluronic acid (I hope I spelled it right) really heals and improve skin condition from within. Well ... I imagine they revitalize skin cells. Thanks to you guys and gals who produce and sell this product. It&#x27;s really affordable and works.</li>
    <li> Not thick and sticky. No odor. My face seems softer and more &amp;#34;alive,&amp;#34; even after using this a short time. I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> have not notice any effect whatsoever since I started using the vitamin C over a week ago</li>
    <li> I like that it is not greasy and it absorbs in your skin quickly. I&#x27;ve only used this product a week and don&#x27;t see any dramatic results yet. I&#x27;ll continue to use it if it will guard against aging as described.</li>
    <li> I turned 62 last Tuesday and trust me I have tried everything from botox to very expensive skin products, with questionable ingredients. Because of the great  price and great reviews on this product I figured what have I got to loose! Not only is the product unbelievably fabulous, but so is their customer service. They care about what you think, you do matter. I love that and I love the way my skin looks and feels. It is pure, simple, priced right. Keep it simple, what could be more perfect!!!!!!</li>
    <li> High quality Vitamin C product -- equal in strength to others at twice the price.  Love the larger size</li>
    <li> Fast  delivery great product,  ++++ , very recommend</li>
    <li> I have just started using this vitamin C serum as part of my daily regime and I feel I&#x27;m already noticing a difference. My skin is firmer and smoother and fine lines are less noticeable. I can&#x27;t wait to see how I&#x27;m doing a month from now.</li>
    <li> This really does work to even out my acne scars. Still a work in progress, but I&#x27;m can tell its gonna be a staple in my beauty regime forever!</li>
    <li> I use it every morning. Good stuff. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Face looks very vibrant and clear, received many compliments.</li>
    <li> Beyond the value for quantity, I appreciate the softness of my skin when I use this light serum. I&#x27;m not sure how long before I experience the results I am hoping for, but the lines across my forehead and between my eyes are less visible after about ten days. If the recently appearing skin discolorations recede, I will be ecstatic!!&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this serum to a friend who ordered it after trying some - it&#x27;s so light!&lt;br /&gt;It is also very smooth under make up, doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation [for me] and I can use it with moisturizer at night.</li>
    <li> I am 27, light-medium skin tone with an oily t-zone with dry cheeks, acne-prone skin. This has a light, watery texture, and is non-irritating. I have used this for about three months and I haven&#x27;t seen significant results in lightening acne marks, skin tone or clarity. The smell is a little off-putting, too. My husband hates the smell of it and even asked me to stop using it. I was hoping for a more effective product, but I think you get what you pay for. Maybe this will work better for another person, but it was not a winner for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months now and am fully satisfied with the result. It not only faded my acne scars, but also kept my skin hydrated and soft. I am 42 yrs old and people actually assume I am in my 20&#x27;s.  Best of all, this product is great for sensitive skin which my skin type is. In addition, my fine lines have improved.  For those who are new users, liquid comes out thin and clear, basically water consistency. It does absorb very quickly and no sticky feeling after. There is no fragrance. Followed with moisturizer, skin will feel supple and baby soft.  Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the feel of my skin. ( I still look 61, but I&#x27;m good with that) anyway, I work outside year round and manage to get scraps &amp; bruises. I have noticed they heal better than before. Only half way through my 1st bottle and yes I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started to use your Vitamin C for the face. I used Vit. C a few years ago and loved it&lt;br /&gt;But the dermatologist stopped carrying the&lt;br /&gt;Product.  Was so excited to find yours. My body&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to drink it up and at 67 years old I like&lt;br /&gt;The facial glow. Keep in touch and I let you&lt;br /&gt;Know more.😊</li>
    <li> fab for skin and fab value use it with my other products hydrolic acid and matrixal 3000 make skin soft supple help to plump up wrinkles and skin looks smoother and brighter. my skin feels smooth and soft. i apply the vitamin c first then use amazons hydrolic acid as reviewed on dr oz show as a skin care miracle, then i top it off with matrixal 3000 for added boost.the vitamin c is 20% which is the normal amount for vitamin c products. i am very pleased with this product and have ordered a total of 5 bottles and am happy that the bottles are larger in size and at a great price. just to make it clear Dr OZ recommended vitamen c and hydrolic acid but not a particular brand. i trusted amazon to make my purchases.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this brand since the other I&#x27;ve used is not available on Amazon. I have received the product less than 5 days and that surprised me. I have received this product before another one which was ordered the previous week. The serum is o.k. but comparing it to another brand I can see and feel the difference between them. I do not have the same results such as feeling the skin tighten and noticably smoother. I do use this serum twice a day, morning and evening, after washing and applying a skin softner. Sorry to say I will not be purchasing this for myself but will recommed to friends who I know will benefit.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its working yet... But it is VERY watery and thin</li>
    <li> I have now bought this product 2 times and really like it.  It makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 1/2 weeks. I use it in the pm on a clean face neck and chest. I use it in the AM before I apply my makeup. I recently had neck surgery so I use it on my scar. Today, I noticed the &amp;#34;grooves&amp;#34; in my chest from sun damage are going away. The skin on my chest is getting smooth and even. I&#x27;m very impressed. It goes on smooth and clean feeling. I&#x27;m sold on the product! Quick delivery and customer service sent me s nice email on the product and suggestions on how to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Just as good as the ones that are more expensive and give you half the amount as this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this specific one because of the size (2oz vs 1oz) but I don&#x27;t know if it does what my other one did ( Pure Body Naturals - THE BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C) this one has not removed some marks on my face like the Pure Body brand did. I am not sure if I am going to purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin c, it is light, feels wonderful, and has a budget friendly price.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to do what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have recommeded this product to several people.</li>
    <li> Is working really well in reducing wrinkles! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I see a difference and feel it!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have used this product and I can say it helped a little.... The directions on the label was extremely hard to read as well as the ingredients ...</li>
    <li> excellent! thanks for checking in to see how this worked!</li>
    <li> After 17 days I&#x27;m sorry to say I&#x27;ve seen no change or improvement. I followed the instructions &amp; have been using it AM &amp; PM. Will continue for a few more weeks hoping for some improvement. Very dissatisfied, as I was so encouraged after reading the reviews.</li>
    <li> Feels good on skin. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily. Nice fragrance. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like using this on my face, neck, tops of hands.  Have been using this for about 3 weeks, face seems softer, neck looks better.  Will continue to use.  UPDATE:  I just purchased another bottle my 3rd now. I did try several other brands and found this one to be the best.  My face responds to this vitamin C serum very well. My face stays moist. I use it in the AM under my makeup, then again after I wash my face in the PM</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin C product</li>
    <li> The size of the bottle is whar drew me to the product, but that was only the first good part of the product. The serum is amazing, delivering  great results when using  a very small amount of product. i would definitley rexcimend the product, and I will buy it again. I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s helped..</li>
    <li> unfortunately  I received it with bad smell&lt;br /&gt;I think it is expired one&lt;br /&gt;Iam saaaaad😭😭😭</li>
    <li> See m&#x27;s to be working.Only used for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> This really is a excellent serum.  Its not real running like some I have tried.  Alittle bit goes along ways.  I like the fact its 2ozs.  Will diffently buy again.</li>
    <li> I  HAVE BEEN USING THIS SERUM FOR TWO WEEKS AND I AM ALREADY SEING RESULTS. THE SKIN OF MY FACE IS SMOOTHIER AND TIGHTER AT THE SAME TIME. THE COMPANY HAS A GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY HAVE WRITTEN TO ME TWICE TO CHECK HOW I AM DOING WITH THE PRODUCT AND TO CLARIFY ANY CONCERN FROM  MY SIDE.NO DOUBTS ABOUT. I WILL BUY IT AGAIN AND STRONGLY RECONMEDED.</li>
    <li> I like it. It seems to work.</li>
    <li> I only gave 4 stars because I have just started using it. So far so good. I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions. It goes on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely purchase again</li>
    <li> Love this product! I was in the skin care&lt;br /&gt;Business all my life! The product is light and smells very light and refreshing! And is very gentle on my skin! It&lt;br /&gt;Also absorbs very quickly! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The vitamin c serum is comes in a nice bottle and goes on smoothly.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but too too happy about the applicator.  It&#x27;s a bit clumsy to work with</li>
    <li> love this stuff!~  I am old and wrinkly!  and it is softening my deep lines around my eyes and mouth!</li>
    <li> I received the Go Radiance about a week ago and had been using faithfully...but the bottle fell into my bathroom sink and shattered...what a mess.  Why isn&#x27;t it packaged in plastic?  I&#x27;d order some more but afraid it might happen again.  Can you recommend a vitamin c serum that is not packaged in glass.  So disappointed :-((. Cori</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used the product a few days - morning and night. it is a light fluid that absorbs quickly. so far so good.</li>
    <li> Best serum that I have ever used. Plan to buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum for brightening my skin tone!  I expected a citrus scent.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It is light and odorless.. goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I stopped using it after a week. The product started to break me out and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s my acne day&#x27;s are long over. Also there is something giddy in the bottom of the bottle.  What I&#x27;m thinking is it could possibly be vitamin c pills ground up in some water????? It has no smell or color just like water.</li>
    <li> The seal on the bottle was broke and 1/4 of the serum is missing</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its name. It is non-greasy and has no odor. My skin already shows improved tone and fine lines are diminishing. I have only been using this product for a few weeks so this is impressive! I like the facts that the product is all natural. I am going radiant!</li>
    <li> Seems to be OK. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1 month, so the jury is still out on long term use. No criticisms at this time.</li>
    <li> I am new to this product so I hesitate to give a review too quickly, however so far I have to say I do like what I see and will continue with this product!</li>
    <li> Great product for an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Been using this product now for a month. Don&#x27;t feel like my skin is any brighter, and I think it smells like cat food.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using this product and I am already seeing results! Definitely worth the money! I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel great!</li>
    <li> Helps so many skin issues, easy to apply no scent invisible</li>
    <li> I think I like it. I don&#x27;t see any dramatic changes in my skin, but I&#x27;m not allergic, that&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Far and away, this is the best vitamin C serum I have tried!  With only a couple of uses, I can already tell the difference in my skin tone--it is smoother, brighter and move even toned.  This is a keeper, especially since it is twice as much in the bottle for a better price than others I have tried!</li>
    <li> Great Product, feels good on face. Have not had it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results that the Serum advertised</li>
    <li> Easy to incorporate into my daily routine.  Product is not greasy, fits in  easily and absorbs into the skin.  Easy eye-dropper application.  Absorbs quickly so that I can immediately apply my mosturizer.  The price is reasonable,  too.</li>
    <li> My skin feels clean and fresh. Looks younger and lighter since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started referring this product to friends and family because I find it to be so effective. The owner makes sure you know how to use it and the advantages it has on your skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I saw deminished lines right away.  I wait a few minutes and then apply a thin layer of vit E oil at bedtime or sunscreen during day time.</li>
    <li> So I just got my package, luckily before my AM routine, so I got to try it right away. *The first thing I noticed was the generous size. This is a large bottle, as promised!  None of that vaguely ripped off feeling of seeing a tiny little bottle/jar.  And the bottle is dark glass to protect product from light, which degrades vit.C. The next thing is the fluid has an opacity that looks like IT CONTAINS INGREDIENTS!  Most products I receive lately look like clear water.  Now I know that&#x27;s not necessarily the case, but I prefer to see this opacity. So I put it on after washing my face with my Kojie San and pat it in until it&#x27;s absorbed, which is how to get the best out of your skin care products; pat in, don&#x27;t leave to evaporate into air, or rub into your fingers.  No stickiness, nice velvety skin, feels firmed, but not taunt. Can see that new clarity you look for with the vit.C products. Now, I&#x27;ve found the best serums have a visible performance you can actually see in the mirror, and this serum does. I slathered on my neck and décolletage too, feeling secure by my big bottle, LOL, and watch the magic happen.  NICE. I&#x27;m taking care of this, it&#x27;s going in the fridge. Love the feeling of getting what I paid for and more.  Something even the most expensive brands can fall short on.  And I&#x27;ve returned plenty of those.  Hell yeah, I pay $115.00 for a bottle with some initials on it-it&#x27;s flying back if it&#x27;s junk.  Snooty cosmetic counter sales people fall like the walls of my competitors in my Clash of Clans, LOL So here is a quality product, that I will buy again, and be willing to look at other products the brand might have to offer. And a price that sits well in the budget. I would recommend to anyone, and say go ahead if you&#x27;re trying to decide on this.  We only have so much income we can allot to these items, get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I would definitely buy again. The only reason I gave a 4 star is I think the scent could be improved. Not terrible, just not great.</li>
    <li> Really feel this has helped my complexion!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have now purchased this product 3 or 4 times.  Feels great on my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this product works beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is an absolution for all ages especially mine at 60. Immediately the serum starts to naturally tone your skin while the C serum actually repairs from deep in the epidermis and it feels great on my face. I constantly apply it through out the day and I have results...it may take some days and you&#x27;ll see the repair and beautiful skin with minimal pores. Really great serum that&#x27;s why I call it an absolution. 5 stars. Grazie.</li>
    <li> Love the size of the bottle, the product feels wonderful on your skin and so far seems to be helping with my dark spots, as well as, making the skin feel taut.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  I love how it removes the wrinkles under my eyes.This product works just as well as the other product that sells for 19.99 for one ounce. So of course I am very happy to buy this one for twice as much product!</li>
    <li> The dark circles under my eyes are fading!!! Love it</li>
    <li> I sm now a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Not great for me. Redness and dryness.</li>
    <li> I reaaly like this serum.  I feel like it helps with the small lines and wrinkles and keeps my skin tone even.  I have even started using it on my arms to see if it will make a difference.</li>
    <li> I always make sure to use this for a few weeks before rating. I&#x27;m 24 and use this every night before my night cream. In the am, I look amazing. I look well rested, I look bright, I look even-toned. I could get away with no makeup after about 6-7days of using this. Only downside is that the effects don&#x27;t &amp;#34;last&amp;#34;, meaning if you skip 2-3 days, your face will show wear &amp; tear again. Stay consistent and this product is worth a million bucks. I will repurchase many times over; but this bottle should last me another 2-3months.</li>
    <li> Out of all the serums that I have tried this has been the one that comes in the largest bottle at 2oz double the size of most of the ones I have tried. I received this Vitamin C serum for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. The bottle came with a glass dropper to help you apply the drops to your face. Compared to other serums I have tried this is of the medium consistency, it&#x27;s not as liquidy as water but it&#x27;s not as thick as some others either. I really do prefer the thicker ones as it helps to apply without it running away but I am getting used to using thinner ones like this one and know to carefully drop and be ready to rub in or it will drip down my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this prodcut does not cause any adverse reactions like some skin products do which is always nice to learn. I hate having to be so picky over which types of products I buy because of that. I have wasted lots of money on products that just irritate me a lot. I also found that this serum is a good base moisturizer before my regular one. I have combo skin and the area at the top of my nose between my eyebrows often gets very dry. Moisturizes by themselves often do nothing, however I have been using this serum there before using my moisturizer and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks better, healthier and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked this down one star because I haven&#x27;t notice much change in skin color or fine lines around my eyes. I have only used it a couple of weeks so maybe with more time I will see a better improvement that I do now. In the mean time I will continue to use it as I know it is working to moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> Great product excellent buy you cannot miss with this one.</li>
    <li> First, look at the cheerful packaging!!! Its like a bright sunshine! Already a winner in my book. In addition to Vitamin C, Oz Radiance added hyaluronic acid, aloe, witch hazel and jojoba oil. These ingredients help moisturize and heal the skin while reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I would say this is a more traditional thinner serum texture, so it absorbs very quickly into the skin. It has a very light, pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t dry sticky - you can&#x27;t tell that you put it on your skin aside from the fact that your skin feels more hydrated, smooth, and refreshed. I thought the formula was great. The best part about this serum is the value! This is a giant 2oz. bottle! I received this product for free/at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this serum . Shipping was quick great product</li>
    <li> I have just started trying this product for 1 week.And already I have noticed that my skin is less dry looking more soft and supple, lines have started to fade and i have alittle fading of freckles.The best thing is that my face looks brighter I am really hoping the more i use it the more it will fade the spots on my face. I love</li>
    <li> Only been using short time but seems to help wrinkles appear less noticeable.  Received product quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for two weeks on my face and backs of my hands. So far I have been very pleased with the results.  I hope to continue to see more results.</li>
    <li> Have only been using product for one week.  Feels good on skin.  Lotion absorbs into skin nice after you apply the serum.&lt;br /&gt;Great followup from seller.  Lots of info and help from seller.  Would do business with seller again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Excellent product, already ordered another</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s the best product I have ever used will be forever customer and recommending my all besties to buy n buying more soon&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for offering this product on amazon</li>
    <li> Not sure what results will be yet! I like the my skin feels</li>
    <li> Nice product, I&#x27;m still reviewing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days and have noticed better tone. I&#x27;m hoping for more improvement with time, if that happens I will update.</li>
    <li> A very good product, the lines on my face are not as noticed as they were,,only used it a month, seems to be helping the texture alot also.</li>
    <li> Really like this product so far.  Have only used it twice since I just received it.  I was sent directions and contacts (in case I have questions) via email.  That impressed me that the company cares enough to follow-up with customer!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews I couldn&#x27;t help but think that my bottle was filled with something other than what everyone else received. After every application my face feels as dry as paper. I was hoping for at least a little moisture. This did not happen. My face feels dryer when I apply it than if I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I love the C serum. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Never thought I will write this review but miracle happen! I bought serum couple weeks ago for dark spots on my face. Well, i cant see big difference in my dark spots yet so far but for 3 years i had kind of warts under my eyes, and after 2 weeks use this serum it is gone. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but it is gone!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It arrived on time. I have been using it for several days now and I can feel my skin tightening.</li>
    <li> Dont forget to wait a few minutes before apply your moisturizer.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the Lavender Silver Hydrosol Spray here.  Amazing. http://www.amazon.com/Lavender-Silver-Hydrosol-Spray-FREE/dp/B00MGTDLZY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1430317728&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;Lavender+silver+Hydrosol</li>
    <li> Great product, awesome customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve repeated this purchase because I do like it and it does work. I use it for the sun marks on my face. Do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really love this product, and truly see the difference in my skin, great size bottle too, will most definitely continue to buy this serum only from this seller as I know I&#x27;m getting a quality product that actually works! Thankyou :)&lt;br /&gt;update. have purchased yet another bottle of this wonderful serum, I keep sticking with this one due to its quality and effectiveness, well worth it, and the bottle lasts even with two of us using it!</li>
    <li> I was prescribed this product and now I depend on it daily to give me a good feeling about my skin as it tends to glow a bit more every time I put it on my face. I will continue using the vitamin c serum always, its also easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have added this to my night time regime. I am 49. After telling a coworker I&#x27;ve been cooking since I was 20, his response was &amp;#34;so you&#x27;ve been cooking for about 15 years?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I can see a difference!  My laugh lines have become less noticeable!!</li>
    <li> Very thin an watery not sure if is working</li>
    <li> My review is based off my own personal purchase,probably one of the best deals when it comes to Vitamin C serums, 2ml worth of organic, high quality anti aging serum, I&#x27;m a 24 year old male with fine lines and discoloration and i can definently say this has made a huge difference in my skin, it looks so much brighter and my lines have to what it seems diminished, I believe long term use could truly erase lines, will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and if you want a combination product that also contains hyaluronic acid, this can&#x27;t be beat for the size and the price. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is the product packaging. Without reading the product description or ingredients, it&#x27;s hard to tell that this serum contains both vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. If you just want vitamin C, this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C is proven to minimize facial wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid, on the other hand, only gives the appearance of minimizing fine lines because it temporarily fills the lines. The effectiveness is cosmetic and not permanent. Additionally, if you live in a dry climate, hyaluronic acid will actually pull moisture from your face. Vitamin C serum should be used twice a day for maximum effectiveness. For me, there is no reason to use a combination product at night. Especially one that will dry my skin out more since I live in a desert area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this product is great for some people. I&#x27;m just not one of them. I prefer a product that is Vitamin C serum only.</li>
    <li> Love this product......wrinkles gone!!!!!.....nothing compares to the results from this product.....silky smooth tighter skin.....EXCELLENT PRODUCT.....THANK YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> My face and neck are already looking better.  I did n not tell anyone that I was using anything new on my face. But after almost two weeks, my family thought I was using makeup while at home.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Love it my skin is firming and feeling silky thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C serums before with good results but this one is nothing short of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was noticeably improved after a single usage.</li>
    <li> My first bottle of this was great.  The second bottle I received had a very bad odor and was very cloudy and I am afraid to use it. I actually ordered the second bottle way before the first bottle was even used up because I liked it so much and didn&#x27;t want to run  out!!! I have emailed the owner/supplier three times without a response.  Very poor customer service, I wad disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using this for almost 2 weeks now and am I already seeing results. My skin has become more firm and I&#x60;ve noticed some on my brown spots from sun damage are starting to fad. I apply this first in my routine , it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I would high recommend adding this to your beauty regiment .</li>
    <li> I dearly love this stuff! I do not want to be without it! Believe me, I am ensuring that I won&#x27;t be. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you need to love yourself enough to give it a try. I&#x27;m getting compliments about how I am looking so healthy and so much better. This year has been the hardest year of my life, so for people that know me well, this is saying a lot. As for people I don&#x27;t know that have passed me a compliment, it&#x27;s nice to hear. One man that I do know, we were talking age and he seriously said two different ages. He said, &amp;#34;Ginny, what are you ## or ##?&amp;#34; (Sorry, I&#x27;m not telling the ages or mine). I did answer, &amp;#34;Me, no I&#x27;m ##&amp;#34;. He literally guessed me, believing I was nine to ten years younger. He looked surprised when I spoke the truth. I think he thought if he was off, he wouldn&#x27;t be more than a year or so different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought more, this is so good. Have I said I love this?  Good stuff :)</li>
    <li> I have used vitamic C serum in the past and i have seen the change in my skin tone after 3-4 days. I can not see that change after using this product. I feel that this is fake vitaminc C. I can not see any kind of brightness one gets after using vitamic C serum. Also real Vitamic C gives a little burning sensation. But, I do not feel it. From the appearance, I find this serum is just water. I am not sure why other users have given this product such a high rating. I totally disagree with what other have said here.</li>
    <li> Not very thick, but rubs in good.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever.  Have been using it on age spots on my hands and they have gotten so much lighter. Some of them are almost gone.  I originally purchased it for use around my eyes but started putting it on a dark brown spot on my hand. Had no idea it would make it go away.  This is also good for wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD SERUM FOR AROUND EYES AND FOR USING ON PRONOUNCED LINES ON YOUR FACE. RESULTS START TO APPEAR IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS. NO MORE PUFFINESS OR DARK CIRCLES AND THE LINES HAVE REDUCED IN APPEARANCE.  VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS AND WILL CONTINUE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter. She was impressed. She noticed the difference in her skin appearance in just a week.I bought 5 more bottles for myself and my sister.</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with another product for the benefit of free shipping. I didn&#x27;t know trying to weasel out of free shipping with leave me with baby skin! Using this with rosewater from Poppy Austin, I began noticing improvements within two weeks after using it. I have eczema around the corners of my mouth and my skin can be dull. However, adding this serum has improved the evenness of my skin and has softened my eczema. I notice that even not washing my face after a day (please forgive me, finals week will do this to you) my skin remains dewy....I&#x27;ve never had dewy skin but this product has me hooked. It is not a harsh product and I only use a couple of drops.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen major results, but being vitamin C how can that be a bad thing. Anything with vitamin C, B, A in cosmetics is a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin c serum that I have ever used.  My skin is so smooth and silky. It does not leave a sticky feeling on your skin and when you put on your moisturizer it does not flake or cake up as some other product do.  What is most wonderful about this product is that you get twice as much product for the same amount or less money.  I use it in the morning after cleansing my face and after I use my toner.  I put on my vitamin c serum wait a few minutes and then I put on  Rodial Bee Venom moisturizer wait a few minutes and then I put on my obagi sufader sun screen.  What a combination.  It is unbelievable. I definitely recommend this vitamin C for anybody who want to reduce lines and wrinkles and just overall have a beautiful glow to their skin.  If I could give this product 10 stars I would.</li>
    <li> Super product at a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I use it daily and have seen a definable difference in my 43 year old crows feet and smile lines! I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have not been using it daily but already skin looks better.  First thing i have found that is working on dark spots!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the serum for a little over a week but within 2 days I could feel a difference in the texture of my skin. It is smoother and more vibrant, like sunshine for your skin, but healthy!</li>
    <li> Product is great.  The size for the money is amazing.  I only just started using it but can feel the difference.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have used many different brands of Vit C but this one is by far the best. I will be sure to always buy&lt;br /&gt;this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> twice the amount, for less that the original&#x27;s cost. my wife says no difference. I can work with that.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and was packed very well. The price was lower than other like products.  Now I will start using the product and see the results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I tried it for a week and the whitening effect is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the vit c serum for 2 weeks, so far no noticeable results.  I like the way it feels on my face- not greasy at all and dries without tightening.  Smells really nice too</li>
    <li> It is great but I wish it had a little bit more oily feel to it.</li>
    <li> love what it does for my skin</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 2 weeks.  it most definately tightens. I feel it go to work  immediately.  I love the price.  I am looking forward reviewing after using the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> I decided to stop wasting my hard earned money on a beauty products that just don&#x27;t work. I started to use Sano Naturals because the price was right and all the fancy beauty products contain these essential ingredients. Well my skin sucks this up and looks dewy and healthy and I have noticed that the texture is firmer and more supple. I have been told that I have &amp;#34;baby skin &amp;#34; by some woman , who are as old as my children! This is really worth a try, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> My second order same product ! That says it ! Jennifer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and can already see improvement in my skin.  The dark spots on the left side of my face (from the sun coming through the car window when driving) fading as well as the freckles.  The wrinkles/sagging along my jaw are gradually firming and are not as deep.  I am very pleased with this product.  I am now applying it to my sun damaged chest area and the tops of my hands.  I follow up with pure almond oil to moisturize.  I was skeptical at first about trying this product, but now I will continue buying as long as they provide it!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery! I&#x27;ve used it for the past 3 days and it does tighten up my face. I received an email from the founder of the company just before the product was delivered, thanking me for the purchase, giving some further instruction on use, and saying that she&#x27;d be contacting me after a bit to see how I liked the serum. Over all very favorable impression! Day 4 and still loving it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price!  It really seems to brighten my complexion.</li>
    <li> So far, so good for this serum.  Although I&#x27;ve been using it less than a month, I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my skin.  I also use it everyday on my hands, because for me, my hands have always looked older than my face and true age, and so far I&#x27;ve seen improvement--the skin looks less dry and wrinkled.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it faithfully, and will review it again after 6 months, but even if my skin doesn&#x27;t get better by then--the improvement is already noticeable enough to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this product I will order it again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Although I have only been using for less than a week,  my buying experience was very positive and my skin Skin FEELS great when applied with my moisturizer. Time will tell about the overall improvement but so far very pleased.</li>
    <li> No point in spending more for Vitimin C Serum. Go Radiance has an excllent, quality product for an attractive price. I use it daily with excellent results.</li>
    <li> I have always like vitamin C I used it once before from a different company but I do like this one better, I have been using it for a about a week but really love the product and will contimue using it and when the time comes wil reorder.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a short time but so far it leaves my skin feeling very soft.  I have had no irritations with this product and that is good as I do have sensitivity to some products.    To add to this, I was very impressed when I received a personal email from the company explaining how to use the product and all the benefits that this particular serum has.  I have purchased other things on line but have never received an email and was very appreciative when the instructions were sent to me.  The size is double other serums that I have purchased before and feel that I really am getting my moneys worth.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the help and feed back on how to use the product is so helpful</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly with a follow up about how to use the product</li>
    <li> After using many Vit C serums over many years, I have settled on Go Radiance Vit C 20% serum.  There are no unnecessary ingredients and it seems to be as pure as you can get.  The extremely reasonable price is another plus!</li>
    <li> I had to wait awhile and use this product for weeks so that I could leave a honest review. I am 44 and started to notice my skin was starting to look different under my eyes like two fine lines under each.  I cleanse my face, apply the vitamin c and instantly my skin tightens really good under my eyes.  I like this vitamin c serum.  The serum is not thick so I just take the dropper and put in the palm of my hand and apply it over my face that way. After applying the Vitamin c serum I wait let it soak in and then apply Vitamin e under my eyes the two together is my blessing.  I will re-order.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is the BEST I&#x27;ve found! It is odorless and very easy to put on. Also, It dries immediately. I use 8-10 drops for my face and neck. The bottle is double the usual 1 oz. size, making it very economical to use. This is my favorite C serum of the many I have tried, and I have just ordered another bottle! It arrived from Amazon in only 2 days! Thanks, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second bottle of Best Vitamin C Serum arrived SO FAST and well wrapped! I love this serum - it&#x27;s so silky when applied and it sinks into my skin immediately. Already, I notice that my dark spots are less so. This is a great seller and a wonderful product - I&#x27;ll continue to buy more of this superb serum. I am recommending this Vitamin C Serum to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Great price.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a Vitamin C serum to try and although ( as I write this today) I only just started using it, I feel it compliments the daily facial regime.  I will come back to update after I have had a few months to use and see the results.  But my initial thoughts are that it absorbs quickly, and with the hyaluronic it should compliment the Vitamin C and jojoba oil.  This feels like it absorbs quicker than the OZ Vitaminc C serum but I need more time to try both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are experimenting or simply looking for a Vitamin C / hyaluronic serum...I think this is worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I like that the seller sent me an email on how to use the product effectively. I am using it every day and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, but I don&#x27;t think it has been long enough to rate it fairly. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Radiance Vitamin C Serum it&#x27;s an excellent product, I have used for 6 months and I can clearly see an inprovent on the look and feel of my face. I do recommended.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to write a review when I have just started using the product, repeated emails do not make the days go faster, in order to write a review I need to use the product for the recommended amount of time.</li>
    <li> I use it in the morning and my skin has been feeling a bit tighter and healthier.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery  Light and absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Able to apply moisturizer soon after&lt;br /&gt;Great for before and after sun exposure&lt;br /&gt;Starting my fair skin teen early on healthy skin habits</li>
    <li> Love product. I use it with the Sano Hyaluronic Acid Serum+. I&#x27;m 61 and love this product for what it does.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this daily and says her skin feels softer and that her dry normally dry skin feels more moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Not greasy at all. Bigger bottle is great. Leaves a nice glow to your skin.</li>
    <li> Very good, it working good on me. And it clearing the dark spots on me!</li>
    <li> Dropper dispenses just the right amount of serum, seems to be working, but.time will tell how effective.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel great however, after a few days use it broke my skin out.</li>
    <li> Suprised at how I instantly fell in love with this product.  I&#x27;ve actually stopped using all the other serums I  thought I couldn&#x27;t  live without.  Now this is the only beauty product I can&#x27;t live without!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. Finally I found something for my wrinkles that works.  Thanks for this miracle. I just started using it &amp; my face feels smooth &amp; gorgeous. I recommend it  to my friends</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  My face has never looked younger.</li>
    <li> This was the best agent in the anti wrinkle fight, maybe because it had some hyaluronic acid mixed in its formula.  I did see a difference in my skin, but I was not diligent enough to get the dramatic results I saw on others.</li>
    <li> thanks for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use this product for a reasonable length of time to make a fair review. So far, after 10 days, I have not noticed much of a difference. I am hopeful that this product will come close to what it is claimed to do. I am giving myself a month of daily use to be able to give an honest assessment.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my wife love it</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I love it absolutely fabulous !!!</li>
    <li> love the serum and how it feels on my face, this is a remarkable product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Also helps with thin skin from sun damage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a tight student budget so quality and quantity are really important to me. I&#x27;m really impressed that Oz Radiance creates a high quality Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum that costs the same as other brands but offers 2x as much product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum performs remarkably well! With twice daily use my skin tone appeared more even, healthier, and happily moisturized. It feels great when applied, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Plus, the scent of the high concentration of vitamin C is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this Vitamin C serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It seems to be a good product and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and it absorbs well into the skin - my skin is looking good - I love the fact that my adult acne (not terrible just here and there) is gone and my skin looks moist and supple - this is a great product for any skin - I recommend this serum for all age types -</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 months twice daily. My skin feels and looks tighter. I&#x27;ve been using it combined with a weekly micro needling treatment as well as using twice a day after cleansing. I can feel it being absorbed much better than other serums I&#x27;ve tried. Has no odor or greasy feel to it. My skin looks healthier!</li>
    <li> This serum arrived quickly and was well packaged for security.  There is no off-aroma, just a pleasant, neutral aroma.  The consistency is not thick, but it is just right for smoothing over my skin.  I have only used it 3 times so far so I do not know if it will really do what is advertised, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel so smooth.  I really like the fact that it is all natural.  I am even putting some of it on my forearms since I have so much sun damage there.</li>
    <li> OZ Vitamin C Serum.... after two weeks, oh my!!! All my wrinkles around my face and chin are gone! Even the deep crevice between my eyes is almost gone. All the dark spots on my face are  gone! This is awesome,&lt;br /&gt;I do pray that the price stays the same so I may remain wrinkle free at 68 years young, lol.</li>
    <li> This is so watery it is difficult to use.  The dropper allows you to put it on your face but it starts running off immediately.  If I hadn&#x27;t opened and tried to use it, I would return for a refund.</li>
    <li> It feels good into my skin . I see a big changes in just a few days after using it. I have to apply a bit of moisturizer after applying it because it dries my skin . But overall, I am beginning to see a big changes in my skin which is the youthful look and elastic skin. Thank you so much whoever introduce this product .</li>
    <li> I have only been using the OZ Naturals vitamin C serum for roughly a week but I absolutely notice a difference in my skin. It feels plumper, smoother and well hydrated. I bought this along with the OZ Naturals eye serum amd so far I am extremely pleased with both products. I am used to spending exorbitant amounts of money on department store skin care and this honestly has given me the best bang for my buck! I just turned 40 and although skin care has always been a priority, it has definitely been important to me as I&#x27;m getting older. At this price, you really have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I just ordered my second bottle yesterday.  Just follow the simple directions and you WILL see results like I have.  Thank you Jennifer Davis for this miracle product and PLEASE don&#x27;t ever discontinue this item.</li>
    <li> It always works! Makes my skin feels toned and smooth. My only comlain is, it&#x27;s hard to read the labels on the bottle. I even use a magnifying glass and still not able to read any of the words on the label.</li>
    <li> Have never used a serum before but I figured why not. I&#x27;m a 63 yo man having spent a lot of Yates in the sun. Want to see if using this could help lessen the wrinkles. Will try it in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good results so far. Been using for about 2 weeks. It&#x27;s been easy to incorporate I to my daily beauty regime. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I can say that my skin seems brighter and some and some acne marks have faded. I will continue to use this serum.</li>
    <li> My skin really became softer. I&#x27;m using the product only once a day at night and I sometimes forget but the skin is still nice :-) I&#x27;m using it together with phytoceramides and It really made a big difference in my skin. I love it and the size is great too! Twice as big for better price? Wow! I couldn&#x27;t resist!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results so far. I tried the serum on my &amp;#34;old lady hands&amp;#34; and it is apparent that my hands actually look younger. I haven&#x27;t noticed as much a difference on my face but, it definitely tightens up my entire face kind of like a mini face lift. I have only used this product for 1 week so I believe the best is yet to come. The quantity of serum in the bottle is amazing!</li>
    <li> This product spreads beautifully, soaks in quickly, and within 2 days I was seeing results! My skin is smooth, soft, much more radiant, and it looks more even toned (THIS after 1 week of use!!). I will be purchasing again! Super affordable and phenomenal results!</li>
    <li> I could not possibly do without this on a daily basis. Cold and indoor heat have met their match</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price, and fast shipping; everything you want from a product and seller.</li>
    <li> The lady here absolutely loves the product.  She reports and so do I great results.  We will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I received this product, and it&#x27;s awesome! I&#x27;m definitely seeing a difference. I&#x27;m sure going to continue using it. It&#x27;s great value for money.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using about a week and can feel the difference. My skin looks radiant and feels so soft. Do not miss trying this product. You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> Nice product...great price! Skin feels soft and looks refreshed a fter using &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> wow what a difference I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately two weeks now my face feels fabulous like a silky feeling and my boyfriend loves it</li>
    <li> I been using this in 1 week i fell my face less dry and it made my face look more healthy and fresh</li>
    <li> My wife says she does not see any real difference in her face as far as wrinkles go and she has used it every morning along with a Retinol Cream at night.  I can&#x27;t see any change, that&#x27;s for sure!  However, she does think her skin feels somewhat softer.  She will finish out the month with both products and then perhaps I will be updating this as she really hasn&#x27;t been using both products for very long.</li>
    <li> It came fast, good quality!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thin for my preference</li>
    <li> Have just begun using this product, but it is certainly as good if not better than some of the more expensive brands I have used this far.  A most impressive serum!</li>
    <li> Great product to use in my own homemade anti-aging creams. It really adds a glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> I can really tell a difference in my face. It&#x27;s easy to use, and I use it everyday followed by my regular moisturizer...even when I choose not to wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum for face is excellent I am very happy to found this product that made my face look radiants and glow. I well keep continue using them forever! I well order them again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I love that this comes in a larger jar. This is twice as much product than the other vitamin C serums I have used. It really makes a difference in your skin as well. It improved tone, texture and elasticity. As well as putting an end to breakouts. I did receive this free for review, but these are my honest opinions and i maintain it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to apply and I use it all the time-usually morning and night. Also helps as a natural sunscreen. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum in January and waited to post a review.  I was skeptical, everyone claims their product is the best...but many leave much to be desired.  I actually do like this serum, I have noticed an overall brightening and evening out of my skin.  I have also notice some lightening of dark spots.  It seems to be plumping my skin up - which is a good thing,  I think I will purchase this again when I run out, I may even try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> although I have only used 5 times now I can see and feel smother skin. I like how light it feels when I put on my face. I will continue to use and will update results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out with closed comedones all along my lips and forehead. I went to the dermatologist and was prescribed tretinoin cream 0.025% and that has helped so much. I do not recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product.  It does what it says.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly amazed by this product for the price. I originally bought it to try vitamin c on my face as I was hearing such great things about it. But to have my skin feeling supple, smooth and looks healthier in general. I&#x27;m loving it and have already recommended it to my friends as they&#x27;ve noticed a difference. Thanks for an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have only been using it a few days and I can already see the difference.</li>
    <li> Got this product for the first time. It goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin nicely. I love that I was contacted by the founder with hints on how to apply this serum. I will have more to say at a later time.  I have now made a second purchase of the Vitamin C serum within a month.  This one is for my daughter. I am so pleased with this purchase, because after a couple of weeks I see improvement. The lines around my mouth have softened and my mature skin is looking smoother. (I am 83) This is a great product and look forward to seeing more improvement with time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I see a difference in my face and neck, especially under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product so far. Just about everything I apply on my face clogs my pores, but this serum doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s too soon to tell any real difference, but the serum brightens and softens my skin. After washing my face, I tone with witch hazel, then apply the vitamin c serum. The serum is not thick, which I like. I hate products that are loaded with ingredients that I don&#x27;t know. With this serum, I know what I&#x27;m putting on my face and it feels good applying. I chose this brand over the others because it does not contain vitamin E, which causes me to break out, and because of the value. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum</li>
    <li> Best vitamin C serum works! My skin is clearer and more even toned after 2 weeks. Quality, quantity, and price is well worth it. Plus I&#x27;m getting less breakouts.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally to help reduce wrinkles.  I am 63 years old.  I am pleased with what it has done, especially around the eyes, where I had lines and loose skin.  I was surprised that it also helped reduce age spots and melasma that I have had for years.  Many have noticed the change in my skin and have asked what I am doing.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really feel and see a difference.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Just started  using it, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Had serum for a week or so. I use it morning and night. My wrinkles and skin tone is improving somewhat for such A short time of use. I am pleased so for with this serum. The serum doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feeling to liquid. It&#x27;s quite smooth putting on my face, neck, chest. When drying there is a few seconds of a slight clammy feeling, but not a bad feeling.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin so soft and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT I HAVE NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN IN JUST THE FIRST WEEK MY SKIN IS SMOOTHER AND HAS A GLOW I HAVE TRIED VERY EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET AND THEY DIDN&#x27;T WORK LIKE THIS SERUM HAS I WILL CONTINUE BUYING THIS SERUM IT WORKS TRY IT YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the product and the pricing, in particular.  Follow-up customer service has indeed been a pleasant surprise.  I will continue to use and purchase this product, as my skin is responding well thus far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month day and night but have not noticed any change to my skin&#x27;s appearance . The dropper makes application difficult. A pump would be better.</li>
    <li> I am an Asian, adult male in his early 30&#x27;s. For this reason, I try to find products that will help my skin look healthy without resorting to make-up. I have a bad history with acne, acne scarring and discolored skin cause by prior acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product and one of those spin brushes for the face. After the first week of using this product my acne breakouts were less severe and I haven&#x27;t really had one for the past several weeks. The most noticeable improvement are the discolored spots on my face. I had one in particular that I was monitoring closely. Fortunately after two weeks it &#x27;came off&#x27; when I was using the spin brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Vitamin C oil helped out a lot. I have tried Hydrochloric acid (I think this is the correct spelling) and Vitamin E oil before, but had very little to no result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have wrinkles, acne, acne scars or brown spots I recommend four products/steps. First, wash your face with any facial cleanser with benzoyl peroxide. Second, while the facial cleanser is still on your face, use the spin brush. Third, use a micro needle on your face. Fourth, put Vitamin C on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is naturally oily, so I haven&#x27;t had the need to use moisturizers and I have been using this product for at least two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant about purchasing this product, search on YouTube and see what Dr. Oz says about Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;ve been using this product for less than a month; but have already noticed the lines on my face softening. It is a noticeable difference and I am thrilled. My skin is softer and I have had no negative reaction to the serum. I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
    <li> It really smells like a campfire. Understand from company that it&#x27;s because there is no fragrance added. I will be updating this after using for several weeks</li>
    <li> I cant tell the difference between this and the super expensive brand. I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences yet but I have only been using for a short time. I hope to see something so I can reply with a great review.</li>
    <li> Can you make a bigger bottle .8 or 16 fl oz.bottle not no increase too much prices.&lt;br /&gt;I love your vitamin c. My face skin texture smoother.</li>
    <li> I actually see a big difference on my expression lines! I love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, amazing price. Why pay more? I will buy again and have told my family &amp; friends!</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  I have beautifully glowing soft skin.!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. My skin looks better each day since I started a new regiment that includes this serum. I&#x27;m also pleased with the amount of serum, which should last awhile. No doubt, I&#x27;ll order this again should the price remain so reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about 10 days and can already see a difference.</li>
    <li> I think this is pretty good.  Hard to tell whether it&#x27;s really doing much - but I know vitamin C is good - I use other C products as well so this is just an addition for night time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product for up to 1.5 months and still dont know if it&#x27;s working or not !!! I&#x27;ll keep using it hoping to see better results in the future</li>
    <li> My wife is impressed with it.  It works nicely.  Will not smear or drip (as described with other reviewers)…if you dose-it correctly on the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; More is not always better &amp;#34; Will re-order soon.  Excellent pricing.</li>
    <li> Just started this product 5 days ago...did not expect the results that happened...almost over night...my frown lines and lines between my eyebrows have drastically diminished and my face feels so smooth...can this be real...my DIL noticed my skin looked different after one night&#x27;s usage...it is worth the effort and I am pleased..</li>
    <li> Will not be without it!  It truly does make a difference in skin tone and softness.  i&#x27;ve reordered for a friend and she&#x27;s also a believer - she&#x27;s tried other Vit C serums and not seen any change.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s triple purified, not 3 bottles.. It&#x27;s a kind of confusing to me.</li>
    <li> after a month I see no change</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s  only  &#x27;so much&#x27;  anything  can  do  at  my  age  but  I  don&#x27;t  feel old -  and  I think  it  really  is  aiding  in  fading  away  age spots - I  am  65 yrs. and  lived most of  my  life  in  Ca. sun tanning - so anything  that  can  help  is  amazing  to  me :-)</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed so far in the product. But since I have not been using it very long, I am continuing its use and hope it work for me favorably. In the next couple of weeks, I hope to see improvement in these wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have a friend who sells facial products and she is constantly telling me how good I am looking and my fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product every day for only 10 days so far.  I do feel a little tightening of the skin after applying it in the morning, but that&#x27;s the only thing I can say so far.  I put a hyaluronic acid moisturizer on top of it that has a sunscreen in it.  I will keep using it and look forward to seeing better results in a few months.  I like the value for the money; you get quite a lot in that bottle and it glides on very smoothly.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> when I do a thorough scrub on my face this stings a little bit but I think I see a difference. I do use it with a serum and moisturizer so what really is making the difference?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product a week or so and already see results.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does. It actually helps minimize skin problems from free radicals. It also reduces the fine lines in one&#x27;s face and it also reduces the brown spots on a person&#x27;s skin due to sun exposure. It is a very good product. Jfr</li>
    <li> I haveba very sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t buy expensive products to try and just waste money if my skin reacts to the product.  When I saw the sale price of Vitamin C serum.  My skin tolerated it and after a week I can feel the softness of my skin.  Vitamin C serum is now part of my daily facial routine.  I am super satisfied and very happy of the results.  I cannot thank you enough!!!</li>
    <li> When I use this regularly (a few days in a row without forgetting), my skin seems brighter and more youthful. I imagine it&#x27;ll only get better with long-term consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use acne products like I do (benzoyl peroxide specifically), then don&#x27;t mix them. I&#x27;ve been using this at night only and BP during the day. I read that the effectiveness of both is reduced when mixed.</li>
    <li> There are so many different types and brands of vitamin c serums out on the market. Some claim to work but don&#x27;t. Now the one from oz radiance is one of the better ones.  I really enjoy the smelll of it, its light scented. It is a lightweight serum and goes on really smooth. I like the fact that it is natural with no added ingredients that could harm your skin.  I use this vitamin c serum for alot of things. It helped lighten up my acne and even out my skin tone. And I even put a few drops into my bodywash when I get a shower and I also put some into my conditioner. It softens my hair and makes my skin soft and glowing.  I have sensitive skin and I experienced no side effects.</li>
    <li> was very excited to receive product after readind description and high review rating, not to mention the amazing price of product.  I like the quality dropper bottle is incased in.  However, the consistancy of product was surprising to me in that it was as just about as liquid as water unlike most other serum products I have used over the years.  After seeing the product run down my face when putting drops on I am not as excited to believe it will help give me some results I would hope for but I will continue to use it morning and night to see if results will come from it.</li>
    <li> I have just  a few days using this product, but my skin looks brighter and smooth. The amount is excelent for the price. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have damaged facial skin as a result of a lifetime spent in an outdoor career. Of the many serum C products I have tried, this one is by far the best. The light lotion base spreads smoothly and is quickly and evenly absorbed by the skin. The effects it has in improving the condition of my skin is readily noticeable. I highly recommend this product for anyone interested in healthier skin.</li>
    <li> Im still waiting for results, but the treatment is good..</li>
    <li> This is my second review since starting this product: I love it. I am 66 years old and was a sun worshipper in my youth causing several sun damage spots on my cheeks and above an eyebrow. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about three weeks, twice a day, and not only do I see a smoother texture to my skin.... the dark is starting to go away.  I known from research the ingredients are powerful. Over the years I have formulated my own skin care products using several of the ingredients. I am now taking care of my aging parents and have little time for R&amp;D much less for producing a quality product. Turning to this Vitamin C Serum has given me one less thing to fret about because I can see it works and is so easy to apply, feels good too. Thank you Go Radiance for &amp;#34;your&amp;#34; time and effort in formulating this so I don&#x27;t have to, nor do I have to worry if I am wasting my time or money, I&#x27;m certainly happy.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s dark pigments</li>
    <li> This is the most light weight little power house serum I have ever used - and I&#x27;ve tried plenty. Please don&#x27;t change a thing about this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now, and can see a difference in my skin tone.  I&#x27;m also using it on some rough skin spots on my back, and I think it is making them fade!  I was impressed with the emails details how this oil should be used, and plan to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product!!! But it did take a long time to ship. But everything else is great you should totally buy this!</li>
    <li> Love it so far.  Have not used long enough to see full result.  Feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  A little runnier than others but you just don&#x27;t have to put as much on.  It is great under my makeup and gives my face a plumped up look.  I also use it at night and my face looks moisturized in the morning.  So glad I found this product!!</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all.  The consistency is way too watery and it takes forever to dry.  By the middle of the day my skin was so oily I had to wash my face and reapply my makeup at work.  I thought I would love this product but am completely unsatisfied.  A complete let down.</li>
    <li> Superb seller and product!</li>
    <li> My Mom love this product! Using it daily-adds glow to my skin, excellent anti-aging serum. Just ordered more for my Mom and will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used the product once a day in the morning for over a week now. I apply a thin layer, allow it to dry, then apply my moisturizers and find that my skin looks healthier, my forehead wrinkles have lessened a bit and that some spots have blended better.My face has an overlal look of better health!  I will continue using the product and feel very good about the purchase and the help that is offered so that it works. The delivery was very prompt. I will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 and have been using Vitamin C Serum for about 3 weeks.,I noticed a difference the first day!!  my skin has continually improved in texture, smoothness and tightness. I just started getting the little &amp;#34;lax lines&amp;#34; on my lower face above my jaw line, they are smoothing out.  I use Retin-A at night so was a little nervous t use this product fearing a reaction but none.  I am sold for life.  I just bought more for friend and daughter to try.  I have used many products high end to drug store and this by far is the best I have ever tried.  I have been on a 3 week Efudex treatment on my chest but look forward to using this product there to reduce aging and over exposure of many years living in So. California.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the product a  lot!</li>
    <li> Really like it so far.  I put it all over my face neck and arms and when it drys it has tightened my skin.</li>
    <li> OZ Radiance Vitamin C Serum is such a great product that I continue to reorder it. The harsh winter weather has taken its toll on my face, and OZ Radiance always restores it to a soft, glowing condition. The product has diminished my fine wrinkles and pigment discoloration. The serum arrived on time, and I was extremely pleased with the customer service I received via email. Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reordered OZ Radiance Vitamin C Serum and continue to discover what a wonderful product it is! Recently, I underwent major surgery. The lengthy hospital stay and the antibiotics caused major dryness to my face. Once I returned home and resumed my use of Oz Radiance, my entire face returned to a soft and supple condition, and the fine lines and pigment discoloration lessened. The product  is outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I have ordered OZ Radiance Vitamin C Serum! I continue to be extremely pleased with the product and love the look of my skin! Definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I washed my face sometimes more than usual so that I can just put it on.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am not good at skin regimens, but this product is so easy and quick to use that I have no problem applying to my skin at night before bedtime and in the morning before I apply my makeup.I have only been using this serum for a few weeks, but my skin does seem more nourished. The flakiness is gone and my makeup goes on much more evenly. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have tried much more expensive vitamin C serums and this one is as good or better. It feels good and I apply it before any other products to give my skin the nourishment it needs.  And it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C oil is one of the best products used for the face. This price for the quality and quantity of the product cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Skin looks and feels amazing !!! Highly recommend! Will reorder!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve had better results from this then the expensive lotions and potions I&#x27;ve bought in the past. I have seen a big difference in my skin in the couple of weeks since I received it. I would buy it again. Wonderful and can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing vitamin c serum. I have tried many and this is by far the best quality and quantity. Be patient it takes time to see true results.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used enough to tell a big difference yet</li>
    <li> Bought this for the second time but not impressed this time around. The solution looks different which might affect the product performance.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel more hydrated and soft. I put it on AM &amp; PM. I use it with Hyaluronic Acid, patting the mixture onto damp skin. Regular moisturizer afterward, if needed.. The Vitamin C seems to help keep the moisture in my skin, so I use less moisturizer.nMy skin really does seem to be a bit brighter.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I could tell a difference in my skin within a few days! I&#x27;m 56 and haven&#x27;t always taken the best care of my skin but I can see a big change with this product, I will definitely keep using it:)</li>
    <li> I am 67 and have used another brand of this sort of serum with excellent results. Trying this ine was more of a test since it costs so much less, and being newly retired, I live on a strict budget.  After about 3 weeks of using this product, i am thrilled to report that it works at least as well as the more expensive version. This is a truly great product. I bought a bottle for my 44-year old daughter who has extensive sun damage to her facial skin, and she is very excited as well (although she often has a hard time admitting something I found/recommended is good, - she&#x27;s totally with me on this one).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My skin improved in just a couple weeks. I couldn&#x27;t imagine not having it in my routine, not to mention the value. Great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!  my hawaiian summer freckles are not taking over my entire face and my skinnis so smooth!  LOVE</li>
    <li> Love the Vitamin C serum. My skin feels great after using it. It&#x27;s not heavy, the serum makes your skin shine in the best way possible. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product!  I get blemishes from time to time but they are quickly taken care of with Go Radiance Vitamin C serum. I will be using Go Radiance for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I liked it but its too early to see the results (1 week).</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 10 days &amp; think I see a difference in my face. It may be to soon to really know, but I love how easy it is to use.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, my skin feels soft and healthy. Great value product.</li>
    <li> Seems like it does something positive in combination with retinol. I think over time it may do the trick to minimize wrinkles and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and People began noticing how great my skin looked, soon after using it!!</li>
    <li> Love!! My face was so dry, not anymore! I have been using this for a little over a week and my face looks and feels better.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but even after the first use my face felt and looked tighter!!</li>
    <li> s far i love the product.  I use it everyday.  I would like to know what else I can use along with it for more anti aging/ wrinkle improvement products that your company would suggest!  Thanks for ur customer service and  affordable prices!!</li>
    <li> I use vitamin C serum regularly and this product is fantastic.  I really appreciate the value size of this product that makes it a great buy!  I plan on ordering again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I spend a lot of money on products like this and this one I would definitely buy it again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Loving this product!!!  My skin is more radiant after just a few applications! I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price and the customer service is fantastic. Thank you Go Radiance LLC!</li>
    <li> I use this with an infrared wand to treat hair loss due to stress and a previous illness. My hair loss was a two inch strip from my forehead to the crown and it is right down the middle. The hair loss started in January and it continued for months until there was almost no hair in this area. Doctors I consulted told me it was probably low thyroid but tests results were normal. Now using this and the infrared light (also available on Amazon) there is substantial new hair growth in the last 3 weeks.  Information is available online that suggests using Infrared light therapy for hair loss.  The vitamin C helps nourish the scalp as well. If you have hair loss, I recommend seeing your Doctor first to make sure there are no underlying issues. Not all hair loss can be explained medically and not all individuals with hair loss respond to treatment but if you want to be proactive in treating your hair loss this might be something to try.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality oil at a wonderful price!  Unbelievable price for such a high quality serum! Get it now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have not found one product that will help with under eye wrinkles, but this makes my skin feel GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Go Radiance liquid Vitamin C for 3 weeks and just ordered my second bottle.  It has been quite amazing to see my aging skin look years younger.  A daily application on my chest and shoulders, (I have other products for my face, otherwise I would apply there as well) followed by a good moisturizer, has changed my skin from looking dry and wrinkled to smooth and so much more youthful.  I am 65 and recently people have guessed me to be in my mid 50&#x27;s.  I love the product and I love the price!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered so far so good it has been a week and my skin is looking and feeling better.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised!  At 72, I don&#x27;t expect much of any product :-) but, my skin looks better, brighter, after only two weeks!  Absolutely a 5-star product!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a Vitamin C Serum.  It&#x27;s working great and helps brighten my complexion and I am noticing an improvement in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Keeps my complexion smooth &amp; clear...plus a large bottle. Product should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I tried this because these serums can be very expensive and you get much more in this bottle. Problem is that it is much thinner and runnier than the other ones I have used. I don&#x27;t doubt that the right ingredients are there but I do not like the formula.</li>
    <li> Great product!! My skin tone has improved visibly and I have less acne. I used it a few days after laser treatment (for dark spots) and experienced no irritation. Reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> I just started using. I am 84. So far so good. Starting to notice a difference. Good value and wonderful support and follow up from Company.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, good quality.  Just as advertised</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I think it has helped with my dark circles!</li>
    <li> I like that is not so greasy, it is just right for my type of skin. As it is a bit watery, I have to keep my finger where I place the drop of liquid not to run down, but I am ok with that, I can handle it..., the thing is, that I don&#x27;t see a magical improvement, I used it for 2 weeks daily, after that only sometimes. Maybe I should be more insistent...</li>
    <li> This vitamin c has helped some of my pores and my dry skin feels smooth thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent serum. A little goes a long way. Used in conjunction with 100% Hyaluronic Acid with excellent results, in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hJyhyaluronic</li>
    <li> It is a great product!!  You can&#x27;t beat it at any price.  I use it on my face and hands to lighten and / or remove age spot.  I apply it twice a day.  I notice a huge difference in my hands already.  Please give it a try.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. Can see a total difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> It ordered Poppy Austin VC first great results.  Sun spots have faded , lines softened... Friends commented &amp; asked what I was using.  Four others have bought thus best VC.  Does not seem to be as good as the Poppy Austin brand</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She loves it. It goes on fast using very little liquid. This bottle should last about 2 months. It heals the sores on her face. I use it on mine too and it heals acne sores very fast. It absorbs fast. Goes well under makeup and under moisturizer. Can be used alone. Is not sticky. You won&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> It did improve the texture of my face a bit, but it is no fountain of youth!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about 7 days. The consistency is nice, not sticky or too watery. I haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I would recommend that anyone give it a try. Great price! Hope to give it 5 stars in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> When I first tried the product, I thought it was too thin and wouldn&#x27;t be effective, but after receiving a email from Jennifer explaining why the consistency is that way, which was nice to know. After using it for several weeks, I can see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m going to be a regular consumer of this product. Thank You</li>
    <li> slightly thicker than water this splashes on nicly. there is an eye dropper so you get just enough without waste. absorbs quickly. 2oz for less that others were charging for 1oz. i will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It is incredible product , I started using it on my face, neck and hands, and ten days  later my skin was 20 years younger, I am 61 years old, I have bought very expensive serums before and this one is much better and a such a good price, Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I just got it. Been using product and i like it! make sure to follow directions&lt;br /&gt;and moisturizer!</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic change, my skin is softer and no longer as dry in some areas. I paired the serum with Kiss My Face coconut skin cream and its worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. My acne is much better and my skin isn&#x27;t irritated any more. Maybe over time I&#x27;ll see some big changes but its still early.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting to see the Vit C portion of this eliminating the 3 dark sun spots I have on my face and after using it in generous amounts twice (and sometimes 3 x) a day for over 3 weeks there has been no change of them lightening, or signs of my face/arms having more collagen. The hyaluronic acid portion works well when I use it on damp skin, although the effects wear off after a few hours. I am also using a hyaluronic face cream (different comp) and I have been for a couple of yrs, and I drink at least a gallon of water a day as I have for 10 years now. I also eat only organic foods and take supplements as well, so I am not sure why I am not seeing more benefits. Suggestions?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost a week now and have notice a glow, especially around the outer corner of my eyes. Other areas are gradually looking youthful, clear and smooth. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long but so far so good. No issues</li>
    <li> I received my vitamin c serum tuesday and I started using it that same night.so far so good.</li>
    <li> Most of the time I use aloe vera the plant itself for skin, hair plus cuts burns and internally. This product had some good reviews and plus it just felt yea try it&#x27; And I will say I am glad I did. I use it in the morning mostly right after taking a bath, on face, neck and ears with a Chinese massage that I have been doing for years. Feels good, real good. Try it</li>
    <li> Really bad...make me break out...done nothing to improve my skin</li>
    <li> i use this every night I like the waY it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Took a couple of days--at first it made my skin feel tight and dry, but after a week, I LOVE it. I can already tell a difference in my skin. And it&#x27;s 2oz, most others are only 1oz.</li>
    <li> Product not as good as OZ Natural.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time ok.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like the Vitamin C serum.  I hope to see even better results after a full month.</li>
    <li> The product is good. I can see some positive changes. I will recommend it to those willing to wait one or two weeks. it really works like magic.</li>
