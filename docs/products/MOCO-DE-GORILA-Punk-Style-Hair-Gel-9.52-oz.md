      <li>I always Eco Olive oil gel first than use the Gorilla gel on top.</li>
      <li>The hold was good but the yellow color of this product was not pleasing to the eye at all.</li>

      <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>Tie my hair down with a scarf for 20 minutes the longer the better take it off and I&amp;#34;m out the door.  </li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;snot gel&amp;#34; is less of a hair gel, but more of a wax/pomade texture and feel.</li>
      <li>The delivery took much too long, but the product was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I have kinky natural hair</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t over use for a natural look.</li>

      <li>Came fast took only 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>I am an African American woman, and I use it to smooth down my edges when wearing an up do.</li>
      <li>They also have 2 other versions, rockerr and sport --- they are very gel like.</li>
      <li>but it really looks and feels like snott, not sure how this came about, but it&#x27;s deff something new to me, especially women of color.</li>
      <li>So far I used this on my edges and it really holds down, you might want to mix it with your edge control, because it leave a little residue after it drys the next day, but i was also told you should leave the top open over night, so it will make the gel a little less snott.....</li>

<li> Use a small amount on top of other holding gel products and lay your hair down with a scarf your hold will last all day.  </li>
<li> However, this was the punk hold which didn&#x27;t last as long and also flaked.</li>
<li> Hard to wash out and didn&#x27;t really work, just made my hair wavy  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave dry flaky residue either.  </li>
<li> but you only need a little.</li>
<li> Stayed down all day long.</li>
<li> I am natural so it is hard to fix a product to lay my hair down</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> LAYS DOWN</li>
<li> Keeps my edges down and strait.</li>
<li> SILK SHINY WITH A LITTLE WAVE</li>
<li> It does get HARD, so be careful not to try and comb it out.  </li>
<li> too messy</li>
<li> Turned a few naturals on to this product.  </li>
<li> &amp; I&#x27;m not sure</li>
<li> This stuff is real thick and gives a firm stiff hold</li>
<li> Hard to get out of your hair.</li>
<li> I would suggest the tub over the tube, the tube gets clogged and is hard to squeeze out.</li>
<li> would not use it to spike unless I add water before applying since PUNK is very thick.</li>
<li> The package deal was already broken.</li>
<li> This was disgusting.</li>
<li> The product works but the build up is horrible.</li>

    <li> This is the best gel ever. I&#x27;m a black woman with natural hair and this works great when I want that sleek ponytail. I always Eco Olive oil gel first than use the Gorilla gel on top. Tie my hair down with a scarf for 20 minutes the longer the better take it off and I&amp;#34;m out the door.  It makes it look like I have a relaxer!</li>
    <li> great been using it for years, day and night use, any hair style  you want. any party you want to be</li>
    <li> Gorila Gel is the best gel for ultimate hold that i have seen in a very long time.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS!  LAYS DOWN THE KINKY AND NAPPY EDGES&lt;br /&gt;LIKE SILK SHINY WITH A LITTLE WAVE</li>
    <li> Really, really goopie! It takes skill to use and I ain&#x27;t there yet.</li>
    <li> The product works but the build up is horrible. If you&#x27;re african-american try Edges by Total Transformation. No build up and is the best on the market for our hair type.</li>
    <li> The Gorrila Snot is ok .Im giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s easy to leak out. When I got it in the mail, it was spilling out. Over all its a good product but you only need a little.</li>
    <li> The gorilla snot is one of the best things that every happened to me! lol I use this for my edges. I am a woman of color and I use edge control but during the course of the day it melts. So I use gorilla snot to hold the edge control in place and it is amazing!! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Great hold with ecco gel and other edge control products.  Use a small amount on top of other holding gel products and lay your hair down with a scarf your hold will last all day.  I love it.  Turned a few naturals on to this product.  Don&#x27;t over use for a natural look.</li>
    <li> So far I used this on my edges and it really holds down, you might want to mix it with your edge control, because it leave a little residue after it drys the next day, but i was also told you should leave the top open over night, so it will make the gel a little less snott.....but it really looks and feels like snott, not sure how this came about, but it&#x27;s deff something new to me, especially women of color. Came fast took only 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> Did not like. Hard to wash out and didn&#x27;t really work, just made my hair wavy  will not buy again</li>
    <li> This was disgusting. The hold was good but the yellow color of this product was not pleasing to the eye at all. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The package deal was already broken. There was no replacement. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I got this and I love it. It works wonders but I would advise you to get some olive oil edge control to use with it</li>
    <li> The delivery took much too long, but the product was worth the wait. Keeps my edges down and strait. Washes out without leaving a residue.</li>
    <li> I ordered the extreme hold which I used before and loved it! However, this was the punk hold which didn&#x27;t last as long and also flaked.</li>
    <li> Very nice holding gel</li>
    <li> I have kinky natural hair &amp; I&#x27;m not sure if I &amp;#34;loved&amp;#34; the product. I&#x27;ll keep being a product junkie. Shipping was quick. Good buy</li>
    <li> I am natural so it is hard to fix a product to lay my hair down but when I apply the gorila snot gel with a edge control product it and my hair stay in place for 2 to 3 days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my 4 year old&#x27;s faux hawk for a year now. It&#x27;s the best! I would suggest the tub over the tube, the tube gets clogged and is hard to squeeze out.</li>
    <li> I give this produce 4 stars because it does flake once it dries...other than that, this stuff works for me.  I am an African American woman, and I use it to smooth down my edges when wearing an up do. or ponytail.  It dries fairly quickly, and it stays that way ALLLLL day!  If I sweat, it continues to do it&#x27;s job.  It does get HARD, so be careful not to try and comb it out.  I would advise to just go ahead and wash your hair to avoid breakage, and of course..you will have dandruff like flakes everywhere!  Other than that, I have no problems with it because I only use when wearing my hair pulled back. I hope it works for you....Peace and blessings y&#x27;all!</li>
    <li> Great combined with edge control! Thanks for the rapid service!</li>
    <li> Its too sticky but it works well</li>
    <li> omg i love this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for laying down your edges.  It doesn&#x27;t leave dry flaky residue either.  Hint the name &amp;#34;gorilla snot&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Hard to get out of your hair. It has the texture of gum...but it gets the job done .</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;snot gel&amp;#34; is less of a hair gel, but more of a wax/pomade texture and feel. It is very low price in stores.. however. . . they started changing the packaging a couple times. They also have 2 other versions, rockerr and sport --- they are very gel like. I am a fan of this PUNK style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use it to spike unless I add water before applying since PUNK is very thick. I do however use it for my combover. Cheers.</li>
    <li> This stuff is real thick and gives a firm stiff hold and it also holds all day without any flakiness. I am african american and this stuff works to hold a ponytail-no more ratchet brown gel for me anymore!! I&#x27;m sold on this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Stayed down all day long. Very nice</li>
    <li> This product is the best , cant stop braging  about it.  it Great  love love love</li>
    <li> Product arrived cracked open, gel was everywhere ..too messy</li>
    <li> I love me some gorila snott, yes I do. It holds great, looks great, rinses out easily, doesn&#x27;t leave the shower all coated with wax and dyes -- It&#x27;s a staple in my household now.</li>
