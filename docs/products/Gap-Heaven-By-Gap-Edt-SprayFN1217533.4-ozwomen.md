<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for at least 10 years, but couldn&#x27;t find in GAP shop, cause they stop to produce.but happy I found in Amazon and quality good as always. and not me but all my friends say the scent is fresh and smelly. I will back to buy more. :)</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I thought this scent would be exactly what I was looking for, clean and fresh scent.  It has that for about a minute....  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite pefes. It&#x27;s light and clean. I am so happy u found it ! I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is original.</li>
    <li> Love this scent was very happy that i could find it.</li>
    <li> Wow does this take me back! I have been on a hunt for certain fragrances that I used to wear. I swear the 90&#x27;s were amazing for this. My first hunt was for the Bonne Bell Bottled Emotions. And those are so hard to find. Big disappointment. I came across cult followings for those scents and some one also mentioned Heaven by Gap. I wore that a lot as well in middle school and loved it. So of course when I found it on here, I couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to have a trip in memory lane in my purse :)</li>
    <li> Great Product.  My wife used to wear this 7 years ago back when we were dating.  I bought it for our anniversary gift and the smell of it has been very nostalgic.  I don&#x27;t know if its the nostalgia that makes me love the smell or the scent itself, but either way I love smelling it(I think it is a little of both).</li>
    <li> This fresh scent is revitalizing. It is sweet but it doesnt give you a headache. I bought it for my mother and she allways smells like flowers.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see this product available again.  It was not available any longer at the Gap and I ordered a bottle from Amazon quite a while ago and then it was not available.  I just found it available again from you and it is the same fragrance and I am just delighted.  Your prompt service and great packing is always appreciated.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and so sad they stopped making it. I always get compliments when I wear this--even from strangers!</li>
    <li> Came early. Perfect!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, need I say more!!!!</li>
    <li> This has been the only fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn that people complimented me on, and I was so angry when Gap discontinued both Heaven and Dream! What were they thinking? And they wondered why they were losing customers?? Gap should fire their entire marketing department! This fragrance is wonderful - light, not cloying, but it gets you noticed, nonetheless. Bravo for Amazon and Scentsations for offering it! And Boo to Gap stores for not carrying it!</li>
    <li> A light, fresh scent.  My favorite scent to wear.</li>
    <li> this is just how i remebered it the perfume was in the orginal box and wraped in the cellophane.  would buy again</li>
    <li> my wife used to buy this in the store but gap doesnt sell it anymore thanks for amazon and there competive prices it came fast also</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about Gap Heaven.  I reviewed the body spray, but the perfume is pretty much exactly the same as the body spray.  You can never apply too much, even though one spritz is plenty.  I am extremely sensitive to smell, and usually get intense headaches from perfume.  This is the only perfume I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  It actually has a calming effect on me, and I could spray every inch of my body with it without it being overwhelming to me or others. I get compliments daily on the smell, so I can just NOT figure out why Gap discontinued it!  If I had the money, I would buy up EVERY one of these to make sure I never run out!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! My sister and I have been wearing it for years,And,it&#x27;s discontinued Again... Always gets me complyments! So glad I can get it on Amazon ...</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the price is good.</li>
    <li> It has a good smell, but only lasts for a little while, not as long as I thought it would be... But my wife uses it like a body spray so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> great service. speedy delivery. packaged with love and care.                                                   many thanks , dianne2177  I will surely recommend you to all my friends.!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this online as I hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in Gap stores. This is one of my favorite scents to wear everyday because it&#x27;s so light and fresh, and I had been hoarding what little I had left. This comes in a much nicer glass bottle than the one I had previously and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> The early 2000s called, and they want to remind you about this lovely scent,</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the ones I had previously purchased and doesn&#x27;t last as long. Not very happy with this.</li>
    <li> This heaven product was pretty disappointing. I&#x27;ve been using heaven by  Gap for years. Usually the scent will stay on all day &amp; it also smells different.  Not sure if it was a bad batch or what.  I used to purchase it right from the store however they stopped selling it there. This is my second time buying it through Amazon. I didn&#x27;t have this problem the first go around. So not really sure what to think....</li>
    <li> This 90s fixture will take you back to the days of slap bracelets and Dawson&#x27;s Creek romance when you&#x27;d sneak in your older sister&#x27;s room to get a few squirts of Gap&#x27;s Heaven.</li>
    <li> THE PRICE IS GREAT!!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Smells very nice....and my daughter loves the scent</li>
    <li> I wish Gap would bring this back. It is still my favorite scent all these years later.</li>
    <li> EWWW, it smells like bug spray, not at all clean and fresh!! Wish I could return it but can&#x27;t  - waste of $18!</li>
    <li> Received in packaging, smells just like I remember! I&#x27;m very happy, thank you</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to those who don&#x27;t like a stinky, strong perfume, it&#x27;s light and refreshing, I really love it!</li>
    <li> Meant to put 5 stars !!!! I love it been wearing it for years  and was so sad when gap stopped selling it  ! So happy u had it !!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law. She has worn Heaven for years and sometimes it is hard to find, especially in Eau De Toilette. It&#x27;s a light and lovely scent and suits her beautifully. It would be a good scent for a femine, but not flowery, young women. This was a generous sized bottle and will last her a long time. It arrived well protected and in perfect condition. I strongly suggest that everyone looking for a light scent to check it out. They may find it&#x27;s a heavenly scent to love for life!</li>
    <li> El nombre se identifica con el perfume, es un verdadero cielo de fragancia, creo que es exelente, lo volveria a comprar</li>
    <li> Just as I remember. :) This was my go to fragrance back in high school. :) Brings me back to some fun times, and also smells great. :)</li>
    <li> The item was just as expected.  Light scent, very nice !</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear this people ask me what I have on. Its such a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Have liked this for years. Glad they still make it</li>
    <li> Break out your butterfly barrettes, chokers, Bonne Bell Lipshades and Buffy the Vampire Slayer dvds (VHS, even BETTER) because that&#x27;s what this perfume smells like:My youth!!!  I might be older but I have a much better disposable income and did not think twice before buying this and Dream by Gap.  They did not disappoint except that the scent wears off quickly.  That&#x27;s ok! I can re-apply in between Buffy Episodes while my Bagel Bites (a food of my youth) cooks in the microwave.  I might not be able to get my late teens/early 20s back but I can buy their trademark perfume for a bargain price...</li>
    <li> Heaven by the Gap is awesome and so is Amazon!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I have been wearing it since 1994 and get compliments daily when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Got for my mom who can&#x27;t find anywhere else. She loves it.</li>
    <li> My favorite for 20+ years!</li>
    <li> As a teenager of the 90&#x27;s, I love and miss this perfume! I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere...maybe it&#x27;s discontinued? So, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for a great price. It reminds me of Tori Amos, My So Called Life rereuns, and laying in bed at my parents house reading YM magazine! I love that you can still get Gap Heaven online at this reasonable price...nice and clean, a beautiful fragrance! Love it!</li>
    <li> Best everyday scent there is!</li>
    <li> Arrived timely, packed well, good price.  THANKS</li>
    <li> This is a delicious fragrance!</li>
    <li> my wife loves wearing many different scents so I try my best to find different tones for the changes in the seasons.  This is a great spring/summer one.</li>
    <li> What a fresh non perfumy scent, like a shower and laundry. I hope Gap doesn&#x27;t retire it......</li>
    <li> is that Heaven I really love it&#x27;s freshness, the escence remains in my cloths, feels clean... thank&#x27;s to Amazon ..I love the price too TR</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I wear it all of the time and get complimented on it each and every time I wear it!&lt;br /&gt;So clean and nice smelling. Very light and not over powering. Perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law as it is her favorite, I was happy to be able to find it.</li>
    <li> Used it for yrs;unfortunately GAP stopped making this perfume. Recently purchased this scent from ebay for $20.00. Now, it is all I wear. I love the scent. It smells light, clean, and earthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Heaven since around 1999, and was so devastated when Gap stopped selling it.  But wait...Amazon to the rescue!!!  The price is even better than it ever was at Gap, and it smells just the same.  I gotta have my signature scent, so thank you for supplying it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for many years and love it.  Can&#x27;t believe it was discontinued - but every so happy this was available.  Product arrived safely and was priced OK too.</li>
    <li> Heaven is a very nice fragance by Gap. Fresh and perfect for day and night. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived properly on due time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since high school and that was a very long time ago! Great scent, subtle but so pretty. Came packaged well and fast shipping.  Will defintely order again from here when I run out.</li>
    <li> Its ok, nothing great.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother spending money on it again.  I will use it, but never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for 20 years. It&#x27;s clean and fresh. My &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent. :-) forever in love</li>
    <li> This is what my friend said when she asked me to look for this fragrance. \\&quot; FINALLY IT&#x27;S BACK\\&quot; ...she liked it so much when it first came out, and was disapointed to know that it was discontinued. SO she is happy once again...</li>
    <li> Just love this fragrance, been using for it for years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this because it&#x27;s so delicate without loosing its smell! I plan to buy my mom a bottle sometime soon!</li>
    <li> Ahhhh Heavan... This was my go-to perfume back in middle and high school. I wore it religiously! When the Gap discontinued it, I was heartbroken... I eventually moved on and found another signature perfume and kind of forgot about this one. This fragrance just came to my mind out of no where recently and I just had to get it. I was worried that it might not smell the same or it would be different but it is still the same old lovely scent. Love the perfume. Love the price!</li>
    <li> Heaven by Gap can be worn anywhere anytime because it is light but pleasingly fragrant. I wear it to work and every day I get a compliment from a co worker or a client. When I remove my sweater, jacket or scarf I can smell it the next time I put them on. I  can wear Heaven to work, church, grocery or a wedding. It is appropriate to wear anywhere,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE this perfume! So happy I could still get some!</li>
    <li> excellent product, thanks</li>
    <li> Smells just as refreshing as I remember it from a decade ago!</li>
    <li> Great perfume, reminds me of scented rain oils.  It is not a strong scent and won&#x27;t last on your body all day.  Your co-workers will thank you for not giving them a perfume headache.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  It has a light scent and smells so fresh and lovely.  I&#x27;ve worn it for many years.</li>
