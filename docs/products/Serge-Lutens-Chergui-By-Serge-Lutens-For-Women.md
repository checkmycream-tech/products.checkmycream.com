      <li>The fragrance is beautiful.</li>
      <li>This is a great fragrance for colder weather, but it can be cloying in the summer.  </li>
      <li>I got this for a great price here.</li>
      <li>Tobacco is one of my 5 or 6 favorite notes in a fragrance, and Chergui does it the best I&#x27;ve ever seen it.</li>
      <li>Perfect for winter season :)</li>
      <li>Incredibly, truly lovely hay note in this.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could share with you a good description of the essences involved.  </li>

      <li>I love this perfume!  </li>
      <li>Nothing to say, I just love this smell!</li>
      <li>With the excellent price on Amazon, I became interested.  </li>

      <li>Smell of tobacco and Amber produces an amazing smell.</li>
      <li>Fabulous murky fragrance, great for Winter.</li>
      <li>nice</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many women and men have practically eaten me up with praise for how good I smell.</li>
      <li>(Soon to be replaced by a Spring scent when things warm up.)</li>
      <li>With notes of honey, musk, incense, tobacco leaf, hay sugar, amber, iris, rose and sandalwood</li>
      <li>Will never understand how it sells for half the price that it does in stores, but hey, that&#x27;s a win win!!!</li>
      <li>It is very sexy smelling and unique.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>More like a syrupy barn then baby</li>
      <li>Fantastic buy!</li>
      <li>Absolutely famous Serge Lutens.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After I purchased the cologne from Amazon, I was able to get a sample.</li>
      <li>I love it because you won&#x27;t find anyone else wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Definitely authentic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve become something of a &#x27;perfumista&#x27;, and this is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>It is a nice, honeyed scent but not as sweet to make it a feminine fragrance.</li>
      <li>Very sweet and dessert-like.</li>
      <li>Based on another description from luckyscent.com, this fragrance is \\&quot;a hot and breathtaking fragrance that&#x27;s not tame and not at all familiar (and oh-so-gorgeous because of it).\\</li>
      <li>This is a very unique fragrance that give me a very calm and smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>Sweet tobacco, leather and amber --- lovely evening and wintry scent.</li>
      <li>This is a \\&quot;special\\&quot; fragrance, which is part of my regular rotation and am always happy when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I see this as a mature fragrance (post-college), more suitable for men.</li>
      <li>This stuff is unique.</li>
      <li>This is by far the most stunning fragrance I have ever smelled.</li>
      <li>On special occasions (preferably formal, semi-formal) this fragrance shines.</li>
      <li>Very sensual and exotic.  </li>
      <li>- it is true poetry in a perfume.</li>
      <li>This is one of those true 3 or 4 spray frags.</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic and def at the right price from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very familiar with Tobacco Vanille and I love it, but this is tobacco done very differently than that.</li>
      <li>My current favorite!</li>
      <li>but this was a success.</li>
      <li>Of the ones I own, this is my second to Miel de Bois.</li>
      <li>IMO it smells like a freshly baked snickerdoodle cookie - which I like.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Very rich and soft.</li>
      <li>For me, the dry-down, which takes about a half hour or so - is simply amazing!</li>
      <li>The dry down is the best part- sweet incense.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful, complex fragrance which truly could be worn by either a man or a woman</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very flattering when complete strangers comment on your sexy scent.  </li>
      <li>Use with caution!!! ;);)</li>
      <li>I first tried this at Barney&#x27;s in Chicago, but bought elsewhere because of expense.  </li>
      <li>This is a deliciously different fragrance --- i recieve many compliments on this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It smelled wonderful in the bottle but the dry down was very powdery on me.</li>
      <li>I have to admit, I had never of the perfumer SergeLutens or his French unique French fragrances, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, I did some research and decided I HAD to own one of his fragrances</li>
      <li>Great scent and smells clean on the dry down.</li>
      <li>This fragrance (on me) is not a monster but whispers and stays close to the skin, blooms like a flower, has moderate projection, good longevity and moderate sillage.</li>
      <li>It also attracts lots of positive comments.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Chergui is not a leather scent in how I sense leather, but certainly close.  </li>
      <li>I love my new fragrance, it&#x27;s individual.  </li>
      <li>Simply put, forget the hype, lower your expectations, and probably you get to enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Thanks  </li>
      <li>The line is fabulous and last all day which is a plus.  </li>
      <li>They really out did themselves</li>
      <li>Too much hype I would say.</li>
      <li>very woody</li>
      <li>That said, it is unusual and a pleasure to wear.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Great price and shipped fast: 5/5</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
      <li>It instantly has a far away, exotic scent.</li>
      <li>(definitely prefer this over pure havane; I haven&#x27;t tried TF Tobacco Vanille)&lt;br /&gt;Sillage: 3.5/5 (above average; for me, this is ideal.</li>
      <li>It is an all time classic and the bottle is just timeless.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
      <li>After that its dry, sweet, comforting goodness.</li>
      <li>&quot; I find this, of all Serge Lutens fragrances, the most easy to wear (IMHO) - especially on a chilly day but equally amazing in the Spring/Summer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pure sophistication, but at the same time, I wouldn&#x27;t wear this to a black-tie event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I manage a busy restaurant.  </li>
      <li>it has a depth which evokes thoughts of soft summery winds breezing over ones face while lying in a valley of lillies.</li>
      <li>lush.  </li>
      <li>When I think of Chergui, I picture a well-groomed man in his late 20s, wearing casual designer clothes, with cool glasses/sunglasses, arm-in-arm with a beautiful woman, walking around NYC in the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lingers gently on the skin, and certainly not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I get that too, but its only for the first few hours.</li>

<li> long lasting.</li>
<li> guess Amazon is not the right place to blind buy colognes, you live and learn.</li>
<li> A bit of a powdery leather on me, but the drydown remedies that (clearly I&#x27;m not a fan of powdery scents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I blind bought this and was not disappointed at all.</li>
<li> It smells dry, like its name.</li>
<li> this was my first into the niche game, which is all I collect and wear.  </li>
<li> Get it if you like the smell of wet tobacco and dry hay.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tobacco is one of my 5 or 6 favorite notes in a fragrance, and Chergui does it the best I&#x27;ve ever seen it. Think of semi-sweet and powdery cherry pipe tobacco - AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity is DAYS on clothing and projection is very good. This is one of those true 3 or 4 spray frags. I&#x27;m very familiar with Tobacco Vanille and I love it, but this is tobacco done very differently than that.</li>
    <li> Although a hardcore Chanel Cuir de Russie lemming, even with the newer formulas, I venture into other leather scents now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chergui is not a leather scent in how I sense leather, but certainly close.  A bit of a powdery leather on me, but the drydown remedies that (clearly I&#x27;m not a fan of powdery scents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful, complex fragrance which truly could be worn by either a man or a woman - I dislike the term \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; as I believe there is no such thing - with a very different vibe, like the vast majority of Serge Lutens scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly one of the best scents out there, and well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I first tried this at Barney&#x27;s in Chicago, but bought elsewhere because of expense.  Yours is perfect and it is an awesome fragrance!</li>
    <li> Nothing to say, I just love this smell! Smell of tobacco and Amber produces an amazing smell. However, I am a little bit disappointed with the sillage, it is soft and only get noticed (Definitely noticed) once someone gets close to you. Perfect for winter season :)</li>
    <li> m a perfume collector, and this was my first into the niche game, which is all I collect and wear.  Now with over 100 bottles...this is still up among the smellguudz I like.  Thanks  RaJuR real deep kool on the web and YOUTUBE!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I had never of the perfumer SergeLutens or his French unique French fragrances, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, I did some research and decided I HAD to own one of his fragrances (esp since Amazon has them for one half the price of other carriers)...I was not dissapointed.  This fragrance would probably not be for everyone, but I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> one of the best scent on Earth</li>
    <li> Definitely one for cold weather or late, late night soirees.  As I array my Lutens collection, the dark color of this blend reminds me to use it cautiously and sparingly.</li>
    <li> lush.  long lasting. it has a depth which evokes thoughts of soft summery winds breezing over ones face while lying in a valley of lillies. enough said.</li>
    <li> This is a deliciously different fragrance --- i recieve many compliments on this fragrance.  Sweet tobacco, leather and amber --- lovely evening and wintry scent.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about blind-buying a niche fragrance but Chergui did not let me down. This fragrance is hard to wear, not something I would recommend for everyday wear. On special occasions (preferably formal, semi-formal) this fragrance shines. Very sweet and dessert-like. I don&#x27;t ever recommend blind-buying a niche fragrance but this was a success.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  The line is fabulous and last all day which is a plus.  I wish I could share with you a good description of the essences involved.  My senses are just not that refined.  That said, it is unusual and a pleasure to wear.  Definitely authentic.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most stunning fragrance I have ever smelled. With notes of honey, musk, incense, tobacco leaf, hay sugar, amber, iris, rose and sandalwood - it is true poetry in a perfume. Based on another description from luckyscent.com, this fragrance is \\&quot;a hot and breathtaking fragrance that&#x27;s not tame and not at all familiar (and oh-so-gorgeous because of it).\\&quot; I find this, of all Serge Lutens fragrances, the most easy to wear (IMHO) - especially on a chilly day but equally amazing in the Spring/Summer. For me, the dry-down, which takes about a half hour or so - is simply amazing! With all SL fragrances I always think what type of food is this? IMO it smells like a freshly baked snickerdoodle cookie - which I like. This fragrance (on me) is not a monster but whispers and stays close to the skin, blooms like a flower, has moderate projection, good longevity and moderate sillage. I get loads of compliments and don&#x27;t smell like everyone else, which I prefer. This is a \\&quot;special\\&quot; fragrance, which is part of my regular rotation and am always happy when I wear it. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> I blind bought this scent because of all the sterling reviews that are on here.&lt;br /&gt;After I purchased the cologne from Amazon, I was able to get a sample. To me this smells more like talcum powder (which I hate) as opposed to tobacco which I enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it seems that Amazon does not have a return policy when it comes to perfumes, now I am stuck with scent that I can&#x27;ts stand.&lt;br /&gt;I guess Amazon is not the right place to blind buy colognes, you live and learn.</li>
    <li> This is my go to perfume.  It is very different.  I love it because you won&#x27;t find anyone else wearing it.  It is very sexy smelling and unique.</li>
    <li> Fabulous murky fragrance, great for Winter. Will never understand how it sells for half the price that it does in stores, but hey, that&#x27;s a win win!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Chergui for years.  With the excellent price on Amazon, I became interested.  Ordered it hoping that it was not a fake/dupe.  It&#x27;s the real deal.  Wonderful Lutens&#x27; fragrance!</li>
    <li> Another winner with Serge Lutens.  All of the bottles look the same, but it is what is inside that counts.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has a few rave reviews around the web. Too much hype I would say. It is a nice, honeyed scent but not as sweet to make it a feminine fragrance. I would rather smell it on a man rather than a woman. Simply put, forget the hype, lower your expectations, and probably you get to enjoy it. I would classify this as a metrosexual type of fragrance that can be worn year round.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and def at the right price from Amazon. Works as a men&#x27;s fragrance and I constantly get complements. Fantastic buy!</li>
    <li> This is the best parfum it stays all day&lt;br /&gt;i gave it to my husband&lt;br /&gt;its very woody we share it now&lt;br /&gt;so nice</li>
    <li> My current favorite! (Soon to be replaced by a Spring scent when things warm up.) But for now, it&#x27;s a warm, cuddly scent - like snuggling up in front of the fireplace on a crisply cold night. The mix of tobacco, hay, grass, vanilla is irresistible.</li>
    <li> When I think of Chergui, I picture a well-groomed man in his late 20s, wearing casual designer clothes, with cool glasses/sunglasses, arm-in-arm with a beautiful woman, walking around NYC in the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serge Lutens Chergui is what got me into 1) niche fragrances and 2) eau de parfums (which I will now buy over EDTs). I blind bought this and was not disappointed at all. The fragrance is beautiful. It&#x27;s sweetness (because of the honey and amber notes) draws people in, and it&#x27;s mysterious vibe keeps people guessing. I see this as a mature fragrance (post-college), more suitable for men. It&#x27;s pure sophistication, but at the same time, I wouldn&#x27;t wear this to a black-tie event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 4.5/5 (10 hours+)&lt;br /&gt;Scent: 4.5/5 (definitely prefer this over pure havane; I haven&#x27;t tried TF Tobacco Vanille)&lt;br /&gt;Sillage: 3.5/5 (above average; for me, this is ideal. I don&#x27;t want to fill room, too abrasive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4.5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and shipped fast: 5/5</li>
    <li> Great scent and smells clean on the dry down. Love it. It is an all time classic and the bottle is just timeless.</li>
    <li> Looking for something different?  This is the Parfum for you.  You will not be disappointed.  Very sensual and exotic.  I will be buying my second bottle.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got this for a great price here. This stuff is unique. Get it if you like the smell of wet tobacco and dry hay. Some people say it smells like baby powder. I get that too, but its only for the first few hours. After that its dry, sweet, comforting goodness. More like a syrupy barn then baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I think of it, it smells like a lot like Joop! the moment you put it on.</li>
    <li> I love my new fragrance, it&#x27;s individual.  Notes of musk, vanilla, cocoa.  Its wonderful!  Longer review?  Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth bottle of SL fragrance. Of the ones I own, this is my second to Miel de Bois. It lingers gently on the skin, and certainly not overpowering. Someone else needs to stand closely to appreciate it&#x27;s beauty.</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance for colder weather, but it can be cloying in the summer.  It is long lasting and projects moderately.  It also attracts lots of positive comments.  Notes of tobacco, honey, hay, amber, musk, and vanilla can be discerned.  It is a very complex fragrance.  A winner from Lutens.</li>
    <li> It was just not the fragrance for my skin. It smelled wonderful in the bottle but the dry down was very powdery on me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely famous Serge Lutens.  Incredibly, truly lovely hay note in this.  It smells dry, like its name.</li>
    <li> Obviously any description of this scent is nothing until you experience it.  The term Chergui is the name of a desert wind in Morocco. It instantly has a far away, exotic scent. The scent is sensual and evokes emotions from both men and women.  I have worn Chergui for a few months now and and I manage a busy restaurant.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many women and men have practically eaten me up with praise for how good I smell. It&#x27;s very flattering when complete strangers comment on your sexy scent.  Use with caution!!! ;);)</li>
    <li> This met all of my expectations</li>
    <li> Love it. Very rich and soft.</li>
    <li> like it also because in the USA is less expensive than in Italy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become something of a &#x27;perfumista&#x27;, and this is my favorite scent. My boyfriend always comments on it. The dry down is the best part- sweet incense. Yummy.</li>
    <li> le regale este perfume frances a mi esposa y le encanto ..un aroma muy rico ..se los recomiendo .. creo ke tambien hay para hombre ..</li>
    <li> This is a very unique fragrance that give me a very calm and smooth feeling. They really out did themselves</li>
