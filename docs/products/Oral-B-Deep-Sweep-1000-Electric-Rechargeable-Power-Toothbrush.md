<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it brushes way too hard, makes me lightheaded. if I would have known, would have gotten a different  brand or model. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift.  Have not heard any negatives.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great, I like the size of the brush, and my teeth seem to be clean and white. It is pretty quiet which is nice. I don&#x27;t have to charge it very often which is nice. I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who is looking for a decent quiet rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is working very well.  Very good price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works great, I really like it. Bought it as a replacement for an old electric Oral-B that finally died after about 15 years! Good price on an open box deal, though, unusually, the shipping took forever. I have no clue why, I attempted to email them asking what was taking so long but never got a reply. But it was worth waiting since the price was a real discount from list and only the box was a mess, not the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My oral b professional deep sweep triaction 1000 rechargeable electric tooth brush is just what I expected it to be and more....I love it</li>
    <li> Want to polish your teeth without expensive toothpastes and chemicals?  Give them a workout with this fantastic brush.  It goes where no brush has ever gone before!</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.  I have had several electric toothbrushes and this is deffinitely the best one.  I would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> EAZY TO INSTALL AND EVERY THING  WORKS LIGHTS ARE BRIGHTER THAN MOST. I DO NOT RATE MANY PRODS. BUT I GIVE THIS ONE 5 STARS.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it love it love it.  only braun could have come up with this product and they have a real winner here.&lt;br /&gt;i am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used powered toothbrushes in the past, but this Oral-B is truly excellent.  It stays charged for days, and I&#x27;ve already bought an additional head for when the current one wears out because I don&#x27;t want to be without it for any period of time.</li>
    <li> Really great brush!  I used to have an older oral b and i immediately felt the difference.  This one works way harder and faster  and the way they designed the brushing movement is brilliant.</li>
    <li> Great clean feeling after use. Love that it vibrates every 30 seconds to keep you on track with time. Uses minimal counter space.</li>
    <li> Sits on the bathroom counter.  Vibration makes this a very irritating tool to use.  Might be O.K. in my shop though!</li>
    <li> Really a nice toothbrush and is working very well.. so well it vibrates my jaw and cheeks, making them itch somewhat!! Not sure if I&#x27;m just use to another brand that is a little less aggressive or what. Would recommend this for the fact it gets the job (getting teeth clean) done. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days so I can&#x27;t comment on how durable it is at this point.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I ever bought.</li>
    <li> Started out as a good, affordable electric toothbrush.  Then, within a month or so, started to not hold charge well at all.  Now, a couple of months after owning, it refuses to accept charge at all.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud, but be warned.</li>
    <li> Much less comfortable than slightly higher end Sonicare model it replaced.  Quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used previously Oral-B brushes that work with pulsar action and really help remove plaque and white teeth. But this thing is just a mechanical sweep imitation of what you would normally do with your hand. Not liking it at all.</li>
    <li> This thing ROCKS!! Love it, Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I went to the dentist earlier this year and was reccommended that I get an Oral B toothbrush with a timer. Initally I thought they were trying to rip me off but this electric toothbrush makes a huge difference in removing plaque. I like that it has a 30 second timer so you can get each section and it makes my teeth feel clean, I also like that the brissles aren&#x27;t rough on my gums. I thought it was a little pricey for an electric toothbrush but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It works okay.  I din&#x27;t get  a brush cover.</li>
    <li> My Son loves it!  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I purchased for a loved one who is disabled and a regular hand brush too difficult to use and a sonic feels weird so the Oral B fits perfectly for her.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size and slender and she can manage well without tiring in her hand. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This replaced a fancy 5000 series with features I never used. Cleans just as good and uses the same brush heads for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel so fresh after using it. Loved it. Definitely recommended to anyone that wants to switch from traditional toothbrushes</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works well!</li>
    <li> Got it on sale and it is doing its job. I think I like this brushing action better than the rotary action. Maybe because it is more traditional, maybe because it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sanding down my teeth. It took about 24 hours to fully charge but once there it&#x27;s been solid.</li>
    <li> got it right away (2 days) and my first couple of brushings were great. If this continues you will hear from me again.</li>
    <li> Definitely more powerful than the generic I used to have that just died on me.  This can be good or bad if you are prone to headaches.  Only time will tell how dependable this brand is.</li>
    <li> A very good cleaner and good price.</li>
    <li> I was going to try to replace the battery on my old brush, but that was too difficult so I bought this new one instead. It is so much better than the old one!!! I love it.</li>
    <li> It does not live up to the hype at all.  The &amp;#34;deep sweep&amp;#34; is ineffective.  Perhaps a different brush head would be better.  Also, my brush has started to not run right. It misses out while I am using it.  I am assuming it will quit working altogether in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> excellent toothbrush in all respects</li>
    <li> Does a great cleaning job for the price. Brush head is a little large but cleans well and can be interchanged with other Oral B heads. Good brush compared to more expensive models.</li>
    <li> good product, would recommend</li>
    <li> Was quite on the fence about this purchase, I needed to replace my Braun Oral B Sonic which would no longer hold a charge more than a day or two. Finally decided on this and was pleasantly surprised. If you use an electric or sonic now, you may remember the first few times you brushed it felt like your eyeballs were vibrating. At least that&#x27;s what I experienced. You will have that feeling again, as this brush seems more powerful than the one I replaced. It&#x27;s a funny sensation, but doesn&#x27;t last long fortunately. I don&#x27;t usually buy the hype from TV commercials, but in this case it turns out this brush really is WOW.</li>
    <li> Very small and  lightweight --love it however brushing action feels stronger than previous models plus the brush itself is larger so have to take it easy.  Very pleased with appliance and would order it again</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush that Oral-B has ever made!  It really gets my teeth clean and the 30 second timer makes sure that all my teeth get their fair share of brushing!</li>
    <li> It takes almost a day to recharge the battery once you let it go down to when the red light flashes so the charging technology could have been better (I have power tools that charge in less than an hour). Be careful of the sweep action of this unit, it can make a mess of your bathroom sink and mirror in short order. I am in the habit of running the toothbrush while I am rinsing it out so I had to wipe the sink down on more than one occasion because it slings water and toothpaste all over. I ended up swapping this head with one of my older Oral-B toothbrush heads because I got tired of cleaning up after it. It is ergonomically better than the previous Oral-B&#x27;s that I have owned and it allows you to swivel it around a little easier than before to get up and under your teeth.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is very powerful and it stays charged for a long time. It was worth paying the extra money than a standard toothbrush.</li>
    <li> much better than my old toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I am still adjusting to using an electric toothbrush.  I have never liked that they are messy.  I can feel and see a difference in how clean my teeth are, so am sticking with it.  It holds a charge for about a week.  I am going on a week long trip soon and wondering about traveling with it.  Have noticed others have an issue with it.</li>
    <li> Ordered 1 then ordered 3 for family members.  Especially good for cleaning gum area.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I ever used. Every time I brush I feel as though I have just came home from a dentist cleaning. Fantastic toothbrush. I especially like the 2 minute timer signifying 4 30 minute cleaning zones.</li>
    <li> I like this tooth brush, however just as I m finding my deep tooth cleaning zone, the tooth brush does a timer style hiccup. It is sorta a kills the mood sometime, other times it reminds me I have other teeth to clean. over all a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great book, great service. thank you!</li>
    <li> never used electric before this is really amazing i believe everyone should use one make sure u keep it clean after each use</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B tooth electric brush. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The brush is too hard for my teeth. I prefer a softer brush...would not be surprised if it could damage the enamel on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Wish I has switched sooner. Easy to adjust to, but a little noisy and on/off button seems in a place that its easy to press during use.</li>
    <li> I have always had an Oral-B electric rechargeable I would not have bought this product toothbrush.  They have been gentle, soft, quiet and non-intrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this one:  It is extremely loud, rough on my teeth and gums and I don&#x27;t even like using it.  Most of the time, I use a manual softbrush $3.95 brush.  I even went to the expense of purchase what seemed to be a soft set of replacement brushes for it and they do not even do the job.  But the clincher was when I went for my 6-month checkup, my dentist informed me that this brush is not appropriate for my teeth and gums.  I am older and a lot of my teeth are capped, so the brush clatters loudly and brashly against them and hurts my gums. I use a sensitive toothpaste.  Just recently my gums are sore and my teeth are hurting.  If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, they ease up.  It was a waste of money, but when my original one just stopped working, I felt I had to replace it.  This is not a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to contact the manufacturer on line to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job well but kind of hiccups a few times during operation.  Does not really affect brushing other than a minor annoyance</li>
    <li> Had to send it back because the brush insert was too large for the mouth.  There are no smaller brushes available .</li>
    <li> Works well is in my top list.</li>
    <li> Nothing special....it works, does a good job, lots of action, I think I prefer my Sonicare overall.</li>
    <li> Like a jackhammer in your mouth.  I sent it to Oral B for their &#x27;satisfaction guarantee&#x27; program.  After the shipping for sending it back, and them not refunding the Amazon promotional credit that was partly used for the purchase, I&#x27;m out $20 and don&#x27;t have a terrible toothbrush either.</li>
    <li> This is the brush I needed.  Much better in RPMs than my old brusher..Use this with the professional deep sweep.</li>
    <li> This is not my first electric toothbrush, but it is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and my gums are healthier than ever.  Even my dental hygienist noticed.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected, just great.</li>
    <li> Wow, did now how low the power was on my old cheap electric tooth brush until I got this one.  Like a massage for your teeth and gums.  You actually want to brush your teeth longer &amp; doesnt have a lot of useless bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> I used to think electric toothbrushes were kind of gimmicky, but this changed my mind. My teeth definitely feel cleaner. It&#x27;s also got a timer system in it to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed long enough so it keeps you honest, and I think it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
    <li> i was not impressed  i have decided to give this brush a try  but i like the style and clean feeling of the brush i have been using</li>
    <li> It really works.  My teeth are cleaner than they have been even with my previous Oral B rechargeable.  I hope this one lasts longer than the last one</li>
    <li> THE ON/OFF BUTTON IS DIFFICULT TO ACTIVATE.  DON&#x27;T CARE FOR THE PROGRAMED HESITATION.  PREFER TO FOLLOW MY OWN BRUSHING ROUTINE.  DON&#x27;T WANT TO GO THROUGH SENDING IT BACK,, BUT MAY JUST DO SO.</li>
    <li> Bought as a New Years gift for me and my spouse. With first use I knew my mouth and teeth we&#x27;re going to be happy.</li>
    <li> very good ,i like it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m had the deluxe triumph 5000 for a few years and my doctor was amazed at my results. I can tell this one, though smaller is cleaning even better.&lt;br /&gt; I was going to buy the other leading tooth brush because I saw some good studies results comparing resulted of the two brands.  Then I realized this one is just too new, they were comparing the older version not this Deep Sweep Triaction. I&#x27;m expecting to see this unit pull ahead in the competition in the next study. Anyway I love it.</li>
    <li> Of course it took just outside of the return period for me to be sure, but the Deep Sweep actually worsened my gum recession. I thought this would be like the sonicare, but the bristles move A LOT in a fast, hard motion. At first it even caused my gums to bleed a little. Gonna ditch it and get a sonicare, and wish I hadn&#x27;t missed the return window.</li>
    <li> Had Phillips Sonicare before so I am not new to electric toothbrushes. Must say I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great brush.  First one I got was defective.  But I had no trouble returning it and getting a new one.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush at a lower cost.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> It cleans my teeth very well.  It took me a little bit to figure out what the 30 second signal felt like, but I&#x27;m slow like that.  ;)  Good product, great price.</li>
    <li> Moved up from Oral B Vitality to this once it stopped holding a charge after 5 years. I was impressed with the longevity and that brush kept my teeth in good shape (Dentist check ups were always good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this has the same motor as the 3k and 5k series, just without the bells and whistles - so to me it made sense to stick with the cheaper version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is incredibly powerful and after a few weeks I&#x27;m just getting used to the vibs this thing puts out. I don&#x27;t grind the brush against my teeth but it has shaken my eyeballs before and buzzes your jaw a bit. There is some technique to be had with a stronger motor however and I&#x27;ve gotten it to a point where it doesn&#x27;t bother me so much. Your sensitivity may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works well and cleans very deep, living up to its title. Even when you teeth feel and look clean, almost every night I feel it knock stuff out between my teeth while brushing, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. It&#x27;s lighter and a bit slimmer than my old brush, it feels good in your hand and I have no problems reaching the back of my mouth with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only feature I don&#x27;t like about it is the bright green pulse it produces while it&#x27;s charging. Obviously it&#x27;s in the bathroom and not bothering me while I sleep but it can literally light up a dark bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very please with its performance using this style of brush head and would purchase this again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! It makes my mouth feel very clean</li>
    <li> Excelent and reasonably priced. I bought this as a replacement to my Braun 3D Excel electric toothbrush which lasted 10 years. It is compatible with older Braun brush heads (rotary type) although this one also accommodates the new vibrating-type heads.</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush ... arrived promptly ... good price</li>
    <li> Through research of the information on the oral b website i believe this is the best model to buy. 5 stars because of price, simplicity of use, power and no useless modes. Dont get suckered to buy more expensive models.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush was what I wanted for birthday. Actually, my wife bought it for me. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I am not new to the electric toothbrushes.  I have a Sonicare Diamond, but it does not seem to clean as good as the Triaction. Oral-B&#x27;s do seem cheaply made compared to the sonicare products though. It is loud.</li>
    <li> Had a previous Oral B brush but it did not keep charge very well.  This one works great and was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel amazing after I brush my teeth. The heads of the toothborush are universal so there are s many types of heads to choose for which is what I love. Product is nice and durable. Feels nice to hold and great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to set up&lt;br /&gt;Good clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
    <li> This brush works better than described. Very powerful and accepts all oral-B brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have a brush holder.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrushes my whole life.  Every time I go to the dentist they say I should switch to a electric toothbrush.  Well I finally decided to try it and I can notice a real difference.  My teeth now have that smooth dentist fresh feeling and I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in months.  Hopefully the dentist will notice also and not give me the speech about brushing better.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best investments I have made for my oral care. I had not had an electric toothbrush before and when I saw it was on sale I figured I&#x27;d suck it up and buy one. This brush gives almost the equivalent of the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feel that everyone desires. My teeth feel clean and polished all the time and I will not be going back to a manual toothbrush anytime soon. For the price, it offers a substantial brushing experience that is markedly better than average. I have not tried a high-end Sonicare brush before so I cannot attest that it provides the best clean that money can buy but the Deep Sweep more than gets the job done for me. If you&#x27;re ready to upgrade from a manual brush but not ready to spend over $100 on a professional cleaning experience this will probably be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Great, works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the price and because on the Oral B name.  I was not disappointed.  I have been using this for several months now and am very satisfied.  Good value for the money</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price, I really enjoy the way this toothbrush feels and really believe I&#x27;m getting more cleaning than manual brushing</li>
    <li> Recently switched from my Sonicare to this OralB model.  I noticed a cleaner mouth after the first brushing.  Simple design but unfortunately no cap for the brush.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush (unlike the ones with the rotating or sliding heads) actually moves the bristles side to side. Its a wonderfully natural replacement to a manual one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B electric battery in handle dual head bio-directional toothbrush for about ten years. Not the same one of course. I found them to be very durable and reliable. The replacement heads were always priced reasonably. Rather than using one brush 2-3 times per day, I always interspersed the electric brush use with a manual brushing with hand held brushes I had evaluated as the most effective manual brush head configurations based on authentic reviews that I could find. My Oral-B electric model had the circular oscillation brush above the horizontally triangular brush below it. I have always been confident I was using the most effective use of technology and just plain elbow grease with manual brushing possible. Oh, and by the way, I&#x27;ve had several gum surgeries to save as many of my teeth as possible since my problems reared their ugly heads in my early thirties. Gum care is what I am an expert on!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting to the chase. I was impressed by the TV commercial for this product. As I have done dozens and dozens of times, I pulled the Amazon reviews from real people like me about its performance. The reviews were exemplary enough so that a person like myself in their 60&#x27;s on the border of losing a crapload of their remaining teeth due to age, not care, was something I had to pay attention to. The superlative reviews are all true. The power and results of this amazing instrument startled my senses and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAZZAM! I could not have possibly anticipated the power and effectiveness of the 21st century power of this invention without actually trying it. I cannot recommend this dynamo of cleaning effectiveness enough. It literally doubled the power of my battery powered 10 yr technology hand-held to an unbelievable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve trashed my manual toothbrushes. I use this absolute pleasure of effective cleaning 2-3 times per day. As a person with periodontal issues for many years, I can only admit I wish I had discovered this instrument earlier in my life. Do not hesitate to order this absolutely new and innovative way to scrub your choppers and bring your gum health to a pristine level of sanitation.red this instrument earlier in my life. Do not hesitate to order this absolutely new and innovative way to scrub your choppers and bring your gum health to a pristine level of sanitation.</li>
    <li> I wish the handle were a bit more &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; so that one could hold it more firmly. It tends to slip around in one&#x27;s hand when it gets wet.  Otherwise I like the Oral-B very much.</li>
    <li> It gives a vigorous scrubbing and it reaches the hard-to-reach surfaces (like the inside fronts of both upper and lower) of my teeth.  I am happy I changed to this brand of electric toothbrush.  I am equally happy with the affordable pricing.  I used a pricier Sonicare for years, and that brand kept obsoleting it&#x27;s brush heads, so I gave up and moved to Oral-B.  I recommend this Oral-B model and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Only been a month, but so far so good. I feel like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Great product, stops working if u r using to much force. Takes a while to fully charge for the first time</li>
    <li> There is now sufficient evidence from trials that using an electric toothbrush is better for you than a standard brush - although much of the benefit comes from the &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; options - helping you remember to brush for at least 2 minutes. Broadly however the category is getting more an more clogged up by more and more &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; toothbrushes with options that you don&#x27;t really need, at a higher price point. Studies do not show a correlation between brush speed and cleanliness - effectively faster is not necessarily better. Different brushing modes are also not that important - most people will just use one setting all the time. &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; mode is just a slower brushing speed - not really relevant, if you are hurting your gums you are either applying too much pressure or using a brush head that is too hard for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Sweep is really all most people should need, an electric toothbrush with a timer, a wide variety of replacement brush heads that are not too expensive, and a pressure sensor that warns you if you are overenthusiastic. Battery life is excellent and the brush is very easy to use. One button, on and off. Good ergonomics. Waterproof. A small travel case would be a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Sweep head this brush comes with is in my opinion the best in Braun&#x27;s lineup - the closest to a standard toothbrush. Personally I get a little frustrated with the tiny round brush heads available on most electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a coupon or on promotion, the brush is occasionally available for less than half the original price. Great deal not to be missed.</li>
    <li> If no coupon offer, it is bit too pricey....</li>
    <li> Best value for money brushes. good comfortable dental care !!</li>
    <li> Love it, I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I never had an electric brush before ,and now I&amp;#34;ll never be without one.This thing is GREAT I&amp;#34;m kind of lazy about brushing so in the same time this brush does 3 times the job I use to do....</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about this brush, Once done brushing I feel like I just left the Dentist office, teeth are very clean, hits all the hard to reach spots and doesn&#x27;t hurt the gums.</li>
    <li> I had to replace the one that was lost &amp; chose the same brand because of the price &amp; quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve replaced a dying expensive Philips sonicare pro with this and couldn&#x27;t be happier. At a fraction of the price I was concerned that my dentist would notice a difference but he said my teeth and gums still look great!</li>
    <li> I drink a pot of coffee a day. This is the first toothbrush I have owned that truly shows a marked difference, week after week, on my coffee-stained teeth. If you have staining, this will help a lot, especially if combined with Rembrandt&#x27;s D Toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love my new toothbrush.  The battery would no longer hold a charge in my previous Oral B toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I do miss the 2 speed from the old brush.&lt;br /&gt;C Nelson</li>
    <li> AFTER CHARGING IT UP&lt;br /&gt; IT SEEN TO FEEL THE NEED FOR MORE POWER&lt;br /&gt; LIKE THE BATTERY THAT WAS CHARGED NEEDED NORE POWER TO THE BRUSH&lt;br /&gt; SEEMS EVERYTHING OUT HERE IS SOUND WAVES NOE THIS WAS THE ONLY THING I COULS FIND THAT WAS LIKE A POWER TOOTH BRUSH LACKING POWER&lt;br /&gt;  I SAY THAT BECAUSE THEY WATCH SO MUCH HOW IT WORKS THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE KEYS IN IT AND LET IT DO THE JOB FOR IT SELF BRUSH YOUR TEETH I NEAN IS THAT NOT WHAT THEY ARE AFTER&lt;br /&gt; LOOKING FOR A ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH RECHARGABLE SEEMS THE BATTERY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER  OH IT WORKS BUT ITS NEW  AND COMES WITH A HOLE I TOOTH BRUSH BIG FEAL  I LOOK ON FOR SOMETHING BETTER THIS IS NOT IT FOR ME&lt;br /&gt; TRUTH IS IM NOT HAPPY WITH IT&lt;br /&gt; GT THAT FELLING BOY I WISH IT HAD A LARGER BATTERY&lt;br /&gt; FEELS LOKE IT WILL NOT LAST FOR LONG  STILL FELL THE BATTERY IS GOING TO LET ME DOWN  FORTHESE REASONS I DONT LOKE IT&lt;br /&gt; SEEMS LIKE ITS THE ONLY THING AROUND  CANT SEAM TO GET ONE OF THOES RECHARGABLE TOOTH BRUSHES LIKE THEY SOLD TWO YEARS AGO&lt;br /&gt; EVERY THING IS IH TECK&lt;br /&gt; IT BRUSHES THEN IT STOPS TO TELL YOU OH TOMETO BRUSH SOMEPLACE ELSE&lt;br /&gt; WELL WHEN IT COOKS FOR ME THEN BUT NOW  I WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN&lt;br /&gt; VERY DISAPOINTED IN IT  RATH USE A PLAIN TOOTH BRUSH THINK I WAISTED MY MONEY  THINK IT SHOULD HAVE A BIGGER BATTERY ON THE UNIT  OK I DONT LIKE IT&lt;br /&gt; I GUESS YOU PICKED THAT UP  BUT ITS THE ONLY THING OUT THERE THATS EVEN LIKE A TOOTH BRUSH ALL THE OTHER VIBRATE YOUR HEAD OFF HATE THEM TOO&lt;br /&gt; ILL USE A REGULAR TOOTH BRUSH ANS SAVE MONEY TIME AND TOOTH PAST TOO</li>
    <li> Works great. Cleans very well especially the back. The price was the deciding factor when looking at the Oral B &amp; Sonicare. Read reviews on both and does just as good a job as the Sonicare. Louder than my old Sonicare but am used to it now.</li>
    <li> it can clean my teeth. but  there&#x27;s some problem with the charger.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really enjoy these toothbrushes.  The recharging station is small, works great, and is easy to clean.  I like how it vibrates every 30 seconds (or so) so you can know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing each part of your teeth.</li>
    <li> I had one of their lesser models (I forget the name) for years and loved it. WHen I ran out of replacement brushes I decided to try a better model rather than replace the brushes. Using this thing is a little like munching on an orbital sander. I feel like it&#x27;s going to rip out my fillings if I&#x27;m not careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One strange issue is every 30 seconds the motor will stall/pause for a second or two. I didn&#x27;t read the instructions so maybe it&#x27;s some kind of timer alert. Whatever it is, I find it annoying. It gives the impression something is not working correctly.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt as clean as they are now.  I love this toothbrush.  This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the second powered brush I have bought since the first gen Sonicare(yeah mine lasted like 7-8 years!!) But this one is way better. If you brush too hard it shuts some of the functions off to let you instantly know you are brushing too hard. I really like it. The small size and great performance really appeals to me. My teeth feel amazing.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush I may have ever bought. Battery don&#x27;t last as long as they say for me, but I also brush longer than 2 minutes</li>
    <li> Oral B has one of the best toothbrushes on the market.  It takes a few days getting used to but it definitely works great.</li>
    <li> Legit. Does a great job and much stronger than my previous electric brush. I would recommend. The price is amazing for what it does in terms of actually cleaning your teeth to the point you can actually tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush my husband has ever used he says.</li>
    <li> gives a sound after each 30 seconds, very handy to know when to go to the next quadrant. does not shut off after 2 minutes. my first electric...i really like it</li>
    <li> There is a lot of action here so it gets the job done faster than the older designs. Some other products just buzz in your mouth. The slight pauses are of no benefit and I would like the on/off button to be more prominent but over all I&#x27;m pleased with this mechanical device.</li>
    <li> I was .very careful using it for several weeks.  It chipped my front tooth.  I have strong teeth  so this was a surprise.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Very easy to use and efficient to clean. Five stars!</li>
    <li> Works great. Very happy with is</li>
    <li> If you buy one of these remember to start it whole in your mouth. Otherwise it will splatter water/saliva all over your walls and mirror! (Also shut it off before taking it out of your mouth.)</li>
    <li> I received this product on Tuesday. Two days later the toothbrush is still not charged. It seems as though the battery is defective. The product was new and is essentially unusable. Thoroughly disappointed. Cannot say anything positive since I never even got to use the toothbrush. I foresee myself having trouble with getting a replacement since I did not preserve the original packaging.</li>
    <li> Solid buy.  Gets the job done.  Pricing is on point.  No complaints so far.  I would certainly recommend to my friends and family for their oral hygiene needs.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it should, just not quite as powerful as I thought it would be. I like it though</li>
    <li> I bought the Oral-B because it seemed a very good deal and my old sonicare needed replacing. Terrible idea. The Oral-B has a harsh vibration and feels clumsy. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it does as good a job as the sonicare and I am ditching this and getting another sonicare.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and great toothbrush. I love the feel of it and the size of the head. I wish it came with a travel case like the other brands but in all its a great item.</li>
    <li> Works well, does a nice job at a good price. Does everything you need without all the worthless bells &amp; whistles, like multi speeds and worthless times.</li>
    <li> Although a little louder that the Sonicare the Oral B wins in every other regard. We bought 3 and couldn&#x27;t be happier after 10 years and 2 models of Sonicare.</li>
    <li> After reading the glowing reviews below, I purchased this product through Amazon.  The product feels tinny and cheap and makes a lot of noise.  I&#x27;m a big guy with a medium size mouth, but the brush head feels very large, and the bristles feel too large and stiff.  Two minutes of this in your mouth, and you&#x27;ll be bleeding regardless of your gum condition.  This one goes in the trash.</li>
    <li> Its only for US. In Europe dont work!! ATENTION!!    The price its great, but I live in europe and the charger  its only for US.  I dont understand why dont work in two norms (110v and 220v), because its made in germany.  Normally a item like that must work in 110V and 220V, because the travelers, like the chargers of smartphones and computers.    Now I cannot use this item :(    Nothing its saying in the description!!!    UNBOXING LINK: [...]</li>
    <li> Took forever to charge the first time (like 36 hours?), but then it ran for almost 2 weeks before needing a recharge. Seems to work well on my teeth. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Been using Braun electric toothbrushes for over 20 years, just go to the dentist for regular cleanings, period. Chalk it up to Braun. Bought this one for my son who has new braces, the toothbrush is awesome and quiet. Neat sweeping pattern, too.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have used many powered toothbrushes. I I am very pleased that this one works much better than the others.</li>
    <li> I was a Sonicare user for over 5 years. My boyfriend would use my Sonicare when he spent the night. It was tedious changing the head constantly but he is worth it. My boyfriend and I were watching a commercial for this toothbrush and so I decided to get him this because it was cheaper than the Sonicare. He got it and he says he wants to brush his teeth 4 times a day because he loves the way it makes his teeth feel. Ironically a week after he got it my Sonicare stopped charging, so I am ordering a new WOW toothbrush! Doing research on this the disposable heads are quite less as well. So it is a money saving, great, affordable electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It has a 2 minute timer like the Sonicare does but after 30 seconds it vibrates different to let you know to switch sections of your mouth. This is freaky at first!</li>
    <li> Simple yet effective. Just on and off with 30sec reminders which are very useful! Recommended to anyone wanting a simple electric toothbrush. Compact charging station too, so good for travelling.</li>
    <li> Needed another for my wife.  good price.</li>
    <li> My old plain and simple Oral B stopped working after more than 10 years. So I decided to go with pretty much the same model. This one does the trick. Simple design, small charging station, attractive color and more important I can use the same brushes I had bought for my older one. The old one buzzed once after 2min of brushing whereas this one does buzz after each 30sec.</li>
    <li> If the company hadn&#x27;t introduced a serious flaw by penny-pinching on the internal battery, this would have been the top travel brush of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you brush twice a day, which dentists recommend and I do, these miss the boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recharging time is over 14 hours every week, making it impossible to brush before bed and then again in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Oral-B for skimping on the battery!</li>
    <li> Love it. Great price. Wish i would have had it a long time ago. Had other mfg but broke couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it until now</li>
    <li> This seems to be an excellent product. Deep cleaning and very effective.  I love the power.</li>
    <li> I purchased based on the glowing reviews, but was greatly disappointed. Does not clean my teeth anywhere near as well as Phillips Sonicare&#x27;s that we have or have had. Brushing your tongue makes it slow to a crawl. 60 day money back guarantee from Oral B requires that all original packaging must be kept, and you must pay for return shipping. Since it comes with only 1 brush head, I purchased more, which are an additional loss.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> It met all my expectations except the brush head is smaller than I would have liked, performed adequately over all</li>
    <li> As many of the people in my generation have been given permanent retainers or metal support bars, we know its hard to clean back there and get the food out from behind the bar. This toothbrush makes that very easy with its multi directional movement and the vibration, the food just falls out. What used to take me 20 min now takes 2</li>
    <li> No frills or options, one speed, works great.</li>
    <li> feels like a mini jackhammer but does a fabulous job of cleaning my teeth</li>
    <li> I had a couple of Oral-B tooth brushes but this is the one with the longest battery life by far. It kept the charge a week. I use it twice a day 5 minutes ( 2x ) my older one is empty after 3 days, great improvement !!</li>
    <li> I have had other sonic brushes before (left one in a hotel) but this just does not measure up to others.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> If you just want a good, basic electric toothbrush at a good price, buy this.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. I have been spoiled by the more expensive brands and actually stopped using them for a while and went back to the normal toothbrush. Picked this up to see if I wanted to get back into the habit of using an electric and now wish that I would have just purchased the more advanced, expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is no &#x27;ding&#x27; on the product itself it does work great and does a great job brushing although it may be a little too aggressive for some users that would prefer a sensitive option.</li>
    <li> After using many electrical toothbrushes, this is the first time I feel my teeth are truly getting cleaned. I don&#x27;t need the programmed stops to change quadrants, but I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> I am sure there was nothing wrong with the brush itself but it was incompatible with the electric plugs and voltage in Australia so I had to return it and buy one here. If Amazon sends electrical goods out internationally they need to ensure that the product is compatible.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral B Electric toothbrush. After 5 years and numerous daily uses, the first one could not&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;press the First Alert button&amp;#34; and died. Braun products are very reliable and look sleek and modern.&lt;br /&gt;I have their electric shaver too and the Braun products are dependable. Very good selling price, too.&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth, gums and mouth do feel cleaner/fresher after using this product. I&#x27;m very happy with the Braun Company.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a 7 year old Oral-B Triumph. It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles but I found I never used all those &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; anyway. This unit is thinner and lighter but seems to have the same amount of power. Some folks don&#x27;t like the brush head but I really think it&#x27;s a matter of preference - I like it a lot. You&#x27;re gonna need to buy new brush heads in a couple months anyway, so get whichever one&#x27;s you like - Floss Action would be my second choice if ya like the smaller round heads. Other reviewers have mentioned that it splatters everywhere. You need to put it in your mouth BEFORE you turn it on! Just like any other electric brush - they all work the same. Works great for me anyway and a lot less expensive than others that have options you&#x27;ll probably never use.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy this earlier? Good and clean feeling after use. I still need to read instructions as I&#x27;m not totally sure what all of the features are.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and does what I need it to do without those extra add-ons that triple its price. I also like the tactile feedback when it&#x27;s time to change quadrants.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Tooth brush exacting what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works well, however, quite noisy. Charge seems to last for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Good product cleans well. Appears to be quite robust.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so I don&#x27;t know how it stacks up against other models or brands.  I chose this one because it had the features I thought I would need most (timer and universal fit for brush heads) I will say that It works perfectly for my needs. My teeth only feel this clean after leaving the dentist.  I like that it holds a charge over several days of use and that it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand.  Wish I had gotten one of these years ago.</li>
    <li> My teeth absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush. I switched from a standard non power brush so I don&#x27;t know what the other features this one doesn&#x27;t have are like.</li>
    <li> This Oral-B Professional works much better than the one I bought a year ago.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday, so the jury is obviously still out on the effectiveness and reliability of the Deep Sweep 1000.  It seems good enough so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef is that the manufacturer decided not to include a small, inexpensive piece of plastic that wraps around the charging stand for brush head storage.  It&#x27;s described in the product literature (with the disclaimer &amp;#34;depending on model), but it&#x27;s not in the box.  So if a convenient, hygienic place to put the brush head is important to you, avoid model # D16.513.U (if possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other, less relevant beef is that Oral-B / Braun keeps discontinuing items that I would buy again, given the chance.  This is my third different electric toothbrush model in 6 years.  The best one was called the Pulsonic, but it has disappeared from the face of the earth...</li>
    <li> This is a great little machine from a company that usually builds the best products within its own market.  It&#x27;s a very vigorous experience brushing one&#x27;s teeth with this rechargeable toothbrush, the proof of which is seen in the mirror with one&#x27;s first morning smile.  The second one I&#x27;ve had over about four years.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an old Braun which I really liked.  I am amazed at how clean my teeth are.  It feels like I just had a dental hygienist clean my teeth.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have used the Sonicare toothbrush that I got as a kid in the early 2000s, and I found that the quality of plaque removal has been steadily dropping for some time. I guess this is to be expected for a electric tooth brush that&#x27;s over 10 years old, but I decided that it was time for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Deep Sweep 1000 for Christmas, and I have never been happier. My brushing habits for the past few months have not been up to par. I started using the Deep Sweep on Christmas Day with a dentist appointment on New Years Eve. When I started using it I knew that my gums had become over sensitive since flossing had started causing bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I had my cleaning appointment, the hygienist and dentist couldn&#x27;t complement me enough on how clean my teeth were. The hygienist told me that it looked like my teeth had recently been professionally cleaned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this tooth brush enough, although the more expensive one would be nice with its timer and such, but all that is unnecessary. Buy this tooth brush and never have your dentist ask you how often your floss or brush again!</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush to replace another Oral-B brush that I had for many (over 10) years that finally had the battery fail. I like that it takes a lot of different heads including some leftover from my last brush. The brush seems more powerful than the last one I had and I like that it has four intermittent signals of 30 seconds each which lets you do upper front and back and lower front and back quadrants equally. I was pleased with the older brush but like the new one even better.</li>
    <li> by no means not the best price. but works like an expensive ones. The charge holds for a week + if you are a single user.Cleans teeth like after a visit to the dentist office if you use one of the whitener toothpaste. Pretty soon the dentist will be out of jobs because they can not exorbitant prize for whitening your teeth!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try to be brief because I know some of you guys do not like to read long-winded reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Like you visited the Dentist, super clean feeling of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, intuitive. (doesn&#x27;t even require reading the instructions but you should)&lt;br /&gt;Brush head design doesn&#x27;t allow for mold growth.  No cleaning inside or underneath like Sonicare&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Brush heads are cheaper than competitors (3 for the same price as with Sonicare for 2 brush heads).&lt;br /&gt;Good grip.&lt;br /&gt;2-minute warning telling you that you are done brushing (but you can continue if you want).&lt;br /&gt;Nice colors, easy on the eyes.  Very uniform and neutral.&lt;br /&gt;After three uses, I already see improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Breath stays fresh longer (seriously!)&lt;br /&gt;You can brush the tongue too and it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt even for the most sensitive teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Sweep Triaction is more effective then \\&quot;circular motion.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Easy to charge.  Dock and use.  Do a full charge at least once every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Solid, practical features.  None of the unneeded features that passes the cost onto the customer.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the back-row teeth won&#x27;t damage the inner walls of your mouth any longer!  I use to have to reach far back with a regular manual toothbrush and I ended up inflaming the inner (back) part of my mouth just to get a decent clean.&lt;br /&gt;Small brush head that more than covers any tooth and easy to reach the back end teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.  I highly recommend this product for anyone that is looking to go Electric Toothbrush.  You do not need to buy the more expensive model at all.  You can even use different brush heads with this model 1000 (research into it, sorry).  There are different brush heads that you can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it performs at 20,000 brush strokes per minute.  Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.  But that&#x27;s a HUGE improvement (understatement) over using a regular toothbrush manually.  Why invest in a toothbrush per week?  That&#x27;s more expensive than buying this electric toothbrush that does a much better job at cleaning your teeth without the headache, frustration, and lack of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must-buy if you care about your oral hygiene and health.re expensive than buying this electric toothbrush that does a much better job at cleaning your teeth without the headache, frustration, and lack of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must-buy if you care about your oral hygiene and health.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I would purchase again! the description for this product is exactly what it says it is</li>
    <li> It does hold a charge for days and it is powerful enough to get all those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> A great little toothbrush. I wish it would stop after 2 minutes but it just keeps on going.</li>
    <li> i always wasted too much time brushing my tooth, i brush it too long!&lt;br /&gt;this toothbrush will briefly pause every 30 seconds to let you know it&#x27; time to brush the other side of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;it also have a led light that will blink red when it&#x27; time to recharge the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;this toothbrush also works with any type/style Oral-B head, that&#x27; a good thing cus you bought bulk heads at costco!  haha</li>
    <li> Strong cleaning and the timing function ensures that you get your 2 minutes in each time you use.  Will improve your oral health.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, high rating the low price justified.</li>
    <li> Great value. Does a very good job.</li>
    <li> This works really well, I especially like being able to time how long you brush.</li>
    <li> We are old oral B users and when my husband&#x27;s died, I begun my research on Amazon reading the reviews, comparing prices and information about electric toothbrushes since it had been awhile since we purchased one.  Since our hygienist said both top brands were great at cleaning teeth and preventing gum disease, which my husband has dealt with and since we were used to the back and forth and not the circular movement, we picked the deep sweep and my husband is very pleased.  Common sense tells you to put it in your mouth first and turn it on and that worked great and prevented the water from spraying everywhere.  He said it is a strong back and forth movement and makes him feel that it is really cleaning well!  We recommend this electric toothbrush and buying it from Amazon with the coupon.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm to keep teeth clean!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! buy it here!  i needed one TODAY and spent over $20 more a big box store.  That said, this is crazy awsome.  I am cheap cheap cheap and never would be so darn excited about an expensive toothbrush head 100% worth the creat clean feeling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK - I read a review that suggested that the more expensive models where mostly marketing hype with no foundation to support the benefits claims - with which I agree. That said I suspect I should have gone up a model and gotten one that runs at 8,000 - this one only goes 4,000 rpm. I think the Sonic is a better unit but agree with my hygienist that these brush heads are better (floss and interproxal) for my needs.</li>
    <li> Brought it as a gift for Father&#x27;s Day. He had a Oral-B for years and it went out. So I got this one for him and he says that it&#x27;s better than the one he had. So I am buying me one.</li>
    <li> Saw it on TV.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant to use as it seems to massage your gums.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has the most power of any toothbrush I have owned. My teeth and gums have amazed my hygienist and my dentist since I started using it.</li>
    <li> My husband is not thrilled with his new Oral-B Deep Sweep Traction toothbrush.  He feels as though he is taking a shower rather than brushing his teeth.  Liked his old Oral-B electric toothbrush much better.</li>
    <li> I will make this short and to the point. I have used electric tooth brushes for over 10 years. I started with the high dollar, expensive brushes which in my opinion were no better than the cheaper ones. I gravitated to the Oral B rechargeable $15 brushes that seemed to do a reasonable job. However when it came time to replace my second unit, I found that it was no longer available. I didn&#x27;t want to have to change out batteries and I didn&#x27;t want to spend my life savings on a new toothbrush so I finally &amp;#34;settled on the 1000 ad a compromise. I was extremely surprised. This brush is very thorough. Unlike others that I have used, it doesn&#x27;t require any scrubbing on my part. It actually feels very good on my teeth and gums. I love the design of the stand/charger. Instead of fitting in the stand, it sits on top making it far easier to keep clean. Perhaps the more expensive brushes have improved in their technology. Nut for 50 bucks, this brush is a pleasure. I look forward to using it for many years.</li>
    <li> I like the up and down action as opposed to the usual rotary.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use but like my old Oral B better.  This one really makes a mess if you take out of your mouth. I know don&#x27;t take it out of your mouth but sometimes slips out.  I don&#x27;t like the way it tells you to move to different area all the time. My old one just lets you brush all areas and has one tone at the end of the time.</li>
    <li> Love the way it brushes my teeth. Only complaint is the power button is so small and recessed that I have trouble shutting it off.</li>
    <li> I like this 2 minute auto brushing which is built in, its streamline Handel and powerful brush head cleaner. However this brushhead it cane with is too heavy and hard on my teeth. I will still be able to purchase a more sensitive brush heads for OralB that&#x27;s the beauty of this product.</li>
    <li> This product definitely cleans teeth well but it QUITE strong.  It made my gums very sore after the first few uses and I had to stop using it for a few days, then alternate with manual brushing for a few days until now I can use it 2x/day without issue. There is NO way to adjust the intensity, one simple on/off button only. It is LOUD, really loud, especially compared to the sonicare I had previously - something to consider if you&#x27;ll be using it near someone that&#x27;s sleeping. I was disappointed that the product did NOT come with a travel cap for the brush like the sonicare does, so basically no way to keep the brush head clean/protected when traveling. I also find the brush head quite large as is the &amp;#34;stem&amp;#34; of the brush head. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product for someone with a small mouth or trouble opening their jaw really wide.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the design of the brush, but the charging base seems to accumulate a lot of grime, even with rinsing the brush head under water while running post-brushing. The brush head pops off easily for cleaning thankfully but I&#x27;ve been surprised how messy the base was with only 1-2 weeks of use. Good clean but not recommended for people who need a more gentle brush (look at sonicare), really should come with travel cap, and could be quieter.</li>
    <li> This was the best electric toothbrush that I have had. The replaceable head is also really nice. If you have sensitive teeth and gums this head won&#x27;t bother them. It does take a few days to get your mouth accustomed to an electric toothbrush. I like that you can get any oral-b head and it will work with this toothbrush. The 30 second timer is a really nice feature. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that it had no cap for the head so I got one of the toothbrush caps from the grocery store. I highly recommend this for someone starting out with electric toothbrushes. You don&#x27;t need all of the fancy stuff that comes with a $100 - $200 toothbrush. My teeth feel just like I was at the dentist. This is worth every inexpensive penny.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!!  The 3-way speed selector s very useful, as is the 15-second notification, so one can move to the next dental quadrant.  Feels like the brush my dental hygienist uses. My teeth are whiter, without having to use a harsh, abrasive paste.  Great price, too....</li>
    <li> The action is very severe.  Should have ordered a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; product.  I made a poor choice.  I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, delivery was early. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is interesting from the first use and does an amazing job of cleaning your teeth.  I prefer this brushing action to any other on the market.  The base accommodates many other heads if you prefer them!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and this is the first time she is using an electric tooth brush. She likes it very much.</li>
    <li> We had a Philips Sonicare before this which wore out after several years...and I am returning the Oral-B Deep Sweep to buy a new Sonicare. This thing really feels like using a piece of machinery in your mouth. Like a reciprocating saw for your face. Some of the more handyman types out there might appreciate this, but we found it too aggressive. I actually could feel the end of my nose wiggling when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think I&#x27;m some kind of wimp that can&#x27;t handle a powerful toothbrushing experience, then the other problem factoring into our decision to return this one is that the heads are rather large. We both found it difficult to open our mouths wide enough to get the working surface of our back molars (and my wife kept her wisdom teeth, so she has to go back pretty far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe these things are not a deal-breaker for you. For us, yeah (though I am disappointed to be back to the expensive Sonicare replacement heads).</li>
    <li> shakes my whole head.  not as good as the sonic care</li>
    <li> Since this was a Braun product, I thought I would be buying something that would last.  However, the button that turns the toothbrush on quit working after 31 days.  Amazon will not honor a refund after 30 days.  Very disappointed in the product and with Amazon.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush offers more cleaning power.  I felt like my teeth were much cleaner and the gums healthier after a few days of use.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this brush is the way it vibrates every 30 seconds to let me know to switch quadrants.  It takes 18 hours to charge.</li>
    <li> Not as quiet or smooth as some of Oral Bs other models.</li>
    <li> Really good - a real improvement over what I thought was still a good toothbrush. Glad I finally got a new one!</li>
    <li> These are classic electric toothbrushes. Durable, dependable, good all around.....  Charge lasts a week for 1 person and you can also fit the rotary old style heads.&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> I got this because the sonicare I was using seemed to vibrate SO fast that it didn&#x27;t seem to move at all.  I can feel this one working and notice the difference in the cleanness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> An excellent value and works great.  I will buy another</li>
    <li> Have no Idea why anyone would use a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Decent toothbrush. I&#x27;d recommend it, but nothing amazing.</li>
    <li> Worth it!&lt;br /&gt;And the best thing is that there are knock off brush heads out there. So if you buy Oral-B you aren&#x27;t stuck with buying insanely expensive replacement brush heads.</li>
    <li> Recommended at my last dental visit</li>
    <li> This sucks, brushes way too hard. If you take it out of your mouth it slings tooth paste up to 4 feet away, makes a huge mess. i bought different attachments for it but i still prefer the other electric ones you get from acme instead.</li>
    <li> Great brush-charging base is easy to use and keep plugged in without getting in the way and is one of the best value for money rechargeable toothbrushes I could find online.</li>
    <li> I does all I expected and more.  A new type head for me, and it seems to really work well</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;ve only ever had Phillips electric toothbrushes. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try after my last Philips was somewhat of a lemon and as far as I was concerned, this was the only one comparable in the price range. Well, if it was my first or only option, maybe I&#x27;d like it, but I doubt it. I liked many features about it, however, I hated the vibrations in my mouth. Compared to my Phillips, this thing has no precision, feels like a mini jackhammer. Sorry, but the Phillips is more refined with pinpoint accuracy. The good news is Oral-B had a trial period with a reimbursement of no questions asked return. Well I took them up on that &amp; they came through. So, I guess it&#x27;s worth a try. However, if you&#x27;ve had a Phillips in the past, don&#x27;t switch teams now...</li>
    <li> I love this electric toothbrush. I have used a lot of electric toothbrushes. This one is the best. After you use it your mouth &amp; teeth feel and look great. Great but also.</li>
    <li> I have used these toothbrushes now for years, cannot be without, best thing since 7 Up...thanks to Oral-B...</li>
    <li> This was an inexpensive toothbrush, but works extremely well.  I especially like the timer so I am sure my teeth get a thorough brushing.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s high quality product and can clean the teeth deeply and make the teeth smooth after cleaning. Rechargeable device is specially good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he has gum problems.  I use it as much as he does!  There are several different replacement heads that fit it.  My teeth feel like they were professionally cleaned.</li>
    <li> Wish I had not purchased. Threw out.</li>
    <li> For an Oral B, this one is all one needs for the price.  I have a couple of the more expensive ones and they all do the same thing...  brush your teeth with rotating heads.  The bristles do need to be changed out every couple months.  The company says every month, but just like a auto shop will tell you to change the oil every 3000 miles, that&#x27;s not true.  If you don&#x27;t mahs the brush against your teeth, the bristles will last longer.  I do like the way the heads change out in this model too.  That&#x27;s a definate plus.  Oh, and DON&#x27;T buy the cheaper off brand heads in the multi pak for cheap.  They are truly cheap and krap.</li>
    <li> Sure, you can get other Oral-Bs with more bells-and-whistles (I own a total of four), but there&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with this model provided you want normal no-frills toothbrushing.  What&#x27;s more important is what kind of brush head you use.  I like the Floss Action (as, apparently, does Consumer Reports).  Yes, these Oral-Bs need occasional cleaning themselves, which is relatively easy.  As Oral-B will tell you, don&#x27;t use excessive pressure while brushing, ensure you brush all four quadrants, use a &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34; toothpaste (and you won&#x27;t need much), and change the brush heads as needed.  NOTE:  My Oral-B would not hold a charge as of Feb 2015...lasted about four days and took forever to fully charge.  Guess this is what happens when you buy a cheap Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied, with the product, the price and the seller. I do recommend this product. The toothbrush seems to do a good job and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my 10+ year old Oral-B electric toothbrush and purchased this electric toothbrush. I was looking for something simple with a nice small charger. This toothbrush fit the bill and works excellently.</li>
    <li> Great electrical toothbrush, been using it back and forth between my traditional tooth brush depending how much time I&#x27;ve got. It charges withing a few hours or less as far as I know. I&#x27;ll update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Very good deal for the price. I found 30 seconds timer is very helpful for brushing.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Handle and stand are fine but I whish it had a little smaller brush head.  Not having some adjustment on the speed or power (mode) is not good though, I would try the 5000 if/when I need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Compact design; powerful teeth cleaner.</li>
    <li> Had this for one month -- one day past the return window it shuts off and doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a good job cleaning my teeth, but the included brush is long, making it difficult to not make a mess while brushing all of my teeth.  You can optionally buy smaller brushes.</li>
    <li> my first electric toothbrush. wish i had bought one long ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using an Oral-Bj rechargeable toothbrush since they first appeared.  I love them.  When this new one was offered I had to try it.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s definitely better than my last one.  It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> Much cleaner feel my teeth using this brush. Working great.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric tooth brush, much better and more powerful than oral B vitality which my wife and I used before, I am a dentist and will recommend it to my patients.</li>
    <li> very fast action -- almost too fast</li>
    <li> I have purchased teh &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; model in the past but after the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge I saw these on sale and thought I&#x27;d try, no noticebale difference at all, dentist visits have been great since I switched to electric 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> My faithful Sonicare brush bit the dust, so I was in the market for a new electric tooth brush. After reading much info on the I-net I decided on this brush. I like it much better than the Sonicare and my teeth feel cleaner. And it is smaller and more compact than the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Good brush. A bit pricey but works great.</li>
    <li> I have never had an electric toothbrush but I love this one and would consider getting several more as gifts. It is so easy to use.....no timers or bells and whistles, just good. clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Brushes well. easy to keep clean.  Control button should have been a little bigger...hard to turn off.</li>
    <li> Great price for this rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-You can use different attachments.&lt;br /&gt;-It really cleans your teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;-Blue bristles have a back and forth motion individual from the white bristles.&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive when compared to similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Battery takes a long time to charge if you aren&#x27;t going to keep it on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;-You must clean under the attachment because liquid gets in through a hole in the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I quite like this toothbrush and I&#x27;m anxious to see what my dentist with think once he takes a look at my teeth again. In case you don&#x27;t know, it is a lot better to use an electric toothbrush. So if you want to give this one a try I don&#x27;t think you will regret it, but either way I hope you have a wonderful day and happy shopping!</li>
    <li> No complaints about this tooth brush. It works well.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush that cleaned my teeth very well. My only issue is that if you leave it on when you pull it out of your mouth it vibrates so much that it slings toothpaste all over the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is my third Oral-B mechanical tooth brush. I love the quadrant approach to brushing my teeth and the timer in the machine lets me know when to switch and when I&#x27;m done brushing by the double pulsing. I always have good dental check ups so I believe it is doing a great job for me. Also keeps my gums healthier than when I used to use a manual brush. My previous machine had a wall mount holder with a built in charger and I really liked that. Unfortunately, the charging system for that one and this new one are not compatible. So I cut the chord from the wall mount so the charger was disabled and I can still use it as a holder. I just take the brush down to charge it on the surface mounted charger provided. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> To heavy. It makes a lot of noise when you use it. My gums are sore after use. This is not like the very light and thin earlier model. I wish the would send me the light thin model I expected. Rob</li>
    <li> I got it on sale at $35 wish i could buy 2 and store it, but i don&#x27;t think the battery would perform as well. Its a solid toothbrush and holds the charge long.</li>
    <li> 5 star rating couldn&#x27;t do without my electric toothbrush love it would take it for nothing thank you very much.  Bjwolf</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to take better care of my teeth as of late, and this toothbrush (particularly the brush head) has been a big help.  Highly recommend it.  Finding replacement heads isn&#x27;t that expensive if you do your homework and not fall for those generic ones that don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I buy.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older Oral B toothbrush.  Thus far this toothbrush has been an excellent replacement.  The brushing is much more thorough than the older brush.  Unlike the previous toothbrush this one has replaceable batteries.  The users manual gives some good tips on battery care to optimize the life of the battery.  It appears that this unit is compatable with just about any brush head Oral B makes.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> As a former dentist, I can say that in my opinion it is the best - better than Sonicare. I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B for many years. This my third one. I use a simple Oral-B handbrush (The Indicator) in the morning and the electric brush at night. It works for me.</li>
    <li> The Deep Sweep is really nice when it works, but while brushing, it has moments of stopping for a short moment and them starting again.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed because of this.  I charge it when it calls for charging.  Even when it is freshly charged the momentary stops still happen.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush. My husband is in love with Oral B so I threw out the manual toothbrush and got on the bandwagon. My teeth are sensitive so it&#x27;s taken time to get used to but every time I brush I feel like I just walked out of the dentist.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe results of using this brush!  It exceeded my expectations many times.</li>
    <li> Very good brush for his price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just fine for the price.  I prefer Sonicaire, but it&#x27;s just too expensive so I opted for this Oral-B. I&#x27;m satisfied with it.  I have had it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this one over all others.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, one of the highest rated at a very reasonable price. Feels like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist!</li>
    <li> This is a must have product! Brush moves in different direction giving you a really clean feel. Much better than my older oral B. Have to have this product in the fight for healthy teeth, gums!</li>
    <li> A very solid upgrade from sub $10 electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush made me feel dizzy and lightheaded.  It moves your head as it brushes. I hate it. I just wasted my money on a toothbrush and replacements that I&#x27;ll never use.</li>
    <li> Hate the 110V only plug</li>
    <li> Appears to operate exactly as described. I subsequently bought a pack of replaceable brush heads, as the unit only came with one brush head. My wife and I are using two different style brush heads, as we have been used to the small round brushes and were not sure about this new larger head. Downgraded star rating to 4 because not yet convinced by the new large brush head supplied. Time will tell with that one, however, brush heads are interchangeable, so no real concern</li>
    <li> Works great, will wait and see how long the batteries live after multiple re-charges</li>
    <li> WOW is right with this brush. Does a great job on your teeth making them feel extreme clean and even a better job on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;This is first brush my gums actual feel better after a cleaning. The only reason for the 4 and not the 5 stars is the WOW it does on the mirror. Brushing with your mouth open is a no-no.</li>
    <li> My dentist reviewed how I brush my teeth. She recommended that I brush in little circles and angle the brush toward my gums. I&#x27;ve been brushing back and forth for my whole life, and brushing the way she recommended made by hand cramp up. I asked her about the fancy toothbrushes out on the market and she said this one would work for me. After reading as much as possible about it, and nearly all the reviews on here (good and bad), I decided the price was right and bought it. My teeth feel like the day I got them cleaned, every time I use it! It beats those tiny circles that I&#x27;m sure everyone is used to, and it has the timer to tell when to switch \\&quot;quadrants,\\&quot; and alerts me when I&#x27;ve brushed for a full 2 mins. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever brushed for 2 mins, but with this brush it feels like it&#x27;s been 20 seconds. 2 mins doesn&#x27;t seem long enough! Great brush, great value. I hope it helps put my dentist out of business ;)</li>
    <li> I use Oral-B products but thought I would try this for the action of the brush.  This gives me the best cleaning I have yet to experience short of a visit to my dentist!  Does the best job for eliminating plaque and the teeth feel really clean.</li>
    <li> While the vibrations from using the Oral-B Deep Sweep make reading while brushing teeth a near impossibility, the powerful cleaning results make this rather minor annoyance factor more than worthwhile. I&#x27;ve used many electric toothbrushes before, but never one so powerful that brushing my teeth for just two minutes would leave my teeth looking as shiny and polished as having just come back from the dental hygienist&#x27;s office! The enamel on my teeth is left looking like it&#x27;s got a mirror finish--something that never happens with any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, the Oral-B Deep Sweep does exactly what it promises with regard to cleaning beneath the gums and between teeth, utilizing a very special up-down motion in conjunction with the more typical electric toothbrush action. The first time I used this toothbrush, I was startled by the heavy vibration of this toothbrush--shaking my head around so much my vision was slightly blurred--but once I got used to it, this vibration doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Deep Sweep is the next best thing to a professional cleaning--highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This Oral-B Deep Sweep Traction 1000 electric toothbrush is made of high-quality materials and provide great cleaning.  Compared to brushing with a regular toothbrush, the Oral-B brush wins easily because it brushes quicker, cleaner, and without effort.  Just pick-up the Oral-B from the charging stand and it is ready to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on 2 minutes of twice-daily cleaning, the travel-time is listed as 7 days, which should be plenty for most people.  Even for those traveling for a longer period, the charger stand and plug is small enough to fit in any small bag or carry-on luggage without any trouble, as the stand has a very small footprint.  The device itself (made in Germany) is waterproof, durable, and built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral-B feels rock-solid in my hands, and feels quite sturdy with its rubberized grip.  One can switch out the brush-head that came with the device for another one of the many Oral-B brush-heads available.  Overall, for anyone that brushes their teeth (which should be EVERYONE), I highly recommend this Oral-B Deep Sweep Traction 1000 electric toothbrush.  You won&#x27;t regret it and your teeth will thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B (Braun) electric toothbrushes for years.  They&#x27;ve done an excellent job preventing plaque build-up and keeping my gums healthy.  I like this model better than the version that&#x27;s smaller, lighter and simply vibrates...that version is easier to use on back molars, but doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well overall.  Looking specifically at this model...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cleaning action&lt;br /&gt;Small charging stand&lt;br /&gt;Comparable with different styles of brush heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No place to put another person&#x27;s brush head&lt;br /&gt;Only single speed&lt;br /&gt;Included head will flick toothpaste absolutely everywhere if you take it out of your mouth while operating (trust me on this...)&lt;br /&gt;The base is slightly dished, which holds water after rinsing the brush.  After a week, there&#x27;s a buildup of crud that needs to be wiped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like this toothbrush.  The cons aren&#x27;t deal killers.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Amazing I recommend to any friend worth all the mony work perfect I like it a lot . . .</li>
    <li> These tooth brushes clean your teeth quite nicely- it can \\&quot;almost\\&quot; feel like you just left the dentist very clean fresh feeling and thorough. We all have one or similar one this one is for my son who does not always do a good job with the manually brush. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush cleans well.  The up and down motion of the brush head gets the job done and feels more natural than an oscillating head.  It&#x27;s also more thorough than a manual brush as well.  The size of the handle in the hand is very comfortable.  It doesn&#x27;t feel too large.  The battery life is good.  It can easily go for about a week before recharging.  This is assuming brushing twice a day for the suggested two minute per usage time frame.  But if you drain the battery to that degree, one evening may not be enough to fully recharge it.  I go for about a half a week and then recharge it.  Another thing to take note of is as you get near the end of the charge, the brush doesn&#x27;t function as well.  The sweeping action of the head slows down noticeably.  This is another reason that I charge it twice a week instead of once a week.  The only thing more that I can think to wish for are stiffer replacement brush heads. The softer heads that come with the brush get the job done.  But stiffer ones would do the job even better.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B is great..... it really cleans teeth and gums ... it will help me avoid gum disease and tooth loss at age 68. It is a little messy but brush before your shower with your shirt off.....I use an egg timer to brush the 3 minutes suggested... it seems like a long time but just keep moving the brush around until 3 minutes is up.</li>
    <li> I had an older Oral B electric toothbrush for 4 years. It had the elongated brush &amp; I loved it. However, it quit working so I ordered this version.  I must say I love the round bristle brush better &amp; my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have already recommended this product to friends and members of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other electric toothbrushes before including Sonicare and Oral-B, but with a different head. My teeth feel cleaner after using the Deep Sweep toothbrush. It feels like it brushes more vigorously.</li>
    <li> I feel like it really cleans good. Vibration is weird.</li>
    <li> My first electric brush, does exactly what I need it to do. Appreciate the 30 second interval buzz so I know I am brushing enough. Swapped the original head for the sensitive ones, which are a lot nicer.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Feels like my teeth are really clean</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the money. Stays charged for several days without needing to be recharged. Supplied brush is excellent.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Excellent brushing qualities at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Worked great for OCD kid who was brushing the enamel off his teeth, now he puts it down when the timer runs out at 2 mins.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush, having previously purchased an older model many many many years ago.  This is an excellent toothbrush.  I love the timer that tells you to move the brush to another part of your mouth every 30 seconds and the 2 minute timer.  I also like the variety of different brush heads available.  Battery life is as advertised.  Brushing twice per day yields 7 days between charging.</li>
    <li> I always said I would never go to oral-b for a toothbrush because they are too expensive but I found this one and figure I would give it a try. I can now say I know why they are expensive and that is because they work. I love this toothbrush and I like the timer and other functions it has to make sure my teeth are taken care of properly. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I ordered this model after reading about the Sonicare comparable model, at least pricewise, that let lots of goop inside.  I have owned only Sonicare in the past.  This model is a nice slim design.  The two things I&#x27;ve less happy about are the considerable noise it produces, and the brush.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with anything I&#x27;m used in recent years.  After my third brushing with this, my gum was bleeding right in the front.  Therefore I needed to get the soft brushes.  A $3.00 coupon comes with the toothbrush for a 3 replacement head set.  Problem is, WalMart didn&#x27;t carry a 3 soft replacement head set, only a two.  So the coupon was useless.  The cost for the 2 replacement head package was $17.97 at WalMart.  If I had not needed it right away, I would have searched for other deals.  That being said, the new head, so far, is not causing any problem.  I wish the brush was quieter and the on-off button a little more prominent.  This is slippery when wet and hard to feel the button.  I don&#x27;t usually make it to a full two minutes of brushing...</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush!  Great price as well!  Had more expensive ones in the past.  This works the best of all buy it.</li>
    <li> Lots of pros for a simple toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It works well.  No annoying beeping sounds.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a small buzz like pause every 30 seconds to help time the brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a 4 buzz when the 2 minutes are up.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps on going with the same timing cycle if you want to brush your teeth longer.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to stop in the middle of brushing to reload toothpaste, just press the button,&lt;br /&gt;and when you press the button again, it remembers where you are in your 2 minute cycle.&lt;br /&gt;brilliantly simple, not sure how they could make it any better.</li>
    <li> works great. May be a little rough on the gums, but cleans teeth well plus massages gums.</li>
    <li> This is a nice electric toothbrush, which is comparable to the [[ASIN:B008PEMBNC Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]. This model doesn&#x27;t have the storage case for extra brush heads, but has many of the same features including a signal every 30 seconds to being brushing a new quadrant of your teeth and an easy to recharge base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference in this brush is the better, larger brush head  that is more like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; manual toothbrush, but with the cleaning power of an electric brush. This is a great introduction for someone not used to using an electric toothbrush. It doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive setting like some of the other Oral-B models, so those with sensitive teeth may prefer other models that have additional settings. However, this toothbrush is a great basic model that works well and is a great value.</li>
    <li> This Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush shares several features in common with my excellent but older Oral-B Professional 1000: a tall, slim, and easy to hold handle;  a timer that pauses briefly every 30 seconds to \\&quot;prompt\\&quot; you to switch quadrant, display indicators to show charge life / status (\\&quot;red\\&quot; means it&#x27;s time to recharge the toothbrush, blinking \\&quot;green\\&quot; means the toothbrush is still charging, etc); and up to 7 day battery life (assuming 2 minute brushing twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my older Professional 1000, this Deep Sweep 1000 has a smaller charging base (a potential positive for travelers), and instead of the usual small and round brush head, the product comes packaged with a new bigger brush head that gives it more of a manual toothbrush look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the newer brush head have different lengths and colors:  those at the tip of the head are the longest and are light blue in color, the remaining rows of bristles are either dark blue or white in color, and the white bristles are slightly longer than the dark blue ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During brushing, the dark blue bristles remain stationary, while the rest produce the sidewise (or up/down, depending on brush orientation) \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; motion that helps stimulate the gums.  The produced \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t feel all that \\&quot;deep,\\&quot; so I can&#x27;t tell whether this product&#x27;s \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; capability gives it a significant advantage over the older model, but in my opinion, both models provide excellent cleaning and work at least equally well, and certainly a lot better than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Sweep 1000 is compatible with a range of brush heads, so if you don&#x27;t like the new bigger one that comes packaged with it, you have other choices that could potentially fill your needs better.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush - a lower priced model than my old Oral-B but actually they have improved the brushing action.  Much lighter and appreciate the fact that the charging stand is smaller than my old one.  Was keeping it for a backup for when my old one died but decided to use it instead and glad I did.  You don&#x27;t get the happy face but it does time your brushing by pausing.</li>
    <li> I needed a new electric tooth brush and this one is just what I expected.  So good to use.</li>
    <li> Does everything you expect an electric toothbrush to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 6 months ago.  It has never held a charge well.  Now it seems that the battery is not charging anymore.  I have charged it, but it is just slowing down to a snails pace after a very short time.  Don&#x27;t have any idea what to do.  Have tried recharging even thought the light doesn&#x27;t come on.  Looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I researched electric toothbrushes before deciding that this was a good compromise between ridiculously expensive and a toy.  Was I wrong!  My wife has a Waterpik electric toothbrush and it is refined.  It&#x27;s quiet, has a high frequency and great fit and finish.  By comparison, this is extremely loud, has a noticeably slower frequency and feels and looks extremely cheap.  For the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out why people think this is great.  When I used it, it felt like I was at the dentist&#x27;s having something drilled out!  I can&#x27;t tell you how bad I think this product is.  I bought two.  I am returning one for a refund and am going to try to get them to give my money back because the one we tried was so horrible.</li>
    <li> I bought exactly this model in Germany and got this for the charger here in USA. However this unit does not have pressure sensor, which blinks when you are brushing too hard on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;The rest, perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get one.  My teeth feel so clean and this one works great.</li>
    <li> very pleased it works great!would recomend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;does great job too! good value for the money as far as i think!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the deep sweep head and it works easily, rinses safely and charges easily. It&#x27;s been recharging reliably each time for months now and the heads are easy to  change. It&#x27;s the only brush that makes the job so easy, It&#x27;s not a chore. Very thorough!</li>
    <li> The best tooth brush I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> It is my brush now, used it for a year.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans so well. Dentist always says whatever your doing keep doing it.&lt;br /&gt;It must be good if they see the results.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected, but it works.. just a cheaper version</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised with the positive reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you kidding ?&lt;br /&gt;I bought this last week - and had a horrible experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly the product feels cheap and was very filmsy&lt;br /&gt;It slipped off my hands a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The triaction - as they call it - was very harsh and sounded like a drill in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;it caused my gums to bleed so I had to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hated the experience.  Dont recommend at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing for an Oral B product.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, the only difference between this brush and the more familiar round headed Oral-Bs seems to be the head itself. The head on this brush looks and feels like a manual toothbrush. If you&#x27;ve tried the round heads and didn&#x27;t like them, you might have better luck with the Triaction head. But I think it doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as the round heads. It&#x27;s also a bit too big and cumbersome and feels tougher to reach all parts of your teeth. I&#x27;m sticking with the Floss Action heads.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:2ae8560b17823389a741341c8c3daf23]] If you like the round head to get into tight spaces, but the elongated head to brush the sides, this is for you! My teeth felt clean and gums invigorated, without being so rough that I had sore spots. Often with a new brush I&#x27;ll have a spot or two that gets irritated at first, not with this. Great investment with great payoff.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Oral-B electric toothbrush my family has owned. Like the others before it, this is a great product. I love the sweeping action. The brush does all the work for you! One thing that does bug me, though, is the lack of a travel case. How much more $$ would it cost Oral-B to provide a decent plastic case to put the brush in while you&#x27;re traveling? Nonetheless, this is a great toothbrush and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The top priority for me when I choose an electric toothbrush is simple - one that cleans my teeth well, including plaque removal, without damaging gums, fillings,etc. I also want a reliable, sturdy brush.  The Oral-B meets both of those requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But also on the list? An electric toothbrush that takes up minimum space in our small bathroom with an equally tiny counter. So it is a plus that the whole Oral-B unit - charger, brush head, and handle - has a very small footprint. It also has a nice, trim profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set- up was intuitive (although I did read the instructions as I went along, just to make sure) I plugged the charger into the wall outlet and placed the toothbrush handle on it. I started charging it at night and by morning it was ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the features I particularly like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it can be switched between daily clean, sensitive and whitening modes. There is also a noise to indicate when I&#x27;ve reached a a full 2 minutes of brushing time (better than using a separate timer or guessing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it does have a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting, I did feel the Deep Sweep brush which comes with the unit was too hard for my particular teeth and gums. My spouse, on the other hand, will be using the Deep Sweep brush and really likes it. There are 6 brush heads available which will fit this Oral-B model: Floss Action, Pro White, Sensitive Gum Care, Precision Clean, and more. The package insert underlines the fact that those who find regular brushing too intense or painful use the Sensitive Gum Care head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I read the product insert thoroughly because I needed the reminder to wash the brush head under running water before turning it off. I went into \\&quot;automatic pilot\\&quot; mode and nearly turned it off first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many appliances that come with chargers, this one performs best when the unit is unplugged and allowed to fully discharge at least every six months. I haven&#x27;t had mine 6 months yet so I&#x27;ll update if there are any issues with this brush or recharging as time goes on. But so far we are very satisfied.nths yet so I&#x27;ll update if there are any issues with this brush or recharging as time goes on. But so far we are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush. No complaints</li>
    <li> Still struggling to learn ho;w to use itl</li>
    <li> wonderful and powerful toothbrush. I love it and will advice others to buy it.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Don&#x27;t care for timing pauses, but that&#x27;s a minor issue.</li>
    <li> I liked it. This is the second one I bout for my mother!</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush!  I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years.  Only difference from my old more expensive model, is that it doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge very long.  You do have to recharge it every other day.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my other Oral-B 1000 that had the battery dying. I thought about buying a replacement battery and soldering it in but this is more cost-effective than my time to tear down the other unit.</li>
    <li> This electric brush is everything that it claimed to be. I don&#x27;t need fancy packaging, just&lt;br /&gt;a good, reliable toothbrush that is not too bulky or heavy.</li>
    <li> A great basic electric tooth brush. Move it around one quarter of your mount and it temporarily pauses to let you know to move to the next.. until the final double pause to let you know you&#x27;re done... that is it. One button for on/off!</li>
    <li> I bought one for my boyfriend and I and we both love them. After brushing with it my teeth feel clean!</li>
    <li> i really like it, tried to brush with my old regular tooth brush - no way, never back! :) have it for almost a year, no troubles so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Oral B electric toothbrushes.  This is my second one.  The battery failed to charge on the first one after a couple of years.  This one is better still.  I don&#x27;t like the Deep Sweep brushes.  I prefer the standard ones.</li>
    <li> Thought I would save some money versus a sonic and this was a waste.  Not powerful at all.  Brush will stop moving when brushing up against cheek.  Skip this completely and spend more on a better product.</li>
    <li> Been using about 2 weeks ... no problems at all. Electric is definitely the way to go. I own 2 Oral B electric toothbrushes and like all of them.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift !</li>
    <li> Nice tooth brush. I have always preferred Oral-B to Sonic. And I am glad that Oral B is making these &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; looking brush heads.</li>
    <li> I think it is a brand problem.  The brush part stops running periodically.  Very troubling.  Works just like the one I bought at Walmart a year ago.  It&#x27;s just a bad product, stay away from it.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from an earlier model electric toothbrush to this...well, &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; might not be the best term, since my previous brush was a more expensive and higher-end model than this one, but it was purchased years and years ago. For what it&#x27;s worth, this brush is better than that one ever was at a fraction of the cost. Definitely a 10/10, can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality of this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush cleans your teeth very well and is kind to your gums. I have receding gums and my teeth are very sensative and this brush is ideal for me .After they feel smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for almost a year and they feel great. Feels much more of a cleaner than the original circular brushes.</li>
    <li> I thought this new concept would be great.  As it turns out, I like the spin brush better.  It cleans teeth better and doesn&#x27;t splash all over the walls and mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric tooth brush I’ve ever owned. It looked really promising due to the side to side action. I tried it for about a month to give it a good chance, but I didn’t like it for the start. The head vibrates against my teeth when I turn it to get to different parts of my mouth. It is a pain to try and find the off button to remove it before I spit. Several times I couldn’t find the off button fast enough or just forget to shut it off and remove it from my mouth and it slung stuff everywhere. I put it up and went back to my manual tooth brush. If your already use to an electric tooth brush, you might like it, but I gave up.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush does not work as advertise.  It&#x27;s brush power is jarring and shakes your whole head when you are using it.  The brush does stop working when you have it against your gums.  Spend more money to get a better product.  This is my second Oral B product since my Sonicare broke.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral B toothbrushes for several years and was a little put out when the rotary brushes were replaced.  I love the new style brush and the improvements made on the handle.  I recommend this system to anyone who is interested in maintaining or improving their oral health.</li>
    <li> Love my new electric toothbrush &amp; have sung it&#x27;s praises to all my family as well as several acquaintances.  I did receive it in a reasonable amount of time &amp; am enjoying using it every day.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received the product before I left for Thailand and opened the box on arrival to Thailand. I attempted to charge the unit with the aid of a transformer as the device indicates the charger only works on 120 volt circuits. However the red light on the unit only indicates that the unit needs charged. However, the green light does not work or indicate that the unit is charging. I am very unhappy with this product and will request a refund. If this request will not be honored, I will file a dispute with my credit card company. Beware of this over-rated product.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Holds charge and works with various Oral and generic brand brush heads.  Timer lets you know when you have brushed long enough by staggering the oscillations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply the best electric toothbrush for the price. It cleans great and can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> After 9 months the battery in one of two toothbrushes died.  Extremely difficult to get if repaired.  If you try yourself - you void the warranty.  But another brand.</li>
    <li> Say sayonara to your gums and enamel if you use this thing.</li>
    <li> Have used the Oral B last generation for about 10 years.  THIS is next generation of deep cleaning.  Got one for each of my nephews who need the toothbrush to deep clean--and not feel like teeth are a struggle.  It has worked well for us all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the cheaper battery toothbrushes, but this Oral B brush blows then out of the water.  My teeth as well as my whole mouth feel really clean. I love it and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s really very good except that there&#x60;s only one head brush for it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy a lot this toothbrush. I have 03 toothbrushes. I would like that the battery were replaceable. I can&#x27;t find it to buy and replace.</li>
    <li> Cleaner very good!!!!</li>
    <li> I had another electric toothbrush which I thought was doing a good job of cleaning my teeth. The Oral-B Deep Sweep does a much better job and my teeth seem whiter as well. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We bought two of these 1000 brushes as replacements for our 10 yr old models which were beginning to fall apart. From other reviews we judged the extra features on the more expensive models to be of marginal use for us (we travel a lot). After using the 1000 for a few weeks we are pleased with the choice. I found to my surprise that two features of the new brushes were rather helpful. First the hesitation every 30 seconds while brushing is more useful than the one 2 minute warning on our old models as it encourages me to do the full 2 minutes. Second the indication of a full charge is helpful as it requires a long time (about 24 hours) to get there, an issue when traveling. The only con is that the flashing green light while charging is very bright, and we generally have to hide it somehow.</li>
    <li> i enjoy using this tooth brush i only wish t had the auto shut down two minute  timer most of the other ones  have but  over all performance  of the item is very fair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush]], so most of my review is in comparison to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the biggest issue I&#x27;ve found with the Triaction 1000, since it may be a dealbreaker for some. If you take the brush head out of your mouth even partially, such as to clean your gum line with the tip, then the movement if the brush head sprays froth everywhere. For me, it got on the bathroom mirror and my chest! This does not happen with the Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, the frothing is due to the \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot; action. The Pulsonic head only moves in small vibration motions, but with the Triaction 1000, every other row of bristles sweeps rapidly from left to right, moving through about 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of features, it&#x27;s a wash (no pun intended) compared to the Pulsonic. They both have a built in timer for the recommended brushing time; the brush head pauses for a second to indicate when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth or finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic included a separate fine head for cleaning your gum line which I find very effective. With the Triaction, if you need this, you need to buy it as an optional accessory. Also, the Pulsonic has two vibration speeds while the Triaction 1000 has just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In favor of the Triaction, it has a battery charge level indicator which the Pulsonic does not, and it has a pressure sensor that shuts off the vibration if you press too hard. The Triaction is also chunkier than the Pulsonic, but not as much as the [[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush]], which I&#x27;ve also tried. This may be a pro or con depending on your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Triaction has comparable features and seems to clean just as well as the Pulsonic. The manufacturer claims the sweeping action is even better at removing plaque than other electric toothbrushes. It may take some getting used to if you currently use an electric toothbrush with the traditional vibrating motion. But, the dealbreaker may be the frothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I was given a test model to review but was not otherwise compensated, nor was I given additional brush heads (the thing that makes up the bulk of the expenses in the long run!). It is possible that the test model I received is slightly different from the final retail model.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, there are some out there who have not &#x27;sunk their teeth&#x27; into the new dental technology. And they should and this is the perfect product to start with. The device is of high quality while the brush (Oral-B) is the top recommended tooth brush among the dental care professionals. Taken together, this is one powerful combination. It makes the perfect gift as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this new model even tho my old brush was still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for a couple months, I prefer my 3000 or 5000 series (at 2 and 3 times the cost)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally different brush stroke than 3000/5000 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optional 8 different brushes to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Pressure control&lt;br /&gt;Indicator bristles fade, to indicate when to replace brush&lt;br /&gt;Hard brushing alert&lt;br /&gt;Professional timer&lt;br /&gt;1 cleaning mode (Daily Clean) my first had a second speed that I never used&lt;br /&gt;Charge level display&lt;br /&gt;The handle remains waterproof (of course) and easy to hold - excellent balance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 handle&lt;br /&gt;1 charger - compact, full strength for over a week when I was traveling and didn&#x27;t take the charger&lt;br /&gt;1 refill brush head - too large for my small mouth already overcrowded with teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60-day money back guarantee and a 2-Year replacement or repair warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine ever buying another brand than Oral B - I have been hooked since my first 11 years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. She likes it and has been using it on a regular basis for her oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Feels different from the round-top brushes, as the brush vibrates from side to side. It certainly feels more gentle than the round-top brush heads, although it allows for use of different Oral-B brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It signals every 30 seconds to let you know when it&#x27;s time to move on to different teeth. This makes more sense than a visible timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if there was a travel case. And this model brushes at 20k pulses per second, versus other models which go at 40k.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pressure sensor warns you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard. Battery will go about 20 minutes total.</li>
    <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] which I bought when it first came out, but decided to give this Oral-B a try and compare. They are both in very different price ranges - the Sonicare is about 190 bucks, while the Oral-B is about 50. So, there is a huge difference there. I do love the Sonicare, but the Oral-B is great as well, and a lot more budget friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B is the most like a regular manual toothbrush, as far as the feel of it in the mouth and the cleaning action feel. The vibration is stronger on the Oral-B and feels like it is cleaning a bit more, because of the stronger vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual head on the Oral-B is also more sized like a manual toothbrush. I actually like this fuller head better than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure sensor on the Oral-B seems to be more sensitive than on my Sonicare. That is neither good or bad, but just a difference. The Sonicare also has more settings to use for cleaning, but this Oral-B is just fine with the one basic setting. I only use one setting on the Sonicare anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neck on this one, leading to the brush head, is a bit slimmer and therefore a bit more comfortable in the mouth and to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it cleans really well. It really feels like it is scrubbing and cleaning as opposed to the Sonicare which in comparison just feels like it is vibrating. I have braces, so it can be difficult for me to brush well with all the obstacles of the braces. I feel like I get a better, more thorough clean on all surfaces with the Oral-B, more quickly and more easily since the brush head is a bit bigger and covers more area at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the gumline really well too and easily. It gets between my teeth and brackets of my braces well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this Oral-B is a great choice. It does a great job, is affordable, and feels like it is cleaning better ( a bit more aggressively?) than the much higher priced Sonicare Diamond Clean.vely?) than the much higher priced Sonicare Diamond Clean.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not able to shell out the money for a higher-end unit, this Oral-B model has you covered. It is very functional and certainly a step up from manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only major complaint is the head design -- what they call the \\&quot;Deep Sweep 1000\\&quot; head. It is designed to mimic the shape of a standard toothbrush. The brushes sweep in a side-to-side motion. I found that this design is inferior to other Oral-B designs (at least for my preferences). The round head (where the bristles move in a spinning motion) leaves my mouth feeling much cleaner. Since this product is compatible with other head designs, I recommend trying out a few designs (though they are pricy) in order to find the best fit. If you do, you might be able to save yourself some money over more expensive units.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.I have only used it a few times but it seems like it&#x60;s going to be great.I love it.</li>
    <li> its a good toothbrush ..after I bought it ...I saw the same product for less money on e bay</li>
    <li> Great design.Much slimmer handle than on older models.Does great job cleaning teeth and massaging gums.Good value.</li>
    <li> Lot of noise and vibration compared to another popular brand Sonicare.  Surprised that there is no cover for the toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Battery lasts a long time.  The timing feature is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Not for me -- but nothing wrong with product</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does just what it claims to do. I have issues with plaque, and it definitely cleans my teeth much better than a regular toothbrush. I DO wish that it had a timer. However, its not that big of a deal to me. I&#x27;m very happy with my buy. I also like that this toothbrush is compatible with various other toothbrush heads from Oral-B.</li>
    <li> There are other better electric toothbrushes available. But they cost $150-$200. For $35-$40 this electric brush can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest asset of this brush is the interchangeable heads. There are 5 or 6 varieties of brushes that do different things, and even that move in different ways, that all easily snap into this brush base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get oscillating brushed, spinning brushes, and other specific purpose brushes, depending on your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that comes with it is an oscillating brush head. (Every other row of bristles moves back and forth rather than the top spinning in circles). It oscillates very fast, so you can&#x27;t turn it on until it&#x27;s in your mouth. If you put the toothpaste on it and turn it on before it&#x27;s in your mouth, toothpaste will go everywhere in your bathroom as it will vibrate it right off the brush and fling it everywhere. Don&#x27;t worry too much, you will make that mistakes once and remember not to do it ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that means the brush vibrates VERY fast. And that&#x27;s a good thing. It works the bristles in between your teeth almost like you are flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con of the brush is the 30 second reminder to switch positions in your mouth. It&#x27;s not a beep, but rather a break in the vibration. So the brush stops vibrating for a quarter second. At first I thought it was broken and just skipping out. But that&#x27;s apparently the 30 second reminder. It&#x27;s annoying. It doesn&#x27;t impact the job the brush does. Nor does it take away from the quality of the brush. It&#x27;s just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the package for mine came a $3 coupon for replacement brush heads and a promise of an additional $7 coupon if you register your brush on line. So that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I love this so much I have started brushing 2 more times each day. My teeth feel much cleaner over some other battery operated oral b&#x27;s that I have used. It&#x27;s a little loud but it works! I have no plaque buildup since I have begun using this brush. I think it advertises 100% more plaque elimination. Really works!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush teeth feel cleaner than by hand highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Bought two of these for my 13 year old twins.  They love them and use them daily.  They tell me their mouths feel cleaner.  At least I am confident they are brushing everyday.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Oral-B Deep Sweep Triaction 1000 electric toothbrush.  I have been using it for several months now and I can honestly say my teeth have never been cleaner!  It does a great job of getting rid of food between teeth as well as any other residue that would result in plaque build-up.</li>
    <li> Great Value on Amazon!  Costs much more in the store.  This is a step up from my previous Oral B.  I love it.  It cleans nicely and feels really good on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much more to say.  If you use this then you can keep your teeth.  I have alls mine. :)</li>
    <li> Wow, awesome brush.  Price is a bit steep but these things last forever.  Hopefully head prices come down a bit.</li>
    <li> Good product keeps my teeth clean and great performance wise if anyone is looking to spend there money worth on a toothbrush</li>
    <li> This is a quality toothbrush at a great price!</li>
    <li> This Oral B has met &amp; exceeded our expectations. The brush action is twice that of our previous units &amp; we are able to use the brush heads from our ones which is very useful.</li>
    <li> Upgraded for a old OralB brush that died after 6 years. The new one is great, cleans much better, feels more powerful. I personnaly don&#x27;t like the large headbrush, but my husband loves it, so I bought a smaller one for myself.</li>
    <li> I used Oral-B Sonic Complete brush for last 10 years, unfortunately they stop making this amazing model and after mine stopped working I was looking for alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Triaction 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My take: Cleaning is very good maybe even better than Oral-B Sonic Complete. However the secession on the mouth while cleaning is completely different from the Oral-B Sonic Complete. It feels much more mechanical movement that&#x27;s transmitted into your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you never used sonic brush you will be very happy because it does the job very well.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for sonic like sensation while brushing - it&#x27;s not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it because the results are good.&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a video that shows in slow motion the difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER 30 days for use:&lt;br /&gt;CLEANS AMAZING BETTER THEN SONIC - LOVE IT !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I ALWAYS HATED ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSHES.  My dentist has always told me the benefits, and I have tried numerous cheap models, but none of them ever worked for me.  I always found myself using a standard $2.00 toothbrush after the electric because I never felt like my teeth were clean.  That has all changed with this new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way that this head moves is incredible.  The bottom stays stationary for scrubbing, while the top moves back and forth to really polish them.  This is the only tooth brush that I have used that literally feels like you just left the dentist.  It is interchangeable with a ll of the other Oral-B heads and I just ordered two replacements for around $3.00.  It&#x27;s very cost effective and I would highly recommend it.  Feel free to ask any questions in the comments and I will answer them to the best of my ability/experience.</li>
    <li> love the product, first electric toothbrush and well made. Unfortunately I saw the same exact product last week at significantly lower price (bought another one)</li>
    <li> Meh. This was to replace another Oral B that conked out. That one had a circular head and seemed to do a much better job cleaning my teeth, especially the back molars. I think that this head can be swapped out and am hoping a replacement with a circular head will do the trick. I expected the motor to have a little more power than it does. Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> The timer is great. Not complicated at all. Really powerful but not uncomfortable. The charge has lasted a week so far which I like b/c I plan to take it on vacation and don&#x27;t want to take the based to charge it all the time. My dentist recommended this but it was $120+ in the office and I found this on Amazon for $40 so I snapped it up and I&#x27;m so glad. Also the replacement heads seemed less expensive per unit than rival brands which influenced my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great electric toothbrush.  After too many years to count I need to replace my battery operated Braun.  I do miss popping in batteries as needed because the charge electrically is a bit of a pain. If you travel and do not have the charger with you and it runs low, you&#x27;re hosed!  All in all great bristles and I continue to get awesome dental visits, of course that is al about FLOSSING!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, affordable and works great. The vibration every 30 seconds is a great feature and my teeth feel cleaner than ever!</li>
    <li> Spoil the pearly whites. Cost effective and attractive. Works great</li>
    <li> My new best friend for oral hygiene, this electric brush works great. And the refills are not super expensive if you shop around. The up and down action and, especially, the vibrating top bristles really get into the cracks and crevices. Afterwards my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned.</li>
    <li> This is extremely noisy.  It seems to do a good job, but I think it&#x27;s an aggressive toothbrush and others do as good a job without so much sound and movement.</li>
    <li> My beloved oral b vitality died after 6 years of steady use, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. When I went looking for a replacement the vitality was sold out on amazon so I started shopping it a bit. Considered sonicare very seriously but figured &#x27;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&#x27; and stuck with the oral b line. I picked this one based on reviews and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s slightly longer and a little louder than the vitality but not enough to be any kind of nuisance. Actually, it&#x27;s only louder because it produces more vibrations per minute...so in theory, a little louder is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel cleaner than they did with the vitality and I love the sweeping head, I&#x27;ll continue purchasing those. Solid unit, hope to get as many years of use out of this model as I did my vitality. Highly recommend for performance and value</li>
    <li> My son came out of a recent dentist clean up with cavities and according to the dentist \\&quot;needed to brush better\\&quot;.  After researching online, we wanted a power toothbrush (dentist reco) with a manual \\&quot;feel\\&quot;.  This product over delivered on each and my son actually likes to brush his teeth. It sweeps and does the brushing technique for him.  When he got his filling yesterday, the dentist could already see the difference and said \\&quot;you are brushing better\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few products out there that changes lives!</li>
    <li> Very good.better than my old Philips</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush to replace an older one. I had no complaints about the older one, but this one is hands-down better! It has a longer, thicker brush than many electric toothbrushes. It&#x27;s soft enough not to cause any gum discomfort (a frequent problem with the other one) but it still gets everything clean. The \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; function is great (basically, in addition to the regular function, different sections of the brush move in different directions), and I can definitely feel the difference in cleanliness compared to most other brushes. Oral-B has never disappointed me, and this brush is no exception. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace the one I wsed for almost 20 years. As far as I can see, this one will last that much.</li>
    <li> Or the wild child of a Sonicare toothbrush. This brush does get things clean, but its kinda nuts. I thought my old oral b made a mess, which was minimized when i switched to the sonicare, but this one puts em all to shame. The top bristles go left to right or up and down if your holding it in your mouth. And toothpaste flies. My 55lb german shepherd mutt, which isnt scared of much, is legit terrified of this toothbrush when its on. I kinda think she thinks im turning into a cyborg, or am about to torture her or something. And for all this motion and noise and activity I dont feel like it necessarily cleans any better than my other electric toothbrushes. Maybe they switched to this technology in order to get the price down, since my other Oral B was closer to $100 and my Sonicare is over that. Also as someone with a smaller mouth, it was harder to maneuver this toothbrush to get the back of my teeth and my molars. These are I suspect particular problems to my mouth which is why this product still gets 4 stars. But still you may suffer the same, because im guessing the head swings about 45+ degrees so if you have sensitivities in your mouth id go for a more subdued toothbrush</li>
    <li> Works great! Good price.</li>
    <li> This is my second electric toothbrush and I think it&#x27;s fabulous. I stopped using the first one (mostly because it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge). This one seems to have no problems holding a charge. I&#x27;ve had it for about thirty days and have never had a problem getting it going. Also, I really like the fact that the base (the charging base) is much smaller than most bases. The toothbrush head colors fade as it gets closer to the time when you need to replace it, which is a nice feature. Every time I brush I feel like I&#x27;m getting a dentist clean which is great. I would recommend the toothbrush (I think it may be especially good for children).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this tooth brush for about a week and so far I like it. It seems to be on the basic side but it&#x27;s what I needed because I was brushing to hard with my regular tooth brush. It really does seem to do a deeper cleaning of your gums without doing any damage. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a basic electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love it! It holds a charge with consistent power for a long time. I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush prior but wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the charge, but this is much improved!</li>
    <li> Amazing toothbrush! Way better than my old electric toothbrush. I love how every 30 seconds it lets me know when to switch to the next quadrant of my teeth. I finish brushing feeling clean, refreshed, bacteria reduced.</li>
    <li> Much too strong!  It vibrates my whole head, very annoying.  I am not a fan of this brush.  I was using a Rotodent, love it (until my dog ate it), will go back to it.  I don&#x27;t feel that my teeth are as smooth/clean after this brush compared to the Rotodent.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Sometimes the motor grinds to a brief halt if you apply too much pressure while brushing. Otherwise can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this one since my old one that I purchased back in 2006 started losing charging time and just did not seem to brush very well anymore.  So I checked on the reviews of this one and asked a question and decided to purchase.  I really do like it and the fact that it warns you ahead of time when the battery needs recharging.</li>
    <li> It came on time and the quality is pretty good.</li>
    <li> When I was a consumer columnist for the Jerusalem Post, I wrote an article about dental care options. I interviewed several dentists for the article, and although they had different opinions about toothbrushes, they all told me that electric toothbrushes are too hard on teeth. A simple, manual toothbrush is preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home I use both a manual toothbrush and a very inexpensive Oral-B electric one, the kind you can buy at the supermarket for about ten dollars, sometimes less. That toothbrush isn&#x27;t hard on the teeth. It does, however, do a poor job of cleaning between teeth, so I still agree with the dentists on that: manual is generally better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this toothbrush is everything those dentists objected to: it&#x27;s too hard on your teeth. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it seems to clean between teeth better than the standard rotating electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: save your money, listen to the dentists, and be kind to your teeth and gums. Don&#x27;t get this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> it started to smell bad after a couple months.  no matter how much you wash, the rubber on the handle just smells.  bad.  like poop.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older Oral-B after many years and it is a good improvement.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric toothbrush for those that haven&#x27;t used one before. While I completely disagree that it offers the \\&quot;familiar brushing motion of a manual toothbrush,\\&quot; as Oral-B claims, it does offer the great cleaning power of Oral-B electrics but without some of the advanced features (that some people might not need).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electrics for six years and Sonicare electrics for the five years before that. For what this product costs, I&#x27;m impressed with the cleaning power it offers. It&#x27;s definitely comparable to Oral-B&#x27;s more expensive 5000 series in terms of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to electrics then this is a good choice. If you have straightforward toothbrush needs and don&#x27;t need the features of the 5000 series (multiple cleaning styles, separate timing dock, etc.) then this is a good choice. This toothbrush offers quality cleaning at an entry-level price.</li>
    <li> We have been using Sonicare for the last 5 years and the brush died. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and 2 of this Oral B are less than 1 Sonicare. I love how clean my teeth feel. I like this brush much better than the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> works as good as expected,  like it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Significant improvement in my teeth.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to this toothbrush from the Oral B Vitality. I would generally use the precision heads on my Vitality, but the deep sweep action head on this Professional 1000 seems to get my teeth much cleaner. The specs state the 1000 offers more pulsations/revolutions than the vitality and it is noticeable. It only cost me about $5-10 more than the Vitality which made it an even better deal.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done very well.</li>
    <li> Do you really need to be told that you are brushing your teeth too hard? It is for the most part common sense, and a reliance on gadgets and machines to that extent is not good. This toothbrush is a simple electric toothbrush that works as well as the other Oral B toothbrushes I have been using for the past 10+ years. This toothbrush has a small charger that does not take up too much space. The toothbrush itself is easy to hold and has two small LED indicators at the bottom to help with the charging. One small con - if you are on the move and travel a lot, the lack of a carrying case is likely to be an inconvenience, albeit a minor one.</li>
    <li> I am Sonicare user and did use Oral B in the past.  I decided to &amp;#34;hedge my bets&amp;#34; and also invested in this unit as well.  I like the &amp;#34;deep sweep&amp;#34; heads a lot--they seem to work very well.  I did eventually buy a Oral B &amp;#34;5000&amp;#34; unit to use also. Currently, I use this particular unit with a specialized Oral B brush head and it works very well--the &amp;#34;pointer&amp;#34; head for use around bridges/crowns.  Good alternative to the more expensive Oral B units.</li>
    <li> After buying the top of the line Oral-B for $$$ and having a great experience, I wanted to see if the lower models would work as well at 1/4 the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It does. Buy it. Yes it oscillates less than the high end.. but that can&#x27;t be a stable number with diminished battery life over time. There are also great reviews that point to the same conclusion.</li>
    <li> This new Oral - B has a different head, looking similar to a normal toothbrush - if not similar to the Philips range of Electrical toothbrushes? The vibrations against your teeth feel OK, and this unit also helps to keep your gums healthy too. The changing of the brush heads once done is simple task. You get fair amount of time between charges, which is good if you work away from home or you&#x27;re going away for a week&#x27;s holiday - and really do not want to drag around yet another charger! The unit as whole feels well-made and robust, the toothbrush part is comfortable to hold and use. As other reviewers have mentioned and think it is worth repeating (and you may need it when away from home), this is a two pin plug, and you will need to either a shaving point in the bathroom, or a two into three pin adapter. It has a light-up area if too much pressure is applied and a timer alert signal to ensure adequate time is given to brushing each area. This toothbrush claims to reduce plaque build-up. It certainly makes my teeth feel clean and fresh and time will tell on my next visit to the Dentist! I do, however, note that currently the replacement heads are quite expensive. On performance, though, I am very pleased with this item.&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick list of the good points as I see them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Slim design and light weight that fits easily in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Your teeth feel really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Replacement heads cheaper than Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Good battery life - I religiously brush my teeth twice a day and usually for longer than just the 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> This thing is GREAT.  To start off, this is the first rechargeable toothbrush I have had with a reasonably sized base; not occupying a big footprint on my counter.  The toothbrush itself is quiet, yet performs excellent.  The various sweeping actions of the different bristles really seems to work well; and the bristels on the tip move in the right way to actually clean behind my wisdom teeth, which is a failure of most toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is replaceable, with a &#x27;fading bristles&#x27; method of determining when the head needs to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush works well, is less expensive than comparable models, and has a properly sized base unit.  Its a toothbrush, I dont need a lot, but what I do need this one has.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife, she loves it. I&#x27;ll give it 5 after she&#x27;s had it for a while.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to see that the Sonic Complete is no longer available, so decided I would give this one a try.  I figured it is a newer model and therefore a progression in technology.  I was wrong.  My teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean, the toothbrush is noisy, and it just seems like a cheap motor was put inside to crudely move the head back and forth.  It looks great under the faucet with the water pouring over it, but I doubt the cleaning power once you have it stuck up against your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to find the Sonic Complete on E-bay.</li>
    <li> Other oral-b power toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had have worked great but I was never a fan of the small circular head. I always felt like I could have gotten more teeth cleaned in less time. This brush is great and it lets you  know when it&#x27;s time for a replacement brush as the bristles fade. I had to replace my sonicare that I left at a friend&#x27;s house and was very surprised that this made me feel that I didnt miss my old brush at all</li>
    <li> I like this much more than my old Sonicare, which after abour 4 years decided to start turning itself on randomly during the night. It&#x27;s less jarring than the Sonicare, and according to a NIH study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15997965), Oral B professional brushes are more effective at removing plaque.  This specific model is a lower speed version, but I like that it has a small base and thinner handle.  I don&#x27;t like when a small device comes with a large charging base that takes up lots of counter space.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not crazy about the pastel green the tooth brush works great.  The interval skips help to remind me to change quadrants. while brushing.</li>
    <li> A little hard to get use to.</li>
    <li> I love this model. It does a great job and hold a charge for a good while.</li>
    <li> Found that it is noisier and slightly harder to turn off than my previous Oral-B toothbrush but it was less expensive too.</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth brush. You can switch heads easily and I am sure it has improved over my last one. !</li>
    <li> I feel really confortable with this product</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush.  It comes with a base and the brush head.  Plug it in, charge it and ready to use.  It cleans the teeth and gums well without a hard bristly feeling. I keep it plugged in all the time, so it&#x27;s always ready to go. The head needed to be changed in 4 weeks. The only downfall is the cost of the replacement brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B008PEMBNC Oral-B&#x27;s Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] and was hoping this [[ASIN:B00ARTK9FA Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Triaction 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] might be an upgrade. Except for a different head, it&#x27;s overall the same, although I do prefer this more vibrant color (it matches my ocean-themed bathroom) of the handle. While the brush head has \\&quot;clinically proven Triaction Technology\\&quot;, it is very large and I have a difficult time using it in my mouth, which I don&#x27;t consider exactly small. Not to get too gross but this causes a mess, both in use and rinsing it off. I have to keep my mouth totally closed or spray is going all over the counter-top, mirror, and whatever else is laying about, which makes it more difficult for me to brush my teeth properly (and more clean-up to do). I like to be able to see what I&#x27;m doing when brushing and I can&#x27;t do that with this particular head. While I&#x27;m sure it brushes well, I much prefer the smaller, round ones instead, and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference to my teeth by the switch, although it is possible this Deep Sweep cleans better. So while I appreciate the opportunity to try this out, I&#x27;m going back to the round heads where I have easier mobility and can see what the heck I&#x27;m doing (and look Ma, no spray!). While that&#x27;s my main bone of contention, I have come up with a handy-dandy pro/con list for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use: the lights to let me know when to charge or when it&#x27;s done; the 30-second stuttering telling me to move on to another quadrant&lt;br /&gt;- Indicator bristles where the blue will fade eventually so I&#x27;ll know when to replace the head&lt;br /&gt;- The pressure sensor will stop movement of the brush if too much pressure is exerted, I&#x27;ve never had it happen to me&lt;br /&gt;- Attractive color (always subjective)&lt;br /&gt;- Small charging station that takes up very little room on a counter&lt;br /&gt;- Eight(!) different brush heads are available for this model, so there should be one for your every whim and need&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof and ergonomic handle&lt;br /&gt;- Instructions that actually inform and help&lt;br /&gt;- 2 year limited warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Brush is far to large for me&lt;br /&gt;- Messy, messy! I don&#x27;t want my spittle all over my bathroom. Ew!&lt;br /&gt;- Only one brush head included&lt;br /&gt;- No refill station included for a family to use and store their particular heads&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a while to chargeferent brush heads are available for this model, so there should be one for your every whim and need&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof and ergonomic handle&lt;br /&gt;- Instructions that actually inform and help&lt;br /&gt;- 2 year limited warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Brush is far to large for me&lt;br /&gt;- Messy, messy! I don&#x27;t want my spittle all over my bathroom. Ew!&lt;br /&gt;- Only one brush head included&lt;br /&gt;- No refill station included for a family to use and store their particular heads&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a while to charge</li>
    <li> This Oral-B professional series brush with triaction, provides a thorough, satisfying clean.  Hard to reach surfaces, especially inner surfaces, have that squeaky clean sensation that you only expect from a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.  The charging base has a small footprint using minimal space on your sink/counter.  Brush head life probably varies, but 4-6 weeks is not unusual in my experience.  The brush handle has a solid feel and is easy to control for doing detailed brushing.  All-in-all this is a great value, and very well-made.</li>
    <li> I do like to use it.  Only problem is with my arthritic fingers I have a problem turning on and off the sweep, but once I get it going it really does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to take to our summer home.  I already had one at home.  Love it. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have the model 5000 and got this for my fiance and he loves it, it works the same as my much more expensive one, just with less frills.</li>
