      <li>I tried another product and the results were not as good as this Serum.</li>
      <li>I had heard about how good vitamin c serum is for the skin around eyes, and this was on sale.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing and it works.</li>
      <li>Just amazing.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, it leaves my skin bright and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>, I really liked this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>so I know it&#x27;s working but not too strong to burn.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>, after two days I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin</li>
      <li>Great price for this larger size bottle.  </li>
      <li>She reports that it goes on the skin smooth and does not leave an oily trace.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the Serum seems to feel good on my 71 year old face.</li>
      <li>In other words, if I&#x27;m writing a review,  I&#x27;ve got to be pretty darn impressed.  </li>
      <li>I must admit that she was right!</li>
      <li>but when i recieved it, i opened it up and applied it right away!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great with other products or alone.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s good for living in variable climates where the weather fluctuates from humid to dry.</li>
      <li>Directions say to use just a drop but with a gentle light touch it pours out in an unsteady stream?  </li>
      <li>laugh</li>
      <li>I noticed right away the diminishing of my forehead wrinkles and crows feet.  </li>
      <li>I had lines on my forehead and wrinkles around my eyes and after the first bottle was gone so</li>
      <li>My face and neck are noticeably soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I apply vitamin C first followed by hyaluronic acid, then</li>
      <li>Strong enough to tingle</li>
      <li>and I really do like this vitamin c serum.</li>
      <li>EVERYONE kept telling me how much healthier and awake</li>
      <li>After using it awhile it has really improved my skins texture and healthier looking skin.</li>
      <li>I must say,  I&#x27;m not one for writing reviews and am very choosy on one&#x27;s that I do write..</li>
      <li>My dark circles are not as dark now (and no, I haven&#x27;t been getting more sleep :).  </li>
      <li>It has changed deep, easily seen lines to barely visible!  </li>
      <li>i highly recommend this vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a thick lotion, but rather a liquid...</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave reveiws</li>
      <li>I came across it during a time when I was looking for a new C Serum and decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>put on directly after cleansing my face and saw a big improvement with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>C can help to counteract wrinkle formation and protects against and may repair UV damage from the sun&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is supposed to help reduce the signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the fact that It also helps your skin look and feel young,  </li>
      <li>I give this a 3 star only because the dispenser spills out way too much liquid.  </li>
      <li>I still look old, darn it.  </li>
      <li>the container itself, to the blue cloth bag it comes with, to the high quality of it&#x27;s ingredients</li>
      <li>My fine lines seemed to be smaller and less notiveable as well!</li>
      <li>You must dispense very cautiously or you will loose a lot of product.</li>
      <li>I’m 60 yrs old and never have given a thought to looking younger or my skin care.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit too early to tell because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week.</li>
      <li>I use this serum and have seen a dramatic change on my lower neck/upper chest area that is most exposed to sun.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this product. My goodness what a difference a few days made. Skin is softer, supple, under eye dark circles gone, lines &amp; wrinkles smoothing or disappearing. For me, found mineral or any loose/compact makeup brand applied with a brush works best. Just takes a couple of drops to per application for face &amp; neck.</li>
    <li> I’m 60 yrs old and never have given a thought to looking younger or my skin care. I first bought this serum a few months ago for my girlfriend to try and she loves it! She kept telling I should use it because it’s really good for your skin! I finally gave in and bought a bottle myself. I must admit that she was right! I have some age spots on my face and I used it on them and they started getting lighter. Great product and I really do like this vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit too early to tell because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week. I really want to give this a chance, but the odor is truly awful!  Smells like chewed tobacco - and it&#x27;s a strong smell.  I wonder if I got a bad bottle.  I&#x27;ll hang in there and check back in a few months to share my findings.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my skin</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this serum. I apply vitamin C first followed by hyaluronic acid, then moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I apply twice a day. I&#x27;ve noticed smoother more hydrated skin. I continue to purchase before I run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now on my forehead and I have noticed a difference in the ugly lines across my forehead and especially the two little lines between my eyebrows.  I will definitely continue to use this product because it is working!</li>
    <li> Saw a great improvement with the dark circles under eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put on directly after cleansing my face and saw a big improvement with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, but have already seen a difference.  My dark circles are not as dark now (and no, I haven&#x27;t been getting more sleep :).  Also, my skin feels smoother and softer now.  I&#x27;m very excited to keep using this product and see what other wonderful benefits it has in store for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this and I could feel how it tightened my skin and made it look a lot better. I tried another product and the results were not as good as this Serum. Heads up it is watery and not a gel. I love how it works and I will keep buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me this product to try being that I&#x27;m the total skeptical type and an occasional Botox recipient... I must say,  I&#x27;m not one for writing reviews and am very choosy on one&#x27;s that I do write.. In other words, if I&#x27;m writing a review,  I&#x27;ve got to be pretty darn impressed.  I noticed right away the diminishing of my forehead wrinkles and crows feet.  My face and neck are noticeably soft and smooth. I decided to try it on those little wrinkles us women get in the middle of our chest.  Gone! When I asked my husband if he&#x27;d noticed anything different about my face he said he had been meaning to mention  It looked like I had the \\&quot;pregnancy glow\\&quot;  &#x3D;)  I will definitely continue to use this product faithfully..</li>
    <li> This product works! I&#x27;m 27 and was starting to notice small onset laugh lines,&lt;br /&gt;so I did my homework and decided to give dermarolling a try alongside&lt;br /&gt;the Vitamin C Serum, after two days I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin&lt;br /&gt;and EVERYONE kept telling me how much healthier and awake I looked.&lt;br /&gt;Will def buy again!</li>
    <li> Very pleased from the very start!  Strong enough to tingle so I know it&#x27;s working but not too strong to burn.  Saw a softening of fine lines at my mouth and forehead and neck immediately!  Let it dry and them apply moisturizer.  Worked well.</li>
    <li> I give this a 3 star only because the dispenser spills out way too much liquid.  Directions say to use just a drop but with a gentle light touch it pours out in an unsteady stream?  Otherwise the Serum seems to feel good on my 71 year old face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this serum for my sister as a gift and she raves about it! She reports that it goes on the skin smooth and does not leave an oily trace. It absorbs well and keeps the skin moisturized for the entire day. It&#x27;s good for living in variable climates where the weather fluctuates from humid to dry.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this product but when i recieved it, i opened it up and applied it right away! My skin tone evened out after about 15 minutes and my skin had a glow. After using it awhile it has really improved my skins texture and healthier looking skin. My fine lines seemed to be smaller and less notiveable as well! This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Everything about this Vitamin C Serum says &amp;#34;quality:.&lt;br /&gt;From the container itself, to the blue cloth bag it comes with, to the high quality of it&#x27;s ingredients, I really liked this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know what that means for your skin, I&#x27;ll explain it:&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation and protects against and may repair UV damage from the sun&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is supposed to help reduce the signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the fact that It also helps your skin look and feel young,  i highly recommend this vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily and it makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Great price for this larger size bottle.  I am not used to serums being so fluid.  You must dispense very cautiously or you will loose a lot of product.</li>
    <li> I use this serum and have seen a dramatic change on my lower neck/upper chest area that is most exposed to sun.  It has changed deep, easily seen lines to barely visible!  It&#x27;s not a thick lotion, but rather a liquid... so, you Just need to use a little and it goes a long way!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I still look old, darn it.  I actually think it has made a different on the ole crows feet. I&#x27;m not going to say they&#x27;re gone; but, after a few weeks I did notice a difference.  I had heard about how good vitamin c serum is for the skin around eyes, and this was on sale.  I am not sure that I would buy it again; but, I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this product is suppose to resemble regular serum (which is thicker) but this product feels like water. Nevertheless, it leaves my skin bright and healthy looking. I am starting to see that my acne scar is fading away and will be repurchasing this item.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and it works. I ordered a second bottle. Give it time and you are guaranteed to see see results. I had lines on my forehead and wrinkles around my eyes and after the first bottle was gone so were the wrinkles/lines by about 80%. Just amazing. I normally don&#x27;t leave reveiws but i had to for this product. I reccomended it 100% because it works. And for this price you cant beat that. The bottle will last you about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I adore this product.  I came across it during a time when I was looking for a new C Serum and decided to give it a try.  I am very happy I did.  I started out using it twice a day to intensify the effects and now I use it once.  It&#x27;s great with other products or alone.  I&#x27;m looking into their other products since I am so happy with this one.  If you are in the market for a change give it a try.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Will have to review after using about 4 or 5 months.</li>
