      <li>Pretty good dental floss.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for taking a perfectly good product and ruining it oral-b.    </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shred, it goes in easily and doesn&#x27;t creep me out.</li>
      <li>Its softer against the gums and seems to clean better to.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fray, slides in and out of teeth easily.  </li>
      <li>And strong, too.</li>
      <li>, I despise the clicking sound of the floss as it pops out from between the enamel.</li>
      <li>From the moment I slip it between the tooths and begin working, the squeaks of clean minty goodness sound out:</li>
      <li>THIS stuff, this Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss, is astounding!</li>
      <li>Glide floss in general is usually pretty good.</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this floss more highly.</li>
      <li>cannot recommend this floss more highly.</li>
      <li>This floss is strong, very smooth, and flat like a ribbon, which makes it both more comfortable to hold and able to slip down between teeth quite easily.</li>
      <li>How many flosses can you say are SOFT?!</li>
      <li>To me it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say it has completely changed my life for the better</li>
      <li>The floss almost never get stuck in between my teeth and always leaves a fresh minty taste afterwards.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I was able to clean,</li>
      <li>I know, right?</li>
      <li>From the first moment I opened the top, when the floss near-floated out on a soft tendril of air, as if an ephemeral elven lock of hair (you know that&#x27;s what hobbits and wizards use, right?)</li>
      <li>or if you really force it, will break cleanly.</li>
      <li>The floss works fine for most of my teeth, except for the one pair in the back, which are really close together, which has nothing to do with the seller.</li>
      <li>so I can clean my whole mouth, so the first time I used this I did that.</li>
      <li>There are many better brands out there to choose from so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
      <li>I expect that this floss will be put on the short list for canonization and soon people all over the world will be praying to Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss, Patron Saint of Good Dental Hygiene and Flossing the night before their checkups.</li>

      <li>The floss slides smoothly and cleans better than any other that I have used.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Avoiding flossing isn&#x27;t an option anymore, though, because last time I went to the dentist, he told me I had gingivitis, then gave me a look like I was a dum*ss for not preventing it by taking better care of my teeth.</li>
      <li>starting with the dollar variety that is more wax than fiber</li>
      <li>have tried a number of different floss, and keep coming back to Glide Floss simply because it works the best.  </li>
      <li>Crest Deep Clean floss does NOT shred while you&#x27;re using it and has a sweet mint flavor.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker than standard waxed floss (any brand) which makes it more effective in getting spaces between teeth clean the first pass instead of having to really manipulate like normal \\&quot;standard\\&quot; floss.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, but if they are dancing, they&#x27;re using Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss as Olympic-caliber Ribbon Dancing!</li>
      <li>And the ticker the floss, the more it digs into my fingers and the less likely it will fit comfortably into the toothy</li>
      <li>I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence or not?</li>
      <li>I really like this floss since it really does \\&quot;glide\\&quot; between your teeth.</li>
      <li>You can do the cleaning in one pass, it digs out whatever happen to be stuck in there very well.  </li>
      <li>Feels so much better than the old standard string.  </li>
      <li>I wanted Crest Deep Clean dental floss</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss in Cool Mint for years now and accidentally ran out last week.</li>
      <li>Normal Crest Gray Deep Clean floss gets 5/5 stars.</li>
      <li>Saw the new deep clean and the reviews lead me to giving this one a try.</li>
      <li>Amazon price is is decent, but fluctuates.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll accept that as the consequence of being a dumb*ss, especially given that even though I have access to clean water, dental hygiene supplies, and modern medicine, I didn&#x27;t bother with necessary maintenance until there was a real problem.    </li>
      <li>Other flosses would always shred or wouldn&#x27;t even fit between the teeth.</li>
      <li>- I am still not a millionaire, my car is still a 12-year-old powder blue sedan with a malfunctioning CD player, and no one has swooped in from the future to take me on exciting adventures through history in their time machine - but it&#x27;s certainly improved it a bit.</li>
      <li>It never shreds, it glides easily between my (tightly packed) teeth.</li>
      <li>It may be the exact same product, but it&#x27;s not as described.</li>
      <li>So we searched around and found some other Colgate floss and some generic floss from the Dentist to use until we could get more Glide Floss.</li>
      <li>Not sure how you could make a better floss.</li>
      <li>Then I tried Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss to floss around it daily.</li>
      <li>In search of the proper tools to make my dental hygiene more regular and less a hassle, I picked up some Crest Glide Deep Clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other dental flosses, but I would rather pay the extra money now on good floss than stop flossing altogether with all the consequences that would bring.</li>
      <li>Did I mention soft?</li>
      <li>Soft, it is: minty, wraith-thin.</li>
      <li>However, I am now completely sold on this it.</li>
      <li>The green floss is better than regular floss</li>
      <li>how quickly and how little floss I needed to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As others have stated, the floss that you receive is not the gray deep clean, but rather the mint green one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, it breaks so often that I go through 2-4 pieces every time I floss, which effectively makes it 2-4 times as expensive.  </li>
      <li>so it feels like I&#x27;m flossing with a candle; the thick batch that makes it near-impossible to fit between my teeth</li>
      <li>The new one utilizes the same patients and technology, however, it seems the quality isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
      <li>The glides are thin enough to go through all my teeth, but are strong enough not to break while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Every time I use it, I tear up a little at it&#x27;s absolute beauty and perfection: a Lamborghini of dental floss with the class of a Rolls Royce.</li>
      <li>No thanks, I&#x27;m too lazy to clean a set of dentures, and I&#x27;m too broke to even contemplate getting a dental bridge.    </li>
      <li>It will absolutely ruin every single other brand of dental floss out there for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Crest and Oral B were both bought by proctor and gamble. This product is now labeled Oral B Glide Pro Health. Back when it was Crest, I never has floss shred or break. The new one utilizes the same patients and technology, however, it seems the quality isn&#x27;t the same. Still a 5 star product though.</li>
    <li> I almost lost my dental implant because of an infection. Then I tried Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss to floss around it daily. Two years have passed, and I have experienced no additional problems. The floss slides smoothly and cleans better than any other that I have used. If you have a dental implant, try this floss.  I also suggest the use of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection or Pro-Health Clinical Oral Rinse.</li>
    <li> This brand is terrible.  I purchased a multiple-pack and it tears every time I use it.  I would never buy this again. There are many better brands out there to choose from so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Watch out for this floss! It will absolutely ruin every single other brand of dental floss out there for you. It&#x27;s AWESOME and no other floss will compare. I ran out of this once and had to use some leftover brand from my ignorant days and I don&#x27;t know how I could ever stand to use the stupid, coarse, stringy, shredding floss that is other brands. I can never quit you, Crest Glide.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Glide for years, and every time I get something else, I regret it. The glides are thin enough to go through all my teeth, but are strong enough not to break while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package is a much better deal than in stores, and I received it in a timely fashion from the seller.</li>
    <li> Pretty good dental floss.  Doesn&#x27;t fray, slides in and out of teeth easily.  I&#x27;ve bought this several times now.</li>
    <li> This is mint floss, which I don&#x27;t find disclosed in the product description, and I can&#x27;t read from the image that it is either.</li>
    <li> Crest Deep Clean floss does NOT shred while you&#x27;re using it and has a sweet mint flavor.  It&#x27;s a little thicker than standard waxed floss (any brand) which makes it more effective in getting spaces between teeth clean the first pass instead of having to really manipulate like normal \\&quot;standard\\&quot; floss.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got all my wisdom teeth and need to have them out, because they&#x27;re crowding my mouth. Those toothy jerkwads. It has become harder to floss; as my teeth have slowly crowded closer together, regular floss has begun to shred like crazy between my molars. It&#x27;s annoying to be trying to clean back there and having to engineer the process carefully so that I don&#x27;t end up leaving behind tendrils of minty string.    Faced with this shredding problem, I decided it was easier to just not floss. Problem solved! I stopped for several months, and my brushing began to suffer as well. I know, right? Gross. Avoiding flossing isn&#x27;t an option anymore, though, because last time I went to the dentist, he told me I had gingivitis, then gave me a look like I was a dum*ss for not preventing it by taking better care of my teeth. Then his hygienist scraped the everloving crap out of all the little crevices of my mouth, and my gums stung for a week. I&#x27;ll accept that as the consequence of being a dumb*ss, especially given that even though I have access to clean water, dental hygiene supplies, and modern medicine, I didn&#x27;t bother with necessary maintenance until there was a real problem.    In search of the proper tools to make my dental hygiene more regular and less a hassle, I picked up some Crest Glide Deep Clean. It&#x27;s made such an improvement, I feel foolish for not buying it until just recently. This floss is strong, very smooth, and flat like a ribbon, which makes it both more comfortable to hold and able to slip down between teeth quite easily. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other dental flosses, but I would rather pay the extra money now on good floss than stop flossing altogether with all the consequences that would bring. Neglecting my dental hygiene for a few months brought on gingivitis; neglecting it longer could lead to losing my teeth. No thanks, I&#x27;m too lazy to clean a set of dentures, and I&#x27;m too broke to even contemplate getting a dental bridge.    This floss makes takingcare of my problem teeth ridiculously simple in every way. I won&#x27;t say it has completely changed my life for the better - I am still not a millionaire, my car is still a 12-year-old powder blue sedan with a malfunctioning CD player, and no one has swooped in from the future to take me on exciting adventures through history in their time machine - but it&#x27;s certainly improved it a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss in Cool Mint for years now and accidentally ran out last week. So we searched around and found some other Colgate floss and some generic floss from the Dentist to use until we could get more Glide Floss. The result was not pretty. The other floss cut into my gums and got stuck between teeth and shredded like crazy. It was just a very unpleasant experience. Plus the other floss was uncomfortable to hold. Glide floss is like a miracle in comparison. I also like the blast of mint each time you floss. This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I use floss after everything i eat and this is the best tasting and most efficient floss I have ever used-it is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is great floss. It&#x27;s strong, slips in between tight teeth and has enough friction to dislodge the nasty bits as well as sliding smoothly to clean below gum level. I&#x27;ve tried lots of floss and this is the best. Other brands sometimes split or shred on rough teeth and get stuck. This floss seems stronger so it either does not split or if you really force it, will break cleanly.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. Hey, we all hate flossing, don&#x27;t we? But I REALLY hate flossing. I hate wrapping the floss around my finger to get a grip, I abhor reaching to the back of my mouth to get the back teeth, I despise the clicking sound of the floss as it pops out from between the enamel. And then there&#x27;s all the problems with the gums, and the dentist recriminations of not flossing enough or properly or blah blah blah. I&#x27;ve been through all kinds of floss: starting with the dollar variety that is more wax than fiber so it feels like I&#x27;m flossing with a candle; the thick batch that makes it near-impossible to fit between my teeth and that is so coarse, it&#x27;s as if i&#x27;m trying to fell a toothy forest. And the ticker the floss, the more it digs into my fingers and the less likely it will fit comfortably into the toothy crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THIS stuff, this Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss, is astounding! From the first moment I opened the top, when the floss near-floated out on a soft tendril of air, as if an ephemeral elven lock of hair (you know that&#x27;s what hobbits and wizards use, right?) weaving it&#x27;s way to my mouth, I knew this was the floss for me. Soft, it is: minty, wraith-thin. Did I mention soft? How many flosses can you say are SOFT?! This one is. And strong, too. Like Teflon plumbing tape, only minty, and dental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use it, I tear up a little at it&#x27;s absolute beauty and perfection: a Lamborghini of dental floss with the class of a Rolls Royce. But I steel myself and get to business. It seems a shame to actually use this little strand of heaven, but it is for teeth, and for teeth it shall be used. From the moment I slip it between the tooths and begin working, the squeaks of clean minty goodness sound out: an angel&#x27;s chorus of plaque and gunk destruction. How many angels can dance on the top of a tooth? I don&#x27;t know, but if they are dancing, they&#x27;re using Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss as Olympic-caliber Ribbon Dancing! Add some pop-rocks, and I&#x27;d have an angelic disco in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this floss more highly. I expect that this floss will be put on the short list for canonization and soon people all over the world will be praying to Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss, Patron Saint of Good Dental Hygiene and Flossing the night before their checkups.elic disco in my mouth.

    <li> I really like this floss since it really does \\&quot;glide\\&quot; between your teeth. Didn&#x27;t know floss could be so expensive. Though, it might be a little cheaper at Costco.</li>
    <li> The Crest mint glide floss is great tasting and cleans the teeth really well while massaging the gums and not being shredded in the process.</li>
    <li> Great floss.  Feels so much better than the old standard string.  Its softer against the gums and seems to clean better to.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> At first try, I thought I&#x27;d found the perfect floss!   But it&#x27;s  not (at least not for me).    These floss breaks ALL TO OFTEN in my mouth, and is  really disappointing.    And... if there&#x27;s anything tough that gets caught between  my teeth - forget it.  I can not get it out with this floss,  it just keeps breaking.    I was forced to go back to using regular dental floss, which  is too bad because this floss feels so good to use.  I wish  they could make it STRONGER.  As is, this just doesn&#x27;t  work for me.</li>
    <li> great stuff have reviewed before</li>
    <li> Crest Glide has always been my favorite. The floss almost never get stuck in between my teeth and always leaves a fresh minty taste afterwards. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that works well for my tight teeth. It doesn&#x27;t shred, it goes in easily and doesn&#x27;t creep me out.</li>
    <li> These never break off in my mouth like some have. They taste GREAT. They also come in kewl little cases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that this product (formerly known as Gore-Tex) was the only floss that could get between my closely spaced teeth and remove the annoying bits of food that got stuck there.  Other flosses would always shred or wouldn&#x27;t even fit between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I hardly get on here to write a product review but believe me this floss is flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other flosses I&#x27;ve used I usually have to reel off a lot so I can clean my whole mouth, so the first time I used this I did that. I was surprised how much I was able to clean, how quickly and how little floss I needed to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, the product has a nice minty flavor and it will not break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s everything I was looking for in a floss and more; it is durable, efficient and tasty! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about cleaning your teeth - use this!</li>
    <li> I have used Glide for a number of years now and was looking to replace it with the same. Saw the new deep clean and the reviews lead me to giving this one a try. The best I have every used. Wraps around my finger and does not slip. It slides between my teeth very easy. Not sure how you could make a better floss. Try it, you will see.</li>
    <li> The floss works fine for most of my teeth, except for the one pair in the back, which are really close together, which has nothing to do with the seller.</li>
    <li> I look for a few simple things in my floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I don&#x27;t want it to shred&lt;br /&gt;2) I don&#x27;t want it to be stuck between my teeth&lt;br /&gt;3) I want it to do the cleaning&lt;br /&gt;4) I don&#x27;t want the flavoring on the floss to be too noticable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of different floss, and keep coming back to Glide Floss simply because it works the best.  It never shreds, it glides easily between my (tightly packed) teeth. You can do the cleaning in one pass, it digs out whatever happen to be stuck in there very well.  With other floss I feel I need to make a second pass sometimes, but not with Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavor: Glide comes in two packaging. Photo attached. One has silver packaging and one has grenish packaging. The silver packaging has no mint flavor, the greenish package has mint flavor (not terribly strong but noticeable).  The describe of the package for silver package mentioned \\&quot;deep protection\\&quot; and for green package mentions \\&quot;multi-protection\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t feel or see the difference between the two other than one has flavor and the other one does not.  I did not notice the mint flavor mentioned on the package. I have a slight preference for no flavor, so if I knew I would have picked the silver package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In term of price Glide is a little pricier than other floss.  To me it is worth it.  The best price on this 6 packs I found at Costco, especially when they run a coupon in their flyer. Amazon price is is decent, but fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter \\&quot;price history alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence or not? I noticed that when I use my Glide floss my hygienist compliments me on my flossing!</li>
    <li> I like Crest Glide floss and bought this because it was the lowest priced.  However, it breaks so often that I go through 2-4 pieces every time I floss, which effectively makes it 2-4 times as expensive.  This does not happen with the Crest Glide floss in the white cylinder packaging (109.4 yd), so I am switching back.</li>
    <li> Got sent the green variety with the nasty nasty \\&quot;glidestripe\\&quot; full of bulls-*** oil instead. Thanks for taking a perfectly good product and ruining it oral-b.    Update: So I don&#x27;t know what idiot at crest/oral-b decided that dousing the floss in rancid peperrmint or spearmint oil was going to improve it. Result - your mouth tingles and not in a good way, everything tastes like something you would never put in your mouth. After using the floss you now have to WASH your hands, because otherwise you might rub your eyes. This making the floss unusable at work or in the living room. Does the oil have an expiration date?</li>
    <li> The best floss for those of us who have closely spaced teeth.  This is the only floss that works for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted Crest Deep Clean dental floss and they sent me Oral B Glide Pro-Health. It may be the exact same product, but it&#x27;s not as described. Waste of time and resources.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product I realized it was the wrong version of Crest&#x27;s Glide. However, I am now completely sold on this it. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wider than most floss. I thought it would get stuck in my teeth. Nope. The wider floss cleans my teeth better than the thinner floss I was used to using. My teeth stay cleaner with this floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two packages left out of six and this is January 26, 2013. That means this product has lasted almost a year for one person.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, the floss that you receive is not the gray deep clean, but rather the mint green one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have zero issues with the flavor of the floss, but I do care about functionality of it. Glide floss in general is usually pretty good. I think my teeth are fairly close together and tend to shred all floss....this stuff is no different. As soon as I start flossing with the green floss, it breaks. I end up breaking it about 8 times during the course of flossing my entire mouth. It&#x27;s a pain in the arse and I HATE IT.  Just the color green makes me hate floss now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the picture shows gray, then the floss should follow the description. The green floss is better than regular floss so it gets 2 stars. Normal Crest Gray Deep Clean floss gets 5/5 stars. This is  just bad advertising.</li>
    <li> Shread upon contact with spaces between teeth. When willI find floss that requires 3 strands to finish the job?</li>
