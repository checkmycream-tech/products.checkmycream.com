      <li>My skin feels smooth, fresh and clean after.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results so far</li>
      <li>I do not use it like a full face mask; I use it on my once a month hormonal acne.  </li>
      <li>it works - before it was full of acne marks.</li>
      <li>This product is very good, didn&#x27;t  irritate  my face and left my face very soft and no breakouts.</li>
      <li>I feel that it clears up any acne quickly.  </li>
      <li>And quick.</li>
      <li>It was very soothing on my skin and made my face feel so smooth when I washed it off.</li>
      <li>(This might sound really like a no-no</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>but lately I&#x27;ve been getting more than my fair share of pimples and was looking for a product I could add to my skin care regimen.  </li>
      <li>It is worth to try.</li>
      <li>Right after he shaves he puts it on and leaves it on for about 10 - 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Can notice right away.</li>
      <li>I use once to twice a week and my sensitive oily skin looks so clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This is a product that does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s softer - fewer white heads - and a more even tone.  </li>
      <li>used a lot on my face, but I think it can actually be used more sparingly.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean, it really helps as an overnight spot treatment as well.</li>
      <li>It also works on large pores with junk in it.</li>
      <li>not least, no product will ever work effectively if we don&#x27;t provide the proper, natural care for our skin which means in addition to using this product, drink plenty of water - making sure that your water intake surpasses the consumption of all other beverages AND get plenty of rest.  </li>
      <li>My coworkers and friends have commented on how much smoother, clearer my skin is.</li>
      <li>It has really helped control the irritation and break out he would get from shaving.  </li>
      <li>This mask works really well for bringing the junk up to the surface.</li>
      <li>I promise you that this stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>It also works really well for drying up the blemishes.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>I bought for my daughter and it works very well.</li>
      <li>and it really does extract the dirt from your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I switched from acne free brand and will never go back.  </li>
      <li>Works better than any other product for my skin.</li>
      <li>So you can imagine how hesitant I am to try ANYTHING new on my face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s helped with my acne, but my skin always feels nice and soft afterwards at least.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>This product is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought that actually works.</li>
      <li>Overall this product has worked better than any other product i&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>This is the real secret to beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>It fades old marks as well as new ones.</li>
      <li>, we washed it off to reveal soft clear skin!</li>
      <li>My 16 yr old used it and after 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Overall I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I never had acne as a teenager but now as an adult, I get it.  </li>
      <li>This product does the trick - my only suggestion, especially if you have sensitive skin, is to follow the directions carefully and be sure to not leave the mask on for longer than 10 minutes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s helped with my acne, but my skin always feels nice and soft afterwards at least.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Murad Acne Clarifying Mask from Warehouse Deals: they sell old products.  The expiration date was three months from date of receipt and there is no way I would ever finish this bottle before it expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this product and will buy it from a store rather than have this happen again.</li>
    <li> It dries out acne but will not completely eradicate it! Great overnight spot treatment though</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try as I&#x27;ve had quite a few breakouts lately.  After several uses, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything for my skin.  Waste of money for me :-(</li>
    <li> I suffer from monthly breakouts starting the week before my period. I use this as a spot treatment and wear it overnight. It does seem to help dry out the pimples a little, but it doesn&#x27;t make them disappear. I have friends that swear by this product. Topical treatments have never worked at all for me in the past. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it does seems to help a little - more than any other spot treatment I&#x27;ve tried, including expensive prescription ones. It&#x27;s not a miracle treatment but it does help. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try, especially if your skin has been receptive to topical solutions in the past. It might be better to try and get a free sample to see if it works for you before paying full price for a whole tube. I&#x27;ve heard they carry samples of this at Sephora.</li>
    <li> I use this mask as a spot treatment overnight and it works miracles. Zits are practically cleared up by the time I wake up.</li>
    <li> This is a product that does exactly what it says.  I use it about once per week and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  I don&#x27;t have skin problems but lately I&#x27;ve been getting more than my fair share of pimples and was looking for a product I could add to my skin care regimen.  This product does the trick - my only suggestion, especially if you have sensitive skin, is to follow the directions carefully and be sure to not leave the mask on for longer than 10 minutes.  Also, I find that it&#x27;s not really a good cleanser, so if you have oily skin you might want to wash your face first using a very small amount of your normal cleanser, rinse, and then apply the mask at the end of your day.  The mask will get rid of the pimples and slow down their desire to form and the results should be noticeable in the morning.  Last but not least, no product will ever work effectively if we don&#x27;t provide the proper, natural care for our skin which means in addition to using this product, drink plenty of water - making sure that your water intake surpasses the consumption of all other beverages AND get plenty of rest.  This is the real secret to beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> Murad products are always great to use.</li>
    <li> Skin is visibly brighter. Fights acne. Can notice right away.</li>
    <li> Helps heal acne. Takes the redness and swelling away. Realty helped relieve some old stubborn cystic acne and old red marks.  I use it as a spot treatment</li>
    <li> The Clarifying mask helps prevent my face from breaking out and keeps my skin looking great I really love the line of products by Murad :)</li>
    <li> When I have a really bad acne break-out, I will dot this mask on a couple of times a week and it always helps clear everything up much faster without making me peel like benzoyl peroxide does.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use this on average 2-3 times a week with my facial moisturizer.  My acne has been reduced by at least half.  I also no longer get infected acne.  I switched from acne free brand and will never go back.  The smell is less harsh and it&#x27;s less drying than my previous brand.  I would definitely recommend.  I also use before bedtime so the leftover smell wears away.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I use this every other day. Smells nice and works quickly and well.  As good as fancy products.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, my face really cleared up of acne and my face has even toned and looks &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;! I use once every few days then i follow with toner and a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Love this Acne Mask.  Been using the product for two weeks now and have noticed an improvement on my face.</li>
    <li> I put some of this in a small, air tight container so I don&#x27;t waste any by squeezing too much out of the tube and use it as a spot concealer or over larger areas and just leave it on all night while I sleep. If it&#x27;s getting dried out in the container, I add a little water. It lasts a really long time that way. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for acne over many years, and this is by far the most effective product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mask! It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean, it really helps as an overnight spot treatment as well.</li>
    <li> just wanted to say that the sulpher smell is like gunpowder/fireworks, rather than the rotten eggs smell.&lt;br /&gt;I actually kind of like the smell of this. Seems to be tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a lot on my face, but I think it can actually be used more sparingly. Has a good glide to it compared&lt;br /&gt;to some clay masks where you have to smooth out the chunks of clay on your face.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it. I had adult acne and I got a facial where the Murad products were used. I am so please with the results of my skin about using this for less than a month.</li>
    <li> This is the only Murad product I like.  Works nice.  If I have a troublesome blemish this helps shrink it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old woman and have been suffering from cystic acne for a couple years now.  I never had acne as a teenager but now as an adult, I get it.  Mostly it&#x27;s on my jaw line and it comes and goes.  Anyway, I was given a sample tube of Murad Clarifying Mask when I was at Sephora the other day.  I broke out yesterday along my jaw line so I decided to try it tonight to see if it would do anything.  The welts were really big and gross!  I washed my face and then put the mask on.  I left it on for about ten minutes and then washed it off.  Wow!  I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!  The acne on my jaw line was significantly reduced to almost nothing.  My face feels so smooth and my pores look great.  I decided to use the mask as a spot treatment overnight to see if the acne would be gone in the morning.  I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results so far, I can&#x27;t wait to go back to Sephora and buy the whole Murad skincare line.  I just read another review where someone else uses it as a spot treatment as well and they seem to love it.  If you suffer from acne, try this stuff, you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle. I&#x27;ve had issues since I was 10 when I hit puberty. This product is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought that actually works. And quick. It fades old marks as well as new ones. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Murad Mask!!! It was very soothing on my skin and made my face feel so smooth when I washed it off. It did not make my face dry at all which I was surprised by. I will continue using this and will buy more once I am out.</li>
    <li> My son loves it!  Best skin care product!</li>
    <li> Works better than any other product for my skin. I have cystic acne and this has done wonders.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, didn&#x27;t  irritate  my face and left my face very soft and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne, but after seeing an asthetician for a year and using murad products, I no longer have as many breakouts and when i do have a bad breakout, I use this mask.  It does have a smell that lingers on your skin thats sulfur like if you use it like a mask, even after moisterizing.  However, I find the best use of this to be if you get a really red cystic breakout, you can use it to spot treat your acne before bed and leave it on the affected areas all night and the swelling from the inflammation does subside by morning.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this so it lasts awhile, which makes me feel better about the price of it. Then shower, use your normal cleansers, treatments and moisterizers and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> Very good, I should have bought the whole kit. I knew the murad products are good but not awesome.  my daughters´skin looks better - it works - before it was full of acne marks. It is worth to try.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It is absolutely amazing! I have acne prone sensitive skin that is dry and my pores clog easily. I use this about three times a week  nightly and it really does extract the dirt from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place a think layer on my clean, towel dried face and leave it on for about 10 minutes. I rinse well with water and apply my face lotion. My skin feels smooth, fresh and clean after. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it helps clear my complexion.</li>
    <li> I do my routine with the Murad Acne Complex Kit and than follow up with this mask. My skin feels wonderful following this treatment</li>
    <li> I gave a 4 star because i have to use it every week for 3 consecutive days in order to keep my face pimple free. It dries my skin and it&#x27;s because I over use it. There is one thing that i like, that it gets rid of the red scars i get from old pimples. Overall this product has worked better than any other product i&#x27;ve bought. I would definately would recommend this to anyone who suffers from acne.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I use it to help pimples as a spot treatment and ally it overnight once a month. I am 32 and have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> The secret in this mask? SULPHUR! I&#x27;m serious! And it&#x27;s just enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. I actually use this mask as an overnight mask. I use a thin layer and sleep with it on and 99% of the time pimples and redness are gone by morning. This product rocks! I just wish Murad would make a daily moisturizer with sulphur content.</li>
    <li> This is a clay mask that I squeeze then cut open the plastic tube to get the very last drop of the product out.  It is the best clay mask that I have tried.  I use it once a week for deep cleansing or once or twice during the week to combine it with my Glo Therapeutics Acne Cleanser to have a spa experience.  This product will draw the impurities from your skin to provide a deep cleaning of problem skin. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My 20 year old son uses this product.  Right after he shaves he puts it on and leaves it on for about 10 - 15 minutes.  It has really helped control the irritation and break out he would get from shaving.  I would recommend it to anyone having trouble with their skin breaking out or getting irritated after shaving.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t get everything out though but helps draw out impurities.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week but I&#x27;m not noticing anything different about my face.  I leave it on for thirty minutes before showering the day that I do my microdermabrasion treatments.  I got this to help prevent breakouts but it hasn&#x27;t done that so far.  Someone suggested using it as a spot treatment overnight for singular pimples but it didn&#x27;t help with that, either.  After this tube I&#x27;ll probably try another product.</li>
    <li> I have had inflammatory adult acne for years. I put it on a few times a week overnight and the next morning my pimples have shrunken, redness less, and overall clearer. This is the only acne product I use currently. I don&#x27;t use any acne cleansers or spot treatment (this is my spot treatment as well). (This might sound really like a no-no but I sometimes squeeze painful, bulging pimples and then I put Murad clay mask on overnight.) It also works on large pores with junk in it. I got off my 2nd round of Accutane over 2 years ago. My coworkers and friends have commented on how much smoother, clearer my skin is. I recommended this clay mask to a teenage son of my colleague and her son&#x27;s skin after a few weeks of Murad sulfur clay mask improved too and he stopped having bigger whiteheads. I also told a friend about it and it also worked on her cystic acne. Totally worth it! A tube lasts for months.</li>
    <li> I have hyper-sensitive skin. I mean if I touch my hand to my face - my face will turn red.  So you can imagine how hesitant I am to try ANYTHING new on my face. My mother had always told me about the benefits of sulfur so I reluctantly ordered this product. I cannot even tell you with only one application how much better my skin looks. It&#x27;s softer - fewer white heads - and a more even tone.  I promise you that this stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> This product as recommended to me by my esthetician.  It works great!  I do not use it like a full face mask; I use it on my once a month hormonal acne.  I put it on the effected area at night and sleep with it on and in the morning I put it on under my sun tan lotion and rub it in to my skin.  This product literally draws the stuff in your pimple out!  I am personally a picker so I put this product on, the same day or next morning it has either drawn out the white head to pop or has dissolved the entire pimple.  Plus a big bonus is this product does not leave your skin irritated or dry!</li>
    <li> I use this 1-3 times per week to help with my adult acne and reducing red marks.  Sulfer masks are great for this purpose, but there&#x27;s always that smell to contend with!  This mask is the best I&#x27;ve used so far, in regard to not smelling like eggs!  It has a nice lavender scent that masks the sulfer smell nicely.  It noticeably improves my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for adult and teens alike. I used it once and noticed immediate drastic difference. My 16 yr old used it and after 20 minutes, we washed it off to reveal soft clear skin! It was shocking how instant the results were. I recommend this mask to anyone with combination, acne prone, and oily skin type. Use 1-2 times per week and leave on for 20 min(not 10).</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter and it works very well. All Murad products I truly recommend, my daughters´skin looks better,&lt;br /&gt;thus she is takeing a medicine to improve her metabolism, but this product was the best choice.</li>
    <li> Seriously one of the only products to actually help my acne.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect addition to my at-home facials.  I clean my face, then steam it, and then apply this mask.  After the mask, I moisturize and my face just glows - no makeup needed.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve used.  My skin looks and feels like I just left the spa.  My skin looks better immediately and my pores, what pores?  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin and good spot treatment for overnight!  I use once to twice a week and my sensitive oily skin looks so clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Overall I really like this product. I use it at night for spot treatments and sometimes over entire face for 10-15 minutes.  I feel that it clears up any acne quickly.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works exactly but i believe it absorbs the pore clogging dirt.  Whatever the case, this works great for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I dont have a basis of comparison.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for me. I saw no change. I am scheduled to see a Dermatologist. I am a senior, and for me to have acne&lt;br /&gt;is horrible. This product did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!  I have used it once a week and it feels refreshing after the first application. I am writing this review after using it 3 times... and I noticed my small acne bump disappears (reduces in size) the very next day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for myself and my teenage son. It has been very effective for both of us. It goes a long way toward clearing up my son&#x27;s teen acne and helps to keep my oily skin clear. I also use other Murad products on a daily basis, but my son usually does not. If you need a deeper treatment than your daily cleanser, this mask works well. If you are prone to breakouts, you might want to give yourself a few days after using in case this brings deeper impurities up to the surface as breakouts after first use. (So if you have school pictures or a big event, use this a few days in advance to ensure clearer skin the day of the event.) I can usually find Murad products on Amazon for less than it is sold in stores or spas.</li>
    <li> This mask works really well for bringing the junk up to the surface. It also works really well for drying up the blemishes.</li>
