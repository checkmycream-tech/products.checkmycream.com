<li> Other removers are either too oily or too dry or a lot of rubbing is required.  </li>
<li> but it irritates my eyes and leaves a film that over time causes me to develop blepharitis which I&#x27;ve gotten a few times from these types of cream removers.</li>
<li> Love this for removing annoying eye make up with out irritating eyes!</li>
<li> Even if I ordered through an Avon representative I would still have to pay shipping which stinks.  </li>

    <li> I used to use this because it was so cheap like 99 cents a bottle.

    <li> This is the only eyemakeup remover I will use.  I received a sample of it years ago and even though I&#x27;ve tried other, much more expensive removers, this is still the best.

Plus you cannot beat the price!</li>
