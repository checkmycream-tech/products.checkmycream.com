      <li>Great for sensitive skin, rashes, eczema, ect.</li>
      <li>I bought the travel kit and loved the smell so much.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, lathers good, and does not have chemicals like other soaps.  </li>
      <li>Should have read the fine print.</li>
      <li>Especially gentle on face</li>

      <li>Normally I can&#x27;t wear any kind of perfumes or strong smelling soaps</li>
      <li>It lathers sooo easily and there is no gritty substance; it  rinses very clean and leaves my skin just as nice as the \\&quot;concoction\\</li>
      <li>This soap smells heavenly, and lathers richly.</li>
      <li>The smell is just heavenly and my skin feels clean when I rinse off.</li>
      <li>The soap is really great for dry winter skin.  </li>
      <li>I purchased it because I love the lip balm so much</li>
      <li>This product has become my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild but still exfoliates.  </li>
      <li>I gave this a 5 star rating first its Paraben -free</li>
      <li>Maybe if it came in a package of two, I would order it again but otherwise, just wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
      <li>The bar is a little smaller than I thought but it is great soap!</li>
      <li>The only down side was that is that it is much more smaller than I thought it was going to be, but because the quality is so wonderful</li>
      <li>but you may want to try this 2.75 oz first.</li>
      <li>this  bar soap really makes your skin feel smooth and soft would recommend t his to my friends and family</li>
      <li>Because its made with &amp;#34;all the good stuff, none of the bad stuff&amp;#34; I feel good about using it, and its a necessity in my home.</li>
      <li>Works very well and smells natural and clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend and will continue to use this product!</li>
      <li>the Honey is an antibacterial that protects against skin moisture loss and the rolled oats that you can see in the bar is for gentle exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I really wish I could buy this stuff somewhere.</li>
      <li>yes maybe I didn&#x27;t exercise full diligence, but they definitely are trying to mislead.</li>
      <li>This is a family favorite compared to other natural soaps we have used</li>
      <li>I personally prefer the Naked Bee over Burts Bee as I feel the body wash is to strong with all the mix of scents going on.</li>
      <li>This soap has an absolutely divine scent, appears to be a gentle exfoliator, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without the unwanted residue some soaps leave behind.  </li>
      <li>Use this soap for my toddler whose skin is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>the bars are super tiny, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I even use it on my 7 month old.</li>
      <li>I always try to purchase all natural products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been pulverizing oatmeal and mixing it with powdered goats milk as a natural face wash.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable for the quality of product, and it doesnt leave hard to clean soapy residue on the tub or soap holder.</li>
      <li>Only thing wrong with it is that I didn&#x27;t order more!</li>
      <li>this is a small bar but last along time the beeswax helps with this lasting longer this has palm and coconut oils for a rich lather compared to other natural soaps</li>
      <li>I may later change the star rating, up or down depending on how much I like t then.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to rate it properly but so far I like it a lot.</li>

<li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to rate it properly but so far I like it a lot.</li>
<li> I have tired so many other soaps (body and hands)</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to form an opinion.  </li>
<li> Long lasting.</li>
<li> The only downside is the price and that the bars don&#x27;t last as long as other store bought soaps.</li>
<li> It also says that it will last a long time for such a little bar</li>
<li> The soap is not drying but it still won&#x27;t replace moisturizer for those with dry skin.</li>
<li> and it does&#x27;t dry my skin out, or make it oily.</li>
<li> It has a rough texture so it gets the dry skin off too.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it was much smaller than I anticipated.  </li>
<li> but I doubt I will do so again for the soap...just too extravagant of a purchase for such a small bar.</li>
<li> and there was only one small square.  </li>
<li> A little small, I wish they had a bigger size.</li>
<li> Its about 2x2 and less than an inch think.</li>
<li> This is one of the few products that I can use on my daughter who has eczema.</li>
<li> Downside, for the price you get so much less!</li>
<li> The only negative is the bar is small and a poor value given the price.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d scoop out a small amount, add water to make a paste, slop it on my face, and rinse off with a cloth - - and then pick bits of oatmeal out of my hairline and rinse oatmeal off my washcloth and out of my sink.</li>
<li> The bar of soap was about a 2x2 square that was around an inch thick.  </li>
<li> It is very expensive which is unfortunate</li>
<li> Disappointed with the portioning of this item</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well and smells natural and clean.</li>
    <li> this  bar soap really makes your skin feel smooth and soft would recommend t his to my friends and family</li>
    <li> The smell is just heavenly and my skin feels clean when I rinse off. No residue. My only dissappointment was the size. I thought that they would be closer to standard bars of soap but it is the same as the travel size.</li>
    <li> I thought i was getting three bars and there was only one small square.  YIKES.&lt;br /&gt;I love their products and the honey/citris scent.  But I won&#x27;t order again.  Should have read the fine print.</li>
    <li> This bar has a wonderful strong scent that lingers long after you have washed. It also says that it will last a long time for such a little bar so I am definitely looking forward to that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an \\&quot;earth mother\\&quot; but some of my friends were doing the \\&quot;beauty secrets of the bible\\&quot; so I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been pulverizing oatmeal and mixing it with powdered goats milk as a natural face wash. I&#x27;d scoop out a small amount, add water to make a paste, slop it on my face, and rinse off with a cloth - - and then pick bits of oatmeal out of my hairline and rinse oatmeal off my washcloth and out of my sink. My son found this soap at a local store and bought it for me to try. It&#x27;s obviously quicker &amp; easier! It lathers sooo easily and there is no gritty substance; it  rinses very clean and leaves my skin just as nice as the \\&quot;concoction\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using. I am going to investigate more of these products!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap!  I am so happy to use it, to smell it and to give it as gifts.  This time the box was open on both ends.  I don&#x27;t know how but both bars made it to Puerto Rico (still shaking my head)!</li>
    <li> AMAZING SOAP! Great for sensitive skin, rashes, eczema, ect. I use this one my face twice a day and it does&#x27;t dry my skin out, or make it oily. The price is reasonable for the quality of product, and it doesnt leave hard to clean soapy residue on the tub or soap holder. I highly recommend and will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to rate it properly but so far I like it a lot. And unlike other oatmeal soaps I have tried this one smells nice, not like perfume  just a nice pleasant smell. I may later change the star rating, up or down depending on how much I like t then.</li>
    <li> This soap smells heavenly, and lathers richly. Because its made with &amp;#34;all the good stuff, none of the bad stuff&amp;#34; I feel good about using it, and its a necessity in my home.</li>
    <li> love the scent and doesn&#x27;t bother my eczema</li>
    <li> Smells good, lathers good, and does not have chemicals like other soaps.  The only downside is the price and that the bars don&#x27;t last as long as other store bought soaps.</li>
    <li> Misleading product image and description.  Description says soaps, and product image has 5 bars in it.... yes maybe I didn&#x27;t exercise full diligence, but they definitely are trying to mislead.</li>
    <li> Love the honey fragrance!</li>
    <li> This stuff. Oh my gosh. If you want baby skin after one use, buy this product. It has careful ingredients that work well with all skin types, even ones sensitive to things like fragrance. It may be a bit smaller than a regular soap bar, but it definitely makes up it&#x27;s size in its quality.</li>
    <li> My sister and I discovered the products on a trip to the West Coast and then wanted to continue using them.  I have really enjoyed the products and will continue them.</li>
    <li> This soap has the best scent. It has a rough texture so it gets the dry skin off too. Just wish the bar was bigger!</li>
    <li> This came as part of a gift basket I received recently. This soap has an absolutely divine scent, appears to be a gentle exfoliator, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without the unwanted residue some soaps leave behind.  It is also non-drying. The only negative is the bar is small and a poor value given the price.</li>
    <li> I really wish I could buy this stuff somewhere. I&#x27;ve only ever seen it in a gas station in virginia. I bought the travel kit and loved the smell so much.  The soap is really great for dry winter skin.  Normally I can&#x27;t wear any kind of perfumes or strong smelling soaps but this stuff doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This soap seems to be moisturizing.  It has a nice light scent and lathers well.  Lasts longer than most soaps.  I will reorder this.  It comes in larger bars, too.</li>
    <li> Nice feel and fragrance.  Lathers good.  My only complaint is that it was much smaller than I anticipated.  Probably will not order again for that reason.</li>
    <li> This soap was so wonderful that it definitely deserved five stars, yes it is that amazing. I have tired so many other soaps (body and hands) and this one takes the cake. The only down side was that is that it is much more smaller than I thought it was going to be, but because the quality is so wonderful it&#x27;s okay. This soap is a definite must have! I also think that this soap would be amazing for the winter.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating first its Paraben -free no dyes or pigments ,Gluten free etc this is a small bar but last along time the beeswax helps with this lasting longer this has palm and coconut oils for a rich lather compared to other natural soaps the Honey is an antibacterial that protects against skin moisture loss and the rolled oats that you can see in the bar is for gentle exfoliation.This also has a wonderful scent very light smells like orange.This is a family favorite compared to other natural soaps we have used .There is a bigger bar of this soap if you prefer that but you may want to try this 2.75 oz first.I personally prefer the Naked Bee over Burts Bee as I feel the body wash is to strong with all the mix of scents going on.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell and moisturizes my skin nicely.Especially gentle on face area.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice lather also so relaxing in the bath.</li>
    <li> I love the soap and the smell is wonderful! The lather is great for washing hands but the fragrance is a bit too strong for me to use as a body soap. The bar is a little smaller than I thought but it is great soap!</li>
    <li> This product has become my absolute favorite. It smells great. A little small, I wish they had a bigger size.</li>
    <li> Best soap. Good quality.  Long lasting. Wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> What a lovely smelling soap.  It&#x27;s mild but still exfoliates.  Only thing wrong with it is that I didn&#x27;t order more!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies to many products, soaps and perfumes.  I always try to purchase all natural products.  This product is wonderful, it smells nice and the smell lasts for a long time, it lathers and cleans well.  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I just love this Orange blossom scent!  I was given the hand wash as a gift and couldn&#x27;t wait to purchase more the minute I ran out!  I also added the hand lotion and a bar soap.</li>
    <li> Use this soap for my toddler whose skin is very sensitive. Downside, for the price you get so much less! Why? Its about 2x2 and less than an inch think. Disappointed with the portioning of this item but I love this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to form an opinion.  The bar of soap was about a 2x2 square that was around an inch thick.  Had a nice smell and lathered nicely.  It lasted for about a week with both my husband and I using it.  Maybe if it came in a package of two, I would order it again but otherwise, just wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.  Use all their products.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling and quality soap but the bars are super tiny, especially for the price. I purchased it because I love the lip balm so much but I doubt I will do so again for the soap...just too extravagant of a purchase for such a small bar.</li>
