<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell great! Husband loves this brand</li>
    <li> Great soap for shaving. It takes a few times to get the lather right; sometimes it is just like soap residue and goes away. If you work it into a froth, though, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> Good soap. Scents are done well, not overpowering. Doesn&#x27;t produce the most lather ever, but works well. Good lubrication. Not that it matters but the packaging is entertaining, I love vintage themed things.</li>
    <li> not our usual brand but my husband has enjoyed the change</li>
    <li> Smells nice and lathers well</li>
    <li> I bought this almost a year ago, and I am still using them now.  These soaps are not just fantastically scented (both my wife and I love the scents), they last forever as well, and they come in a container that makes my soap dish irrelevant at this time (which is good, since my 23 month old son threw it and broke it a few months ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this brand of soap once I run out, as I have never been more pleased, nor did I know I could be so pleased, with shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Not bad,just have to see how long it last</li>
    <li> This a great product. It lathers well and has a nice smell. I bought the variety pack so I could try the different aromas. I didn&#x27;t realize how long these would last. With this variety pack I now have enough soap to last me 937 years or equal to 257,312 shaves.</li>
    <li> This is certainly serviceable shaving soap. It lathers up easily enough, although it does seem to have a very narrow band of &amp;#34;perfection&amp;#34; - it took a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s better than some brands I&#x27;ve tried. The sents aren&#x27;t horrible, they&#x27;re all subtle enough that even if they weren&#x27;t pretty decent, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s tough to beat the price for something that works.</li>
    <li> These soaps create great lather with my shaving brush. I like the variety pack, and the scents bring back memories of old fashioned barber shops for me. Good deal, great product.</li>
    <li> Nice four pack of shaving soap!</li>
    <li> If you use an old fashion shaving brush this product is the very best for lathering up before shaving and soap does not evaporate or disappear. Makes shaving a pleasure.</li>
    <li> My husband, who doesn&#x27;t like heavy scents, loves all of these. They lather well and protect as they should.</li>
    <li> First time ever using soap. I usually use creams or gels with and without a brush. These soap pucks are amazing. They smell great but don&#x27;t over power your senses. It lathers up quickly &amp; feels great on your face. After I shaved and rinsed off my face it felt clean &amp; my den felt tight. I decided not to use after shave to test the after effect of it and it still feels great. This is so good that it doesn&#x27;t require an after shave. If you rake too long to shave you might need to re-lather because it might dry up. But that is not a big deal. They have been around for 100+ years with good reason. I used a Gillette razor that I have used over 12 times to test how well the lather would allow me to easily glide the razor over my face. Suppressing lye the razor moved without effort, I didn&#x27;t need a pre shave oil, I did not get any razor burn/ irritation. Great product &amp; would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great selection and good sizes for a good price. My husband loved them</li>
    <li> I started using the lime puck around the end of August and it is still going. I am daily shaver. I will never buy a 4 pack again...soaps up nice and provides a nice lubricant for a decent shave. I don&#x27;t like it as much as some of the other shave soaps I have tried, but I think I&#x27;ll be using these for the next 16-32 months.</li>
    <li> Provides a good lasting lather that stays until I am done shaving.  Much better than the otc in my area.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; are ok, for some reason I went through the BayRum rather fast.  Lime smelled the best to me but that&#x27;s my 2 cents on it.  Col. Conk makes awesome soap though, foams up great!</li>
    <li> These soaps are great. They leave my face feeling clean and hydrated--probably a result of the use of glycerin. The foaming action is pretty good too. I&#x27;d like to point out that none of the soaps leave a lasting scent. The only one who will smell it is you, while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;On an aside, I like to heat the soap pucks in a bowl (in a microwave, 15 seconds on high) and then pour the soap into my shaving cup. This way the soap perfectly conforms to my cup after it cools.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving soap. It lathers well and I like thickness of the lather when applied to my skin. I wish the lather would last longer before it started to stiffen but this may be due to a cooler restroom in my older restroom.&lt;br /&gt;I would by this for friends regardless of whether they used a double edge razor like me or not.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of soap, good aroma that is not overpowering, excellent rich and long lasting lather.  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> Interesting mix of scents.</li>
    <li> These soaps last me a long time and they smell awesome.  They create a great lather and shave like a dream.  My skin gets pretty dry after shaving so I use a balm to compensate.  Great Shave soaps though for the price.</li>
    <li> Good shave soap. Had mixed feelings at first, seems like on first use it doesn&#x27;t lather all that great. However if you add a little water and let it soak in to the soap one day ahead of first use it works superbly. If I wrote a review after my first use it probably would of been bad. So be sure to presoak the soap.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave soap, love the variety pack, I can try them all!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer.  He loved it.</li>
    <li> I love col. conk soap. The scents are appealing and it&#x27;s easy to make lather.like their products!</li>
    <li> Smell great and works great but not my favorite soap to use.</li>
    <li> I gave these a try instead of my usual Proraso or Taylor of Old Bond Street. I like the fact that they fit perfectly in my shaving mug without having to nuke them to fit. Just soak my badger hair brush in hot water for a minute or so and load up the brush with some lather. You don&#x27;t need to create a big thick lather in the bowel. Just get enough on the brush and work up the lather on your face. I like this brand and when I use them up will most likely order them again.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product.</li>
    <li> There is so much shaving soap in the bathroom, I&#x27;m not sure about my husband&#x27;s reaction to these. No complaints and he never hesitates to gripe.</li>
    <li> Great soap, good fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t stick with you all day - although you might wish it would.</li>
    <li> I know this soap is either hate or love but I had no problems getting this to lather up and the smells are good ..... Mr and my wife noticed the lime one smell like jello haha but it isn&#x27;t a bad scent</li>
    <li> a great value for the money, does a great job for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fair shaving soap. It doesn&#x27;t lather that well. Just ok.</li>
    <li> For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.  While it is softer and you go through it faster than other shave soaps, it&#x27;s also easier to get soap onto your brush.  And the high amount of glycerin, which I imagine makes the soap softer, also makes for a very smooth save.  The scents are there, they smell OK, but once in a lather they aren&#x27;t very strong.  This may be for you, but I prefer to be overwhelmed with the scent as I am shaving, it adds to the experience for me.  That&#x27;s why I deducted one star.  Most other soaps I have used have a strong enough scent that I am still smelling them after the shave is over.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the lime scented soap so I cannot comment on the other fragrances, but the lime smells....... like lime.  The only thing I can compare this to is the Proraso soap that is also available here on Amazon.  Long story short there is no comparison between the two.  The C. Conk works into a lather much easier than the Proraso, and feels much creamier when applied to your face.  The Conk also leaves a slight slippery film after washed from your face which makes quick touch ups possible.  All and all a great buy!</li>
    <li> This was bought for someone else but the feedback I got was very favorable or positive and this person has been using shave soaps for years</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now without disappointment. Saved a ton of cash on shaving cream and will be using for as long as it is produced. Great shave ,</li>
    <li> Just get them you&#x27;ll be happy you did</li>
    <li> These work great if your into glycerin soap. They build great lather with minimal water. They also smell really good! The scent seems to last all day on my face. I gave it 4 stars because they melt a lot faster than other soaps I have used in the past. Maybe its because they are glycerin. Not sure.</li>
    <li> For a first soap, I really enjoy Colonel Conk. My experience yields that it&#x27;s pretty darn thirsty, but once you know how to work with it, you can make a pretty fantastic lather. The scents, while great, are lost almost immediately after you&#x27;re done shaving. If the scent lasted longer, I doubt I would ever need to buy more soap within this decade. The stuff seems to last almost forever, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you can find better soaps. But for the money, I think that this is really great stuff.</li>
    <li> Pretty good soap. Seems to require a little more water but then lathers well. Pretty good cushion, good lubrication - dries a little quicker on the face than others but a decent quality soap. Scents are subtle but nice</li>
    <li> Great price, great value</li>
    <li> Good quality, great smell.  You need to use a brush with these, but they do an excellent job.  I enjoy them, and they really helped with the razor burn I had from using the cheap stuff.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Each 2.5 oz puck lasts me about 20 shaves including head shaves which use more soap, All the scents are great. I love the Almond and Lime.&lt;br /&gt;I place the puck into a coffee mug and lather it there and continue with a face lather. However, for best results when I have a little more time I lather the brush in the mug and continue the lather in a bowl.</li>
    <li> I use these soaps with the Colonel Conk travel case and a straight razor for daily shaving.  These soaps lather quickly with a badger brush and perfectly fit the travel case.  My only bone with them is that instead of pressing out of the plastic packaging directly into the travel case, one needs to press them out of the packaging and then insert the bottom into the case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Bay Rum soap twice so far, but I like how it lathers up and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
    <li> lathers well and gives a good shave long lasting lather and a pleasant smell last for a month or moor in the shaving mug</li>
    <li> Nice shave soap. Lathers well and seems to protect bettter than the Poraso I was using. The almond smells best in my opinion,  but all scents are pleasant and not over powering.</li>
    <li> Ordered it on Saturday and it was here on Monday.  This long lasting shaving soap is wonderful.  It lathers well and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t using these soaps your retarded.  They last for months and months and work much better than any normal commercialized shaving cream.  Obviously a shaving brush is required, but now that I use one I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to putting on shaving cream by hand.</li>
    <li> Ive only used the Lime soap so far but am pleased with the lather and the shave. Good soap, but there are better options out there if you want to spend the money.</li>
    <li> This are great! Really enjoy the smell of them</li>
    <li> These are great shaving soaps. They have a mild aroma that leaves a pleasant smell after shaving. The soap is nice and smooth when foamed with a shaving brush. I have only used one of the scents so far but am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I was not compensated for my review and the opinions are 100% my own. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap I have ever used. Way better than Shaving cream or foam. I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> These lather okay. I usually put water on it for a good 2-3 minutes. Dump it out, then start loading my brush. I&#x27;m fairly inexperienced yet and can&#x27;t always get a great lather. I love the difference scents. One bar lasted quite a while for me shaving 2-3 times per week.</li>
    <li> It have a really good smell and is very easy to work in to a lather. My wife loves the lime.</li>
    <li> This is a quality shaving soap that works itself into a nice lather. It does dry somewhat quickly, but this has not caused a disturbance within my normal routine. The sent is not overpowering and does not last long, but I have found all four to be pleasant while shaving. The soap allows for a nice smooth shave and allows for minimum tug. I found this product to be well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great soap to shave with.</li>
    <li> Grate product. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the sample pack. My favorite is the Rum bay.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave...I admit it. It isn&#x27;t my favorite duty, and I generally put it off to just once or twice a week. I&#x27;m also not good about trimming my beards and mustaches that grow, so they tend to grow wild, but that is a different review. I&#x27;m not sure why I don&#x27;t like to shave, but usually end up with nicks and cuts, and a rough fine sandpaper on my face. I also didn&#x27;t like spending 30 dollars on a set of reusable razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone recommended I use a straight edge razor. After a little research, and reading some recommendations, I decided to try a safety razor first to practice before making a leap into the full on straight edge. Admittedly, I just picked up a cheap soap, brush, and bowl set along with my Merkur razor. It was nicer than before, but still didn&#x27;t motivate me to shave very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Christmas I asked for some different soaps and received this set along with some others, and a badger hair brush. I first tried a sandlewood scented one, and definitely liked the texture and scent, but it didn&#x27;t improve my shaving experience. I tried another, and finally tried the almond Glycerin soap in this pack. I have to say, the experience is totally different. You can feel the difference in the razor gliding over the skin. I&#x27;ve actually shaved 3 times in the last 4 days, still get a number of cuts on my neck though. Part of the enjoyment is the ritual of creating your own lather that comes with this kind of shaving. I have to say this the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. Definitely upgrade your soap to this if you made the same mistake I did about going with a generic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all soaps are created equal.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and the price was great !</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of delivery date,  lathers, and smells great</li>
    <li> They do not smell as amazing as razorock but still smell pretty good. I get a pretty good lather out of them. Pretty slick.</li>
    <li> This product/s are amazing! My least favorite is the almond, but it still smells pretty damn good!&lt;br /&gt;By far, the best one is Amber, followed by Bay Rum, and Lime. The scents are subtle and smell amazing!&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long. It lathers really well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product and buy it again!</li>
    <li> Perfect sample pack! Makes a great gift too! Soaps smell wonderful and make a great lather. Price is hard to beat</li>
    <li> I used Art of Shaving for years. however, the price tag is much to high. I purchased this based on reviews. I am starting with the bay rum and liked it. You have to work it to generate a lather, but it makes for a good shave. I used my art of shaving cup for the soap. I would recommend this for the price if you do not like using shaving cream out of the can.</li>
    <li> Good brand use their stuff a lot and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I purchased this sampler pack along with a [[ASIN:B0018OVL4G Kingsley Shave Soap Bowl]] when I started shaving with a DE razor a few months ago.  I warmed up the Bay Rum puck in the microwave and poured it into the bowl, rather than just letting it sit in there.  It fits better, and it makes soaping up the brush so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long each puck will last, but after three months the first one is still going strong. So it&#x27;ll be a long time.  The lather is not as thick as I was previously accustomed to with the pressurized cans of shaving cream, but the slickness is definitely there, which is what really matters.  And the soap rinses right off the blade with none of the effort and frustration of the canned stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All four of the scents smell good to me, but since the smell doesn&#x27;t last beyond the shave, it doesn&#x27;t really matter much which one is my favorite. All the same, it&#x27;s probably the Amber, with Bay Rum close behind.  I&#x27;m really happy with all of them though.</li>
    <li> The Conk soaps are all decent, but nothing special.  Each provides a necessary level of cushion and glide for your razor.  The soaps are all scented and each is unique.  I personally found I like them all but the Bay Rum.  There are a lot of other soaps and creams I like better, but for the price the Colonel is a good option.</li>
    <li> Lathers quickly and provides a smooth share. Have only tried the Amber. I can review others as they are used.</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to the wet shave, shaving brush, scene. I had heard about this particular brand of shaving soap and decided to try it out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying all four, my favorite is the &amp;#34;Lime&amp;#34; soap puck. My reason being that because the boar bristles in my shaving brush naturally have a slight musky smell. The first soap I tried was the &amp;#34;Amber&amp;#34; one, and I didn&#x27;t like the combination of that scent with the boar bristles, and the way it left my face smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Lime&amp;#34; soap leaves my face and the brush smelling refreshingly clean. Purchasing these pucks individually is slightly more expensive, but from now on I&#x27;ll only purchase shaving soaps with a citric scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaving soap, very happy with this brand of shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for a little bit now, started out with Art of Shaving, moved to Taylor of Old Bond Street, and then for my birthday, my sister got me this variety pack.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited and scared about it, there&#x27;s a very loyal following to Col Conk&#x27;s, and there&#x27;s people who hate it. I was scared that I was gonna end up not using all 4 and to the end of each soap.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was wrong to be scared! I&#x27;ll break my review in a couple points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT:&lt;br /&gt;The smell of all 4 are excellent, unique, but not overpowering. You definitely can smell them when you&#x27;re lathering and shaving, they&#x27;re very pleasant. They don&#x27;t stay for hours after your shave, so, use an after shave for that, and don&#x27;t worry about clashing scents..the smell of Col Conk&#x27;s will be gone after you wash your face with cold water. These are great for sensitive skin because strong scents usually use harmful chemicals to produce the smell, and even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, your face will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LATHER:&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the part that freaked me out after using it a couple times. I tried lathering a bunch of different ways with no water, then too much water, then the amount that i usually use for TOBS, and i always ended up with an awful lather in the bowl. The key to the lathering that I found, is to really load your brush (rub it around the soap switching clockwise/counter-clockwise as you get a big soapy amount on your brush) then apply to your face for longer. So basically, your face is the bowl if you get what i&#x27;m saying. It gives me a better, and longer lasting lather than any of the other soaps/creams i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;For 15-18 bucks, you get 4 soaps that have amazing smells, produce a great lather, and leave your face feeling baby soft smooth afterwards. TOBS, Cella, Trumper,etc. are around 15-25 bucks for one tub, you get 4 here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue experimenting with new soaps/creams, but I know i&#x27;ll always have Col Conk around, it&#x27;s just an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Great lather and great scents!  The Lime is my favorite and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the others .. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My husband only uses this brand, and its always delivered on time</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaving soap on the planet. I get about three months from one cake of soap. Great smelling as well.</li>
    <li> Love the lime and the bay rum, amber is alright, but you can keep the almond scent. I wanted to try them all so this was a great deal for me. I don&#x27;t mind giving away 1 of 3 for a chance to try them all for a bargain.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered and the scents are accurate.  Great for having a variety to choose from and being able to store easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soaps do not dry out and far as quality of shave they are great, not need for any additional creams or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record:  I always use a badger brush to apply soap evenly and lift hairs better.</li>
    <li> Nice variety pack.  The scents are all unique and nice but not overwhelming.  These blocks of soap are Huge and just 1 of them should definitely last you a long time.  If I knew what I was getting before I ordered it I would do it again.  Spend the extra 5 bucks and get these tremendous soaps</li>
    <li> Love these as much as my poraso especially the almond. Great lather and smoothness for cutting and a very fair price. You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> Thisa 4 pack of shaving soap should last m over a year.  great quaity in 4 different scents.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> These lather great and smell wonderful. My fiancé loves them.</li>
    <li> Darn great stuff!  Wish I would have tried it years ago.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, he loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood is his least favorite out of the 4.&lt;br /&gt;All the others smell amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Rum and the Lime. I have not tried the other two but they look good. The soap lathers very well and doesn&#x27;t dry up when I put it on.</li>
    <li> This review probably is not fair to this product, but I wanted to put it up anyway.  With shave creams that I had used just before this, I used an oil prep on my face before the application of the cream.  I did the same before applying this product and I think that&#x27;s where I went wrong.  The slight lather didn&#x27;t stay on my face to the point where I couldn&#x27;t see any soap, even though there was a glide to the razor which could have been from the soap or from the oil.  Couldn&#x27;t tell.  It was only with another shave soap that I discovered that use of oil on my face did not mix well with this soap.  I got rid of these without having the opportunity to discover these soaps without the oil.  So I shouldn&#x27;t really judge them given that I never found out that probably they lather well and work well. I still wanted to put up this review for anyone who might encounter the problem.  If so, the solution is probably not to use oil on your face before applying these soaps.</li>
    <li> This is great shaving soap for straight razor users!  I especially like the amber variety.  These last a long time, too, so even though it&#x27;s a variety pack, you&#x27;ll get quite a long use out of the four pucks.  This leaves your face feeling very clean, and it makes the shave smooth, especially if you keep your razor good and sharp.</li>
    <li> This time the pack did not come with 4 different presentations. This is my only complaint on this last order.</li>
    <li> my husband loves these.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.. Great soaps</li>
    <li> Great soaps - the scents are a little faint for my tastes, but at least they&#x27;re not obnoxious.  They lather up quickly, the lather has good staying power, and they last fairly long.  Shaving comfort is just fine for me.  All in all, it adds up to a nice value.</li>
    <li> Excellent products. Good lather. They all smell great</li>
    <li> A month ago, I decided to buy this shaving soap variety pack after finishing my latest Art of Shaving set--a fantastic decision. While I haven&#x27;t tried all of the scents, I really enjoy the bay rum aroma. It makes me feel like a pirate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I prefer shaving soap to shaving cream because it lasts longer, lathers better (in my experience), and travels easier. (No more &amp;#34;3-1-1&amp;#34; for this guy. Plus, the price is right.</li>
    <li> This soap goes on easy but dries quickly. Once it starts to dry it can make for a rough shave. Smells great but once rinsed the scent goes away rather quickly. Not a bad product but don&#x27;t know if I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Great smell and lathers easily.</li>
    <li> This four pack is the way to go. It helps you make up your mind on what type of soap will be your favorite. Colonel Conk assures you of quality.</li>
    <li> This stuff is as good or better than I expected.I think I like it as much or better than proraso, and taylors of old bond street.it seems to reduce the amount of cuts and scrapes I got with the crap you get in the cans.it smells nice, but not overpowering.my skin feels good after using it.the four soap &amp;#34;pucks&amp;#34; are fairly small but you don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather working.it&#x27;ll last maybe a year or more ( I don&#x27;t shave every day ).good stuff.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I&#x27;d read it from someone else&#x27;s review, but this stuff really does produce a closer shave. I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for years, but I&#x27;ve always bought cheapo soap. Picked up this variety pack because I felt like trying a different scent, and I was kind of amazed -- same razor, same brush, same face, but this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. Thanks, Colonel!</li>
    <li> Great lather, wonderful smell. Why did I ever shave with gunk out of a can? Paired with a good  straight razor, and it makes shaving an enjoyable part of my routine, instead of a hassle. This combination has eliminated razor burn, and ingrown hairs that I always got with cartridge razors and Gillett gel.</li>
    <li> I rated this 4 out of 5 stars because even though this product lathers very easily it dries on the face if you aren&#x27;t using a lot of water when you are whipping up the lather.  I am using the Amber right now and I love the smell.  It is a very manly smell.  One thing I did was to put the package in the microwave for about 10 seconds to melt it and pour it into a shaving bowl with a lid.  This a a great product.</li>
    <li> great stuff, good value.</li>
    <li> All of these smell so good!  I used these as stocking stuffer&#x27;s for my husband because he loves to use his safety razor for a nice clean shave.  He loved these little cakes and we really can&#x27;t decide which one is our favorite scent.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! The scents are refreshing and masculine! It was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift! I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
    <li> These are great with a badger brush. A little water and some elbow grease and you get a great lather for a great shave. Smells good, obviously doesn&#x27;t last after the post shave routine but a great product none the less.</li>
    <li> It takes some time getting the lather right but overall a good soap. Some of the scents I do not like as much as others. Overall, good value purchase.</li>
    <li> This soap was a gift for my husband&#x27;s shaving mug. He loves it! I will purchase more when these run out.</li>
    <li> It maybe my inexperience but I can&#x27;t seem to get these to lather that well.  I follow all the instructions I have read and been told even watched videos on straight razoring.  But I just can&#x27;t get these to lather the way I thought they should.  The smells are great and I suppose for the most part they work, maybe it is the Glycerin? that causes it not to lather that much?  I am not sure but it just wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting or care for.</li>
    <li> The Ichabod Conk Glycerin Shaving Soap is a product that you will really enjoy using. They come in a variety of popular scents (I like the Amber and Bay Rum the best) and your skin will love you for using the glycerin. The thing that you will like the most is the way that it whips up into a nice, thick, rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a wonderful shave!&lt;br /&gt;Have a wonderful day.</li>
    <li> Still a good product. Wet shaving is recommended over electric due to the defoliating action of the blade. Shaving soap is also recommended over those thick aerosol creams and is extremely cheaper in the long term.</li>
    <li> So far they give me a nice lather and nice close shave. I wold recommend them to anyone who shaves!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smells and lathers great with a shaving brush.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues with razor burn and leave my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell awesome. The Amber is not very fragrant but the rest are delicious. After about 15 minutes of smells I decided that Lime (it won me over the first time but I hate what ifs) would be my first victim. It has been the best shave if had in a long time. I&#x27;ve tried gels, creams, and soaps all of which left my face dry and flakey within minutes. This one was perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, so much better than the stuff in the can. I cycle through the different scents each day. The bayrum seems to lather the best, but all of them are pretty comparable in that regard. But they last forever, I&#x27;ve been using these for a month or so and I don&#x27;t even notice them depleting at all... at this rate it could be years before I use these all up. So in that regard, these are a fraction of the price of canned creams and gels, and they work better too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat these shave soaps for the cost. They lather great and I have never experienced any irritation or rash associated with this product. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Lathers well &amp; smells nice.</li>
    <li> The shave soaps smell awesome. I wanted a sampler, since I am new to straight blade shaving. The lather isn&#x27;t as thick as other soaps, but the smell/price are great.</li>
    <li> I discovered shaving soap late in life and Colonel Conk&#x27;s is one of the best shaves around.</li>
    <li> My son recently wanted to try an old fashioned razor. Since he has sensitive skin, we decided to try these glycerin soaps. He thinks they&#x27;re great, they fit right into the soap dish we also purchased.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand that seems to last and does not smell bad after awhile.  They also last a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> Builds up a nice lather. I have only tried the Almond, which has an okay scent. Would like them more if they were priced a little better.</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch of different soaps and then went with the Col.  I really like all of these, top quality and nice scents too,  All make a nice lather and help your blade just glide along.  Trust me, ride with the Col. and you&#x27;ll actually like to shave in the morning again.</li>
    <li> I enjoy each kind and my wife uses the lime.</li>
    <li> A little bummed that the ingredients are not listed anywhere on the product (a concern when your wife has allergies). But lathers and softens great.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of scents. They smell very good. My personal favorite is the lime. They do not suds up very much, even using a brush and shaving bowl. But they soap up enough to do the job. Most likely will not purchase again, I&#x27;ll go with the Elizabeth street shaving soap. I liked the scent better and the lather was superior to the conk.</li>
    <li> First time I used this brand of soap.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> Great Price! Great Variety! Wonderful aromas and thick lathers.</li>
    <li> Long time double edge safety razor user and bald to boot. Have tried a number of soaps. Try it you will like it, I love it.</li>
    <li> The scents are awesome. I don&#x27;t shave every day, so the smaller size appeals to my economic sensibilities. I like all the scents. I have no issues lathering the soap. Some people have mentioned that they don&#x27;t get a good lather. I load up my brush with the soap in the container and then use a little salsa bowl to whip up the foam. You will probably have to add a little water to get the foam rally going.</li>
    <li> Great variety pack for the money. Try the pack, pick your favs, and re-order the ones you like.</li>
    <li> These arrived in a timely manner (there were a birthday gift), packaged well, no issues. My husband jokingly said that this 4pk will likely last him for 2 years! These are all pleasantly scented, with the lime being the lightest of all. According to my husband, they lather well and are long lasting. We will be purchasing these glycerin soaps again (in about 2 years!!)....</li>
    <li> I switched to the old style soap shaving when I ran out of the expensive pressurized shaving cream and the only thing available was a $1.05 bar of shaving soap.  It last me for over 3 months and I&#x27;ve been using the lime one now for about three months and have  plenty left.  No skin irritation or allergy issues at all.  Highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Great soap, good value not too keen on the Lime scent.</li>
    <li> Good but not great, hard to lather, works well making a super lather, ie, shave cream plus this glycerin soap.</li>
    <li> Great variety pack, each one has a great smell. My boyfriend and I both joined in on the safety razor bandwagon, and these scents appeal to both of us. Currently we&#x27;re using the almond scent and love it. It gives a really great, soft, silky lather. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great value for high quality soap. This will last you a while too.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  It makes a perfect lather.  The trick I learned is to heat up the soap a bit by holding it upside down under the tap.  Do this for about a minute and it will melt the soap just enough to really load up your brush.</li>
    <li> I was highly disappointed by this product after seeing its great reviews. The soaps smells nice but the lather it produces is very unsuitable for a comfortable shave. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone over a product like Tabac or Proraso.</li>
    <li> Good mix of scents, each bar lasts me over a month to use. Should be noted that the soap requires solid prep work before using or you will not get a good experience.</li>
    <li> Awesome value! Nice smells and good variety!  Dad really likes them!</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my son and appears to be a good variety and I think he will be pleased.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shave soap!  Since he took up shaving this way we&#x27;ve saved a ton in shaving cream &amp; razors!  Plus he gets a better shave!</li>
    <li> I only use the Colonel Conk soaps, this was a great buy on a variety pack.  I usually get this from West Coast Shaving, but this seller beat his price, so more money in my pocket for a great product.</li>
    <li> good variety of glycerin shave soap for those men who shave there face with a real razor, with blades that do not cost $23 each or have 57 blades to shave your face in one stroke.  Shaving should be enjoyed, experienced.  The fragrance is great and the soap lathers nicely and helps the whiskers stand up and the razor slide gently.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> best way to try out the different scents and find what you like. the soap has a good lather to it and works great with my sensitive skin. the scents arent over powering. its a good way to try this brand of soap out if you are looking to try something new or new to wet shaving in general.</li>
    <li> I love this soap for the scent, lather, and ease of use. The soap helps to keep irritation way down while providing a great light scent. I started wet shaving a few years ago, and this is the soap that started it all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may have complained that getting a lather has been tough, I can tell you that if you know how to work this soap, you can get a very thick lather. I use hot water in the cup, with the puck and the brush inside, I let it soak for about 20 seconds. Pour out the excess water and start working the brush on the soap. BOOM! Lather bomb! I have now stocked enough to last at least a year or so.</li>
    <li> My first experience with this brand of soap - very happy. Easy to get a good lather, doesn&#x27;t dry out on my skin too quickly. Judging by my first few weeks, these 4 soaps will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> love this soap good lather great for wet shaving.</li>
    <li> So far the one I am using is very soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these</li>
    <li> This four pack of soap will last me well over a year and I shave every day. Good stuff good clean shave.</li>
    <li> Good shave soap, offers different variety of scents and textures.</li>
    <li> Good lather, clean smell, good shave but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other soaps I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I love Colonel Conk soap.  It is very affordable and it lathers great. Compared to other soaps, Colonel Conk doesn&#x27;t dry out nearly as fast so I can shave a ease and get a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I am a straight razor shaver - this soap is fabulous</li>
    <li> Good product and a hard price to beat.</li>
    <li> I have really like Bay Rum, but I think the Lime soap is actually my favorite from this pack. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read from multiple sources that Col Conk shaving soaps are excellent, especially the Bay Rum. Being unfamiliar with the scent of bay rum, and curious about the other scents that Col Conk offers, I thought this variety pack would be an excellent way to acquaint myself with the different kinds. So far, I&#x27;m a huge fan of these soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purely personal take on the different scents:&lt;br /&gt; - Bay Rum is an interesting smell. A lot of people like it, but I&#x27;m not the biggest fan. Lathers up easily. If you like the smell, I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt; - Lime smells like a lime scented cleaner, so not great, but it wears off quickly. In my experience, it&#x27;s also not the easiest to lather up, and tends to dry out quickly on my face. If you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not too bad, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt; - Almond is very sweet smelling. Once again, I&#x27;m not a huge fan, but it lathers up easily, so like the bay rum, if you like the smell go for it.&lt;br /&gt; - Amber is by far my favorite fragrance. It smells like an old time barber shop to me, which is the atmosphere I&#x27;m going for in my morning wet shave routine. It also lathers up fairly easily. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good smell&#x27;ems whilst you cultivate your man foliage!</li>
    <li> Very good lather produced</li>
    <li> I love them so far they are the same size that you would see in a barber shop ,and they smell great</li>
    <li> Great fragrances. However, these soaps don&#x27;t last as long as the majority of shave soaps I&#x27;ve tried. For the price, I&#x27;m willing to buy them again, but I&#x27;ll continue to shop around before I select a &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; to routeenly purchase.</li>
    <li> Started straight razor shaving about a month ago. love the art of straight razor shaving and based on what many have said decided to get shaving soap instead of using regular shaving cream. Decided between Col. Ichabod Conk and Taylor of old bond street (cream). Decided to go for the Col. Conk so that i get a variety. unfortunately i feel the soap dries up much faster on my face (maybe i have to start shaving faster??) its a good shave it gives however would be great if i could lather it up, apply it, wait a few, shave and be done with it. instead i have to shave my face in two parts. apply to the right and shave. and then apply to the left and shave. Ill see how it goes. Product was good but just not for me maybe.</li>
    <li> This is really a great shaving soap. Canned shaving creams are easy to use and are convenient,  but they can&#x27;t compare to the quality and comfort of Colonel Conk shaving soap. I have been shaving for over sixty years, and when I first started safety razors hadn&#x27;t been around that long and the quality of the blades were not very good. Razors have greatly improved with the introduction of the stainless steel blade, but finding a high quality shaving soap to match the razor is some what difficult.&lt;br /&gt; Over the years I have used many different shaving soaps, trying to find that perfect match to provide a comfortable shave. I finally found it!....  This is without a doubt the best shaving soap on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;I place two of the cakes into my rather large shaving cup and put it in the micro-wave oven for about 5 or 6 seconds, this softens the soap so I can press it firmly into the cup. Using a high quality brush, I can work this soap into an excellent lather. I enjoy shaving with this quality shaving cream.</li>
    <li> they came in timely manner and arrived as expected. my husband loves them</li>
    <li> Its good but doesn&#x27;t have much friction reducers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the old bay rum soap thus far, and as each bar will last for quite some time I don&#x27;t expect to get into another for a few months still, but it&#x27;s fantastic soap, as long as you&#x27;re applying the correct amount of water to the lather process. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ready went my other  run out.</li>
    <li> Colonel Conk met all of my expectations</li>
    <li> Great lather, good smelling.</li>
    <li> The lime smells kind of like cleaning chemicals. The Amber looks different in color than the last colonel conk Amber shave soap I purchased. I like the glycerine. Lathers well. THESE ARE THE SMALL PUCKS. Just giving you a heads up. Perfect for trying these scents out. They will still last you months anyhow.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using this soap pack (the first time was a gift).  It works up a nice lather and smells really nice.  I&#x27;ll probably order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> Priced good and foams up great</li>
    <li> Great soap and I like the different scents.  They all smell good and I like the variety.</li>
    <li> I like the lather and mild smell of the soap. Gives a good slick lather on the face. Excellent for use with myour de razors</li>
    <li> Good smelling soaps, they do lather good, not exceptional, but well worth the money.  Would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Initially I was concerned that it didn&#x27;t whip up an impressive lather in the bowl, or my face. It&#x27;s a thin lather, but soapy. But when it came to actually shaving (I use both straight razor and a typical razor when I&#x27;m in a rush), I was very pleased. It&#x27;s just filmy enough to give the cutting edge a nice glide. And I love all four scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great smell and shave will buy more soon</li>
    <li> I read that the glycerine shave creams will not last nearly as long as the other creams but I have not found that to be true. This soap lathers easily and abundantly. And it smells good.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shave soap.  The smell is great and refreshing and the lather is like no other.  He liked it so much that we gave it as gifts with a shave set to his father and his best friend for Christmas.  One soap last 3-4 months so the variety set can last about a year - what a deal!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for shaving. A nice shave brush makes a rich thick lather and the different smells are nice to change throughout  the different seasons. I put mine in a tea cup and it holds the pucks very conveniently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used on bar so far and it is fantastic.  Great foaming, smells nice, feels good.</li>
    <li> This is a good beginner soap sampler for those new to the art of wet shaving.  This soap performs quite well, and it is quite economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed all four of the scents out the box, and the amber really grew on me the more I used the product.  They all lather well once you learn how to use a shaving brush and work out the water to soap ratio.  For help with all things shaving, see the &amp;#34;Badger and Blade&amp;#34; site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only knock against these soaps is the sample containers, which are really too small to build a good lather.  I repackaged mine in larger bowls, which really helped a lot.  You can either melt the soap down since it is glycerin-based, or use a cheese grater to grind it up and then mash down into a new container.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wet shaved with a brush, as others have, for many years. In spite of the funny name - Colonel Conk - the products are really quite good in generating a nice, fragrant, long-lasting lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased, and imported, specialty shaving soaps for a lot more money over the years, but I haven&#x27;t seen a real difference in what they deliver in terms of the shaving experience, or purported skin health. Although their packaging &amp; marketing story may be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any of the shaving soaps from Colonel Conk are very safe buys and high quality shaving products. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These samples are nice, and all four smell great- not overpowering. Lather isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; as something like Proraso- it&#x27;s a little sudsy. I liked them better with my safety double edged razor and not as much with a straight. Great trial pack for the money.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to rate this shave soap higher. I really did. But after using the whole variety pack, you&#x27;ll notice some of it&#x27;s shortcomings. First, the only one that lathers really well is the Amber scent. I don&#x27;t know what it is about that scent, but it clearly lathers up easier and more dense than any other of their scents, bar none. Now that I&#x27;m here reading reviews, I almost chuckle that a few others have mentioned this exact same conclusion. So it&#x27;s not just me nor my procedure. Each puck last quite a while. It&#x27;s pretty hard stuff that you won&#x27;t burn through quickly. That said, it does melt easily in the microwave if you&#x27;re trying to form it to a shave bowl and does not separate as it re-hardens . As for the scents themselves, they&#x27;re all very pleasant. None of them are overpowering and some are actually pretty light. My favorite scent is probably the BayRum. My least favorite scent is.... you guessed it... the Amber. It&#x27;s not offensive, but just has a baby powder type of smell. Ok, but not appealing to me. If the BayRum was the scent that lathered up real well, I&#x27;d be ordering more. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not and I&#x27;m online looking for something else.</li>
    <li> Great product - great value. If you are a history buff, especially for the  American west, than this product offers an added dimension. Find out more on the Colonel Conk website. Beyond that, you get four pucks of classic (and very lightly) scented soap. I shave just about every day and a puck will last me 2-3 months. They are hard soaps so about 30 seconds more work to lather up, but well worth it in my opinion. Also, for lathering purposes, I use a cheaper boar&#x27;s hair brush rather than my badger hair. The stiffer bristles do a better job here. I will always buy Colonel Conk, just a great brand to have.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. A real nice surprise.</li>
    <li> Each of these soaps have unique and pleasant fragrances.  As far as I can tell, they all work similarly.  My favorite scent is bay rum because it makes me feel old-timey.</li>
    <li> i tried the lime scent today and it was very pleasant. it lathered very well, but dried out on my neck before i got to it.just needed to relather.very slick and smooth for a nice close shave. i take my time shaving so you may not have the drying out problem if you shave quicker or lather as you go. very happy with purchase. i wish the puck was larger for a better fit in my mug,but that is more of a nit pick than a complaint.</li>
    <li> Nice soap, all smell great, next time I will go all almond.  Nice Value for quality soaps.</li>
    <li> I like the soaps.  They smell good and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Lime so far. The Lime is incredible. getting optimal lather is easy and it has provided the best shave I&#x27;ve had with Glycerin based soaps.</li>
    <li> Love these shaving soaps. The glycerin soaps seem to make better lather for me, and so far the Bay Rum and Amber cakes smell the best, especially the Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> Would not shave with anything else!!!!</li>
    <li> The Colonel Conk soap quality is great.  This is a really good way to try the several scents available.  I have used the Amber for some time and wanted to try out the other offerings.  Fine product with great lather.</li>
    <li> I have only used the lime so far, but it lathers well and gives a smooth shave. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving soap.. I still a little left on my original soap before trying these.. Very pleased with the lather it creates.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend using this product.. I&#x27;ve had now 8 months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got the variety pack, I like all of them.</li>
    <li> Top knotch. Really smooth. Provides great protection and seems to soften skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It lathers well and it seems each puck will last a very long time.  The soap provides a very smooth shave with my double sided safety razor with no irritation whatsoever.  So far I have only used the lime-scented soap.  It has a nice smell in the shower but does not last very long, which I like.  I will buy this product again…but it will be awhile before I need to.</li>
    <li> Colonel Conk shaving soaps are my go-to soap for using my safety razor.  They lather well and have great smells that linger but are not too strong.  They last a surprisingly long time too</li>
    <li> No reactions and lathers up great.  There is not much else to say.  Price wise I have enough soap to last me possibly over a year.  Oh the savings.</li>
    <li> These lather up gloriously and smell great. Probably the best shaving product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great quality.</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic. Smells great, lathers up easily, and it helps to get a close shave. They last quite awhile too.</li>
    <li> I bought this assortment thinking the Bay Rum would be my favorite. Indeed, the Bay Rum soap smells good and lathers exceptionally well (compared to my previously used tallow-based soap). But, the Almond is incredible. It smells so good I want to eat it; it reminds me of a confectionery, but don&#x27;t be alarmed the scent dissipates soon.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap my favorite so far is the almond I have not tried the amber</li>
    <li> So i bought these a while back and im now into my last bar. while all of the scents where nice id have to say that my favorite was the bayrum</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband. He shaves old school and these smell soooooo good. I love the amber one the most. The lather is good and he says they work really well for a glycerin soap.</li>
    <li> Great way to try product. The scents are a little too subtle but great if you plan on using your own scent afterwards</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about three weeks.  It works into a lather easily, but the foam is very thin and dries out quickly.  The  scents are nice but not nice enough to make me want to buy it again.  I won&#x27;t be finishing the four pack.  Going back to Prorasso.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Almond is the only scent I didn&#x27;t really like that much, but everyone has a preference. The smells don&#x27;t linger on your face all day, usually gone by the time I&#x27;m done getting ready, which I think is good.</li>
    <li> Almond is very nice. The others are alright.  Personal preference. But for the money, can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I loved every single scent. I got a close clean shave every time I used them with a tweezer man badger brush.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving soaps.  I bought the multi pack and started with the lime.  Decent scent, good lather and a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Great variety pack if you want to see the different scents Colonel Conk has and a nice gift for the man who likes to shave. These are all sample size so one ounce smaller then the regular size but comes in the clear package with their logo on it. Stack them in to a tower and tie a ribbon on it and it would be a nice addition to a gift basket for men.</li>
    <li> Great call for first time buyers. The selection is nice and depending on preference you will most likely find what you like in this set.</li>
    <li> This is stuff is the bombdiggity! Love it!</li>
    <li> These get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers up easily and feel good on my face. The smell is actually rather weak but it is there: I like this. It is not overpowering, but adds a little something nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very good shaving soap for the money. This soap along with a regular shaver with a replaceable razor blade will yield a much better shave and save a lot of money versus using the throw away shavers and spray can soap.</li>
    <li> Nice lather and great scents that are not too strong.  My DE razor glides smoothly and the conditioners leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> These are nice soaps for shaving.  I keep one in my travel bag with a travel shave brush so I can get a decent shave on the road.  This also lets me avoid packing liquid shave cream/gel, which makes airport security a bit easier.  The little plastic clamshell case easily and securely re-closes after use, again perfect for travel.  Not a huge fan on the lime one, but the others smell great.  The lather is pretty good, I have used much better products, but for travel this is the perfect size, packaging, and price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the variety of this 4-pack and am looking forward to slathering them over my chin.  I recently made the great leap backward to old school shaving and, so far, I&#x27;m glad I did.  I was disenchanted with expensive, plastic, landfill filling modern razors so I stocked up on safety razor related items and took the plunge.  It seems to be working out fine...</li>
    <li> After using these soaps, I look back on my old ways of shaving like people look at primitive medicine. &amp;#34;You had to hack and chop back then because people just didn&#x27;t know better.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know I can walk away from my daily shave with silky smooth skin and smelling of rich almonds. It&#x27;s called luxury, how can you love others when you don&#x27;t know how to love yourself?</li>
    <li> I will never use shaving cream out of a can again.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it lets my safety razor glide without any problems.</li>
    <li> I had needed new soap but didn&#x27;t know what I wanted to order as I had not tried very many thus far so when I came across this sampler pack for the price of one large soap I jumped on it. I haven&#x27;t run out of my old soap quite yet so I haven&#x27;t actually shaved with any of these but I did open them each and get to experience the smells of each which was surprisingly good across the board. Very happy with this purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I like the different smells. The size does not fit in my teak container.  It will require a few uses till the top comes down in size about .5 inch, then my lid will go on again. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Now, it&#x27;s time to shave!</li>
    <li> I usually love the bay rum scent and was going to buy it&#x27;s 4 pack, but after recieving the product fell in love with the almond and lime scents.</li>
    <li> Good lather and they all smell great! The Bay rum is definitely. These will last a ridiculously long time too. The first one&#x27;s been used for about a month or two and barely any difference in quantity</li>
    <li> First time I buy this brand of glycerin soaps and they are of good quality. My only thing and why I am not giving this product a full give starts it&#x27;s the fragrance. It&#x27;s very light and not as lasting as others. It lathers very well and provides that lubricating film for shaving. Other than that, buy this product, its very effective.</li>
    <li> Great price, great soap.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Good shaving soap. I&#x27;ve used one so far. It lathers up nicely.</li>
    <li> wonderful, whips up to dense creamy foam on my brush very quickly. feels good on the face. heck I shave in the shower then wash my whole face with it after I finish with the razor.</li>
    <li> Great soap no complaints, foams up very nice and smells great. Will buy again once i use up this batch.</li>
    <li> Really makes a nice thick lather. Much better than mama bear. I&#x27;m loving the bay rum at the moment.</li>
    <li> Pretty good soaps to try out different scents, though the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
    <li> The first shave convince me. After using Williams all my life had it not become so hard to find I would of never tried this product. I will use this from now on.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is all I hoped for and more.</li>
    <li> Not much excitement here. Good quality for a good price.  You order good shaving soap, and that&#x27;s what you get. Great customer service as well. They included two free with my first order just to let me know that they appreciate my business.</li>
    <li> Bought this as my first shave soap when I got into DE shaving.  This was a great purchase.  The soaps gave me variety and lathered surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. I microwave in an old coffee cup I use the soap in and this keeps it from moving around.  It does not lather up as nicely as some other soaps but at 1/3 the price this is the best deal I have found with saving soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for what it is, and it fills the soap bowl.  I found other products I like much better at the Art of Shaving, but it is expensive.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVING SOAP LEAVES FACE VERY MOISTURIZED</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Good Deal. Good Product. Good Store.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell so good, they almost seem edible. I love the scents, especially lime and almond. My girlfriend loves the scent as well. These are high quality shaving soap bars. I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love these soaps. I just switched from cremes to soap and they are great. I just wish the smell was stronger.</li>
    <li> Perfectly fits in a normal sized shave soap dish. He loves the lather and says Bayrum is the best scent.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Nice scents &amp; came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I only have  one bowl right now, so I&#x27;ve only used the lime, but it&#x27;s wonderful. I love this soap. I&#x27;ve been using Proraso but it dries my scalp (I shave my head, not my face) out a lot. The Colonel Conk made a great lather, smells nice, and isn&#x27;t as drying. The smell is pretty much only for you and is a pleasant addition to the overall product. But it won&#x27;t last and shouldn&#x27;t be expected to, especially after your after shave balm application.</li>
    <li> I recommend this variety 4-pack of Glycerin soaps. Good smells. Don&#x27;t leave skin dry. Work well for shaving. Good products overall.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap.  works extremely well when lathering and permits close, clean shave.  I like the feeling post shave and absolutely no irritation</li>
    <li> I prefer a shaving mug and brush to foam or tube shave cream, and Colonel Conk products are perfect for me. I bought this through Salida Cutlery, and the package arrived a week ahead of the delivery schedule. If you also prefer hot shaving, then this variety pack is a perfect way to sample a few of the more popular Conk soaps. I&#x27;ll be sticking with both these products as well as ordering more from Salida Cutlery as a preferred vendor.</li>
    <li> Got the variety pack.. The soaps are great make a nice lather.. I add a shot of Burt Bees Shave creme to the mix for a deeper shave. but, it works great on it own as well.. i like the scents of all the cakes.. Esp. the Lime a great summer scent.. Will order again</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, Hubby loves this shaving soap. He will be buying more when its all gone. He loves the feel of the soap. soft.</li>
    <li> The Colonel makes a good soap and the variety pack is a great way to check out all the scents.  Honestly I only like the amber (old timey barber shop smell) and the lime (lime smell).&lt;br /&gt;The pucks didn&#x27;t fit my larger mug, but I dropped the puck in there and put the whole shebang in the mircowave for about 2 minutes on defrost and it melted it into a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;I fill the mug w/ hot water while letting it soak in a sink filled with hot water.  Makes the soap soft and creamy for a nice lather.  Keeps the whole thing hot for a second pass.&lt;br /&gt;Some will complain that this uses your soap up faster but really at a few bucks a puck, if it lasts months I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Solid glycerin soap. Quality fragrance that isn&#x27;t overbearing. Can&#x27;t really go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> It is an outstanding product that, with a quality razor and blade, delivers an A 1 shave. What I did bot realize is that this&lt;br /&gt;Product comes in two sizes. This is the smaller one making it much less of a buy.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> I bought the same glycerin soap last year (vor my Christmas stocking) and I am now using the last one.  I needed the replacement.</li>
    <li> My father &amp; husband love the lather and fragrances.</li>
    <li> Great shave soap I like the Bay Rum sent best</li>
    <li> Good way to test the line out &amp; find your favorite.  Loses a star simply because the lime is on the weak side if we&#x27;re talking scent.</li>
    <li> These shaving soap bars last forever!  I use my brush at a medium dampness, get a great thick sturdy lather, and a great shave every time.  Way cheaper than the creams and pastes.  And this 4 pack gets you a bunch of different versions to try.  I haven&#x27;t gotten one I didn&#x27;t like yet.</li>
    <li> nice lather, nice fragrance</li>
    <li> great soap, great price, speeding shipping.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried other shaving mug soaps and always come back to Colonel Conk&#x27;s Glycerine Soap.  If there is a better one I would like to know.</li>
    <li> it is easy to lather and lathers well. I was a little disappointed to smell been around longer, but overall I do feel clean shaven. I would have recommended this product if the scent stuck around a little more</li>
    <li> These arrived as expected, and the glycerin soaps in the 4-pack have a great consistency and aroma, and lather very easily with the badger hair brush we bought from the same vendor.  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I had used the lime shave soap before and it worked very well. I ordered this pack to sample the other scents.</li>
    <li> Have heard that either a friend or foe of this product and after only 3 shaves...I&#x27;m in love. read that lime and musk was best so...I started with almond and loved it. use a medium brush that was soaking in hot water with my razor, excellent lather and stayed on the face without drying/disappearing quickly. deffiently recommend a pre-shave cream to even make the shave better. I have had issues with sensitive skin for years seems that will no longer be an issue.</li>
    <li> Love it, will never shave with anything else.</li>
    <li> No regrets purchasing this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure what my family would think b/c I always used the can shaving creams. I recently started using this type of old-school shaving product and have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I shave 2-3/week. also, I have a chiseled face, so...it can be difficult to get a close shave in certain areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. this product will last a very long time &#x3D; huge cost savings as compared to cans&lt;br /&gt;2. use in conjunction with double edge safety razors. You can get 100 blades for $5-6, so do the math...&lt;br /&gt;3. be sure to get a good brush, not a $50, anything around $25 will work&lt;br /&gt;4. has a silky texture and the blade glides well&lt;br /&gt;5.  scent &#x3D; surprisingly very pleasant. My wife enjoyed all 4 and suggested I use 1 for each season (spring, summer, fall &amp; winter) - not sure if I&#x27;ll actually do this. my kids also like the scents, which was unexpected due to there not being a bubblegum or cotton candy scent.</li>
    <li> Quality item. Great variety for the price. Long lasting scents but not over powering. Makes a great gift for men.</li>
    <li> Love them. Have used the product before and my wife bought me and my son a set for Christmas. I like it.</li>
    <li> These soaps are great. Not the best lather compared to what I&#x27;ve been using (Van der Hagen), however it provides excellent protection and each soap has a great scent. Well worth the price. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these soaps for quite a while now, and they are still excellent. Perfect scent and slickness. I will definitely buy this soap again!</li>
    <li> I kept hearing much about the bayrum scent over the rest, but also much of the others as well. So it was nice to see this variety pack to try them all out at a good price. I actually like all four of them, though far as scent goes the almond is the best. None of them are overpowering or leave any undesired smell afterward. I read a review that makes the bayrum scent seem like an old man aroma, maybe mine was missing the ingredient as I found it distinct though not like its only fitting for seniors. Sometimes its annoying to take them out of the plastic to put in my shaving bowl as its a tight fit, at least until it stars wearing away soon. That really is nothing to complain about though, love all the soaps so far, will certainly purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Purchased to try out various favors of soap for use with DE razor.  The lime was my favorite, the others were meh.  Worth it if you want to be adventurous.</li>
    <li> I ended up taking each puck and splitting them in half with a kitchen knife. Then I melted them down using a steam bath on the stove in small glass dishes two half&#x27;s at a time. Then I poured them into some small round plastic tupperware like containers from the dollar store. This allowed me to give 4 people 2 samples each rather than just one each.</li>
    <li> Nice lather, razor seems to glide over the skin while shaving effectively.  The smells (flagrances) don&#x27;t last very long. Haven&#x27;t used it enough to determine how long it will last</li>
    <li> A good variety, sized to fit most soap bowls, all smell nice, and I don&#x27;t notice a difference in performance compared to MUCH more expensive shaving soaps.  A great value, fulfilled promptly as Amazon always does.</li>
    <li> Like the way it lubricates. Like the fragrance. There seems to be a bit of a learning curve to get an acceptable lather &amp; it seems to work much better with a stiffer brush.</li>
    <li> I loved each of the scents, save bay rum. I feel that bay rum is probably made for a man much older than myself (20), but the others are very nice. My favorite being the lime.</li>
    <li> Love Conk soap and use it almost daily. Great lather, great scents, and great price. Glad I tried the variety pack.</li>
    <li> Nice variety pack to find your favorite scents.</li>
    <li> I made this purchase for a gift for my Grandson.  He was very pleased.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap! Great Product Great value!</li>
    <li> Good shave soap.  Love it.  I shipped fast and arrived before the stated arrival date and on a Sunday...Great!!</li>
    <li> awesome product. I found this soap better then my Williams. First think I noticed my twin blade disposable was easier to rinse out and the shave was smoother</li>
    <li> Good for everyday quick shaves.  The lather feels nice and gives the razor a nice glide.  I just wish the lather didn&#x27;t disintegrate so fast.  Makes a more soapy than creamy lather, but this is shave soap after all, not cream.  All four scents are very pleasant and not overpowering.  I think the amber is my favorite.  The bars seem to last a very long time too.  Been using them for over a month and still can&#x27;t even tell that they&#x27;ve been used at all.  Again, I just wish the later would last a little longer.  I do have hard water, but I&#x27;ve also tried distilled water and it didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.  So in summary, this is a good, inexpensive shave soap for work days when you need to shave quickly.  For days when you have more time and want a more luxurious shave, I would go with a good shave cream.  But for the price, you cannot beat Colonel Conk when used as an everyday workhorse soap.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I purchased the variety pack so as to determine which scent I like the best.  Less later than a standard shaving soap but much slicker.  Gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> All 4 smell great, however I have trouble getting a good, thick lather. Could just be my technique.</li>
    <li> Love the scents, especially the almond! Great lather, leaves you feeling smooth and clean. The amber reminds me of the way my Grandfather smelled after he shaved.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how long these last. I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements. I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now and I&#x27;m never going back to disposable blades.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Best I have ever used. It does not dry your face. Alao it is more econimacal then to use canned shave cream</li>
    <li> This is great stuff and I think useing A Lather brush makes for A better shave than A can of shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the smell of them except for maybe 1 of them.  Lathered ok but the smell didn&#x27;t do it for me. Maybe you will like them but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> husband loves.  Can&#x27;t seem to buy shaving soap in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Works as described although I would like a bit thicker lather. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I run out but may look elsewhere in the future unless I figure out some kind of trick. I really like all of the smells</li>
    <li> Ken has only used the lime, but he loves it.  He went back to safety razors over a year ago, but recently has not been able to find a decent soap.  Knicks are reduced, smells while shavingnice and then dissipates.</li>
    <li> The best shave soap I have ever used. The lather is rich and builds very quickly. Provides a very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Good lather.. Handy size. I use these in my Conk traveling soap cup with a Conk traveling shave brush.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the money.  Last a long time and have great scents to all of them.  A greta way to see which one you like the best.</li>
    <li> Great soaps. Each with a great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bayrum: Like the smell of Old Spice without the scent being overbearing to others? Check this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber: Old West scent. Very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond: Sweet, smooth, and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lime: Refreshing and is best suited for Spring and Summer. Personally, I love this soap because it complements many of colognes.</li>
    <li> My husband has been breaking out nonstop since he started using these soaps. They make great lather, and they smell great, except the lime it&#x27;s horrid (I&#x27;m sure an acquired taste). We won&#x27;t be sticking with glycerin.</li>
    <li> I purchased these along with a new safety razor, and have been extremely pleased with both.  I&#x27;ve only used two of the scents so far, with both being pleasant.  The Bay Rum does smell sort of like an old barbershop or indeed probably like your grandfather.  The almond has a pleasantly strong almond aroma while you&#x27;re using it, and both become light to non-existent in scent strength once you&#x27;ve rinsed them off.  They have worked well to protect my face, and I&#x27;ve worked them to a lather in their plastic packaging with no issues.  Overall very pleased.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES these soaps. &amp;#34;Definitely 5 star,&amp;#34; he says.  He says that they all smell so great that he has a hard time picking one as his favorite.  He said these work SO MUCH better than the shave soap he bought at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and service</li>
    <li> I love the variety and quality offered in this pack, every soap works for shaving different parts of the body.  I love the Bay Rum for my face and neck, the Amber is good chest and underarms, I love the Lime for my groin and butt crack; I save the almond is for my wife, I like almond flavored stuff.</li>
    <li> great works up lather fast and smell good</li>
    <li> Nice variety.  Good quality.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I’ve been straight razor shaving for awhile now and it still more than a shave, its an adventure to me and this has been the best soap I’ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather beats the stuff I would get at Walmart or the drug store hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat disappointed in the Bay Rum scent though, I can barely even smell, but the Almond was a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those that can&#x27;t choose a scent, or want a variety.  Great shave soaps</li>
    <li> always good lather and scent stays ith u.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite glycerin soap brand for shaving!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and purchased the Colonel based on customer feedback. To have it fit my Van Der Hagen bow, I zapped in the microwave (in the bowl) for  about 7 seconds and it did not loose either scent or consistency. It lathers well for me and does moisturize my skin. I&#x27;m using the Bay Rum puck now. Not overly Bay Rummy, just right.</li>
    <li> They smell super! I got them for the husband and love the smell.</li>
    <li> Not the best in the lather department, but smells great and I enjoy them.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the Bay Rum puck. The soap creates a great lather with minimal preparation. I soak my shave brush while I&#x27;m showering, Shake out the water and then take a few passes over the puck. That&#x27;s all the soap I need to get a good three pass wet shave with my safety razor. The fragrance is great but not at all overpowering.</li>
    <li> I had brought the bay rum soap about a year ago, and i liked it but i preferred my Taylor Bond, one for the smell and Conk&#x27;s soap does dry a lot faster than some soaps; However, the bay rum and other Conk soaps does lather with more ease and forms almost perfect lubrication for a straight, or any kind of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amber, bay rum, and almond have a nice pleasant smell, and again they all later up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The i cannot say much about i have not used it at all yet... the reason for this is i can hardly smell it. When i first opened the container i smelled a subtle lime fragrance.  This variety pack is a great deal, and all of these will most likely give anybody a nice conformable and pleasant shave.</li>
    <li> As good as Art of Shaving and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very good soap! Foams well and rinses away nicely. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I like all the soaps but I&#x27;m glad I went with this variety pack so I could pick my favorite.</li>
    <li> really bought this just to see what they smelled like, in my opinion the only two good ones are amber and bay rum, the lime one kind of smells like pine sol and I have never liked almond essence, the smell is overbearing for me. but good soap either way, always get a good lather and a clean shave.  thank you colonel. :)</li>
    <li> Love the smell of each. Good price to buy the four pack as opposed to just one. They all lather really nice and the shave is great.</li>
    <li> I returned to wet shaving about a year and a half ago and have thoroughly enjoyed the experiences associated with a slower more detailed approach to personal grooming.  I endorse the old school methods and have enjoyed many benefits from these almost forgotten manly habits. One of my best lessons learned is the quality of the experience is directly related to the quality of the components used. Consequently, I strongly suggest that you take time to evaluate the products and equipment you choose. A perfect example of better benefits through better components is Colonel Conk&#x27;s Glycerin Soap. It is amazing how much better the experience and the results of my shave have improved since I started using the Colonel&#x27;s brand.  I strongly recommend this alternative for your shaving soap/lather decision.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t find anything negative to post about this shaving soap.  The bars fit nicely in my shaving mug.  I only use the water that my brush will hold to lather it up and the fact that it is a glycerin soap allows for a smooth shave.  I&#x27;m a relative newbie at shaving with a straight razor and the fact that this soap lubricates so well really helps with the process.  The various scents are nice while you are shaving but they don&#x27;t linger after a rinse so they won&#x27;t conflict with any aftershave or cologne that you use.  All in all, very nice soap for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It was what I ordered and arrived on time with no fuss. I&#x27;m using the Bay Rum first, and it makes a nice lather and smells great. Something I&#x27;ve noticed is it&#x27;s a pleasant way to start the day to take just a minute or two longer to whisk up a lather and shave with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Huge lather!  A single &#x27;puck&#x27; lasts for months.  I keep a puck in my shave mug and use a slightly-less-than-dripping-wet badger-hair brush to work up a lather.  Feels clean and fresh on the face.  I don&#x27;t know if its the avocado oil or whatever but my skin feels moist after shaving.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Smells great and lathers just fine.</li>
    <li> I have waited years to buy this soap, because I&#x27;ve been skeptical that I&#x27;d like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I find that it makes a wonderful lather with a boar brush, and is very lubricating while shaving, and is all around a pleasure to use. The lime scent is my least favorite, but all around none are so strong as to be distracting or revolting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d tried them sooner.</li>
    <li> Conk makes great stuff. These soaps are no exception</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Have been using it for a few years now and will never go back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap, good soap, shaving soap, good shaving soap. Other than that they have smells that are pretty good I guess. Definitely good for the price and variety.</li>
    <li> Read a few reviews and thought I would give these a try. If I didn&#x27;t like them I would just give them away. Boy oh boy! I was amazed at the lather these puppies could produce! I have read reviews how others found them hard to lather up! I think they need a lesson on how to lather up shaving soap! The scents on these are very mild but I like this. I have found that this soaps gives a great barrier between my razor and skin! Cant speak enough how impressed I am with this product! If you decide to buy this you will not be making a mistake! Pull the trigger!</li>
    <li> These &#x27;pucks&#x27; do have a very long life span. After one year (previous purchase) the 3rd puck is still going strong. By comparison with disposable razors it is not only more cost effective to use double blade with good brush &amp; soap, but the shave is closer, smoother, and those with heavy beard need only shave once a day.</li>
    <li> They all give a great lather and smell pretty awesome! My favorite is definitely almond, but bayrum is close behind.</li>
    <li> I love the glycerine soaps, they lather great</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried all of the well known soap brands and to me, this stuff is the best for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Lathers fast and works very good with my safety razor. Scents smell great but do not linger long.</li>
    <li> The bulbs just perfect and I will order again.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Great soap. Provides a good amount of lather that allows you to have a nice and slick shaving surface. My favorite scent is the Lime. Good product and a good price.</li>
    <li> Bought for Christmas gift.  They all smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Not all varieties were to my liking, but a good way to sample. I&#x27;d buy some of them again.</li>
    <li> These soaps are great I used the van der Hagen soap that came with my starter kit and I liked that one but these are amazing. I didn&#x27;t think I would like the lime one that much but most of the reviewers raved on that one, and now it is my favorite as well. Do yourself a favor and try these out. Your skin and nose will thank you.</li>
    <li> I already had the Colonel Conk Almond travel soap and I loved it, but I wanted something to put in a mug for the shower at home.  I really liked the lime scent and it was the one that I didn&#x27;t think I would like.  They lather really well but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to because I just started wet shaving about 3 months ago.  I put the puck into a regular coffee mug and then set that into simmering water to melt the soap to the mug.  It worked great but I would suggest a purpose built mug or at least a short and wide coffee mug because a regular mug is a little deep to swirl your brush in withing clanking the sides.  The lime puck lasted about 2 months of shaving nearly everyday.  So I am guessing this variety pack will last 6-8 months.</li>
    <li> Great selection with the variety pack. Like the Almond soap the best</li>
