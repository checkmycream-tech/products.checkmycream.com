      <li>but I’m sure it would work just fine.</li>

      <li>This soap is great for someone who has sensitive skin or someone who is looking for an all-in-one type soap.</li>
      <li>Love that it is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>After washing, my hands felt very nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It produced a good lather as I washed - not high suds, but a good cleansing lather, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin as I washed with it.  </li>
      <li>After a few days of this kind of use, my skin feels great and very clean.  </li>
      <li>I also decided to try this out as hand soap, so I filled a pump bottle about 1/2 inch in the bottle and the rest with water.</li>
      <li>It leaves our skin feeling clean and is easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>I got to try this free for review</li>
      <li>I received this product for free for my unbiased review of this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how gentle this soap is and the fact that is isn&#x27;t drying like so many soaps seem to be.</li>
      <li>A good natural soap wash no scent to it</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t aggravate my condition, and it keeps my face feeling clean, and oil free.  </li>
      <li>It gets you clean without stripping your skin.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it displays beautifully and fits right into my kitchen decor!</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been replacing chemical laden products with products made of all natural and organic ingredients as much as possible, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Perfect natural Soap and Face Wash at a promotional discount for evaluation and review purposes I gladly accepted.  </li>
      <li>I used this product to wash my face with because it is so mild.  </li>
      <li>My son has mild acne from wearing a chin guard for football.  </li>
      <li>I am blown away at how quickly I can cleanse my skin (thoroughly) without irritation or unwanted dryness.</li>
      <li>am enjoying having the opportunity to use this new soap and can heartily recommend it.</li>
      <li>This product goes on silky, lathers up really good, and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or my hair.  </li>
      <li>We all know I love me some natural products!</li>
      <li>This year I really wanted to use better natural products and this has been easy to add in to my routine.</li>
      <li>I received a complimentary product to facilitate a review.</li>
      <li>This soap removed my foundation well and it rinsed off more completely than the soap I had been using.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have ultra sensitive skin and rosacea on top of that.</li>
      <li>I love using things that I know are good for me and don’t have all of the common harmful ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>All natural products are my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed other foxbrim products especially the argan oil and this soap has been great too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have finally found a gentle all natural soap with simple ingredients that&#x27;s effective and leaves my skin clean and hydrated still!</li>
      <li>I was super excited to try this as I am with all the Foxbrim products I have received this far.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>My face felt very clean to the touch all the way from the oily zones around my nostrils to the dry areas around my cheeks, and my skin felt soft and looked more balanced.</li>
      <li>This is an instant favorite in my house.</li>
      <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>and I love that this soap will cut down on the bottles I have to pack since I can literally use this soap to clean my hair, face and body, and then use as a hand soap.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done and leaves you feeling clean and not completely dried</li>
      <li>My hands feel clean and soft after using and I like the pump.</li>
      <li>This soap feels so creamy and lathers very very well, without having to use too much.  </li>
      <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
      <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
      <li>Just a small amount creates a nice lather that left my skin clean, but not stripped of the all important oils.</li>
      <li>I found the scent to be reminiscent of soaps of many years ago - just a simple clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>Get rid of all the extra nonsense and enjoy the pure</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The soap feels and smells great. I love using things that I know are good for me and don’t have all of the common harmful ingredients in it. I was happy to receive this item to review (who doesn&#x27;t need soap?) and bottom line is I would get it again.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Perfectly Natural Soap brings you a wonderful blend of 100% all-natural botanical ingredients that really works in synergy to effectively cleanse my skin. There was just purified water, organic coconut oil, organic sunflower oil, organic castor seed, kosher vegetable glycerin, guar gum, citric acid and rosemary seed extract. The soap was a good consistency and didn&#x27;t irritate me at all. There are no additives, fragrances, synthetics or harsh chemicals used. This soap perfect for use on the face and body. I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this stuff.  I&#x27;m loving the fact that it has no scent, no color.  I love how wonderful it lathers my hands and how easy it makes washing my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a 100% Natural soap, this is the one for you.  It even has a pump to boot</li>
    <li> I love this face wash.  My son has mild acne from wearing a chin guard for football.  It just seems to never go away no matter what he washes his face with.  After 3 days of using this face wash in the morning and at night, there are no new breakouts, and the old ones have dried up and are fading.  The scars are even fading.  His face looks incredible. I have been using it as well.  I have Rosacea and have trouble using many of the over the counter face washes.  This one doesn&#x27;t aggravate my condition, and it keeps my face feeling clean, and oil free.  I have already ordered a second bottle so I won&#x27;t have to share with my son anymore.</li>
    <li> Amazing soap. I have been using it twice a day for a week on my face and have already noticed a difference in my skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received this to review from one of my favorite company&#x27;s in the world! FOXBRIM!!! I was super excited to try this as I am with all the Foxbrim products I have received this far. So as you can see from the title of this blog this product is 100% natural and 98% organic! We all know I love me some natural products! Get rid of all the extra nonsense and enjoy the pure stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this soap is fragrance free which is awesome for my son because he has very very sensitive skin and breaks out with many scented products. As far as how the soap works....GREAT! It cleans the way you want soap to and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird residue on your skin that some soaps do. It gets the job done and leaves you feeling clean and not completely dried out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of this product is very sleek as with all Foxbrim products. The only thing that I will complain about is that it is very hard to read the small print on the packaging due to the color of the font. Other than that it displays beautifully and fits right into my kitchen decor!</li>
    <li> Love this product a little expensive but it makes me feel clean and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. i tend to breakout very easy but this product works well.</li>
    <li> This was a great smelling soap! It foamed up just enough and left my skin clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> All natural products are my favorite.  This soap is a multipurpose product.  It&#x27;s so gentle that you can definitely use it on your face, body or hair.  It gets you clean without stripping your skin.  It has no noticeable scent as well which is great if you have scent sensitivities.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I am a Foxbrim fan. I have not been disappointed by any of their products that I&#x27;ve used so far. This product did not disappoint either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this natural soap and face wash. I have ultra sensitive skin and rosacea on top of that. This soap has no fragrance and is gentle on my skin. It also removes make up amazingly well. It does not leave my skin dried out and feeling like I&#x27;ve just had a too tight face lift. I have been using it nightly since I got it with no skin irritations, redness, or stinging. Foxbrim has done it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for those who suffer from sensitive skin and/or allergies. This has performed so well, that I won&#x27;t be going back to my old cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance-free soap. We use this mostly for washing our face at night before bed. It leaves our skin feeling clean and is easy to wash off. The pump makes things easy and is nice to have.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve grown so accustomed to simply using the products that line our store&#x27;s shelves and make our selection based only because we like how they work, what they smell like, or how they might taste. We have given little thought as to what that product actually consists. Fortunately, there is been a movement afoot to root out the chemicals and get back to ingredients from natural sources. Some even reaching for a higher level of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; in that they aim for organic natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has been working to create products along this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; line and the result is much like the products of yesteryear when life was simple, more natural. Their newest product is Perfectly Natural Soap. It comes in a small pump bottle much like we find hand soaps. But this is not simply a hand soap. It is a natural product that can be used all over the body and even for one&#x27;s hair. Versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it takes a very small amount to work. The lather is not excessive. After washing, my hands felt very nice and soft. Even a kind of &amp;#34;silky.&amp;#34; This tells me it has not dried my skin as some harsh soaps/detergents have done. I found the scent to be reminiscent of soaps of many years ago - just a simple clean fragrance. Ingredients include: wonderful hand-picked botanicals of Saponified Coconut Oils, Organic Sunflower and Organic Castor Seed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying having the opportunity to use this new soap and can heartily recommend it. I received a complimentary product to facilitate a review. Opinions are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I used this product to wash my face with because it is so mild.  Just a small amount creates a nice lather that left my skin clean, but not stripped of the all important oils.</li>
    <li> I have been making my own body wash for a while now, and I usually use castiel soap as a base, but this Foxbrim natural soap wash works just as well! I use about 1/3 C for an entire mason jar of body wash, which also works fantastic for baby hair and body wash. I also decided to try this out as hand soap, so I filled a pump bottle about 1/2 inch in the bottle and the rest with water. Then take water, fill it up the rest of the way and swirl it around. Then it pumps out perfect. I absolutely love that it is made from plants and that it is 98% organic. Great for the environment and even better for using on your body. The less chemicals the better. I adore Foxbrim products, this lives up to the rest! I highly recommend. The bottle is dark plastic to help keep the soap and wash from degrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY</li>
    <li> Great soap it takes makeup off &amp; use for body! It is costly to use as a whole body soap, you only have to use a small amount though, which helps. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been replacing chemical laden products with products made of all natural and organic ingredients as much as possible, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this Perfect natural Soap and Face Wash at a promotional discount for evaluation and review purposes I gladly accepted.  This soap is an all over soap that can be used as a hand soap, a shower soap, or a face wash. I have combination skin and so I tested it as a face wash to see how well it handled both oily skin and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is 100% natural &amp; 98% organic and it has no fillers, fragrances, detergents, lathering agents, parabens, phthalates, silicones, sodium lauryl sulfate OR Triclosaand , and comes in an 8oz size plastic pump bottle.  The soap is a clear color with a nice consistency, and I think I detected a slight citrus scent. It produced a good lather as I washed - not high suds, but a good cleansing lather, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin as I washed with it.  This soap removed my foundation well and it rinsed off more completely than the soap I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My face felt very clean to the touch all the way from the oily zones around my nostrils to the dry areas around my cheeks, and my skin felt soft and looked more balanced. It definitely cleaned excess oils from my nasal area, yet it didn&#x27;t dry my face out in the process. I absolutely love how gentle this soap is and the fact that is isn&#x27;t drying like so many soaps seem to be. At my age the last thing I want is anything that dries out my skin and causes wrinkles after all.  It&#x27;s nice to have finally found a gentle all natural soap with simple ingredients that&#x27;s effective and leaves my skin clean and hydrated still!</li>
    <li> This is a great natural soap that is wonderful for sensitive skin!!!! I use it on my face and it&#x27;s great. It removes makeup with ease. This will definitely become apart of my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this soap. It works great for my skin and I&#x27;m all about natural products. This year I really wanted to use better natural products and this has been easy to add in to my routine. I&#x27;ve enjoyed other foxbrim products especially the argan oil and this soap has been great too. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> A good natural soap wash no scent to it but it washes great, my face feels clean after use. Recommend this one. This soap is also good for the body also.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. I have been truly enjoying it. My skin looks brighter, clearer, and this all natural soap actually helps me to cut back on shower time. I am blown away at how quickly I can cleanse my skin (thoroughly) without irritation or unwanted dryness. Please, don&#x27;t change this product&#x27;s ingredients!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Foxbrim&#x27;s products and this natural hand and body soap is just another reason why!  This soap feels so creamy and lathers very very well, without having to use too much.  Doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it has a naturals scent, if any at all.  Perfect for both men and women.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Lathers well. This has a nice creamy texture while washing.  Doesnt dry out my skin.  Love that it is fragrance free. Very gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding oil. I use it every morning and its perfect. I love how it smells and feels. Great purchase. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I got to try this free for review but I would have bought it and will again! SO gentle and nourishing, I can not get enough of it! So gentle and full of good stuff you can use it on your face!</li>
    <li> This is an instant favorite in my house. I&#x27;m keeping it in the kitchen. I like that it&#x27;s made of safe ingredients, and I like the very light fragrance.  My hands feel clean and soft after using and I like the pump. It is a generous sized bottle so it should last my family a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to use this product at first because of my extremely sensitive skin.  It has taken me a years to find a soap that didn&#x27;t cause a reaction on my chest and back.  I gave this a shot because of the ingredients (or lack there of) and because of the brand.  My wife and I use Foxbrim products regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with a very hard test, washing my hands after a very good, but greasy chicken dinner.  Just a little bit of soap, not more than a half of a pump, 15 seconds of washing, and all the grease was gone and my hands weren&#x27;t dried up.  So I repeated two more times to see if my knuckles would dry up(they get very dry in the winter if I don&#x27;t take care of them).  My hands felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I used the soap in the shower as a body and face soap and as shampoo.  This product goes on silky, lathers up really good, and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or my hair.  The best part for me was I could rinse the soap out of my hair without avoiding the run off hitting my back and chest.  After a few days of this kind of use, my skin feels great and very clean.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, dermatitis-plagued skin. Needless to say, I have to be extra careful on what skin care products to use. My dermatitis usually flares up when I have my monthly period and I use Foxbrim&#x27;s Perfectly Natural Soap regularly because I believe that prevention is always better than cure. I noticed that when I started using this mild soap on my body, I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;crazy flare ups&amp;#34; like I used to get in the past. Foxbrim is a brand that I trust, as I have used quite a lot of their products in the past. I must say that like their other products, this Natural Soap and Face Wash has worked well for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. It lathers up nice and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser works well and it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it is made from mostly natural and organic ingredients and has no harsh chemicals. It can be used even on sensitive skin, and it has not made me break out or given me the itchies (yet).  Some soaps and shampoos will make me itch like crazy after I use them but this soap has not done that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for someone who has sensitive skin or someone who is looking for an all-in-one type soap. There are no worries about added dyes, fragrances, or any other harsh chemicals. This soap can be used from head to toe. I love that I can take this soap in the shower and use it to wash my face and body. The soap doesn’t dry out my skin and leaves it feeling clean and refreshed. I really like using this soap as a facial cleanser. I put a dab in my sonic face brush to cleanse my skin. The soap did not dry out my skin like a lot of facial cleansers can do. I like that this soap is gentle enough to use on my face but effective enough to cleanse my body. Sometimes that is hard to find in a soap. I haven’t tried using it on my hair yet but I’m sure it would work just fine. I’m planning a camping trip soon and I love that this soap will cut down on the bottles I have to pack since I can literally use this soap to clean my hair, face and body, and then use as a hand soap. But best of all it’s all natural and good for your skin. I received this product for free for my unbiased review of this product.</li>
