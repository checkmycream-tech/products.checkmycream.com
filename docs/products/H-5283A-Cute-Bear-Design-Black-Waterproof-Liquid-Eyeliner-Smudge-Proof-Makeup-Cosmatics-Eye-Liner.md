    <li> This eyeliner is definitely cute. I received the red one.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it on October 22nd, arrived October 24th.&lt;br /&gt;Really fast delivery. To be honest, it&#x27;s not the best.&lt;br /&gt;It dries in about 40 seconds, so you&#x27;d have to constantly dip it in.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, when I use the Clarins eye make up remover, tiny liquid eyeliner crusts stay on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff also sticks and dries on your eyelashes too. It&#x27;s hard to take off, and I pulled out like 3 eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Not a  good product, but this is what you get for five dollars.  Really cute, I&#x27;ll give you that.</li>
    <li> The one I received doesn&#x27;t look how it&#x27;s pictured online. The bear is solid red and appears to be crying, and the whole lid is solid black. I&#x27;ll be giving it as a gift for Christmas though, so hopefully they like it. It was also larger than I expected it to be, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> super cute but it was not sealed like it had been opened so i didn&#x27;t use it was a little concerned that it might be tampered with &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> i love it .. it is so easy to take off and looks great,i love the design on the front</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new eyeliner. It came fast. I got a red one and I use it everyday ever since I got it and it lasts me all day also.</li>
    <li> I recently got this eyeliner in the mail and it has a very nice size. I expected it to be a lot smaller since it was so cheap but the awesome price was too good to pass up. it goes on and stays on very clear and nice, great for every day use or for cosplay reasons. HIGHLY RECOMEND!!</li>
    <li> I love these they arrived a week early &amp; work amazing recommend it to more people although you get random colors they are just too cute.</li>
    <li> I love it! Will buy this again :) it dries fast, thin line, perfect black. And so cute! It came early as well :)!!!!</li>
    <li> pretty good for a liquid eyeliner. especially for the price. most low cost eyeliners do not stay that well, prolly will purchase again</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner for my bestfriend and I ended up loving it, too. I ordered myself one. it&#x27;s super smooth and super dark. I love it. plus, it&#x27;s cute.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dark black, its cute and everyones asks where u got it from but it wasn&#x27;t waterproof. I found myself reapplying a couple of times a day, it is smudge proof, overall great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> it flakes and it dries really quick. I liked it but then it ended up making my eyes watery and my eyes are not that sensitive.</li>
    <li> I got a crying bear. Not really what I want to show my friends. Looks nothing like the picture. It gets used up way to fast. Otherwise, Good.</li>
    <li> I could not be any happier with this! I love how dark the color it is, I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding good liquid eyeliner and I finally found it! I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge, the color is amazing and the brush works easily. I would recommend this product, I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> I just got this item a few minutes ago and aside from the awesome bear, this eyeliner is awesome. I put it on and it is a nice dark black and it dries immediately.  I recommend it !!</li>
    <li> Yes it it a cute design but...&lt;br /&gt;1- the felt tip doesn&#x27;t stay stiff and once I used it twice it just stayed in a bent position and never stays straight&lt;br /&gt;2- it started to get clumpy and I don&#x27;t even know how that&#x27;s possible but yea horrible&lt;br /&gt;3- I asked for a BROWN bear and they told me I got a PINK one and when I opened it  it was BLACK -.-&lt;br /&gt;4- after 10 min. It started to peel off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t even use it anymore after the third time so don&#x27;t buy it. Its definitely not worth it TRUST</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really dark black, dries immediately, and smudge proof but not water proof. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great eyeliner at a great price. (Plus, it&#x27;s super cute.)</li>
