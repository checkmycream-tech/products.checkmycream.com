      <li>It has a very soft, pleasant scent and is not overpowering.....</li>
      <li>Introduce u a fresh n warm n clean aroma.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Smelled amazing for about a month then it started smelling like pure chemical.</li>
      <li>More money does NOT mean better.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite fragrance!</li>
      <li>I love how light and feminine it is and while it does dissipate quickly, that is actually a positive for me!</li>
      <li>DKNY Pure is a nice fresh, light floral scent.</li>
      <li>It is light, sweet and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so excited over a perfume before.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>Its a clean scent w/hint</li>
      <li>Clean n airy like just after shower under sunshine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume and I have a hard time finding scents that I like and this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell straight out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Also it fades too quickly.</li>
      <li>Arrived safe &amp; completely intact of original packaging.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Pure DKNY.I bought my first bottle while on vacation in Montana.</li>
      <li>I think this may be my new favorite.</li>
      <li>It is great for summer, but I wear it year round.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Ok i shake it a little better.</li>
      <li>After trying Pure DKNY I immediately purchased the largest bottle!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and fresh, just a tiny bit sweet.  </li>
      <li>Totally different, much lighter scent &amp; fades much more quickly.  </li>
      <li>I first smelled it in one of those magazine ads, and knew I had to have it.</li>
      <li>PURE chemical.</li>
      <li>I recieved my Pure DKNY within 4 days of ordering.</li>
      <li>and she really loves the fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I was ecstatic to find it here for much cheaper than department or beauty stores.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>A very feminine fragrance.</li>
      <li>Really, find something else.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast also.</li>
      <li>When I ran out I realized that no one carries the Pure DKNY in my area,so I went online to order a new bottle.</li>
      <li>It has a very light scent to it even with a few squirts.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It would be great for spring/summer, except for the fact that the scent only lasts on my skin for about half an hour before it totally fades.</li>
      <li>I never, I mean NEVER wore perfume.</li>
      <li>My favorite everyday perfume.</li>
      <li>Needed a new fragrance for summer</li>
      <li>Not too sweet or heavy, even when first applied.  </li>
      <li>Altho it is my second choice..hopefully they continue to make it unlike my first choice</li>
      <li>old daughter put this on her Christmas wish list.</li>
      <li>To me it&#x27;s too flowery, it smells almost like old lady perfume or potpourri.</li>
      <li>Has a soft but penetrating scent...don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a shame because I spent nearly the same amount of a REAL pure dkny.</li>
      <li>Initially, it smells fantastic, but the scent fades after a few hours.</li>
      <li>I doused myself pretty heavily with it, and only 2-3 hours later, the scent was completely gone... a little sad about that, but it&#x27;s still a wonderful smell.</li>
      <li>is simple and just a little sweet.</li>
      <li>so far smell like scented roach spray and don&#x27;t last</li>
      <li>Frustrating because I would like to be able to wear it now, but will have to wait for the correct product to come from DKNY.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it seems to fade fairly quickly for a parfum.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My Favorite! Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Smelled amazing for about a month then it started smelling like pure chemical. PURE chemical. Still have this perfume to prove it, I&#x27;m gonna toss it but it&#x27;s a shame because I spent nearly the same amount of a REAL pure dkny.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat the price!! You can get the same perfume in various stores, but not at this price. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I smelled this as a sample and immediately ordered a bottle.  It&#x27;s so light and fresh, just a tiny bit sweet.  I LOVE IT!  My only complaint is that it seems to fade fairly quickly for a parfum.</li>
    <li> I have always liked perfume, but was always unsure about how I wore it. What I mean is, if it was the right scent for me. I have a go to perfume, a different one that my husband loves and that I had gotten a lot of compliments on. Then my Inlaws gave me a sample of this for Christmas, and as soon as I smelled it, I fell in love with it. It&#x27;s not too strong, not overpowering, is simple and just a little sweet. A very feminine fragrance. Very pretty. I think this may be my new favorite. I am going to buy a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this perfume, I love DKNY!! However, I was disappointed when I got it. It smells nothing like vanilla and it is not clean smelling at all. To me it&#x27;s too flowery, it smells almost like old lady perfume or potpourri. Also it fades too quickly.</li>
    <li> This is not a perfume!!  It is eau de TOILETTE.  Totally different, much lighter scent &amp; fades much more quickly.  A perfume store should know the difference.  Frustrating because I would like to be able to wear it now, but will have to wait for the correct product to come from DKNY.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents and I was ecstatic to find it here for much cheaper than department or beauty stores.  Arrived safe &amp; completely intact of original packaging.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> so far smell like scented roach spray and don&#x27;t last and i had the nerve to make a mistake and order two, got to send one back. Ok i shake it a little better.</li>
    <li> Initially, it smells fantastic, but the scent fades after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Like it. Would buy again. Introduce u a fresh n warm n clean aroma. Clean n airy like just after shower under sunshine.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff and I admit it smells good. Excellent fragrance and decent price. Bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Needed a new fragrance for summer and this is it!  It&#x27;s very light, but smells so good!  My new favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> DKNY Pure is a nice fresh, light floral scent. It would be great for spring/summer, except for the fact that the scent only lasts on my skin for about half an hour before it totally fades. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume ever....</li>
    <li> Love it! Great scent. Arrived safely. Love saving money on perfumes that are so expensive in the department stores. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessing about this perfume since I smelled it in a magazine. It doesn&#x27;t smell like ANYTHING else out there. So soft, dainty, warm, light. I can wear this year-round and I&#x27;m going to be smelling AWESOME! I&#x27;ve never gotten so excited over a perfume before. Seriously.. just buy it-You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume and I have a hard time finding scents that I like and this is perfect.  It&#x27;s a very light, fresh scent.  It is great for summer, but I wear it year round.  I agree with some of the other postings that it seems to wear off after a couple of hours and it is not a strong scent...that&#x27;s partially what I like about it.  I don&#x27;t like smelling like I just walked through cosmetics in a department store.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in a sealed box.  My wife loved the scent.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume Altho it is my second choice..hopefully they continue to make it unlike my first choice</li>
    <li> Not overpowering. Its a clean scent w/hint if vanilla.. I dont like floral scents or musks. They tend to give me a headache. I&#x27;ve had numerous strangers stop me &amp; ask me what scent Im wearing cause they loved the way it smelled also.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Real deal, smells great! Price is absolutely fabulous, much better than what i pay @ pricey retailers! Shipping was fast also. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Before smelling this perfume as a sample I never, I mean NEVER wore perfume. After trying Pure DKNY I immediately purchased the largest bottle! I love how light and feminine it is and while it does dissipate quickly, that is actually a positive for me! I think this perfume will become one of my staples.</li>
    <li> Terrific.  love it.Terrific.</li>
    <li> This is really nice smelling stuff.  My wife was really happy with me for getting it for here for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant perfume for me. I tested it before, so I knew it in advance. It is light, sweet and I think for every day not for event.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Pure DKNY.I bought my first bottle while on vacation in Montana.When I ran out I realized that no one carries the Pure DKNY in my area,so I went online to order a new bottle.After searching several site and comparing price,Amazon beat them all with the lowest price.I recieved my Pure DKNY within 4 days of ordering.I bought the 3.4oz bottle and it last me 2-3 months.I use 2-4 sprays daily.For best price and fast shipping order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was extremely satisfied with the quality of the product. It&#x27;s the real thing. shipment was on time and quality product just like in store.</li>
    <li> I first smelled it in one of those magazine ads, and knew I had to have it. I love the smell straight out of the bottle. Its fresh, citrusy and clean smell is perfect for day time/work. I doused myself pretty heavily with it, and only 2-3 hours later, the scent was completely gone... a little sad about that, but it&#x27;s still a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Smell good. Big bottle.</li>
    <li> My 30 yr. old daughter put this on her Christmas wish list. It has a very soft, pleasant scent and is not overpowering.....</li>
    <li> Has a soft but penetrating scent...don&#x27;t overdo it. I like it as an occassional change, definitely not an every day thing.</li>
    <li> I order the Pure Dkny Eau De Parfum Spray by Donna Karan, 3.4 Ounce for my wife and she loved it.  The package arrived several days earlier than anticipated.  I would definitely buy from this seller again. thanks.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy this perfume a while ago, but it was way too expensive in the store.  I was happy to find it online for  much cheaper.  The smell is amazing and not too strong.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance. It was a great Mothers Day surprise. Hard to find anywhere else but Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite perfume. It has a very light scent to it even with a few squirts.  I constantly get compliments on this scent from people at work and my friends.  I do wish they would make a little purse size spray or roll on of this specific Parfum.</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter and it made her happy because I bought what she wanted. Her husband likes how it smells so I made both of them happy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife thinking it smelled great.  I have no idea what I was thinking.  after a time smelling it on her, i regret this purchase.  More money does NOT mean better.  lesson learned.  guys...  try to find a perfume that you know your wife already likes and get that.  I went out on a limb and choose this one by myself.  I mean she wears it because I bought it (and says she likes it but I dont think she does).  Really, find something else. I am going to have to hide this perfume.  I&#x27;ve told her that I made a mistake with it.  I will buy something else for her.  (They should offer zero stars)</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter in law for Christmas and she really loves the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Yes. My favorite everyday perfume.</li>
    <li> Not too sweet or heavy, even when first applied.  Scent lingers well into the evening.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
