      <li>This fragrance makes me feel more energetic and happy.</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot, it reminds me of summer on the beach with coconut, vanilla, and ocean.  </li>
      <li>But the scent is great, glad I made the purchase and would recommend it for a light, summer fragrance.</li>

      <li>Love Love this item.....</li>
      <li>My favorite of the Philosophy line.</li>
      <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>I forget I used it most of the time.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite scents</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I hope it is not being discontinued because I get so many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this fragrance</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell that makes me feel so nice when I wear it.</li>
      <li>A good surprise for me since I was trying it for the first time.</li>
      <li>Its a very light, clean scent.</li>
      <li>Four sprays is too many and I ended up smelling cloyingly sweet.  </li>
      <li>Love, love this this perfume...smells really fresh and clean..</li>
      <li>I tend to wear the Amazing Grace in the winter and fall and hope to buy a large bottle of that as well.</li>
      <li>Love this light fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s sweet citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>If you like fresh and light try it.</li>
      <li>But it disappears so quickly.</li>
      <li>I tend to spray this more than other perfumes since it is light, and it was nice to have the large bottle all summer.</li>
      <li>Only thing I could wish for is that it lasted longer once on, but maybe it wouldn&#x27;t smell so nice then.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>A light and floral fragrance, might seem strong when you first spray it, but really subtle and nice.</li>
      <li>Exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>This came exactly as described and within the given time frame.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent but when you spray it the scent doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
      <li>Funny how reviews for falling in love and summer grace are the exact same</li>
      <li>wondering if any of these reviews are even made by people who really bought the product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and a lovely fragrance but lasts for only a short while.</li>
      <li>Amazing scent, light but subtle floral scents.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this at Ulta, Sephora, or even the Philosophy website in the large bottle.</li>
      <li>When I apply fine perfume (which this is supposed to be I believe), I usually only use one spray, sometimes two depending on the perfume.  </li>
      <li>Maybe why they make such a huge bottle, because you need to use a lot of it, even when using the lotion and 3 in 1.  </li>
      <li>Philosophy Fragrance Summer Grace is definitely not at all similar to Amazing Grace in any way!!!&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you can find it!  </li>
      <li>very reasonable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone, but this scent is so fresh and clean for summer, or even year round.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this is no more, it smells really nice.</li>
      <li>I think that for the price and the quality, it was not worth it though I usually love philosophy products.</li>
      <li>That, and the high price, is the reason for the 4 stars.  </li>
      <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
      <li>I am a pure grace girl and this is almost as soft smelling as that.</li>
      <li>get the lotion it adds to the smell and is like wow!!  </li>
      <li>The fragrance seems a little different but nice.  </li>
      <li>I feel this scent may smell Gr8 on very young girls &amp; teens.  </li>
      <li>Nothing like any other Grace Clean Feminine Fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I was worried that the fragrance may be old, but I took a chance.  </li>
      <li>Definitely weird how this fragrance has exact same reviews as falling in love summer.</li>
      <li>that was not expected seeing it was not around CHRISTMAS.</li>
      <li>In defense of the Seller the product arrived in 2.5 days from my placed order way earlier than expected &amp; very well packed.</li>
      <li>I really dislike Pomegranate mixed in This way &amp; only ordered this bc the company Listed Bergamot as a note which I adore due to</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this scent and any other philosophy products</li>

    <li> this is the best smelling fragrance i have smelt in a while.  lasts a long time.  get the lotion it adds to the smell and is like wow!!  get it.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered and packaged just as promised.  I am most grateful to be able to purchase more of this fabulously clean scent, and  I receive many compliments when wearing it!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great scent!  I get a lot of compliments.  Price point very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> I wear this all during the year. This fragrance makes me feel more energetic and happy. If you like fresh and light try it.</li>
    <li> I have had so much trouble trying to get this fragrance, thank you sooo much I will order again when I need it.  this is one of my favorite scents</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents but I believe Philosophy may have discontinued this. I&#x27;m so happy I found it but a bit disappointed the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> I have terrible allergies and Philosophy is the only perfume I can wear without getting a sinus infection. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone, but this scent is so fresh and clean for summer, or even year round. I tend to wear the Amazing Grace in the winter and fall and hope to buy a large bottle of that as well. I couldn&#x27;t find this at Ulta, Sephora, or even the Philosophy website in the large bottle. Most stores didn&#x27;t carry even the small bottle until late in the season either. I tend to spray this more than other perfumes since it is light, and it was nice to have the large bottle all summer. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend if you can find it!  Long lasting fragrance.  Get many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep making this fragrance!  It is great!</li>
    <li> This came exactly as described and within the given time frame.  Absolutely love this fragrance and I am sad that they are discontinuing it.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law had this sent on and I loved it. Perfumes usually give me a migrane but not this one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is no more, it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> It is a lovely scented mist.  I use it to spritz after the shower.  I still use my favorite fragrance after I dress.</li>
    <li> The bottle came in a CHRISTMAS box.....that was not expected seeing it was not around CHRISTMAS. It was a birthday gift. Other than that...A Great gift!</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance from another retailer a year ago and loved it.  They don&#x27;t carry this scent anymore so I found it on Amazon.  The fragrance seems a little different but nice.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  Will keep and use but probably not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was worried that the fragrance may be old, but I took a chance.  It was a gift for my mom and she is loving it!  Great summer scent and was glad to find it through an Amazon seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite scent. It was  cheaper than QVC.  Now I know where I will shop for it next time.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  I hope it is not being discontinued because I get so many compliments on it.  It&#x27;s a clean smell that makes me feel so nice when I wear it.</li>
    <li> My favorite of the Philosophy line. I would recommend it to anyone who likes lite and airy fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PPP</li>
    <li> This is one. Of my favorites! Exactly as shown.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, light but subtle floral scents. It&#x27;s an addiction. I do night like heavy perfumes and this eau de toilette is perfect for me. Everyone tells me how great I smell!!</li>
    <li> Love Love this item..... I am a pure grace girl and this is almost as soft smelling as that. I purchased it at a GREAT PRICE too!!!</li>
    <li> This a Beautiful Fragrance!! Just Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent but when you spray it the scent doesn&#x27;t last at all. I forget I used it most of the time. I wish philosophy would make this a little longer lasting.</li>

Nothing like any other Grace Clean Feminine Fragrance.  I feel this scent may smell Gr8 on very young girls &amp; teens.  In defense of the Seller the product arrived in 2.5 days from my placed order way earlier than expected &amp; very well packed.</li>
    <li> Funny how reviews for falling in love and summer grace are the exact same</li>
    <li> A favorite summer scent!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy brand</li>
    <li> Definitely weird how this fragrance has exact same reviews as falling in love summer. Definitely interesting!... wondering if any of these reviews are even made by people who really bought the product!</li>
    <li> A light and floral fragrance, might seem strong when you first spray it, but really subtle and nice. A good surprise for me since I was trying it for the first time.</li>
    <li> Great price for the size. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love this light fresh scent.  Only thing I could wish for is that it lasted longer once on, but maybe it wouldn&#x27;t smell so nice then.  I will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I truly love this fragrance. It&#x27;s very light and feminine. But it disappears so quickly. I wish that it lasted longer so I spray it on the clothes I&#x27;m wearing that day. It seems to last a little longer on the clothing but it&#x27;s so frustrating that it doesn&#x27;t last on me. Want to get the entire line of Summer Grace products so maybe it will last longer that way. I love that it&#x27;s not at all overpowering. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love it. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> my favorite fragrance wish the didn&#x27;t stop making it</li>
    <li> The delivery went smoothly however I am not impressed by the product. It&#x27;s light and a lovely fragrance but lasts for only a short while. I think that for the price and the quality, it was not worth it though I usually love philosophy products.</li>
    <li> My review is for the scent of SUMMER GRACE.  I liked it a lot, it reminds me of summer on the beach with coconut, vanilla, and ocean.  One gripe I have is with the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; fragrance.  When I apply fine perfume (which this is supposed to be I believe), I usually only use one spray, sometimes two depending on the perfume.  With this one, it took some trial and error because one spray is definitely not enough to last any length of time.  Four sprays is too many and I ended up smelling cloyingly sweet.  Maybe why they make such a huge bottle, because you need to use a lot of it, even when using the lotion and 3 in 1.  That, and the high price, is the reason for the 4 stars.  But the scent is great, glad I made the purchase and would recommend it for a light, summer fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and I have had multiple guys stop me at random to compliment me on my perfume. It catches EVERYONES attention. Its a very light, clean scent. Perfect for any summer occasion. I would highly recommend this scent and any other philosophy products</li>
    <li> Love, love this this perfume...smells really fresh and clean..you will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume.  I bought it for my mom for Chirstmas - smells so light and clean but also stays smelling good all day!</li>
