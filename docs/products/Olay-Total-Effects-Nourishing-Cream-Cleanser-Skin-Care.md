      <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I do have fine lines on my face.  </li>

      <li>Smells fantastic too.</li>
      <li>What worked for me is Acne Free.</li>
      <li>This cleanser leaves skin feeling creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I sound like a drama king</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t have that clean feeling.</li>
      <li>natural oils love it better than foaming wash</li>
      <li>It is very smooth and gentle.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so soft and its given it a nice shine, like it comes from within.</li>
      <li>Price is right and it works great for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Good for makeup removal and helping dry skin.</li>
      <li>It takes my makeup off, makes my skin feel clean, without it feeling tight or stripping away moisture, and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I have acute to moderate acne.</li>
      <li>I have been using Olay Total Effects Nourshing Cream Cleanser for several years, and it is the absolute best cleanser ever!  </li>
      <li>None of it worth the money.</li>
      <li>It cleans gently, leaves my skin clean, moisturized.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good for use after using a product that is a little harsher to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>First I found Dior Magique Milk Cleanser.  </li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s gentle and creamy</li>
      <li>and this is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Price was right---and delivery time was very speedy...like the olay products</li>
      <li>Being over 50, I figured I should step-up my skin care treatment and use something more basic than the Complete products.  </li>
      <li>I have a tendency to get dry skin but this cleanser was gentle on my face and helped to smooth my skin too.</li>
      <li>I will continue using it as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>I started using Rx Solutions Skin Therapy moisturizers around a month after I started using this cleanser and the combination has left me with the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had in close to 3 years of trying to find the right combination of skin care products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the few cleansers and the only cheap cleanser that can clean AND keep my skin soft!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle, especially on my eyes when I&#x27;m removing my make up.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, my skin felt very dry and taut, but after that it left my skin feeling clean and soft with no allergic reaction.  </li>
      <li>Not the same as store bought in many previous occasions.</li>
      <li>I do think I will go back to Definity, because I like the gentle scrubbers in that product.</li>
      <li>Cleans well and leaves my face soft.</li>
      <li>I have been getting so many compliments on my skin the last few weeks.</li>
      <li>just started to use so difficult to determine if a good product or not.  </li>
      <li>So far it does clean my face but doesn&#x27;t seem any better or worse than other cleansers I have used.  </li>
      <li>One positive it that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like other Olay products I have tried before, and it definitely comes at a reasonable price, compared to other face-washes recommended for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I recently switched to this because the store didn&#x27;t have my old Olay cleanser anymore.</li>
      <li>I am a twenty-something year old with perpetually dry skin, which is only worsened in the winter.</li>

<li> When my usual exfoliating face-wash wasn&#x27;t holding up to the cold, dry weather, I bought this product to help keep my face moisturized, so it would stop flaking.</li>
<li> Also, it was the bigger pimples that leave the bad scars.</li>

    <li> Good for makeup removal and helping dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for awhile now...I recently switched to this because the store didn&#x27;t have my old Olay cleanser anymore. Let me say how much I LOVE IT! I use it in conjunction with my Clairsonic and Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay facial products for almost 2 years and I have nothing but good things to say about them.  I saw this cleanser somewhere, I don&#x27;t recall and was not able to find it in any store, which was shocking to me.  Of course I came to Amazon.com and there it was.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this two pack.  I have noticed a significant change in my skin, for the better.  I will continue to use and purchase this cleanser along with other Olay products (moisturizers, night creams, under eye treatments).</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Price is right and it works great for my dry skin. Smells fantastic too.</li>
    <li> I had been using Olay \\&quot;Nourishing Cream\\&quot; cleanser (blue banner on the label) for several months and then the local mass-merchandiser stopped stocking it.  I have normal/dry skin and this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my face, smell strongly or cause breakouts.  I started using Rx Solutions Skin Therapy moisturizers around a month after I started using this cleanser and the combination has left me with the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had in close to 3 years of trying to find the right combination of skin care products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay products for years.  Being over 50, I figured I should step-up my skin care treatment and use something more basic than the Complete products.  I used Definity for a couple of months, and really liked those products.  This time, I thought I would use Total Effects.  The cream cleanser is very nice, it leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth.  I do think I will go back to Definity, because I like the gentle scrubbers in that product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My face feels amazing every time I use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Oil of Olay products. This cleanser is the best! It removes make up better than any other cleanser, even tough eye make-up! I have dry skin and this is very moisturizing. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> just started to use so difficult to determine if a good product or not.  So far it does clean my face but doesn&#x27;t seem any better or worse than other cleansers I have used.  One positive it that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 30, but I have dry skin.  Every grocery store cleanser I&#x27;ve tried has made my skin even drier.  I&#x27;ve even tried a few dept. store products.  Unlike grocery store products, most of them are too oily and make me break out or don&#x27;t do anything (including take off my makeup).  First I found Dior Magique Milk Cleanser.  It takes my makeup off, makes my skin feel clean, without it feeling tight or stripping away moisture, and has a pleasant scent.  I was prepared to pay the $30 a bottle for the rest of my life because it was the only thing that worked...until I found the Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Cleanser.  It works just as well as Dior for me and you can get it on here or in the grocery store for 1/4 of the price.  As long as Olay keeps making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  It&#x27;s one of the few cleansers and the only cheap cleanser that can clean AND keep my skin soft!  -Christy</li>
    <li> this stuff does what it says it softens without stripping youre natural oils love it better than foaming wash my favorite please dont stop selling</li>
    <li> This cleanser is one of the very few that I can use to wash my face and not have to also use a moisturizer.  Always keep extra on hand so I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
    <li> I am a twenty-something year old with perpetually dry skin, which is only worsened in the winter. When my usual exfoliating face-wash wasn&#x27;t holding up to the cold, dry weather, I bought this product to help keep my face moisturized, so it would stop flaking. After a week and a half of this face-wash, my face feels wonderful! I only use it once a day, followed by a Neutrogena daily moisturizer with SPF 15 (the same as I used with my previous face-wash). It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like other Olay products I have tried before, and it definitely comes at a reasonable price, compared to other face-washes recommended for dry skin. I&#x27;ll be keeping this one for awhile!</li>
    <li> Not the same as store bought in many previous occasions.</li>
    <li> Ok. So I bought this product, not from amazon though, and was thinking of switching to Olay 7 total effects lotion, body wash, and this face cleanser. The body wash and lotion are just ok. But for this cleanser, IT BROKE ME OUT! Badly! I don&#x27;t know what they use in this but I even got comments from friends stating they&#x27;ve never seen my face look this bad. As soon as I stopped using it, my face stopped breaking out. I mean bad acne all over my face like I was going through puberty all over again. I definitely would not recommend any of the Total Effects brands. The face lotion breaks me out too. The body lotion is ok. The body wash is just ok. None of it worth the money. And just in case I wasn&#x27;t clear, this Acne Wash gave me bad acne. I can&#x27;t believe this. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw. I have acute to moderate acne. It depends on the time of year and what product I&#x27;m using. What worked for me is Acne Free. I used it twice a day to have None to Acute acne. Mostly none at all. But this Olay gave me moderate acne. No acute. Almost severe. Also, it was the bigger pimples that leave the bad scars. I currently am nursing my skin back to health from the brutal treatment of this fragrance infused acne causing face wash. But I now have dark spots the size of an eraser on a pencil. On my forehead, temples, cheeks, and one on my NOSE! Lol. I&#x27;m serious but this kinda made me laugh. I sound like a drama king but I&#x27;m being literal. No embellishment.</li>
    <li> It is very smooth and gentle. Cleans well and leaves my face soft. It was a great buy at two for almost the price of one.</li>
    <li> I compared prices on this product and I definitely got the best deal here. I have a tendency to get dry skin but this cleanser was gentle on my face and helped to smooth my skin too. I&#x27;ve been happy with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> very good cleanser..makes my skin feel soft.....I would buy it again. Price was right---and delivery time was very speedy...like the olay products</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smells good and feels good.</li>
    <li> Olay products are the only products I will use on my face and skin.  I am 59 years old and my skin is in wonderful condition.  I have no wrinkles and my face feels clean, fresh, and beautiful all the time.  Everyone compliments my skin especially since I have no wrinkles and they cannot believe my age.  What is most important is that my skin is healthy and light and it makes me feel pretty and happy!  Thank you Olay for such wonderful care you give in your products!</li>
    <li> Not a very good cleanser, though retains moisture</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay Total Effects Nourshing Cream Cleanser for several years, and it is the absolute best cleanser ever!  It cleans gently, leaves my skin clean, moisturized. comfortable and beautiful.  My only problem is that the product is difficult to find.  I will continue using it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. It smells so nice and it&#x27;s very gentle, especially on my eyes when I&#x27;m removing my make up. It leaves my skin so soft and its given it a nice shine, like it comes from within. I love it and recommend it. It&#x27;s my second time using and I swear by it. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This cleanser leaves skin feeling creamy and smooth. I like that it&#x27;s gentle and creamy so it&#x27;s good for use after using a product that is a little harsher to exfoliate. Would not recommend using on its own, I think it works well in combination with another cleanser but this is just based on my skin type which is more oily and needs exfoliation ever so often.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Olay products and I got this cleanser because of all the great reviews.  However, every time I wash my face with this cream cleanser...it feels greasy...it doesn&#x27;t have that clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I have been getting so many compliments on my skin the last few weeks. I love this product. It makes my skin feel amazing and look amazing.</li>
    <li> I am a retired person with aging skin.  I just started using this product.  It was on a list of products from my dermatologist that I can use on my skin that wouldn&#x27;t cause dermatitis.  The first time I used it, my skin felt very dry and taut, but after that it left my skin feeling clean and soft with no allergic reaction.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I do have fine lines on my face.  I feel this product softened these lines.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products and this one is very nice to use.  I do not use soap on my face, so this gives me the cleansing I like.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t greasy and smells nice. I can&#x27;t use foaming cleansers (too drying) and this is great. The fact that it is offered in a two pack is really nice because then I have one for the shower and one for the vanity. Score!</li>
