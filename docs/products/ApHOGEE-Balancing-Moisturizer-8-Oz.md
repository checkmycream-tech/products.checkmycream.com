    <li> I got the Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer to use after the Aphogee 2 step treatment, and I got amazing results. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day as my conditioner and it&#x27;s really done wonders for my hair. My hair is normally very wavy and frizzy unless I straighten or load it with products that help it curl if I want to wear it curly. This stuff took the frizz right out of my hair. And made my curl so much nicer. I&#x27;ll be buying more of this very soon!</li>
    <li> I like the feel of my hair after using this product. It is soft and not oily. The moisturizer does&#x27;nt have a heavy feel on your hair.</li>
    <li> The balancing moisture has an awesome smell to it. I brought this product along with the Pro Leave in Conditioner, Shampoo, Two Minute ReConst. Conditioner, and Green/Tea Hair Spray. This product was recommended for ladies who have colored hair (highlighted, bleached, died). I am an African American lady with natural hair (meaning no perm/relaxer) with honey blonde highlights; and since these highlights my hair has seen to become more dry then usual. I use this product immediately after Shampoo, and Deep conditioning the hair just to make sure it brings back the life and the moisture in my hair from the color and etc. I highly suggest this product along with the whole line. Great Investment if you are really interested in taking care of your hair. If you dont believe me Youtube the line, and ladies will provide real life testimonies of hair growth &amp; thickness from using the APHOGEE product line.</li>
    <li> Good product it does what it says. Use after Aphogee step 2 treatment  and you have better results.</li>
    <li> The scent is not bad but really strong. Gave me a slight headache. It does work well after the protein treatment but I wouldn&#x27;t say it totally balanced and moisturized. My hair still felt a little dry but that is usual for me after a protein treatment.</li>
    <li> great product ,and I love the moisture and feel after using the product, yes I would buy it again and would also recommend it to others in need of moisture for their hair.</li>
    <li> WORKS REALLY WELL KEEPING HAIR MOISTURIZE VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Make sure you get the other product too, they&#x27;re both great together! The shipping was fast and the product is great. Like I said before, make sure you read the instructions before using!</li>
    <li> this did not moisturize my hair at all. its even worst than a conditioner? :/ when i washed it out it felt dry! my hair didnt feel moisturized at alll :( this speaking from a chinese asian hair type.</li>
    <li> Only used once.  This did not work out for my hair.  My hair did  seem shinier, but not soft or manageable after first use.  Plan to try leave in conditioner, instead.</li>
    <li> Transitioning to Natural.  Love my naturally curly hair it leaves it so soft it&#x27;s amazing what this products does.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once and I would like to comment on it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great because I don&#x27;t have to moisturizer my hair every day after this.&lt;br /&gt;I had dry, brittle hair from the cold winter weather and this moisturizer got me surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It was very moisturizing and ill continue t use it for my weekly, or biweekly hair wash sessions.</li>
    <li> This product is great for giving your hair protein and moisturizes your hair at the same time. Whoever made this product thank you.</li>
    <li> I usually use nexxus humectress after a protein treatment because it leaves my hair butter soft but I decided to pick this up because this bottle was way bigger than nexxus for only a dollar more and I was using aphogee two step treatment and I keep hearing you should use both products together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons - I don&#x27;t like the smell it smells like after shave but for women and im not sensitive to smells at all but I didn&#x27;t like this&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t go on smooth like I like my condishes to do&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -  I&#x27;m sure what I really liked about it, I guess it made my hair a little less hard after a protein treatment&lt;br /&gt;oh its thick, I don&#x27;t like runny watery condish&lt;br /&gt;it was just okay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------would not buy again</li>
    <li> My hair is healthy, but I needed a moisturizing conditioner and purchased the Aphogee balancing moisturizer.  I wanted to see how it would treat on my hair. I followed the instructions for the time to leave it in and rinsed. I had a time combing through. I followed with the leave in moisturizing conditioner and it softened my hair. After that first experience, I spray on the leave in before combing out and it is soft and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> This product work good but my type of hair needs alot if moisturizing so after using this product I also used a great moisturizing lotion..my hair felt wondering after using this product with a little use of extra moisturizing lotion</li>
    <li> very good product love it does what it says i will be telling friend and family about this so they can try it thank you</li>
    <li> I have ethnic hair so therefore mineral oil is not good for my hair.  It&#x27;s a good thing I read the ingredients before use.  I love the leave in conditioner.</li>
