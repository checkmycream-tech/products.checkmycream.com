      <li>Even pedicures weren&#x27;t making my heels look any better.</li>
      <li>LOVE this.</li>
      <li>Very swift delivery and product works great</li>
      <li>This is the product that they use in the shop, I am 100% sure.</li>
      <li>but you really need a good pumice stone</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>makes my feet smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is what nail salons use when giving pedicures.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Ask seller for date of product, product over three years old is not as effective (and ages until you use it all).</li>
      <li>But as long as you use the product as it&#x27;s intended, you&#x27;ll be in good shape.</li>
      <li>Fast &amp; easy.</li>
      <li>So good  that I was worried my whole sole would be scrubbed off.</li>
      <li>Worth the price vs doing this in salon.  </li>
      <li>in the salon or spa, under conditions designed to prevent accidental staining of home fabrics, by a professional who can see irritations and cuts to the skin and determine advisability, after the appropriate soaking time....</li>
      <li>If you put it on your feet and let is sit you can scrub callouses right off.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a great product, no similar product I have tried works as well, in recent years the problem has become one of assuring it is fresh.</li>
      <li>SO gross but SO satisfying and fun.</li>
      <li>And a little goes a really long way which is great, too!</li>
      <li>I do exactly what the directions say on the bottle which is to soak my feet apply the gel for 5 min and wipe it off and then file my feet afterwords.</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>This product really works !</li>
      <li>and this is pretty much what they do...</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, as described</li>
      <li>I had a really had callus under my feet</li>
      <li>You really can save $$$ on pedicures.  </li>
      <li>Caution wipe your feet before getting in shower product is very slippery on feet.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery recomend</li>
      <li>The chemicals (i think it&#x27;s uric acid?) is pretty darn strong though, so if it drips onto your skin anywhere other than the soles of your feet, wash it off immediately.</li>
      <li>, the first time buyer will probably not know it is not working well because it is old.</li>
      <li>a little more soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;this product softens thick dry skin so that it peels off with a towel and leaves a smoother result more effectively than simply sanding with callus removing tools, additional scrubbing with a callus removing tool can finish...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to return product that was too yellow and did not smell right</li>
      <li>and it is completely gone.  </li>
      <li>Professional results.</li>
      <li>and my feet are soft.  </li>
      <li>A word of caution to anyone who has never used callus remover before: do NOT let this product get on any of the soft skin on your feet, it BURNS.</li>
      <li>Can be applied any wear on the bottom of your feet but if you get it on the top of your feet you will definitely feel it after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>A word of caution- if it gets on your hands, or other living sin, it has potential to do damage so remove it quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the large size of the bottle (usually callus remover comes in much smaller bottles that don&#x27;t last long).</li>
      <li>(the manufacturer never responded to email), they finally returned a call, explaining it was old, they assisted in information that lead to the exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Left my feet feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I ask sellers to check for product less than 2 years old and make it clear when I purchase that I will expect the seller to pay to return ship old</li>
      <li>This took off just the right amount, with so little effort, that I am actually looking forward to doing it again!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Amazing product. I have had Frodo feet since my pregnancy last summer. I have tried EVERYTHING. Nothing worked. Even pedicures weren&#x27;t making my heels look any better. My heels had a thick callous on them, they had deep cracks that never healed. This stuff is amazing. A year later, I can finally wear sandals again without embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is of what came off one foot with 10 minutes of scrubbing. Gnarly.</li>
    <li> I use this with a pumice stone in the shower and it keeps the calluses at a minimum.</li>
    <li> It really works!  You really can save $$$ on pedicures.  I think i do s better job myself, with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I had a really had callus under my feet I used the ProLinc twice and it is completely gone.  I will buy another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> If you have rough feet this cannot be beat. Be careful not to leave it on too long as it can burn.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery recomend</li>
    <li> Works perfect , just use as directed. Same product they use at the nail spa.</li>
    <li> dont get it, it does not work like the stuff they use at your mani &amp; pedi spa.</li>
    <li> makes my feet smooth.  Caution wipe your feet before getting in shower product is very slippery on feet.</li>
    <li> Yes works wonderful. Fast &amp; easy. Left my feet feeling soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to get rid of callouses.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Works really well!</li>
    <li> Hard to use, but works if you have the patience to use it.</li>
    <li> Worth the price vs doing this in salon.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love it. It really does work to soften and lift the dead skin off of my feet. SO gross but SO satisfying and fun. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase! A word of caution- if it gets on your hands, or other living sin, it has potential to do damage so remove it quickly. But as long as you use the product as it&#x27;s intended, you&#x27;ll be in good shape. LOVE this. OH! And a little goes a really long way which is great, too!</li>
    <li> This is the product that they use in the shop, I am 100% sure. This is the  BEST foot product that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Very swift delivery and product works great....happy!</li>
    <li> It is a product that is used in the salons...does an excellent jobof remover</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BOMB.  If you put it on your feet and let is sit you can scrub callouses right off.  I wish I had discovered this years ago as I have terrible callouses.  I use it about once a week and my feet are soft.  I could probably use it twice a week.  Be careful though and don&#x27;t get it anywhere other than callouses.  I love this.  Have already bought it twice.  Bought the bigger one this time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love the large size of the bottle (usually callus remover comes in much smaller bottles that don&#x27;t last long). Left the product on my feet for several minutes and then used a pedicure rasp (this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084JQFIK/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) to scrape all of the dead skin off. I was amazed at how much dead skin this product was able to remove. A word of caution to anyone who has never used callus remover before: do NOT let this product get on any of the soft skin on your feet, it BURNS. Can be applied any wear on the bottom of your feet but if you get it on the top of your feet you will definitely feel it after a few minutes. If it gets on your skin during application just wipe it off ASAP and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some time and have re-ordered - great product, works like magic.</li>
    <li> This product really works ! I&#x27;m so amazed but you really need a good pumice stone it makes it easier to remove the dead skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product but probably best used professionally. It can stain fabrics and will burn if used on irritated skin, I suspect it would be difficult to use at home.&lt;br /&gt;Used in the salon or spa, under conditions designed to prevent accidental staining of home fabrics, by a professional who can see irritations and cuts to the skin and determine advisability, after the appropriate soaking time....&lt;br /&gt;this product softens thick dry skin so that it peels off with a towel and leaves a smoother result more effectively than simply sanding with callus removing tools, additional scrubbing with a callus removing tool can finish... sometimes a second treatment... or a little more soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential down side...&lt;br /&gt;Ask seller for date of product, product over three years old is not as effective (and ages until you use it all). I&#x27;ve had to return product that was too yellow and did not smell right, the first time buyer will probably not know it is not working well because it is old. I ask sellers to check for product less than 2 years old and make it clear when I purchase that I will expect the seller to pay to return ship old product.&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer is nearly impossible to contact to discuss a bottle of \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product (the manufacturer never responded to email), they finally returned a call, explaining it was old, they assisted in information that lead to the exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product, no similar product I have tried works as well, in recent years the problem has become one of assuring it is fresh.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well and my pedicurist uses it and said it was great!</li>
    <li> This is the same as what they use in nail salons. Works well at removing dead skin from feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is what nail salons use when giving pedicures. Leave it on for 3-5 minutes, then scrub with a pumice stone or one of those metal pedicure rasp things. My feet look like I&#x27;ve been to a nail salon. It doesn&#x27;t work without the scrubbing though. Lasts about 2 weeks. The chemicals (i think it&#x27;s uric acid?) is pretty darn strong though, so if it drips onto your skin anywhere other than the soles of your feet, wash it off immediately. Tiny drop dripped on my calf once and I got a slight burn before I noticed. Also wash hands immediately after applying.</li>
    <li> I have extremely cracked heels and the bottoms of my feet are very dry and rough. I do exactly what the directions say on the bottle which is to soak my feet apply the gel for 5 min and wipe it off and then file my feet afterwords. I&#x27;ve had expensive professional pedicures before and this is pretty much what they do...my feet feel and look wonderful afterwards.</li>
    <li> Works great on your feet without irritation a must have product !</li>
    <li> So good  that I was worried my whole sole would be scrubbed off. This took off just the right amount, with so little effort, that I am actually looking forward to doing it again!!! Professional results.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, as described</li>
