      <li>no problems so far!</li>

      <li>The price is right, but the comb is too small, snags the hair, and is just not what I am used to.</li>

<li> Otherwise they work fine for at home hair cutting.</li>
<li> Just as I expected.</li>
<li> The combs are cut so that the teeth are sharp.</li>
<li> Yes, they are inexpensive, but even still, they are totally not worth it.</li>
<li> There is little to no flexibility so purchase a heavy duty one if you carry it with you all of the time.</li>
<li> This set of 12 narrow ruled combs hit the spot.</li>
<li> These combs aren&#x27;t bad bud</li>
<li> When I comb my client&#x27;s hair it painfully scratches their scalp!</li>
<li> The combs you buy at Target are flimsy plastic crap!</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t care for these combs. I am a professional Hairdresser (20 years) and admittedly I am spoiled by better combs. The price is right, but the comb is too small, snags the hair, and is just not what I am used to. For at home use I am sure they work just fine, but not for me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not a pro level comb</li>
    <li> same combs as the cleopatra #20. cheaper price .not much else to say&lt;br /&gt;i am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt; i am also a Barber so always on lookout for inexpensive,well made products to use in my trade.</li>
    <li> Donate these to the blessing bags for the homeless in our area.  Love this item</li>
    <li> great quality and you get 12!!!!</li>
    <li> They are OK and do the job of combing hair. But as barber I will not use them professionally. Cheap material.</li>
    <li> If you ever stole a legit comb from a hair salon, then you know how awesome they can be. The combs you buy at Target are flimsy plastic crap! These ones are awesome. And yes - they are a little more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; than the Target combs, but I like that.</li>
    <li> Great price for alot of combs no problems so far!</li>
    <li> Great cutting combs! I use them on men for great scissor over comb fades! Plus, you will never run out with the 1 dozen packaging!</li>
    <li> very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> When I first ordered these, I made the mistake of thinking these were one comb for the price given and I had to redo my order when I realized my mistake. These combs are just what I need. I live out in the country in a small town and finding these type of combs isn&#x27;t easy for me. You can easily get the larger type combs but these tend to me too large if you are older and have fine hair. This set of 12 narrow ruled combs hit the spot. They are slightly smaller on the fine teeth end that on the larger teeth en, but that&#x27;s no problem for me. I tried one out as soon as I got these and it was just what I wanted. I didn&#x27;t find them top be to shape on the ends at all and they gave me a much better combing than the larger combs I had been getting locally. A good buy!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great value and good customer service.  Just as I expected.</li>
    <li> These combs aren&#x27;t bad bud they are fairly rigid. Otherwise they work fine for at home hair cutting.</li>
    <li> nice one, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner.  What I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Basic at a great price</li>
    <li> very pleased, with these combs have been lookin for them for awhile. so happy i found them,will purchase more when ready for them</li>
    <li> Great quality combs for a very good price! The combs were shipped out right after ordering them and I had them in 3 days. Great product for anyone in the hair business or for personal use.</li>
    <li> Really what I was looking for...great comb..just couldn;t get out to shop for these-*thus this nice quality comb came in-thanks.</li>
    <li> These combs are strong and sturdy, so strong that they&#x27;ll scratch your scalp if you comb too hard and fast! They definitely work well. I use them to help style my 360 wave hairstyle.</li>
    <li> Great for family haircuts!</li>
    <li> I keep a comb in my gym bag, in my desk, in my bathroom, at my desk, and want a couple in case I lose or break one. These combs are fine quality and were a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The comb is made of cheap plastic. The slightest bend causes them to break. There is little to no flexibility so purchase a heavy duty one if you carry it with you all of the time. This is definitely a stay at home bathroom comb.</li>
    <li> The combs are cut so that the teeth are sharp. When I comb my client&#x27;s hair it painfully scratches their scalp! Yes, they are inexpensive, but even still, they are totally not worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought these were flimsy on receipt, but have used one for a few weeks now and can report that it is good and comfortable comb.  Some cheap combs can feel like they scratch your head - generally made out of cheap plastic.  Rubberized combs, more like these, are more comfortable.  I certainly got more combs for the price that I had expected!</li>
