<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great, but the brush comes out of the handle.... so you have to mess about trying to get it back in there- while it sticks to everything. lol</li>
    <li> really works well - I love the brush on glue - much easier to apply</li>
    <li> it holds every thing in place and its really strong .. dries very fast so works quickly .. the best i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> The product was old and too thick to be useable.  I would return it but that would cost more than it cost to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Easiest application...longest hold...</li>
    <li> I have been doing my nails for over 9 years now, and have tired many different brands of nail glue, and this one takes the cake.</li>
    <li> My nails tend to split in the middle of my nail bed, so one coat of this helps protect my nail from further damage as it continues to grow out. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  I had a cracked toe nail, applied this to it every few days and it kept the crack from getting larger.  It also allowed the cracked nail to grow out and now it&#x27;s back to being a normal nail :)</li>
    <li> This glue is the max.  Makes everything else pale.  I cannot understand why Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying it.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> I too have been looking for this glue since Sally&#x27;s discontinued it.....it&#x27;s the best.  I still don&#x27;t understand why Sally&#x27;s quit carrying it.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> and I&#x27;ve used them all.  But, if you apply it on top of nail polish, it will be difficult to remove the polish -- it adheres that well.</li>
    <li> Quick &amp; easy to use, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> gel turns hard which greats an issue for the brush and the bottle which the gel is in</li>
    <li> It ;is so nice to be able to buy it in a larger bottle.  The other brands hold so little.  Brush does get gooey before i use it all.</li>
    <li> This is the best Nail Glue I have ever found that actually works. I tend to get split nails and this protects the nail till it can grow out again. I have a friend (101 years old) that had the same problem so I bought her a bottle when I needed to get one for myself. Try it, you will like it. - Suzanne</li>
    <li> Did not seal my broken nail</li>
    <li> This is the best brush on nail glue.  I do my own nails and this is the best.  They used to sell it at Sally&#x27;s, but unfortunely I was told they discontinued it.  Luckily I found it here.</li>
    <li> I got this almost-instant drying glue all over myself and the bottle. My skin was burning from the glue and then when I went back to open it, a second time, the lid/ brush were completely and utterly cemented to the bottle. Its not completely useless and I havent even gotten to use it a single time.</li>
    <li> This product is so effective. You have a split in your nail? This will hold it! I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Im not sure if there is a paticular type of fake nails to use but this did not do well with adhering the nail and glue. I had a nail break off about an hour after I glued them on. Which is crazy because the glue really does work I accidentally got some between my pink and ring finger and it glued them together. It took forever to seperate my fingers and get the glue off. So im going to use this to glue charms and beads on the nail I&#x27;m posituve that it will work for that.</li>
    <li> got to use it only once. the cap seems to be permanently attached to the bottle now.&lt;br /&gt;guess it&#x27;s an amazing nail adhesive, then.</li>
    <li> This glue really works. However a few of the reviews I had read before I purchased says the cap gets stuck and would not open. This is really true. I used once and the cap would not open for months. Two weeks ago I ran really hot water over the cap and tried a few times and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;If you are having the same issue I&#x27;m having, maybe you could try that solution.</li>
    <li> The Product was received promptly and  in great condition.  It was everything it was advertised&lt;br /&gt;to be and I am very happy with both the quality of the product as well as the excellent&lt;br /&gt;service I received.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping was great! I don&#x27;t use this glue for press on nails it doesn&#x27;t seem to last but works great for small nail accents like gems and such.</li>
    <li> Very good but really smells</li>
    <li> received this item and tried to use it and it does not do what it says. ....nothing stays on my nail and doesn&#x27;t help fix broken nails. ..now I&#x27;m out money. ...I&#x27;m very angry dissatisfied customer</li>
    <li> Good glue but the top/brush handle got glued to the bottle, came apart when I tried to rescue.  So, I have 90% of the bottle really not usable.  I will take some fault for &amp;#34;operator error&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Very very unsatisfied. I have put glue on, held the nail down, and the minute I do something semi physical, my nails pop off. It&#x27;s terrible. I was surprised with the great reviews that I would be satisfied, but I am thoroughly disappointed...</li>
    <li> MY WIFE&#x27;S THIRD ORDER---GREAT GLUE, AND IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> This glue is great got nail tips and 3d nail art. Once the nail tip or nail art is on it will only come of when you take it off.</li>
    <li> I have gel nails that, after a while, sometimes fall off....at the most inconvenient times! I love this product.  Easy to use and the fallen-off nail adheres immediately.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> This glue works well but they need to redesign the packaging.  After a few uses the top sticks to the bottle.  I read a review before I purchased that said to use baby oil around the rim of the bottle to keep the cap from sticking.  This worked for a few uses then the cap stuck to the bottle so hard that when I was able to get the cap off of the bottle, the brush separated from the cap.  Looks like I need to find a good nail glue with better packaging, until the makers of this glue redesign their packaging.</li>
    <li> Have tried all of the rest and they pale in comparison.  Lately BONDINI is hard to find in many of the stores. So I was delighted to find it on Amazon. You will feel secure using this for your nails.</li>
    <li> Best nail glue I have every used. I have short nails and put very long ones on, and they last me about a week. Although, the bottle seals shut about every time I use it and it&#x27;s so hard to get open.</li>
    <li> Works very well even with builky mail arty will buy agin I cant find any whee in stores but the price is so worth it once you try your hooked.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Fake nails came off too quickly.</li>
    <li> Strong glue! Make sure you work really fast since it dries out fast and dont get your fingers in it or they&#x27;ll stick. I used it to fix my broken nails with a piece of paper from a tea bag, it worked just perfect.</li>
    <li> Good nail glue, the problem is when you don&#x27;t clean the opening it is going in the trash there is no way you can open it. Mine broke when I tried opening it!</li>
    <li> good glue much stronger then sallys</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for a couple of years. I was using what I thought was the best brush-on glue...IBD. I got sick of the tiny, opaque bottles and running out quickly. I knew Sally Beauty Supply used to carry Big Bondini and I&#x27;d heard good things, so I came here and ordered it. I am SO glad I did! The bottle is huge, so there&#x27;s lots of product, the brush is a good size and the glue holds for WEEKS! I do the acrylic dip system and my nails last longer than they ever did using any other glue. One thing to remember...always wipe off the top of the bottle with cotton pad dampened with acetone before screwing the brush back in or it&#x27;ll stick and you&#x27;ll never get it off. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this highly enough!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know abont this glue untill I visited Amazon.I would recomend it to any one. it is very good and I will let my friends know about it. Thanks Gladys.</li>
    <li> I felt it yellowed my nails and they still frayed on the ends with less, but occasional splitting.  I think I must just have the weakest nails going!</li>
    <li> This glue did not work well for me at all. It is not strong. My fake nails popped off easily with this glue</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE the glue -- I use it as a &#x27;topcoat&#x27; to keep my nails from breaking -- it&#x27;s the only thing I have found in 30 years that works -- but the neck of the bottle gets clogged after a short while and then the cap glues itself to the bottle; so I have never fully used a bottle -- solution -- break the neck off the bottle, put it in a small zip lock baggie (squeeze all the air out every time) and it lasts quite a while longer</li>
    <li> This glue is amazing however, if you are not careful and you put fake nails on and try to remove them you can kiss your real nail goodbye. I gave myself an acrylic manicure and use this glue for the fake nail underneath and when I was tired of my nails I did the soaking but was too lazy to completely remove the nail. So I pulled the nail off from the side where it was loose and I ripped my real nail off the skin. It hurt pretty bad. I don&#x27;t suggest it.</li>
    <li> This is not a brush on glue. It&#x27;s like superglue. Sucky adhesion and good luck trying to get it unclogged for a second use. I settled with IBD brush on nail Resin. I love it</li>
    <li> The glue works well holds for a longtime. I ordered both the glue and the nails at the same time but they were shipped separately and I was required to pay shipping on both items which I did not think was fair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my press on nails that I do! holds tight and the bush gets in all the places you need it to! So much better from the others I used in the past</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and was use to using this brush on glue and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in any of the beauty supply stores so went to the computer. Now I need some more so hope I can get it. Easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great pricing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this glue for silk wrap, I did it myself. Initially it lasted for abt a week. I am kind of hard on my nails. Cooking and cleaning with no gloves, it bwgan to chip. I just used it as a hardened on my natural nails which are already long, I like it better this way. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my nails breaking and cracking. I am still using the silk wrap as a nail repair and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see I love glitter polish&lt;br /&gt;The first is silk wrap&lt;br /&gt;The second is my natural nail glue used a hardener</li>
    <li> Tried many glues for nail tips and had problems with them staying.  This product works great with no problems at all.  Was recommended by a nail artist.</li>
    <li> Apparently this is a great glue. So good in fact that unfortunately the cap stayed glued on. Only used once and worked great. Except for the fact that I cant use again :-(</li>
    <li> I always seem to come back to Bondini. It just works so well, and I like being able to brush it on like polish. I have had issues with the bottle gluing itself shut, but pliers work well to reopen. Caution, though- you can break the neck of the bottle if you are too rough with your pliers. I recommend always opening it over and resting the bottle on a plastic sandwich/storage bag or other disposable surface, and I store the bottle in a plastic bag as well. It&#x27;s basically super glue, and accidents with super glue can be tragic, so just be careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. The stuff just really works well, is easy to control, and lasts a long time with proper care and storage.</li>
    <li> The viscosity on this stuff is SCARY thin. So it&#x27;s not so good for my use, except if a layer of glue is coming off--in that case the low viscosity helps it slide under the layer via capillary action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top sticks, so I have to use a small pair of pliers to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my Nail Care and Repair for Guitarists on YouTube. Acrylic powder and glue. Quick and easy. Holds up for about 7-10 days. It&#x27;s a 3-4 minute process. I use it all the time for my right hand (guitar finger picking). My preferred glue is LockTite brush on.</li>
    <li> Bottle leaks all over the place, hard to open . Very messy.</li>
    <li> Very sticky product.  Using it was annoying but yes it worked.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail glue I&#x27;ve ever found and hard to find in my area. Takes years to thicken it the bottle so it lasts much longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve foud.  Glad to be able to get it here.</li>
    <li> It holds up against polish changes and doesn&#x27;t need much filing, buffing is enough. Very satisfied with this product. If you need a nail glue give Big Bondini a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail glue despite all the reviews that said that the cap gets glued shut after one use. Admittedly, the cap and the interior of the neck of the bottle are flawed because the moment you put the brush back into the bottle, there is glue all over the outside. So, to remedy this, I put some baby oil gel on the outside of the bottle where the cap screws on and it does not stick at all. I&#x27;ve been back to use the glue multiple times and the oil prevents the cap from being glued shut. Also, I only close the bottle about 3/4 of the way as insurance that I can get it back open. Other than that, the glue did exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Bondini works better than any crazy glue product in keeping silks and acrylics adhered to my natural nail without cracking, fungus,and double edges.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped for fake nails but it worked okay for when I ripped a nail past the skin to keep it from ripping more. Also it smells funny....</li>
    <li> This nail glue is not for the faint of heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re ready for a relationship that endures (at least until you tire of the latest pretty little thing you&#x27;ve applied to your nails) while keeping your 007 nail art looking fresh and sexy as you repel down buildings or scale a train car in pursuit of a Russian assassin with an eyepatch, look no further than Bond(ini)... Big Bond(ini).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t let you down in a high speed car chase and you won&#x27;t have to worry about your rhinestone bows coming loose from your fingernails while you hold villains at gunpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easily, dries quickly, and a little goes a long way. Use a very small amount and add more only if necessary later. Take care when removing as this stuff is strong, and use a fine file to remove any remnants that don&#x27;t come away with acetone. Clean the mouth of the bottle after use and store upright.</li>
    <li> I love this glue!!!!!!!! It is sooooooo much easier to work with than the kind you have to squeeze out of a bottle (not messy)</li>
    <li> This glue just didn&#x27;t hold as well as I thought it would.  Also, the liquid form is a little tricky to manage--I&#x27;m finding a gel glue much easier to use and stronger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this glue for a long time, once in a while trying another brand. Always come back to Bondini! The brush is easy to use and the glue is consistently secure on the nail. Highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> did not bond well with the silk nails , would never purchase this item again, not as it was advertised.</li>
    <li> This glue is not strong, does not work well, and it stings the eyes when you are too close to your nails as you are polishing it.</li>
    <li> I change my design (a week or two).  The smell its a bit strong and will sting your eyes a bit if you are too close to the liquid. Ive read, many dealt with having the top getting stuck or hard to open after use. No problem for me as long as I keep the brush inside the opening and not spill/brush outside the plastic.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I used it to glue down a split nail and also used it in conjunction with silk wraps. Works really well and dries quite fast.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to know I could purchase online.  I previously bought the product at Sally&#x27;s but they no longer carry this product.  Love the product as I use it for my acrylic nails.  Would recommend the product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Okay. I purchased this without reading the reviews. I wasnt sure what to expect to be 100% honest. I bought it for the purpose of keeping my nails hard, not for fake nails. I did find that nail glue was best for that. This being said, as soon as I opened it and went to put it on my nail, all sorts of glue from inside the lid dripped on my fingers. I got 4 fingers stuck together. I&#x27;ve soaked my fingers in acetone and still can&#x27;t get it all off. However, I finally got my fingers unstuck! If you&#x27;re looking for super strength, this is it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was that nails I used to start with but they didn&#x27;t seem to stick right away.</li>
    <li> The glue does not keep fingernails on for more than 12 hours.  I have tried to use this glue multiple times thinking I was using the wrong type of nails or putting them on wrong. I bought a second bottle thinking that the first was maybe &#x27;defective&#x27; because of the good reviews.  I even tried using the glue for other purposes when the nail purpose didn&#x27;t work and that was pointless.  Forget it, it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
    <li> Great stuff works well!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I used it with tea bag to repair a split fingernail, and two weeks later the repair is still holding up.</li>
    <li> i use it to glue rhinestones to my clientes nails and it stays on for even more then 2 weeks really good!</li>
    <li> The is the best finger nail glue that I have ever used and it is larger that most glue. I buy it on a Regular basic.</li>
    <li> The lid gets glued shut after only a few uses, despite careful and consistent cleaning of threads.  My manicurist (international prize-winner and instructor, so she knows what she&#x27;s doing) has used it and hates this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got rid of mine years ago and am using the 1.5&amp;#34; bottles with the red caps from Dollar Tree (not the tubes).  I&#x27;ve used one of them for 4 yrs now, and there has been no problem with lid getting stuck closed.  The threads get &amp;#34;crusty,&amp;#34; but you just flick off the excess.  The hole has never clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have brushes (you just dab on a drop, which spreads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails split longitudinally, so I use silk (or a teabag paper) to reinforce them.  Dab of this glue on nail, spread around a little with the &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; of the bottle, if needed.  Put on the silk/teabag, extending edge of product beyond edge of nail.  Let glue soak in.  Depending on how much glue you ended up with this, might take 5-6 minutes.  (You want quick or you want protection?)  If any area of the silk is not wet, add another drop.  When hardened, file off any silk extending over edge of nail. If needed, put on another drop of glue.  I also put a little on the edge (the part you file) of the nail.  It dribbles all along where the nail meets the nail bed (to no ill effect on my skin or nail bed), which is added protection for right at the split site.&lt;br /&gt;mb</li>
    <li> Literally only worked for one use before the cap crusted and glued shut.  I even cleaned it with acetone, but it still didn&#x27;t budge after sealing.  It is a convenient product, but honestly get a gel because those at least last longer than one application.</li>
    <li> The glue kept the stones on, but very hard to get off your hands or anything else if it accidentally gets on it.  Last time I closed it, I couldn&#x27;t get it back open!</li>
    <li> Love this bond glue. This is a Quality product that bonds quickly. Please make sure after each use wipe the outside of the rim with acetone before you screw on the brush or you will not be able to reopen.</li>
    <li> Great product and they shipped it fast.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  I thought this nail glue was going to be very good, but its sucks. Honestly please skip it. I put it on the fake nails and on my real nails. The nails can still be pulled off. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Has a strong hold...pretty much like super glue. I saw all of the reviews and decided to try it. I wasn&#x27;t dissappointed one bit. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I use this to glue on charms for my nail art. I love the convenience of the brush. Just be sure to clean the top of the bottle with acetone before you put away. It will guarantee that it won&#x27;t get glued shut. And the staying power is incredible. My charms do not fall off!</li>
    <li> I purchaed quite a few packages of Kiss Featherlight nails, but found that the glue they ship with was completely dried out, so that is what lead me to this product. I love it. It holds on the nails very, very well. My hands are continually wet (i.e., dishes, showers, cleaning, cooking, etc.), and the nails hold just fine. I will surely purchase more when I start running low. I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i think this stuff works pretty good strong smell but great for fixing tear in nail or small cut or even adding some nail art.. i would buy again but i have a feeling this bottle will last quite some time.</li>
    <li> The lid ALWAYS get sealed to the bottle no matter how efficiently I wipe it off. Maybe they need to put it in a tube.</li>
    <li> Best nail glue ever! This nail glue will last FOREVER on your nails but the instant you want to take it off, its comes right off!</li>
    <li> Absolute worst design ever! I was extra careful not to get glue everywhere and it still got on half my fingers! How can this company sell nail glue in a bottle that doesn&#x27;t contain it properly?  DON&#x27;T BUY IT unless you want to spend a few hours filing your skin away.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the BEST nail glue i have ever used.  My nails are natural and every time I try to grow them out, I am plagued with small cracks or tears that threaten to ruin the look of beautifully manicured natural nails.  No, I just brush a small amount of Bondini plus across the problem area, and file over it lightly.  Then I apply my nail polish normally and wait for the nail to grow out.  I will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> MISC Big Bondini Plus Brush --On Glue works great.  Easy to apply and my false nails stay on for two weeks.  great stuff,.</li>
    <li> Love the Bondini nail glue in the little plastic dropper bottle and liked the idea of the convenience of a brush, but this glass bottle is not the way to go, as the neck of the bottle came off with the cap the first time I opened this product.  Back to the plastic dropper bottle for me!</li>
    <li> Gluten is unbelievable. Accidentally spilled some on my fingers. Had to file it off and use some lotion. This is my go to glue now for projects.</li>
    <li> Love it and seems to bond better than the drug store brands of super glue.</li>
    <li> works better than any other nail glue...AMAZING</li>
    <li> Stick nails more longer. Wipe the rim of the opening on the bottle after use or the top eill stick to the bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this glue to repair broken nails and attach rhinestones. Be careful when using it though! The first time I opened it and went to use it there was glue trapped in the top of the lid that I didn&#x27;t notice and it poured all over my hands when I went to use it! But acetone definitely helped get it off my hands in a timely manor.</li>
    <li> This glue works like a charm. I use this for adding gems or charms to my nail art. Works perfectly! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am not disappointed in the glue itself because it is fabulous.  However, I only got to use it once and now the lid is sealed to the bottle and I can&#x27;t open it.  I have even tried using a pair of pliers and still no luck.  So I paid all that money and only have used it once!</li>
    <li> Almost 2 years since I opened it and still works very well</li>
    <li> This is the 1st nail glue I have found that keeps my faux nails glued on for over a week! Would buy again</li>
    <li> Works amazing on fiberglass I love it. Last along time, FOR THE PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TOP BEING GLUED TO THE BOTTLE, JUST REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT AND USE IT BEFORE PUTTING THE TOP ON WHEN YOU ARE DONE WIPE THE TOP WITH ACETONE TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING STUCK TO THE BOTTLE. DO THIS AFTER EVERY USE BEFORE STORING IT.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. It bonds really well and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry. The smell is okay, it&#x27;s definitely not pleasant but not too awful. Be careful using this I spilled a drop on my pajama pants, I think they were velour and it burned a hole and started smoking. XD I haven&#x27;t used other brands so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it works wonderful so I don&#x27;t see myself trying other glues!</li>
    <li> Read some really great comments on this product so I bought it.  I&#x27;d say it works fair to midlin- at the very best.  I&#x27;ve actually found that standard Gorilla Glue works well and still only lasts about 7 days or so - which is similar to the glue that comes in the nail pkgs.</li>
    <li> Becareful it gets sticky! But it does work really well. i use it after a manicure to keep the nail polish lasting longer. i hand wash most of my clothes that are delicate and washing dishes all the time and i must say the Brush on Glue keeps the nail color from peeling off too soon. will buy again.</li>
    <li> This glue is super easy to use and it works!just be careful not to get any on the rim so the top won&#x27;t get glued on!</li>
    <li> Excellent glue, stays easy to open and does a great job. Less smell than most of the other ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> Because I had order this Dec. 28, 2012 and it is unuseable.  The brush won&#x27;t come out of the bottle.  It must have been old when it was sent.. It usually last longer that this one. I need to order another one. Bondini is usally the best brush-on glue there is very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice strong glue and dries nicely thank you.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that i founf this on this site. When the store i purchase my products quit selling it, i tried other products. They didnt work. I love bondini nail glue.</li>
    <li> Kind if a waste of a purchase, to be honest. Regular CA/c(k)razy glue. If you have regular Krazy Glue, just use that. Otherwise, this product is too thin to be truly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, find that using it for my model aircraft works well where thin CA is appropriate. The brush is really useful.</li>
    <li> I found that this glue does not last or stick well, cheaper brands work better, I was hopeful but will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like this glue</li>
    <li> I so so so love this glue right here its my second purchase and i stand by this glue i use it to glue my nail tips and rhinestones it holds great</li>
    <li> Used on two torn nails and did not good at all so Ill start using it on other things.</li>
    <li> Best glue in the business; have used it for years and have found no other product that is as good.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUT YOU DO NOT NOW HOW GREAT IT IS UNTIL YOU BUY UT AND SEE LIKE I DID AND GLUED THE BOTTLE CLOSED LIKR I DID&lt;br /&gt;GREAT ITEM  ATUALY TO GOOD I SOMEHOW GLUEDS THE AP TO THE BOTTLE I WILL BUY IT AGAIN AND TRY NOT TO GLUE THE LID TOGETHER</li>
    <li> Tried a lot of different types of \\&quot;super glue\\&quot; since I use it in hobby stuff as well as gluing splits, small cuts, or hangnails on my fingers when they become dry and crack during winter or when using strong soaps or solvents, or during winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY one on which the top stays free enough of residue that it is always pretty easy to open, and it lasts far longer without thickening up like other super glues. My take, from years of using and doing development work with very similar plastics, is that there is far more glue, and far less acrylic, than all the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bottle in the medicine cabinet, another on my workbench, and one in my traveling case for trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if the top gets crusted with too much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; to easily open and fully close, gently but firmly clamp the \\&quot;nut cracker\\&quot; teeth of a small pliers around the top and gently twist back and forth to crack the hardened stuff off, knocking it onto a paper towel and not back into the bottle. Use an opened-up paper clip or pin (not pen, as in writing pen) to break the crusted stuff out of the plastic screw-on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to grip the top with the pliers too tightly, as you will break the glass, with disastrous results. Also be very careful to NOT glue your fingers during this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not let the bottle lay on its side, but stand it upright, to keep crusted stuff from forming too quickly.</li>
    <li> nessessary item.well this goes with the territory of nails . handy for alot other things for scrapbooking jewlry. but i like it to fix a torn nail.</li>
    <li> And if you compare ounces to ounces (or grams to grams), then this really is a better price, as well.</li>
    <li> Works great to bond broken natural nails so they can grow out on their own.</li>
    <li> Professional salon&#x27;s use Big Bondini Brush-On Nail Glue because it the best glue you can buy. I have tried all kinds of other brands of nail glue when my retailer stopped selling the Big Bondini Brush-On Nail Glue. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other nail glues since you are better off just buy super glue and use a brush to put the glue on to eliminate the &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34; so you have a best bond to gule the tips to the fingernails.</li>
    <li> I use this to repair plastic parts as well as for applying nail tips.  For tips, brush glue on nail, attach tip, then gently brush edge of tip to seal the tip onto the nail.  This guarantees no pop-offs.  Also, I did what other reviewers suggested and applied some olive oil to the bottle top and the inner area of the brush top so the glue doesn&#x27;t permanently seal the glass bottle to the plastic.  I also keep my botte in the cabinet unscrewed but labeled with a sharpie &amp;#34;top open&amp;#34; on the top white area of the brush holder (use a thin sharpie), otherwise I&#x27;d forget and would probably spill it not realizing the bottle was unscrewed.  Since crazy glue always seems to be a 1 time use since it seals itself closed upon opening, this brush on glue is a tremendous value for the price.  The product is also equivalent to crazy glue or maybe slightly less cement-sealed-like.</li>
    <li> This glue is powerful! It is by far the strongest nail glue I have found and I LOVE that it goes on like polish rather than like superglue. Do be weary of the way it is stored( always upright) and keep the top of the bottle clean. I failed to follow those instructions and couldn&#x27;t get the lid off for weeks. Just spread a little acetone around the edges with a q-tip after every use and you will love your experience with this glue!</li>
    <li> I use this with fiberglass wrap to strengthen my nails for guitar playing. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and it dries fast, hard and clear. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> this glue dries VERY fast! i use it to attach 3D nail pieces because top coat takes forever to dry &amp; for the bigger jewels its harder to wait to let dry. with this there&#x27;s no worrying if it&#x27;ll fall off, saves me time &amp; money because i don&#x27;t have to apply several coats!</li>
    <li> Great Purchase, Thank You!</li>
    <li> I used this and it worked good.  The brush was better than others I have used.  I only got to use this once.  When I tried to use it the next time I couldn&#x27;t get it open so I had my husband try and when he turned it the whole top broke off.  The glass broke at the neck of the bottle.  Had to throw it away.  It was a disappointment because it was expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this nail glue for years and I just love it.  It was especially good on acrylics.</li>
    <li> I applied this to full cover nails about 3 days ago and the nails are still holding strong...very pleased and it came with fast shipping will order again good product</li>
    <li> Not only did this glue work great on my nails, without burning, it&#x27;s worked really well around the house. I used it to repair some broken figurines and the brush made it easy to apply just the right amount of glue. You have to be careful to keep the glue off the outer edge of the bottle, but that&#x27;s not hard to do if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
    <li> This is great nail glue or for other things too!!! I received glass acrylic dishes on ball was broken off lid so I used this nail glue not excepting it to work for glass but BAM in just sec. it was stuck on I was Amazed I love this glue!!  ^_^</li>
    <li> I used it once and it was ok, the second time I tried using it I guess the top &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to the bottom so the bottle wouldnt open. I kept forcing to open until the glass broke on my hand and splashed glue all over the place including my hands and arms which burned. So stay away from it because it burns skin!!!</li>
    <li> I accidentally spilled it and it dried at the top and made it impossible to take off the cap. I finally had to force it open and after a bit of work and nail polish remover, I cleaned out the dried up nail glue around the bottle top. The actual nail glue brush on was fairly good, just mind you don&#x27;t tip it over.</li>
    <li> Best nail glue around!</li>
    <li> I had gotten this product a long time ago from a beauty supply store that closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found it on Amazon, I had to order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that this brand comes in a glass bottle kinda like fingernail polish which outlasts plastic ones that the glue hardens and you can no longer get them open, so you end up only getting about 2 uses out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush makes it so much easier to work with rather than super glue tubes that you can&#x27;t control the output &amp; ended up gluing your fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely order again!</li>
    <li> best glue I have found so far</li>
    <li> Works ok, I used it and all my nails came off with ease right after so I put on  a LOT and held each nail for a min or 2 very tightly and it worked better.</li>
    <li> Did not work with my press on nails. Glue does not adhere to them. The glue that comes in little rubber bottles works great (5 Second Brush on Nail Glue)</li>
    <li> this really is a great bonding agent i used on artificial nails and the stayed intact for two to three weeks and the nails did not budge.</li>
    <li> The best nail glue that I have ever found. It holds when you have a nail that cracks or splits.</li>
    <li> I first ordered the smaller bottle and once I saw how amazing this glue was I had to order the bigger size! And this stuff really dries up rock hard so be cautious when you first use this, especially if you&#x27;re not used to putting on nail glue with a brush. I also wrote a review on the smaller bottle so you can check that out if you want additional info on this product and how much I love it. So I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed!  I needed glue that would not dry out over time.  This stays nice and fluid.  The glue is very strong and gets the job done well.</li>
    <li> the glue goes on easily enough and dries quickly but when dried turns into flaky white layers which looks awful under fake nails. best to jst use this product on tips and wraps i guess, altho it&#x27;s kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> I tried using this instead of my regular nail glue; the nails were coming off within the first day.  I ended up losing four nails before the next day.  The rest came off by the end of the week.  What exactly is the point of this stuff if it does not adhere artificial nails to natural nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible.  Heartily encourage you to buy something far better.</li>
    <li> Great glue but keep your fingers out of the way!  This is serious glue.  Rate four because it got on everything and the bottle neck broke and the glue spilled in my bathroom sink. However, if used on nails as I did works great and it WILL NOT wear off fast.</li>
    <li> This is great for me and easy for my clients thats in a rush, this is also great for press on nails if you want them to last a little longer.</li>
    <li> Nothing superb about this, really. It has the same nail hold as a lot of other (and cheaper) glues. The only thing I liked about this is the application brush. This really does get stuck and it&#x27;s a pain to try to open back up after every use. Maybe baby oil would help prevent the sticking but I would still stick to a cheaper brand of nail glue overall.</li>
    <li> I used this for the press on your nails that I also ordered...it worked good but I did have some nails pop off a little more than with the glue that came with the nails. However, I did use it to glue a bow that broke off a decoration and it held great with little residue or showing where I glued it.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, exactly what I needed!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this glue based on all the great reviews it received.  Unfortunately I did not get the best results.  I used as directed to apply press ons and not even 24 hours later 2 came off,  I then proceeded to remove the rest with no trouble at all.</li>
    <li> This holds nails on very well and is the strongest nail glue I&#x27;ve ever used. The brush on method is a lot more convenient and easier than trying to squeeze glue out of those little clogged bottles. With that being said, my only complaint with this glue is that it becomes extremely difficult to open each fine I need to use it. So just be prepared for that.</li>
    <li> I have used many kinds of nail glue for nail tips and this has got to be the best I have ever used  Hopefully, it will remain liquid to the last drop unlike those small tubes that harden before the glue is gone.</li>
    <li> I broke a nail, way down, like where you can&#x27;t just tear it off.  I used this to hold it together until it could grow out enough to be cut off, and it worked great!  you have to reapply every few days, and be careful not to get the glue where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
    <li> Once opened and closed it stuck and couldn&#x27;t open...this a waste of money:-[</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t open the bottle :(</li>
    <li> It is ok.  I found the rim sticks to the applicator brush easily, even the coconut oil I put around it didn&#x27;t help a lot. As a glue, I found another nail glue that did work a little better with less issues. This worked OK in my book for things OTHER than nails (beads, inanimate objects etc), but not the best for finger nails.  I tried to repair a split in my nail, a crack that was painful, and this glue didn&#x27;t hold it up.  Another nail glue DID hold up though, and for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO at an $8.01 price for the 0.5 fl oz (the other one I used was $5.30 for 0.2 fl oz) &amp;#34;5 Second Brush On Nail Glue .2 fl oz (6 g)&amp;#34; was a BETTER &amp;#34;finger nail&amp;#34; glue than this glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;d recommend the 5 Second Brush On Nail Glue .2 fl oz (6 g) sold here on Amazon for use with your finger nails. The bottle brush didn&#x27;t get stuck as much as THIS bottle brush did (which is totally annoying and no matter how I treated the cap &amp; threaded glass, it would ALWAYS STICK!)  and the 5 Second Brush On Nail Glue just worked better for repairing finger nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this glue April 2014.  It has already turned gummy.  I used this glue exclusively and decided to buy online rather than from the local Beauty Supply stores.</li>
    <li> I must admit, this is the most powerful nail glue I have ever used.  Have tried many brands and none compare.  Yet, the rim of the glass bottle also experiences this potency.  One reviewer said to use a ootton ball with acetone polish remover on the rim, yet if you&#x27;ve just done your nails, do you really want to handle polish remover?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was careful in using it for perhaps a month and wiped the rim off with a wash cloth which helps somewhat.  However, I hadn&#x27;t used the glue in about a week and the bottle glued itsellf tightly shut.  I tried using hot water to loosen it to no avail.  I was annoyed, for at almost $10 a bottle, I expected more mileage.  Next, believing the hot water had helped a bit, I used a small pliers and attempted to unscrew the cap.  Huge mistake.  The cap stayed on tight, but came off along with the glass top of the bottle.  A large drop splashed on my leg and it felt like potent acid-- no exaggeration.  It completely removed the top layer of my skin. Theresulting  wound is at least the size of a nickel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so fortunate none of it splashed in my eyes or on my face.  Yes, I would probably buy it again (but will look into a smaller size), but learn from my mistake... If the top seals shut either throw it out or perhaps soak it in polish remover, Never try to force it open.</li>
    <li> I always keep a bottle of Bondini Brush on glue on my mani station.  I use it to repair any splitting and or braking natural nails along with ASP Fiberglass this method allows my broken nail to grow out the split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always try to be careful removing the applicator brush from the bottle to avoid getting any glue on the edges of the neck opening but regardless I always wipe the opening with a lint free pad soaked in acetone to remove any residue, this way I can always open the bottle without any problems.</li>
    <li> I use artificial nails ans silk wraps a lot and have done so for years.  I have not found a glue any better.  As with any clue, store it upright and make sure the cap and screw on the bottle are glue free.</li>
    <li> I do like the bigger size, it last much longer, and holds pretty good, . 5oz is a good size to get, it helps save on money. and if you take care of your nails, you wont have to buy any nail glue for a while.</li>
    <li> I have tried all sorts of different glues to get my nail tips to stay on and they always pop loose within a few days, this glue keeps lasting and lasting... I love it! And the brush on type is much easier to use and to control where it goes than the tube kind.. I would definitely recommend this product! (plus it was decently priced and shipped fairly quickly)</li>
    <li> Used this to glue my nail on this works great very impressed long lasting Will buy again it truly does bond .</li>
    <li> Lasts for a long time! Much better than the nail glue that comes in typical nail set packages!</li>
    <li> I didnt think this glue work well for nail tips and tge bottle also glued shut.</li>
    <li> have been doing my own nails for over 20 yrs and this is the best glue l have ever come across</li>
    <li> Loved this the first few days. Love the brush. For nail fixes with tea bags, etc. but the top,is stuck and I&#x27;m still working on getting it off cause I have a full bottle of glue :(</li>
    <li> Product liquid is descent, but the brush fell apart during first use. Bristles fell out of cap stick, ironically, wont stick back in cap holder. when I tried all the bristles separated rendering it useless for me.</li>
    <li> Big Bondini is great for use in artificial nails. I really like this product. It is the 2nd time I have purchased this product. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This glue holds amazingly well and it&#x27;s not thick a gooie like other glues. The brush makes it easy to apply and the bottle makes it easy to store.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My fake nails stayed on for two days before I removed them myself, with only one nail coming off. To be honest, I use this stuff as super glue for everything because it works so well.</li>
    <li> I use this for everything that needs to be glued.  Can be used for a broken nail to craft projects.  Keeps for a long time.  Doesn&#x27;t dry up after one or two uses.</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy again.A++++++++++</li>
    <li> Brush broke immediately, the glue turned to a thick glob. Will stick to the small bottles as they seem to not turn into a glob and I&#x27;m able to use every last bit.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all, nails came off 2 hours later..</li>
    <li> They must be paying people to write these reviews because there is no way you can use this glue after you open it and close it. The cap sticks to the bottle and you can&#x27;t get it open again. I am so pissed that I lost money on this. Try a different brand with a different container unless you want to throw money away.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It has a strong hold and you don&#x27;t need to use much. I very much recommend this to others.</li>
