      <li>I loved the way this product makes me look.</li>
      <li>so all in all I would say good product.</li>
      <li>I laughed when I opened this item.</li>
      <li>The design is good, but does not work.</li>
      <li>They loved it.</li>
      <li>I say try them, follow instructions, it takes practice, make yourself feel good.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to hold it in place.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t think they would be good for people who develop headaches</li>
      <li>I have turned my mom, and many friends on to them , and they all love the face lifting stickers too! !</li>

      <li>better just get a face lift !</li>
      <li>well am I glad I did!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This is the greatest thing since botox , i love this , make sure to order 2 because trust me you will love it</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t like a product more than this!  </li>
      <li>I love them!  </li>
      <li>Buy more hair!</li>
      <li>Once you have the tapes in place, thread the strings through each tape, and attach the strings on the top of your head according to how &amp;#34;young and refreshed&amp;#34; you want to look!  </li>
      <li>and I love them,!</li>
      <li>You have changed my life for the better in unimaginable ways!</li>
      <li>but I feel amazing.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>so i was just thrilled.</li>
      <li>kind of like ripping a bandaid off...</li>
      <li>Nice idea</li>
      <li>Everyone thinks they are my own hair every time I wear them.</li>
      <li>, like me, a facelift or neck lift is a luxury you just can&#x27;t afford but want to take years off your face and/or neck, then this is the product to own.  </li>
      <li>I am sure these work great for people with more dexterity than I have, but I couldn&#x27;t use them.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonderful idea and really does the job, but after an hour or two the pain is unbearable.  </li>
      <li>This is so amazing and so very easy</li>
      <li>Once you master it, it becomes easy and you&#x27;ll never feel like you look as good if you don&#x27;t have them on.  </li>
      <li>They are very strong and hold well.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, I really love it!  </li>
      <li>Once you determine that, move any stray hairs out of the way, rub the place where you are applying the tapes with alcohol, press the tapes on and press and move your finger around the tape a bunch of times to make it stick well and to make the tape more transparent (Most of the time, I can get two days wear out of the tapes!)  </li>
      <li>The price for this product is great and t is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>You can see them by your ear and kind of bunches up your face to look like more wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I believe  that most costumers don&#x27;t own one.</li>
      <li>It becomes so easy that you won&#x27;t even need a mirror to apply them!  </li>
      <li>just make sure you clean off the area where you wish to apply the tabs with a good cleaner</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the results.  </li>
      <li>I ended up never using it as I would be embarrassed for it to come undone as I&#x27;m sure it would have anyway.</li>
      <li>I  would order more</li>
      <li>Make sure you purchase the appropriate skin tone set.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>you maaaay be able to get away with wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Unless your curiosity just gets the better of you like mine did.</li>
      <li>I make sure to moisturize the area once the patches are removed.  </li>
      <li>You might have better luck with the item..than I did...</li>
      <li>Im pleased.</li>
      <li>Many people get their hair cut, color it, put make up on, etc.  </li>
      <li>I would love it if I could get the tapes to stick.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have no cream on the contact site.  </li>
      <li>surely i didnt have a tuck..  </li>
      <li>This works ok but takes practice to position to hide the wrinkles or sagging.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, they are &#x27;okay&#x27;.</li>
      <li>have now reordered 3 more, one more for me 2 for my friends.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not stick well, hard to get good results</li>
    <li> Came fast good price still have not tried them ,still trying to see how to work them but so far what I read sounds good.</li>
    <li> First off Amazon always gives fast service.  ** I washed and dry the place I was going to put the tapes. But the  TAPES just don&#x27;t have enough sticky stuff for them to stay on.</li>
    <li> Wsste if money.  I returned this item. One of the string locks was missing.  The tabs would not stay when put on tight.</li>
    <li> I agree with most everyone that the product is wonderful! You do have to clean the area because the adhesive strips won&#x27;t stick but once you have done this the strips will stay really well. Takes ten years off your face! I&#x27;ve been wearing them for about three months and I love them,! My friends are considerably younger than I and I feel like one of them!  I would recommend this vendor anyday! Shipments are always quick and I was also given a few extra tapes because I&#x27;m a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Sometimes they stick, sometimes they don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This is a great product offered by a wonderful company.  I have been ordering from them for a few years.  When I got the last delivery a month or so ago, they sent me 40 free additional lift tapes!  I don&#x27;t understand the few negative reviews I have read.  These tapes work great if used properly.  Make sure you have no cream on the contact site.  Sure, they are not a surgical face lift, but they come close!!! Thank you CosmeSearch!  I will be a regular customer for years to come!!</li>
    <li> The product sort of works. However, it hurts when the elastic crosses the ear. You have to wear it high to avoid that. The problem is the elastic always slips down and I haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to hold it in place. Also, it is not easy to hide it especially when you wear it high. Besides using it near the ear, I ordered another set to use near my eyes. I have to cut a little so the tape won&#x27;t show. When applied correctly, my whole face is all tightened up without any wrinkles. I definitely look much younger but look somewhat different as the tightening actually make my eyes smaller and tilted upwards. I am not sure I look better though. That is why some movie stars look worse after plastic surgery since the face becomes sort of unnatural afterwards. I think this trick can give some people a preview of what the resulting effects if they want to pursue plastic surgery. The product does work as claimed.</li>
    <li> Wasted my hard earned money. The band broke the first use. Didn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
    <li> It works, but difficult to figure out and very uncomfortable when you do. I would not recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Took before and after pictures, could not tell a difference. When removing from the side of my neck, it ripped my skin. Ouch!!!</li>
    <li> Works really well, takes a decade or more off of your face.  Not good for wearing outside in the wind though, as your hair blows and you can see it, lol.</li>
    <li> I tried...I really tried but the item is too complicated, too unweildy and has bizzare results once you figure it out.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed , as the elastic bands broke before I even applied them.  When I tried to put them thru the holes, the end came off</li>
    <li> It works! A welcome alternative to surgery.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic...but I decided to give them a try with a bit of hope...well am I glad I did! They work! It took a couple of tries but I got them on right and the transformation was amazing. I turned my frowny mouth right side up and the confidence went up as well! Another surprize was there to...you don&#x27;t even remember that you are wearing them...very comfortable. Will I buy refills...oh you bet I will...I highly recomend this product...</li>
    <li> when I first tried these I didn&#x27;t think they would work; I felt like people could see them but after I few practices I use them to lift sides of mouth and jawls and they work great. I have worn them to work, out to dinner to workout I wear my hair down and also up in ponytail and they are not noticeable. i can&#x27;t afford botox or lazers so this is the poor persons face lift for jawls.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for photo shoots and special occasions - also comes in a disposable form - you need enough hair to cover the bands up, but it works wonderfully in changing your look - takes years off your face. Wish it were permanent!</li>
    <li> what is described in the instruction does not work, I would not recommend spending the money on this production .&lt;br /&gt;I tried and I was disappointed</li>
    <li> These were so uncomfortable to wear they actually made my ears bleed.  I returned them.  I wore them under a wig, I don&#x27;t know how anyone could possibly conceal these under their own hair.  M y recommendation is don&#x27;t waste your money or build up any hope!</li>
    <li> This product is just what I need. I look so much better with it.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is outstanding!!!</li>
    <li> it is a little hard to get them on the right spot. I have noticed that they slide on skin if you sweat at all. so all in all I would say good product.</li>
    <li> one of the great ones</li>
    <li> Its just those metal tape holders that are painful</li>
    <li> Nor as good as advertised!</li>
    <li> The sticky tabs stay all day and there were many provided.  The stretchy bands were strong. I recomend this product</li>
    <li> I  would order more but I  wait for sale, less expensive.  Thank you  Jirina</li>
    <li> I am so very happy with these and ordered 3 more.  Love them so much and  NEVER want to be without!!!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the product did not work at all.  The adhesive holds for all of 5 minutes and comes off. The design is good, but does not work.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was disappointed with what arrived.  The package was evidently home made and consisted of a zip lock bag, a crudely copied set of instructions and three sets of tapes.  the plastic straps were left out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was unusable.  I may order from a more legitimate vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> Really works! I&#x27;ve been using these for years. Have no problem with them staying on.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - just need to get used to the pull, but it really works and takes years off!!</li>
    <li> I love Secret Lift and use them almost everyday.  When applied as directed they last all day long. I have never had a problem with the tape and I&#x27;ve been using them for at least a year. It gives you that extra little lift that can make you go from looking tired to well rested.</li>
    <li> Save your money this product does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Tape does not stay attached to skin no matter what method you try.&lt;br /&gt;No tape-no pull-no face lift.</li>
    <li> It is just great.  The difference is much more than I ever expected.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this does not work. I cleaned the area very good and put the tape on. The tape stayed about 30 min. also where ever I put the sting it would slide down the back of my head or off the top??? If any one has any ideas let me know. But I think I would like a refund....</li>
    <li> I just found this in the bottom of my drawer.  I just got angry again that i actually bought this garbage!!  I suggest if you don&#x27;t want to wind up with a piece of elastic an some tape stripes that don&#x27;t stick.  Please don&#x27;t buy this.  I still want my money back.</li>
    <li> Was very difficult to work with. Would not stick. When finally got it all connected it slid down. I ended up never using it as I would be embarrassed for it to come undone as I&#x27;m sure it would have anyway. Loss of monwy!!!</li>
    <li> It works if you want to take the time to stick on ....great for special occasion ! Can&#x27;t keep on to long.</li>
    <li> I have short hair, so it was a little tricky to hide the adhesive strip. I trimmed the strip just a bit and it was no longer visible. I didn&#x27;t clean area with alcohol. ..and had NO problem...adhesive was super strong. ..kind of like ripping a bandaid off...do it fast. The first time I used them I had the elastic band too low...too close to my ears...that hurt...adjusted that next use. Not for everyone. ..but works great for me.</li>
    <li> I would love it if I could get the tapes to stick. I used alcohol to clean the area and it didn&#x27;t help at all the tape only stayed on for a minute or so.</li>
    <li> Works as promised! Little hard at first but once you get the practice you get the 5 to 10 years younger look!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;Luv this product! Actually I have been using them for a couple of years, more so as a wrinkle prevention, wear it all day, it lifts so you do not get wrinkles or lines. I would suggest using the stronger tabs on all products, don&#x27;t like the rubberband thing that has the &amp;#34;good tabs&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s too tight even&lt;br /&gt;though I&#x27;m very thin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You great product!</li>
    <li> For my taste it&#x27;s another set of elastics with knots missing, one for the eyes/forehead and another one for the chin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I really love it!  Try it, it may take some patience and practiceto get the tapes right.  See Youtube for really  helpful  instuctional videos.  I couldn&#x27;t like a product more than this!  I like these one piece tapes...Prefer the PRO to the originals with wires.</li>
    <li> These little wonders really helped me achieve the look I needed without having to spend $10,000+ on a face/neck lift.</li>
    <li> Have used these for quite a while now but,they don&#x27;t adhere as well as they used to. ....I think they may be doing something differently. At least 7 in each refill package does not stick. Amazon needs to sell the replacement bands for the neck tapes.</li>
    <li> this was as though I had a face lift.  All that knew me before kept asking me if I changed my eyemake up, or waht was so unusual ...surely i didnt have a tuck..  The tuth is you can see my lids, my fine bone contours on checks and no jowls.. like taking 20 years off my face.. I felt great on job interviews where normally people hire the younger set.  donna in sa antonio, tx</li>
    <li> CosmeSearch, Inc. ships my ordered product exceptionally fast!  When I order the items I need, the package arrives within two-to-three days, which is the fastest I have I ever experienced from an out-of-state shipper.  As an added surprise, sometimes &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; product is included, which is greatly appreciated.  When I use this product, I definitely feel more confident.  I only use the Neck Lift, which causes me to hold my head up, resulting in much better posture.  It is like walking with an invisible book on top of your head (an old modeling-cat walk practice trick)!</li>
    <li> Terrible.  The barbs on the ends broke immediately,  the smaller of the three bands is too small for any use I can see.  These are not effective in my opinion, just very flimsy</li>
    <li> Tossed this contraption out.  Wasn&#x27;t a bad idea and If it works for someone great. Waste of money unless you can figure out how to put it on securely and not worry about it detaching from your face in the middle of a cocktail party. (Had to laugh and grimace at the thought)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Really works. Takes years off your face. The only complaint I have seen is that the tapes don&#x27;t stick properly and are difficult to conceal. I ordered light hair,  and you really can&#x27;t see the bands at all. Much more comfortable than the original secret lift as the hooks would be so uncomfortable above the ears that it would be impossible to wear them for too long.Secret lift pro is so much more comfortable. There is a foolproof way to make the tapes stay on, which is so comfortable you could even sleep in them.  Make sure skin is clean.  Apply surgical spirit (alchohol) let it dry. Purchase tac gel, available from amazon, let it dry and apply secret lift pro. Ten tears younger in two minutes.  This works!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what you expect it to do!</li>
    <li> If one is really inspired and dedicated, these face lift bands work.  Better to use them for night events.  However,  with proper hair coverage, they may be hidden during the day.  For me,  they&#x27;d become more uncomfortable after a few hours.  HOWEVER, while in a fancy ball bathroom,  I observed a much older woman removing her facelift tabs, allowing her face to relax, and &#x27;re-lifting&#x27; her face.  Dramatic.  If one is on-stage, or attending a high school reunion, consider practicing with this product.  At this price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sagging skin or wrinkles yet but what i do have is acne scars. I have them on my cheeks and near my chin. I use these to smooth out my skin. It made me feel so good about myself and i felt pretty when i used these for the first time. I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my skin. I have never had smooth skin as an adult so i was just thrilled. They are very strong and hold well. I cleaned my skin with alcohol and there was no problem with it holding. I can&#x27;t imagine i will use these everyday as it is probably not good to pull on your skin all the time but for going out or for pictures, perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re unsure, trust me..i am a hard person to please and these are truly worth the money.</li>
    <li> I decided I would read the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews before I posted mine.  DO NOT pay attention to those reviews.....PATIENCE AND A LITTLE PRACTICE is all you need to look years younger and feel great about yourself again!  I have been using the Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift for over 3 years.  At first I thought I would only wear it for special occasions but got hooked on them and I wear them everyday and don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re on my face.  Some helpful hints:  If your hair is long, pull the top and sides of your hair off of your face and put in a clip.  It does take some time to know how and where to apply the tapes depending on how you want your face to look. Once you determine that, move any stray hairs out of the way, rub the place where you are applying the tapes with alcohol, press the tapes on and press and move your finger around the tape a bunch of times to make it stick well and to make the tape more transparent (Most of the time, I can get two days wear out of the tapes!)  It becomes so easy that you won&#x27;t even need a mirror to apply them!  Once you have the tapes in place, thread the strings through each tape, and attach the strings on the top of your head according to how &amp;#34;young and refreshed&amp;#34; you want to look!  That&#x27;s it!  Once you master it, it becomes easy and you&#x27;ll never feel like you look as good if you don&#x27;t have them on.  I just ordered the Secret Lift Pro and I can&#x27;t wait to try them!  I will give my review for them also.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all.  It became undone the minute I connected it.  I thought it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> The product Came Very Quickly. What a great idea for face lifting and they work. Wish I had thought of it. The tapes are expensive for tape, but it holds.</li>
    <li> this product for me was hard to use..It was frustrating.You might have better luck with the item..than I did...Beth</li>
    <li> You can see the tape!!  If you go somewhere where it is dark you maaaay be able to get away with wearing it.  When I walked into the light my husband asked, &amp;#34;What do you have on the side of your face?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> When I first applied it, it was great, then after a few hours it began to hurt my ears also the glue slips and causes the lift to look funny after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite a while now.  I thoroughly enjoy wearing the lifts.  They are comfortable and long wearing provided you wash the area with alcohol to completely dry the skin before placing the tapes.</li>
    <li> You need to get used to wearing it, but it does work. I look years younger. Just make sure your hair covers the adhesives.</li>
    <li> What a rip !! Cant believe i fell for this! Lol! I scolded my mom for wasting $ on snake oil and look at me now!</li>
    <li> These patches certainly have some merit, but I found that the sharp, pointy edges of the metal pieces would dig into my skin to where it hurt so much that I had to remove them after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the metal pieces were modified so that the ends were rounded off a bit, they would be much more comfortable and I might purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are &#x27;okay&#x27;. The patches that you place near your ear work pretty well to give a little lift (except you&#x27;ll need a bullet to bite on when the sharp edges of the metal piece start digging into your skin) ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work well on the neck area, which was my primary reason for the purchase.  I think that for the neck, the tapes should be larger than the tapes for the rest of the face, and perhaps square or rectangle shaped instead of the teardrop shape.</li>
    <li> I wanted to see if it would hold up my &#x27;turkey neck&#x27; and it made a noticeable difference! I was able to put under and behind by ears and hike up the loose skin- it lasted for a few hours but beware - sweating makes the tape come off !</li>
    <li> This did not work for me and I am returning it.  I think the only way to get a younger face is a real facelift.  Sorry to say.  All the gimmicks don&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give this a one ★ , totally useless and a waste of good money. Directions are unreal, I actually laughed at myself for purchasing this stuff, I finally threw the whole package in the trash, don&#x27;t waste your time or dollars on this bogus product.</li>
    <li> Worked great except my skin got alittle irritated  where tabs were after wearing all day.  Could be because I was outside sweating.  Would get them again.</li>
    <li> Yes it suits my perpurse</li>
    <li> LOL... Yep, that&#x27;s about it!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t EVEN bother! I will sell you my spare Tripollar Stop if you want real, permanent results that don&#x27;t let one side of your face fall because an elastic  or adhesive gives away!!!</li>
    <li> This tape almost works, but it isn&#x27;t waterproof and doesn&#x27;t stay on during light perspiration times (e.g., during dancing).  I can go swimming in what I use now. I have found that cutting a Nexcare Tegaderm bandage, http://www.amazon.com/Nexcare-Tegaderm-Waterproof-Transparent-Dressing/dp/B000GG7UEW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_9?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390779210&amp;sr&#x3D;8-9&amp;keywords&#x3D;tegaderm, into four sections (once across the end and then vertically twice) you can get two wears out of one bandage.  The tape is very clear and thin.  You just need one section per side of face for a neck and jaw lift, stretching an end from just under the earlobe, the other end up behind the ear and then pressing it down along the strip to ensure it is all connected to your skin.  I never thought I would want to do anything like this because of how superficial it seemed, but it has helped my life in many ways (e.g., employment and getting waited on at the store - sad but true).  Many people get their hair cut, color it, put make up on, etc.  This isn&#x27;t any different.  I wish the Instant Face was strong and clear, worked when it was hot outside and stayed on while swimming.  I also found that Nexcare Absolute worked well in the pool.  I wish Instant Face could develop something clear and more lasting like these Nexcare products (not the Nexcare rolls of tape, they are not clear even though they say they are, and the rolls of tape don&#x27;t work.)  I just want to help those in our generation who aren&#x27;t retired yet and have to compete at times with the younger generation.  Also, many of us don&#x27;t want to go into our late senior years looking like a caricature of ourselves because we had a real facelift.  I want a lift for now that is temporary and works well.</li>
    <li> These are a great help in my daily routine.  I recently lost a lot of weight and my face was looking older than I wanted it to look. Thank you so much for giving me a solution that didn&#x27;t involve a knife.</li>
    <li> better just get a face lift ! this just comes apart ,looks bad , terrible to get on right, a waste of money . feel like it shows when you wear it .Wish i had not spent the money on it!</li>
    <li> Works great, but does make my skin red where the stickers are placed, but that&#x27;s because of how well the stick....I can deal with the redness because they work so well.....love it , and makes my face look amazing , and I look 25 again! ! I have turned my mom, and many friends on to them , and they all love the face lifting stickers too! !</li>
    <li> Was soo difficult to do...the model in the video must have been practicing for a very long long time..&lt;br /&gt;I hated it..Couldn&#x27;t return it fast enough...I really wanted it to work...Was so so disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;Happy that I&#x27;m getting a refund..</li>
    <li> I was considering plastic surgery when I came across this product and decided to try it. I absolutely loved it. It instantly made my double chin go away and tightened the sides of my face, making it look slimmer and making me look 10 years younger. The only thing you need to do in order to make it work is properly apply where indicated on the directions, or ask for someone else&#x27;s assistance when applying. However, when it is hot outside, the stickers may unstick, this is why you should always carry extras with you. The price for this product is great and t is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for years and I love them&lt;br /&gt;They easily remove 10 years of age off my face and neck</li>
    <li> Not sure why I purchased this.  I&#x27;m usually not one to buy stuff like this.  A moment of weakness I guess.  Anyway, save your money is my advice.  Unless your curiosity just gets the better of you like mine did.</li>
    <li> In  the past, I have worn a wig cap, and then used 3M transpore tape behind the eyes and ears to achieve a modified facelift. The eye lift tapes are a little more high tech and probably more expensive than my old technique but I think worth it. They are easy to apply and remove, and last for an entire day/evening.</li>
    <li> It works okay but you have to make sure you do it right otherwise the tape is completely visible and or it looses its sticky. you don&#x27;t spend much for it so I think it is worth playing with.  In all honesty if you have the money just get the work done.</li>
    <li> Ridiculous waste of money!!!!!! Run away!!!</li>
    <li> Not too happy with this purchase. You can see them by your ear and kind of bunches up your face to look like more wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It does exactly what it says it will do and the bonus is that it actually lasts all day and into the night.  I am so happy with this product that I just re-ordered it in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;If, like me, a facelift or neck lift is a luxury you just can&#x27;t afford but want to take years off your face and/or neck, then this is the product to own.  These bands have given me the opportunity to get those results.  I look in the mirror and no longer see a sagging neck and jowls.  Makes me look at least 10 years younger and boosts my confidence.&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of bang for your buck with this product and you&#x27;ll like what you see staring back at you in the mirror.</li>
    <li> I have been a customer of Cosmesearch for over a year.  My face sagged after losing weight, which I gained while taking prednisone.  My poor face looked older than my 91 year old mother!  My mother heard about this system on Dr Oz, but couldn&#x27;t remember the name.  I did a Google search, &amp;#34;Facelift&amp;#34; and found Cosmesearch!  The facelift system is easy to use.  You simply attach a medical type tape with a hole onto each band, which clip together in the back of your head.  You pull your face back and attach the tapes and clip the bands, and presto, new young face!  I wear these every day.  Be sure to clean the area first with alcohol before applying the tapes, and don&#x27;t put liquid foundation over the tapes as I have noticed it will seep under and loosen them.  If you want to look younger, this is a very inexpensive way to do so.</li>
    <li> It works but not if you have short hair ,you can tell were the Band is pulling you skin up.couldnt use it.</li>
    <li> I love it!!. More then I ever dreamed. TRY IT,TRY IT. you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product almost daily for two years and I can&#x27;t imagine living without it.  It takes a little practice in the beginning to learn where to place the tapes and how to angle the bands on your head to lift exactly where your face needs it, but once you learn it...it&#x27;s a piece of cake. You will have to wear your hair down if you want to completely cover up the tapes, and you have to learn how to comb your hair over the bands to hide them, but those little adjustments are more than worth it because you will not only look 10-20 years younger, you will feel confident and youthful while wearing this ingenious product.  My most sincere thanks to whoever came up with this idea.  You have changed my life for the better in unimaginable ways!</li>
    <li> these really work wonders for the face i have ordered these four or five times when i get low i order another pack or two i would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Incredible!  who needs a face lift or shots???  Dangerous!  This is so amazing and so very easy and what a difference it makes!  So worth the money.  Comfortable and you don&#x27;t even know you have it on!  It stays on all day - night! Until you remove it.  Adjustable so it always works.  Great product.  Wish I had thought of it!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It really provides an instant face lift which will not harm your skin. It takes a little practice to use the system. But once you get the hang of it you will be pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
    <li> really work! i will buy again</li>
    <li> Very painful, not enough bands, lousy instructions, left bruising. Will never never recommend it to any one. Wasted my money</li>
    <li> It works fine, but is way to expensive for (let&#x27;s face it) some rubber band and stickers.</li>
    <li> Works very well...just make sure you clean off the area where you wish to apply the tabs with a good cleaner so the tabs will attach and you won&#x27;t have to worry about the tabs loosening.</li>
    <li> When i got them in, I was very skeptical. I wondered how these small bands will hold in place from a hard&lt;br /&gt;pull on the skin, but they worked! I was pleasantly surprised. Now when I am going out, I will be wearing these every time.&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I have is to keep track of them - they are easy to lose.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing the face lift tapes for 2 years.  I absolutely love the results.  I look so much younger.  The tabs lift both my face and neck.  You do have to have very clean skin (clean with alcohol) for the tapes to adhere.  I only wish I could wear my hair away from my face but the tapes don&#x27;t allow me to do that.  I hope the company creates a product that will allow this style.&lt;br /&gt;Great, Great Product.</li>
    <li> Works great -- helps lift the chin without being noticeable or uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> These really do work!</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I had lunch with a friend (who paid righteous bucks for a real lift) and she asked me if I had gotten a haircut (I had not),  and she kept smiling at my face. That&#x27;s the good news.  My problems with product are: My hair is very fine, so it&#x27;s kind of difficult to hide the knots on the band (I feel like they are &amp;#34;on display&amp;#34;).  Also, now that it&#x27;s getting hot outside, I find the bands uncomfortable (and a bit itchy), and I prefer to wear my hair in a ponytail.  Once the weather changes, I&#x27;ll probably be able to tolerate them better, and wearing my hair down to cover the adhesive pads will be more likely.</li>
    <li> What an absolute waste of my time and money. One needs a masters degree to figure out the instructions. You should be embarrassed to endorse and sell this junk. The old saying is true, if it seems to good, watch out. Never again.</li>
    <li> This does work, however, it hardly ever stays on after a few hours and never if it gets warm inside or out.</li>
    <li> You can never hide the bands. I</li>
    <li> I bought this for a few of my relatives.  They loved it. It is a facelift without surgery period!</li>
    <li> Great product idea. It does accomplish the look and lift your face making you look younger and sexier. However the sticker can be improve. Don&#x27;t use over makeup because it won&#x27;t stick. It is definitely a comfortable in the side of the ears but if your fine with settle for beauty over comfort then buy it. Not a product to use everyday just for parties or events for few hours its fine.</li>
    <li> Terrible do not waste your money</li>
    <li> Would not stick. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works well...takes years off.</li>
    <li> This works ok but takes practice to position to hide the wrinkles or sagging.  Make sure your skin is very dry and free of lotions or makeup.  i just wanted it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> These are great, love them! I hate my turkey neck, it&#x27;s disgusting. I&#x27;m 50, but have had this turkey neck for 20 years, I&#x27;m not overweight at all, it&#x27;s just genetic I think.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to write my review on this because I want women who feel as bad I as felt to know these work and you can feel good about yourself again! What a huge change in my attitude and confidence just by using this tiny little neck band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been to several plastic surgeons for consultations and hope to some day have a neck lift. With prices from $3500. to $6,000 that is going to have to wait. In the mean time these work great. They adhere very well to the skin, just clean the area first, I use isopropyl alcohol on a cotton ball, let it dry.They blend well with the skin and are covered by the hair. Unless you&#x27;re bald they should work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the one around the back of my neck on a daily basis, and it pulls back the excess skin on the neck and that turkey thing hanging. I swear I look 10 years younger. The one that goes over the ear and head I use occasionally, it lifts more of the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore the set at family parties during the holidays and no one noticed, even my niece who notices every tiny thing from my new eyeliner to if I trimmed my hair a quarter inch didn&#x27;t notice. Love them, Love them. For the price you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> My first disappointment was in the packaging and the materials. This item is shipped with the elastic bands and tapes in small plastic bags inside an envelope. The elastic bands are made of about ten cents worth of elastic available at any craft store. The tapes are also similar to clear bandaids, which makes the total cost of materials less than $2.00.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive note about this product is the long lasting adhesion of the tapes. In order to pull the skin back properly, the elastic bands need to be placed toward the crown of the head, but the fabric covering on them will not allow them to stay put. They slide downward making the plastic ends placed through the tape holes pinch my ears also creating the familiar sag along my jaw line. I even tried using bobby pins to help keep the elastic in place, which did not work.&lt;br /&gt;The clear tapes are a bit on the large size so they can be seen on the face unless you trim them down. They are fairly invisible, except along the outer edges.&lt;br /&gt;I did watch the youtube video of the woman applying these to her face and if you look closely, right around where she attaches them and lets her hair down, the video is spliced to go from the application to an end shot of her new look, which could have been photoshopped or an image after she had plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;In theory, the effect of drawing the skin back does create a youthful appearance, but in reality I could not get this product to create that effect. I think I could do a better job using sturdy rubber bands and clear bandaids and save myself the expense of buying products like this.</li>
    <li> Adhesive ineffective....therefore lifting tapes totally useless...waste of money  Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again and I know mine is not the first complaint you&#x27;ve received...</li>
    <li> works really well once you figure out how to use them :)</li>
    <li> it is a great way to take some age off your face.... I use it for the neck....  it works.  clean skin, make sure no oil or cream is anywhere you are using the tapes....last all day...use rubbing alcohol to remove tape residue.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product works well if you don&#x27;t have the money for a facelift. It takes just a little time to get the nack of it but once you do, then you will look and feel years younger.</li>
    <li> I found this very painful to wear.  It cut deep into the sides of my head and ears.  It is a wonderful idea and really does the job, but after an hour or two the pain is unbearable.  I tried wrapping the twine in cotton wool but that didn&#x27;t work.  It just would not sit comfortably with me.  I am going to try the pro instead.  Also this item took 2 weeks to arrive!  Much to long to have to wait.  Should be on prime.</li>
    <li> Definitely a gimmick!  Does pull the skin under chin tighter, but felt like someone pinching me the three hours that I wore it. Face and eye lift might work if you wear it under a wig. Otherwise the band shows on your scalp.</li>
    <li> this does work... But I find it very uncomfortable,....maybe when I get used to it ,then it will be better..... I&#x27;ll update my post after I use it a bit more</li>
    <li> I  have tried this product but, unfortunately,  cannot rate it. The reason for that are &amp;#34;The liftbands&amp;#34; Have tried several times, and experienced poor holding power. You also need a hairpiece to cover the areas. I believe  that most costumers don&#x27;t own one. The product is not easy to apply for people that have little time to play with it. Rating is impossible because every person has different needs. Therefore O stars</li>
    <li> Tapes stick beautifully for hours on end, but the holders are so painful behind the ears.  I have to resist yanking them off!  To the point that I have gotten an intolerable headache!!!  I&#x27;ll use them for a special occasion, but never for a full day at the office.</li>
    <li> Changes my neck like crazy!</li>
    <li> Always use them before I start applying make up, love them!</li>
    <li> it is a christmas gift and is untried as of this moment</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as soon as i got it. And i was able to get it in place and stick well, on ny first try  its fast. Its easy. And best of all .. it works !! Im pleased.</li>
    <li> it just didn&#x27;t stick the way it should.</li>
    <li> My wife is totally happy with the youthful look it has given her. Easy to put on and wear. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t WAIT SO I COULD HAVE READ THE ABOVE REVIEW. a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Nice idea but they just did not work....</li>
    <li> I have used the facelift and the neck lift. They both worked well. You just have to practice a couple times. I even FELT younger wearing them.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on clients and am pleased with the results. It takes a little getting used to in order to apply correctly hut once you get the hang of it the results are great.</li>
    <li> I laughed when I opened this item. Strings and tape.....customer expected to tie these tiny strings and thread them thru tiny holes on sticky tabs. For real? Break out the magnifying glass and if someone had any decreased finger coordination ,arthritis etc. it would be literally impossible. The tabs are huge. What kind of face can hide such a huge tab...hair line and hairstyle to hide them? You would literally have to wrap your hair around your face over them.&lt;br /&gt;Not even worth sending back. Trash can</li>
    <li> The worst product I had tried so far. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The reviews are all false unless there are negative reviews.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> This does not work the way instructed.  won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Ladies...don&#x27;t waste your money!  The least little bit of humidity or perspiration, they bounce off your face like a sling shot.</li>
    <li> The band that goes behind your neck broke the first time I used it. Very shoddy. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was contemplating cosmetic surgery.  Thought I would try this for fun. It is very easy to use.  This is now just part of my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;INSTANT GRATIFICATION\\&quot;! The tapes are secure and will not come loose till I take them off.&lt;br /&gt;I have now reordered 3 more, one more for me 2 for my friends. One friend works in plastic surgeon&#x27;s office. This absolutely works just as the picture shows.</li>
    <li> the hook on the string that is suppose to hold your face up broke within a few minutes the first time I used it-I want a new one!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very upset. I was hoping it worked a little.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all. Tape didnt stick and it was missing the hook on one side of one of the bands. I am embarrassed I bought it. Need to figure out how to return it.</li>
    <li> worked great all day! no way though to do the eyes, BUT no turkey neck! took 10 years off! holds very well! well worth the $$ !!</li>
    <li> elastic broke. poor quality. unable to use</li>
    <li> It does make a difference in your appearance.  Only problem is you have to wear your hair down around your face so no one will see it and I don&#x27;t like wearing my hair like that.  Also, if you&#x27;re outside and its windy...there goes your secret!!</li>
    <li> The neck pactches are great. the other stickers don&#x27;t stick very long and hard to move with out them popping off.</li>
    <li> Hard to apply, not worth it.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Secret Lift Original for light hair. It takes a time or two to get the knack of it. Read the directions &amp; use 70% alcohol before applying. One reviewer also said she uses &#x27;invisible bandaid&#x27;, on hot  humid days, for extra traction. That made sense to me. Yes, I have read the few complaints about this product, however, I was determined to master it, correctly, with my first try. Therefore, by the second day, I had it down perfectly. Of course, I *always* carry an extra set for eyes &amp; neck with me, just in case. This product is awesome &amp; absolutely will help you to look 10 to 15 years younger, immediately! I have rather long slightly wavy hair, natural dark golden blonde, yet, at times, I like to wear a wig, for a nice change. I even wear extensions, sometimes, especially on bad hair days. If you have short hair &amp; want to wear the *secret lift* then buy some hair, as one customer recommended. My extensions &amp; 3 wigs are all synthetics, very very inexpensive, that I bought, here, at Amazon. Everyone thinks they are my own hair every time I wear them. Don&#x27;t care what other people may say! I am an artist, writer, intuitive counselor, &amp; have designed my own vintage cards, so I am always encouraging my clients to summon their true grit and moxie mind and be creative with their daily lives! The secret lift is helpful, especially as so many of us are on much tighter budgets. I know ladies who have almost gone bankrupt with fillers &amp; cosmetic surgery. Some of them have switched to Secret Lift for that very reason. Good luck &amp; practice makes perfect!</li>
    <li> Instant youth. Take off ten years without the expense.  For those who say that this product limits your hairstyles,  I say, &amp;#34;What more do you expect for $15?&amp;#34; Buy more hair!</li>
    <li> This product is everything that it is advertised to be. I love it! It is a miracle product. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick fix that looks fabulous. What an amazing transition for an instant neck lift. It works!</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t stay in place for longer than a few minutes on me.</li>
    <li> After trying the &amp;#34;chin lift&amp;#34; for 45 minutes I had to peal the adhesive off because it was irritating due to the constant pull.  The directions were clear, but the product is rather difficult to deal with.  What did I expect?  My friend and I did have a lot of laughs while trying &amp;#34;to look younger&amp;#34;. If movie stars have to wear these, bless them.</li>
    <li> they did not stay in place. poor quality</li>
    <li> I love them!  I tried them last week and have worn them 3x since.  A little tricky as I have very short blond hair and have had to grow it out a bit, but worth it.  Absolutely cannot figure out how to do the neck lift and supposed that I need longer hair to get away with it.  My husband notices when I have them on and compliments me more than usual</li>
    <li> Im 68 years old and have always tried to take care of my face and body. Gravity is a cruel thing.I cant justify 10,000. nor afford it for a face lift  I loved the way this product makes me look. It took 20 yrs off my face. I didn&#x27;t tell, but every where I went people comment on how wonderful my face looks. The only problem I found , it creeps up into my hair ( I have a pixie hair cut) and starts to make my ears hurt, but not always. when the tape sticks to your hair just put a little oil on your fingers,massage it on the tape and hair and it seems to come loose eaiser. (coconut oil, olive, are vegtableoil. I think it creeps up because the band is not long enough. It doesn&#x27;t go over the top and stay there , it creeps to the bottom of your skull. That&#x27;s my take on this, I give it 3-4 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people have problems with the tape. Make sure you clean the area with alcohol first and the tape will hold tight all day. This product removes my under eye bags and my nasal labial folds instantly!</li>
    <li> these really work.  Be careful not to get tape into hair or wig hair....it is too easy to cut the headband.  Wish there was a way to order them separately as well, since they offer refill tapes.  Did not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered these several weeks ago and had problems with the strips coming lose shortly after putting them on, so I got frustrated and was just going to throw them out. Today I thought I&#x27;d give them another try, cleaned the area good with alcohol, made sure I rubbed the tape for 30 sec., I have been wearing them for 12 hrs no problems.I&#x27;m a young looking 66 yr old and wearing the lift makes me look incredably younger. Maybe it&#x27;s vanity but I feel amazing. The only concern I have is the warm weather and sweating from reading previous reviews, hopefully the co. can come up with a solution. I say try them, follow instructions, it takes practice, make yourself feel good. This is written by LARRY&#x27;S WIFE.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! I love it and use it every single day alternating with &amp;#34;Secret lift pro- neck and jaw lift&amp;#34;, it is just like getting a cosmetic surgery but so much more cheaper and painless :-) I&#x27;m a bit allergic to the tape behind the ears but nothing to worry about.</li>
    <li> Awful. Didnt adhere to skin at all. Tried more than one strip after making certain skin was clean and free of any moisturizer. Crude product with elastic bands that don&#x27;t have sufficient stretch. Can&#x27;t imagine who might benefit from it.</li>
    <li> I am sure these work great for people with more dexterity than I have, but I couldn&#x27;t use them.  You have to be certain you know where to place the tapes because if you try to move them even a little, they lose their stickiness and become useless.  Every time I tried to place them, my eyes looked really slanted (fake). If my eyes weren&#x27;t slanted then they didn&#x27;t seem to make too much of a difference in how I looked.  The elastic seemed sort of tight anyway so I don&#x27;t think they would be good for people who develop headaches easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try these, then maybe buy a couple of boxes because I think it will take a few attempts to learn where to place them and (as I&#x27;ve mentioned) they are pretty unforgiving.</li>
    <li> Not comfortable-OK for a short time. I was too afraid that the tape/bands were noticeable to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing since botox , i love this , make sure to order 2 because trust me you will love it</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It takes practice to adjust the band so it fits your neck correctly, but once you do that you keep re-using the band.  It takes away the turkey neck. It doesn&#x27;t stick when it&#x27;s hot outside, and you have to keep the tape behind the ear so it doesn&#x27;t show.  Otherwise, you can&#x27;t beat it for looking years younger without surgery!</li>
    <li> Save your money, time and suffering getting a Face Lift.  This is the answer without the risk.  My cousin spent $9K for a facelift, and believe me, these little patches do everything and more.  I&#x27;m 71 and everyone who sees me when I&#x27;m wearing these tell me I look terrific - about 20 years younger.  They are easy to hide so no one knows your secret and the adhesive lasts for hours.  I would recommend using a bit of alcohol on the area where the patches are placed to assure longer adhesion. I make sure to moisturize the area once the patches are removed.  Give them a try.  You have very little to lose.  Hope you have the same results as I have.</li>
    <li> Make sure you purchase the appropriate skin tone set.  If the sites where the tapes are to be applied are not fully cleansed with alcohol and dried, the tapes will not hold.  Follow the directions carefully.  Additional tapes can be purchased direct from Cosemesearch.  You must have hair at least to the bottom of the ear.  The thicker your hair the easier it is to conceal the bands.</li>
