<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These things stink, and it&#x27;s not any lavender I ever smelled before.</li>
    <li> smells incredible and is a great value.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell. I put them in my closets, there was no change of smell in the closets whatsoever after 3 days.</li>
    <li> smells great!  permeates my closet.</li>
    <li> These have almost no odor to them.  Even a bunch in a drawer do no good at all.  Must have been stale.  Sorry, folks.</li>
    <li> Cute sachets. They don&#x27;t give off too much of a scent but they are cute and great for the price.</li>
    <li> what&#x27;s not to love!!!</li>
    <li> These are great! I&#x27;m really happy with them. They look just as described. Perfect for my lovely wedding toss cones!</li>
    <li> For this seasons crop the color and fragrance is not what it should be.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell.  Gave them away.</li>
    <li> Stash these delightful sachets where ever you want a subtle clean lavender scent.  Also in storing clothes bags to prevent moths.</li>
    <li> The smell of these is nice when you open the package but it just isn&#x27;t potent.  I have several sachets in my closet...and there&#x27;s no smell. I started with one in each drawer of my dresser...no smell.  Bumped it up to two in each drawer...still can&#x27;t smell them. I&#x27;m quite disappointed with these sachets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I increased my initial 1-star rating to 4-stars due to the seller&#x27;s outstanding customer service and the quality of the replacement sent to me. Lisa responded very politely to my review (as you can see). She refunded my money, AND sent me a new order for free, including a gift and a very nice note! I told her she didn&#x27;t have to do that but she insisted. I even offered to remove my one-star rating and she said I didn&#x27;t need to.  However I felt compelled to change my review to reflect the way she dealt with everything. Customer service like this is so rare so I mean to show some appreciation. And my new order of lavender sachets seems much stronger than the first order and I&#x27;m happy with them and will not hesitate to buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Odor was OK..not real strong. But after about 4 months in a drawer the material crumbled into dust like particles, and it was a pain to clean out.</li>
    <li> the smell was overpowering, so will likely not be able to use as planned.</li>

    <li> This item arrived on time &amp; was packaged/protected well. These Fragrant French Lavender Sachets are just wonderful. They smell great, they look great, &amp; you get 12 of them for a very decent price. I ordered some from another company before I ordered these. I spent too much, it was too small, &amp; didn&#x27;t smell as well as the ones I purchased from zziggysgal. I am pleased with both product ans Seller. I will definitely order more items in the future.</li>
    <li> Just love it! First of all I never leave any comments or reviews due to my hectic schedule; but this time I made sure I have a minute to write about my experience with this order. First of all, I received my package within several days. I totally love the smell and appearance of these cute little sachets. Second, I decided to contact the seller with a question regarding a homemade lavender oil. I received the respond within 20 min. Beautiful product, excellent customer service! And they have a facebook page too! Totally recommend to anyone who likes organic products and appreciate great customer service!</li>
    <li> Lovely packets and just what our closets needed.</li>
    <li> I gave these for chrismas gifts, they smell amazing, and the little sachet it comes in is darling. People loved them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy about Lavender.  Beautiful little Sachets, no Lavender aroma at all.  Waste of money.</li>
