      <li>I LOVE THE SCENT</li>

      <li>I am guessing this product does not use some of the chemicals in most deodorants that cause me a severe rash when used.</li>
      <li>but....... works better than any &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Smells great, keeps me smelling great, and doesn&#x27;t irritate like other products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>It also smells really fresh and nice.</li>

      <li>Really a big fan of this product and happy that I could buy it in bulk here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Great product, works  well, keeps underarms dry, no bad smell, arrived promptly!very pleased with this product</li>
      <li>Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
      <li>These deodorants are doing a brilliant job, where as the others would wear out before the work day has gone half way.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t anything fancy, I just want to smell clean.  </li>
      <li>The deodorant was more fragrant than I was anticipating, but the smell is very nice and clean, and works much better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Love the brand and fast delivery, I have been using this brand for years</li>
      <li>Product smells like a man&#x27;s deodorant and works ok if you do not sweat much.</li>
      <li>It seems it was substituted with a COUPLE more, those which are not listed on my older stick: Ethylhexyglycerin, Octenidine HCL.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly, well-packaged.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super clean crisp scent-</li>
      <li>Great odor protection without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I can say that it keeps me fresh and odorless.</li>
      <li>Fresh &amp; herbal scent.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and lass.</li>
      <li>Pleasant light scent, not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>The scent, &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;, is very masculine and is pretty strong.  </li>
      <li>Been using this product for years and have never been able to find something that allows for such a fresh, long-lasting smell.</li>
      <li>It is all natural, and it smells clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m off to melting some beeswax et cetera and pouring my own deodorant recipe into empty deodorant stick containers.  </li>
      <li>This works much better for me, last all day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve excercised and it keeps the smell contained pretty well.</li>
      <li>You definitely have to use it more often than an antiperspirant to control odor</li>
      <li>Not an invisible solid, more of a gel deodorant.</li>
      <li>I recently switched from anti-perspirant and I love it.</li>
      <li>The product has a very good fresh smell that lasts at least as long as any conventional deodorant I have successfully used.</li>
      <li>I still occasionally get dry skin with this product, but no pain, and it smells great.  </li>
      <li>Certainly lives up to the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; aspect...literally.</li>
      <li>It has a natural fresh smell and works very well.</li>
      <li>Its worked very well for me though.</li>
      <li>As others have posted, this product really doesn&#x27;t deserve the title of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, because of the presence of triclosan.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>you should order this brand and it really works.</li>
      <li>I cannot use most conventional deodorants and no anti-perspirment at all.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re serious about natural and least harmful deoderants, look elsewhere -- Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes some good alternatives, and some people have good results with salt-based products like the &amp;#34;deoderant stone&amp;#34; or its liquid salt</li>
      <li>My boyfriend was getting huge red rashes under his arm pits form using the Old Spice deodorant</li>
      <li>I sometimes have to reapply in the evening if I have had a particularly sweaty day, but otherwise it lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>My main deodorant along with the crystal stick.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and I feel the scent leans a little more towards manly</li>
      <li>No perfume smell, just clean and dry.  </li>
      <li>Most of the deodorants do not last long.</li>
      <li>Seems that it contains fewer chemicals than other brands and the price is lower than some of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, so I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
      <li>Did not keep me feeling and smelling fresh for the entire day.</li>
      <li>I notice that a lot of people are complaining of Triclosan, but I just bought a new stick today and noticed that it is NO LONGER LISTED AS AN INGREDIENT.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No aluminum, no Alzheimer no BO got to love it</li>
    <li> My husband likes this a lot. His pits breakout with some brands, but not trusty A&amp;H. We ordered this after searching locally for a resupply after a move (and a breakout) with no success. This is also a great value via Amazon.</li>
    <li> Product smells like a man&#x27;s deodorant and works ok if you do not sweat much.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from anti-perspirant and I love it. The scent is understated and great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My kids smell great!!</li>
    <li> I love arm&amp; hammmer deodorant I use this every day</li>
    <li> Excelent product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It seems to work better than most natural deodorant, however it does not smell the best.</li>
    <li> I would have liked it to smell like vanilla or something. But it works and it does not have aluminum in it.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent.  Very sticky under the arms and did not keep me dry.</li>
    <li> Great odor protection without all the harsh chemicals. I am rather active so I usually cannot go more than 12 hours without reapplying. That is a small price to pay to avoid added chemicals.</li>
    <li> Smells good, lasts all day.  Seems that it contains fewer chemicals than other brands and the price is lower than some of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, so I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
    <li> The deodorant was more fragrant than I was anticipating, but the smell is very nice and clean, and works much better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SCENT AND I LOVE THE FACT IT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE ECO-FRIENDLY BUT IT IS ! WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND AND REPURCHASE !</li>
    <li> This deodorant is wonderful. 24 hour protection from odor. It also smells really fresh and nice. Not too strong, but a nice light clean smell throughout the day. Keep in mind, this is DEODORANT not antiperspirant. You will still sweat, but you won&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Love the way it smells and love the way it makes me feel. It&#x27;s a super clean crisp scent- and it does not stain your shirts and underarms.</li>
    <li> I bought this product b/c I&#x27;m concerned about using antiperspirant that contains aluminum.  This is deodorant only, and it does work in that regard.  What I don&#x27;t like is the smell. The scent, &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;, is very masculine and is pretty strong.  I get a whiff of it now and then throughout the day and don&#x27;t like that it makes me smell like a guy.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was getting huge red rashes under his arm pits form using the Old Spice deodorant and I still cant figure out why, but as soon as he switched to this the rashes we&#x27;re less enflamed and painful. There is still some scaring left, but this Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant stays on longer and smells great! Buy in the biggest pack to save money though, they can be pricey at the grocery store!</li>
    <li> No aluminum - hooray! But this does not affect the job and the size also follows TSA restrictions. Have not tried it out at the gym but that is just because I am too lazy to get there. :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
    <li> Great product, works  well, keeps underarms dry, no bad smell, arrived promptly!very pleased with this product&lt;br /&gt;Ordered 4 pack,&lt;br /&gt;Great value</li>
    <li> This is the only aluminum-free deodorant that doesn&#x27;t rub my skin raw.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine and Jason both make my armpits burn.  I still occasionally get dry skin with this product, but no pain, and it smells great.  I sometimes have to reapply in the evening if I have had a particularly sweaty day, but otherwise it lasts all day.  Finding this has enabled me to give up antiperspirants entirely!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for us - goes on smooth and easy and the scent is not at all overwhelming or too floral -- excellent value and a hardworking and effective product.</li>
    <li> As others have posted, this product really doesn&#x27;t deserve the title of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, because of the presence of triclosan. Unlike some of the other reviews, my issue isn&#x27;t with it&#x27;s potential direct human health effects, but by the substantial scientific evidence that as a biocide and antimicrobial it&#x27;s contributing to the dangerous trend of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve read about MRSA and other resistant &amp;#34;superbugs&amp;#34;, overuse of antibiotics and antimicrobials like this are one of the leading causes. Yes, as a deoderant it&#x27;s effective, but it&#x27;s like swatting flies with a bazooka -- the fly might die but there&#x27;s serious collateral damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re serious about natural and least harmful deoderants, look elsewhere -- Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes some good alternatives, and some people have good results with salt-based products like the &amp;#34;deoderant stone&amp;#34; or its liquid salt forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for citations, googling &amp;#34;triclosan antimicrobial resistance&amp;#34; should get you multiple peer-reviewed papers.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Great product for adults and kids. I apply in the AM and again mid afternoon after a work out session.</li>
    <li> Fresh &amp; herbal scent. So nice to wear chemical free!!!</li>
    <li> Anything without nasty aluminum deserves a try in my book.  I am so tired of all the chemicals that are put in products and all the hype that suggests these things don&#x27;t hurt you!!!  Organic and Natural is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore. I have checked Walmart, Target and local grocery stores. Makes me worried that it will soon be discontinued. This is the only deodorant that keeps me from pitting out my shirts in sweat. Really a big fan of this product and happy that I could buy it in bulk here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to get this at Walmart but for some reason they stopped carrying it.  Finding a natural deodorant is difficult and the few that are carried in stores locally do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product excels where others fail and I am very pleased with it.  I bought it in bulk this time.</li>
    <li> Not a heavy-duty deodorant. It isn&#x27;t going to get you through a workout session or yard work, but it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or paraben in it, and it gets me through a day of office work with no problems.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. Yes it has triclosan but....... works better than any &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I guess its a half natural product but.... still good.</li>
    <li> After decades of my white shirts in particular acquiring yellow stains under the arms (basically ruining the shirt) I did some research. I discovered that the deordrant I was using contained Aluminum. So I looked for a deordrant that was made without aluminum. Arm and Hammer Essentails Deororant was what I was looking for. I have been using this product for about 18 months. I can say that it keeps me fresh and odorless. Not to mention that my white shirts are still white. Great Product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Pleasant light scent, not overwhelming.  Goes on clear, no stain, and effective!  Pleasantly surprised.  I will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> Still Not all natural but there&#x27;s no aluminum and it smell really good to me. My main deodorant along with the crystal stick.</li>
    <li> Did not keep me feeling and smelling fresh for the entire day. Used for one day and switched back to my old stuff the day after. It also BURNED my pits like icy hot would!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t stink anymore!</li>
    <li> Excelente Product!! Just as described by seller!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I recommend getting it</li>
    <li> You definitely have to use it more often than an antiperspirant to control odor but I haven&#x27;t noticed myself getting smelly before the day is out. I haven&#x27;t noticed any uncomfortable wetness. Of course it is winter. It may be different in the summer. We&#x27;ll see. For now I&#x27;m going to stick with it.</li>
    <li> Best deoderant ever. Quick shipment</li>
    <li> Great deodorant awesome scent sweet unit price, great sale!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used.  It is all natural, and it smells clean and fresh.  It lasts all day, and I just love it.</li>
    <li> Really the only deodorant I can use. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and hope to always be able to get it on-line anyway. I cannot use most conventional deodorants and no anti-perspirment at all. I am guessing this product does not use some of the chemicals in most deodorants that cause me a severe rash when used. I have no side effects at all when using A&amp;H Essentials. The product has a very good fresh smell that lasts at least as long as any conventional deodorant I have successfully used. Tip: Using anti bacterial soap helps the longer term effectiveness of this product.</li>
    <li> I use this so i don&#x27;t subject myself to aluminum additives. This is NOT an antiperspirant. And it does contain Tryclosan, which is another additive being discussed as harmful  :(</li>
    <li> I love it &amp; smells great but it doesn&#x27;t last that long :/</li>
    <li> Best vegan deodorant I&#x27;ve found yet - and cheap!!</li>
    <li> These deodorants are doing a brilliant job, where as the others would wear out before the work day has gone half way.  These just keep on going.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant. It smells great, does its intended job well, and doesn&#x27;t have as many chemical and potentially harmful ingredients as competing mainstream products.</li>
    <li> Arm &amp; Hammer Esssentials is a good, safe product. A strong deodorant without the aluminum. Smells fresh and lass. Product arrived quickly, well-packaged. I&#x27;ll use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> well I try to avoid all the fillers and use natural products on my skin. Most of the deodorants do not last long. This works for me all day long. What a relief, and it does not smell like grass.</li>
    <li> Love the brand and fast delivery, I have been using this brand for years and it still holds up. you should order this brand and it really works.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I&#x27;m a girl and I feel the scent leans a little more towards manly but we can still get away with it though. I&#x27;ve excercised and it keeps the smell contained pretty well. I&#x27;d definitely recommend excercising by yourself and seeing if you smell yourself before you go out. Its worked very well for me though.</li>
    <li> It works without aluminum and applies without tearing up the arm pit</li>
    <li> No perfume smell, just clean and dry.  I don&#x27;t anything fancy, I just want to smell clean.  This works great.</li>
    <li> Not the same Arm and Hammer I know!</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant more than Tom&#x27;s. This works much better for me, last all day</li>
    <li> Long-lasting! A hit with my family and I.</li>
    <li> Certainly lives up to the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; aspect...literally. You can smell your body odor towards mid-day, that&#x27;s quite &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. It has a good smell. Not an invisible solid, more of a gel deodorant. Gel has never seemed to work for me. Therefore I rate it 3 stars. It&#x27;s okay, but not strong enough which is a shame.</li>
    <li> Ordered for grandson. Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> As advertised, good price...</li>
    <li> Much better than the antiperspirant version</li>
    <li> Feels sticky and every 5 or so days, a rash occurs.</li>
    <li> Had to purchase another brand, this is not strong enough.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want deodorant with all kinds of additives and chemicals this is the best bet. I tried others and this one is the most pleasant smelling and it works on odor. It&#x27;s all we use now.</li>
    <li> Works well and love the fragrance</li>
    <li> Most all other deodorants irritate my underarms, or don&#x27;t provide enough &#x27;smell-proofing&#x27; to keep my happy-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deo on the other-hand is perfect.  Smells great, keeps me smelling great, and doesn&#x27;t irritate like other products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this better than the Tom&#x27;s product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two shapes of deo sticks they sell this in.  Get this one, and not the super-wide stick-  That one (though it supposedly has the same ingredients) irritated my underarms.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Does not make your glands swell like other deodorants. Thank God, it does not have that crazy aluminum in it. Who would want to put aluminum into their body? For years my glands under my arm and neck periodically spasm-ed and swelled. It was the aluminum in the other deodorants that caused it. If you want a safe deodorant for you and your family, get this one. It has a natural fresh smell and works very well.</li>
    <li> As promised! Thank you</li>
    <li> I thought that some underarm odor might be noticeable at the end of the day. Nope. None. Even after the gym. This is my new deodorant. Plus, it acts somewhat like shaving cream in the shower. No need for any!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad this deodorant works because of triclosan, because it really does work well, and I liked it because it didn&#x27;t have the aluminum.  I guess I&#x27;m off to melting some beeswax et cetera and pouring my own deodorant recipe into empty deodorant stick containers.  Wish me luck</li>
    <li> FRESH SMELLS SOOOOOOO GOOD!!! Remember though, it is only a deodorant, not an anti-perspirant. Do not expect it to control wetness. It doesn&#x27;t at all. Just the odor. It is a trade-off for having no aluminum in it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and have never been able to find something that allows for such a fresh, long-lasting smell. I notice that a lot of people are complaining of Triclosan, but I just bought a new stick today and noticed that it is NO LONGER LISTED AS AN INGREDIENT. It seems it was substituted with a COUPLE more, those which are not listed on my older stick: Ethylhexyglycerin, Octenidine HCL. No idea what these are.</li>
