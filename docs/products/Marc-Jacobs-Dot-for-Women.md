<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells like it should. Which is why the wife wanted it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, delivery on time</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this purchase.  I have tried this product in Macys, and purchased on Amazon because of the cheaper price, the scent was totally different and weaker.  I am sadly disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter (at her request) for her birthday.  She says is great.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  Price was great - much cheaper than depth stores</li>
    <li> Fragrance is subjective whether or not it is for you.  What we look for is value. I will base my review on that. This scent goes on nice and isn&#x27;t overbearing.  Like most of Marc Jacobs fragrances it is a young fresh scent.  I thought of a watermelon scent when I first applied it.  Fruity and bright.  The bottle is pretty to me, but too large to fit into a medicine cabinet so plan to place it somewhere larger.  For me this would be a one time purchase.  A nice summertime scent.  It lasts on skin and clothing for most of the day but doesn&#x27;t have any of the subtle changes that happen while wearing other perfumes.  Meaning it isn&#x27;t very complex. I like it, will wear it, but when it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  There are too many out there to try.</li>
    <li> Got this for my teenage granddaughter and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> My wife live this scent.</li>
    <li> Same spray from the mall only $25 cheaper. Sealed in plastic. Package got to the house before I was expecting it too, and I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Love it! The bottle is beautiful and it smells delicious!!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is great, the bottle is a good size, but the nozzle was broken.</li>
    <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be the real thing, but it was. One of my favorite scents. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was for my Daughter and she really likes it and bottle is gone she will get more..</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. The bottle is a little odd but love the scent. I like fresh scents and chose this one for the winter months.</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance for my 25yr old gf. She&#x27;s the one who picked it out. She loves it</li>
    <li> This is one of my new favorite perfumes. I love love love it so much that I just put it on to smell it myself. I recommend getting a spray and a roll on scent because it lasts only a couple hours by itself but, with both together it lasts all day. Always gets compliments. I think it&#x27;s more floral than fruity.</li>
    <li> Love, love this  Perfume it smells so clean</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! It is exactly what I order and it arrived extremely fast!! Thank you!!! 👏🏻👏🏻</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived broken so was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolute love this perfume well worth the money!!! Love the smell.</li>
    <li> my daughters favorite!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure my daughter will enjoy</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It has a simple, but sweet smell.</li>
    <li> great packaging and was appreciated greatly as gift</li>
    <li> Not the real deal! :( super super sad!</li>
    <li> Thank you I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, not strong but, subtle and and does&#x27;t give you a headache</li>
    <li> Perfect for spring and summer?</li>
    <li> Came in great packaging. Smells just right....will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was expecting and it was still in plastic wrapping around the box. No-one would know it wasn&#x27;t bought from Macy&#x27;s or whatever department store. Smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes to wear. At night times, during the day - whenever, &amp; wherever. Its the perfect scent for me!</li>
    <li> wife loved it but the shipping was quoted to be sooner than it was</li>
    <li> Perfect and just what she wanted!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite in the Marc Jacobs line, and I wear Dot more than any other fragrance. The body lotion alone lasts me all day at work, so I use the perfume at night if I go out. The scent is feminine and subtle.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this on a Groupon and considered buying it due to the good deal. I then looked on Amazon and after tax and shipping the Groupon was actually more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is cool looking but doesn&#x27;t fit very well in a medicine cabinet. So if you or your wife store the perfumes on a dresser or counter then this will be fine. It&#x27;s nice to display too. It doesn&#x27;t have your average look for a perfume.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, the smell of the perfume. I bought thus as a gift for my wife. When she wears it I want to devour her and sometimes I do! She loves the smell too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loved it.  The frangence last all day and the smell is intoxicatingly good.  I don&#x27;t know why all the single weman don&#x27;t use this product, it will attract guys like crazy.  I love the smell so much I tell my wife to ware this product to bed.  I will have to get her more if and when it runs out.  Get this product ladies.  Men will turn there heads.</li>
    <li> It occurred to me that this product from this vendor was a knock-off as the fragrance varied from samples I tried at local stores. The staying power differed also.  In addition, the spray emits mostly a stream rather than a spray which is annoying. After posting this review, I received a prompt response from the vendor. He assured me that the fragrance was authentic and offered to send me a replacement bottle.  I received the product quickly. The spray is still mostly a stream rather than a spritz but that&#x27;s tolerable.  I still don&#x27;t feel that the product has the staying quality that one I sampled from a local vendor seemed to have.  Discount Perfume offered to replace this new bottle if I remained dissatisfied.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order from this vendor again.  The customer service is outstanding!</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my daughter. she loves it.  the price on amazon was the best i could find.</li>
    <li> One of the best perfumes out in the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long so I end up overspraying before I go out.</li>
    <li> I first smell this scent on a woman in passing and had to get its name; hoping it smelled just as great on my better half.  I was very pleased to discovered how much more delightful it smells on her.  Great price for the size; this is the large bottle not the little purse size one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon holding my breath that it would be the real thing. I was just running out of my last bottle (purchased from sephora) and wasn&#x27;t crazy about paying full price for my next one. I rolled the dice with this purchase and luck was on my side! Now I did make sure to order directly from Amazon (not a third party seller) to hopefully avoid a knockoff. It showed up a few days later - authentic box sealed in cellophane, undamaged and fresh smelling. The smell was identical to my last bottle! I was one happy girl! This is my new place to order my favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love this scent on my wife. It&#x27;s sweet and clean smelling and compliments her very nicely. The bottle is a little over the top though.</li>
    <li> Great price, incredible scent.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love it.</li>
    <li> THIS PERFUME SMELL SO GOOD WENT TO THE MALL SMELL IT FIRST THEM ORDER IT FROM AMAZON SMELL THE SAME  THE BEST SMELL EVER THANK YOU AMAZON</li>
    <li> Great size love it would buy again later down line. Also a great smell loving it. Also get great complaments</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume for my wife to wear</li>
    <li> It smells great, but seemed very watery.  Not sure if it is authentic.  When I tested it at Macy&#x27;s it didn&#x27;t seem this way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because I love the way it makes her smell. She just happens to also like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent. As always, Marc Jacobs creates a fresh, light scent that is tantalizing without being overpowering. Great summer scent, but not so fruity that it reminds of you of a teenage girl. My only problem is that this fragrance has ZERO staying power. And I mean NONE. It lasts an hour, perhaps two. I&#x27;ve stopped using this as a perfume mostly because it&#x27;s almost gone by the time I get to any event. Rather, I spray it on a damp washcloth (about 15 sprays) and then toss the washcloth in the dryer with my other clothes. Voila! Wonderfully scented laundry that holds the scent longer.</li>
    <li> The wing was broken and one of the lady bugs was off as well, but I don&#x27;t blame the dealer. It&#x27;s just the way the perfume sits inside the box. It couldn&#x27;t be helped when it was shipped. Still smells great!</li>
    <li> This has a great fragrance to it but doesn&#x27;t seem to have staying power but I like it. I just use a tiny bit more during the day. The bottle design very pretty.</li>
    <li> The product bottle came broken. I was very disappointed with the fact that it was broken and the bottle was a big part of the purchase</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume ! Pretty hard to open at first, then you get the hang of it. Doesn&#x27;t last really long but definitely a great scent.</li>
    <li> It was for my daughter and she likes it</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for a new perfume to be my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;, this one won by a mile!! I love that it&#x27;s soft smelling and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache or make me nauseous.</li>
    <li> FAKE.. Don&#x27;t purchase. Waste of money. No product number on bottom of perfume bottle</li>
    <li> My wife asked me for this for christmas, it was pretty expensive in the store so I looked on Amazon and got it for half the cost. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Good product but shipping not in time. 2 days off.</li>
    <li> Love the scent lived the price. The cap was broken but it didn&#x27;t detract from the scent so I still give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing. A little fruity but subtle. What was disappointing was that I received the bottle without the floral lid. The package was sealed with the plastic wrap but that can easily be replaced. I contacted the seller and they notified me that they could not take a return on perfumes and apologized for the missing lid and offered a 20% refund to my amazon account (I used a gift card). I decided to keep the perfume because it was completely full and I&#x27;m certain it was authentic. True to their word, I received a 20% credit to my account immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought a small bottle and loved this, so after finally running out, I bought a huge bottle! The smell stays throughout the day too. It&#x27;s not a fake bottle, at least mine isn&#x27;t &#x3D;) The price is great too. I have been buying it on my military base previously, but found this price is about the same as the base price &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> happy wife happy life</li>
    <li> This is a HUGE bottle. My box had cellophane completely wrapped around it so there&#x27;s no question it was brand new. Also, I was surprised by the package arriving a day early than ETA</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I am sorely disappointed. This does not smell like the fragrance I had tried on at the store whatsoever and makes me wonder if I bought a dupe. It lasted on my skin for 1 hr tops. Will most likely be returning...</li>
    <li> This perfume smelled just as great as when I smelled it at macys. ordered it from OCT trading because I checked it&#x27;s reviews and had lots of positive feed back only problem was when I received my perfume I opened it and one of the wings was broken glad I bought it for myself would&#x27;ve felt embarrassed if I were giving it as a gift but for the price and quality of the perfume I rate it a 5</li>
    <li> COMPLIMENTS... Lots of them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I get when I spritz this on. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I also love how both the smell and bottle have a&lt;br /&gt;rather youthful vibe. Very, very cute!</li>
    <li> Everything came right. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I really like the light scent of this perfume however it DOES NOT LAST! After less than one hour the scent is gone. TOTALLY gone. I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay full retail price...</li>
    <li> It smells young, sexy, fresh, flirty and its a must have! You won&#x27;t regret it. You really will love it!</li>
    <li> Was delivered super fast!  Almost half the price compared to the department store.  One of the petals was broken off of the bottle when I opened up the package but I am still very happy with it!</li>
    <li> just as described.&lt;br /&gt;arrived new, unopened, etc. however, the red butterfly on the bottle had broken off (i guess during shipping or whatever)&lt;br /&gt;no big deal though... nothing superglue can&#x27;t fix (bottle&#x27;s sorta obnoxious in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; this perfume, by nature, is weak.&lt;br /&gt;I have the rollerball of this (from sephora), and even that only lasts temporarily (it&#x27;s honestly an hourly reapplication since it fades so fast). but it smells so good, and the price is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love Marc Jacobs&#x27; line of perfume. I was excited to try this one and I am very well pleased.</li>
    <li> The bottle is what makes this fragrance expensive. Not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes! It&#x27;s a crisp, clean fragrance that I get TONS of compliments on every time I wear it! It&#x27;s a decent price on amazon, a little cheaper than the department store. But if you have not tried it yet, get it! You will love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived in sealed box, I checked inside before gifting and the bottle was in perfect condition. My sister loves it and it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom&#x27;s birthday and the perfume is to die for. However the packaging was awful. The bottle had to much space and not enough wrapping so one of the large wings on the lid of the bottle broke off. As a matter of fact it looks like it&#x27;s been previously broken before and just glued back on.</li>
    <li> A bit sweet but it is nice</li>
    <li> This is nowhere near the type of perfume you would purchase in the department store or fragrance store. It smells watered down as well as I can put it on the morning and the smell is gone by mid morning. The last time I bought this, I purchased it straight from Belks department store and it would last all day and the smell was much stronger. I would always get compliments on the smell. I am NOT happy especially since I have wasted the $$ and I cannot rerturn it. I will NEVER buy perfume from here again. Very upset!</li>
    <li> When she puts I on I wanna eat her.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the perfum &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; being authentic and about how it &amp;#34;is&amp;#34;.  My honest opinion is; the perfum doesn&#x27;t seem to be authentic!  I sampled this perfum, for the first time, at Macys and I loved it.  I took a chance ordering it from here and I made a big mistake.  I was trying to save money and I end up wasting money.  I know perfums smell different on a person due to skin oils, sweat, and what now.  However, if you had sampled the same perfum before and lasted for nearly 16 hours, smelled fantastic on you, and sprayed nicely, then that&#x27;s exactly what you expect to get.  That&#x27; not what happened with this perfum! I showered, applied the perfum in the following areas: behind ears, inner-side of wrist... (I know how to apply perfum).  The flow was a stream instead of a mist spray.  The perfum lasted tops 20 minutes... Very dissatisfied! Buy at your own risk. I gave the perfum away to my niece; I figure a teen can get by with a little less...  I hated the perfum, and I hate shipping stuff back. (unbias opinion)</li>
    <li> Not sellers fault, it just didn&#x27;t smell as I remembered in the store so it&#x27;s sitting cute with all of the others ones I&#x27;ve fallen out of love with :/</li>
    <li> Smells great but like other reviews the scent does NOT stay at all! Disappointed</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife after we smelled it on a Disney Cruise ship.  Very nice fragrance!</li>
    <li> I want a return this item, it a fake perfume smells like alcohol, this is not an original perfum. I want  my money back!!!</li>
    <li> Love this item!!! Smells great, perfect packaging.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, Great price here on Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the bottle is adorable. The price was the best I have found.</li>
    <li> nice fragrance. the one i ordered from amazon never arrived</li>
    <li> Came by mail on time, packages nicely. I haven&#x27;t opened it yet because it&#x27;s a Christmas present for my mom, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented on how nice the fragrance is on me.  It&#x27;s suttle and inviting.  Kind of a &#x27;come hither.&#x27; While in the Bahamas I was tempted to buy it, but opted for Hugo Boss which is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half of the black wings on the top were broken.  The &#x27;Dot box&#x27;was wrapped in a lightweight tissue paper.  It probably would of faired better with bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it 5 as it didn&#x27;t take away from the fragrance itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and was very embarrassed when it was opened infront of me and one of the petals was broken. The item was wrapped very well for shipping so it must have been broken before shipping.</li>
    <li> First time trying a Marc Jacobs fragrance and I&#x27;m a believer goof forward. Purchased Oh La la for my mom and she is now in love as well.</li>
    <li> Good price point &amp; just love this fragrance!!!!</li>
    <li> excellent, it met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;thanks you</li>
    <li> Great fragrance to have!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Came packaged and sealed - obviously brand new.  Love the scent!  Perfect for summer!</li>
    <li> This came in handy as a great gift. Would recommend. Smells great. Also, if you want to surprise someone with a nice fragrance. This is the one!</li>
    <li> Got free samples from NYFW. Smells HEAVENLY and feminine. Not too strong or overpowering. I can wear this all day long.</li>
    <li> The bottle was broke. open on Christmas bottle was broke wings broke off. she does not want to send back likes perfume</li>
    <li> Dot was my first Marc Jacobs perfume purchase and he has me and my daughter hooked. This was a replacement bottle for my daughter as she went through her first bottle within four months. I love the softness of this perfume and how light the scent is. We will definitely keep buying this one.</li>
    <li> Really loved this scent on the sample , but quite disappointed after purchasing the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the elaborate bottle is very cheaply made - the wings broke off in transit already.&lt;br /&gt;I thought, OK, no big deal - who needs them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I put a little spray on my wrists and when my daughter came in maybe an hour later, I asked her if she&lt;br /&gt;likes my new perfume ... she asked - what perfume ? Really , there was hardly any scent left.&lt;br /&gt;Hmm..what exactly did I pay for ? A funky bottle ?..that didn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
    <li> It smells different from what I tried in malls</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Excellent price!</li>
    <li> Did some covert sniffing in Ulta, and picked this up online for 35%. Something new for the wife is</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Wow is all I have to say about this scent !!!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is awsome looking too !!!&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a &amp;#34;Red Door&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;Sunflower&amp;#34; kinda gal...if that helps at all.&lt;br /&gt;She really Likes it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  It smells really nice.  I wanted to write a review, because i saw a few people received theirs with the flower petals broken off.  I did not have this problem, and I received mine promptly.</li>
    <li> Another great fragrance from Marc Jacobs! Dot is very feminine and sophisticated, with notes of berries, jasmine, and vanilla, among others. It&#x27;s more floral/musky than fruity, which i like, and it&#x27;s a very unique fragrance. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> gave this to daughter. It was twice the amount (weight) of the bottle she was alreay looking to buy at a lesser price. She loves it and that makes me happy. Excellent price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  I highly recommend plus it&#x27;s a lot cheaper here than at the store.  Plus everyone loves it,  I&#x27;ve received compliments.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells sweet and the bottle is just adorable. Amazon has the best price on this item. I love it!</li>
    <li> very fresh, fruity and sweet. also long lasting. I usually use it in the morning and the fragrance stays the same until the afternoon.</li>
    <li> love the scent soft smell</li>
    <li> love it smells great n it came on time</li>
    <li> Wonderful gift for my daughter!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Much cheaper than the store and is genuine in every aspect.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Just as described. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Very nice smell. She loved it. It was approximately $40 cheaper through Amazon. The perfume usually runs $95 To $99  from Ulta for a 3.7 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> She loved it!  She asked for it</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, and way less then I could get it for in stores.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and my wife loved it for Christmas.  Same exact packaging s ones in&lt;br /&gt;department store and about 1/3 less or more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; person but I am definitely loving the Marc Jacobs Dot scent, it&#x27;s light, fresh and slightly sweet, perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is pretty much all the rage right now.  Everyone who smells it thinks it&#x27;s wonderful!  I would describe the scent as \\&quot;sweet.\\&quot;  Plus, that bottle just looks AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the stuff, came super quick.</li>
    <li> A great deal...it was cheaper than the store price.  However it was a new bottle, unopened.  I would recommend this for anytine who wants a good clean smelling perfume.</li>
    <li> I absoulutely do love it..the only complaint is that the scent, which is incredible, doesn&#x27;t last very long. I put it on before work at 7:30 am and by noon its fading fast. I only wear it now out to dinner or to church</li>
    <li> I got a small sample of this perfume from Sephora and immediately liked it. Amazon had it not only cheaper, but with Prime shipping, which I love. I received the package fast, but I&#x27;m going to give this review only 4 stars b/c one of the cute butterflies on the side of the bottle had broken off in shipping. I don&#x27;t mind it terribly, since it&#x27;s not for smell not show, but I would have liked to have the bottle completely intact.</li>
    <li> My wife wears this every day. I love it&#x27;s scent and the bottle is pretty too. This is the second bottle we&#x27;ve bought and probably won&#x27;t be our last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why but it is a prime product but it does not have 2 day shipping.</li>
    <li> Not like other MJ scents in his collection. It&#x27;s on the deeper side of things so some people might not like it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had a sample of this on her desk that she would smell all the time.  I figured this would be a perfect gift.  She didn&#x27;t like it from the moment she opened the box.  I ended up giving it to my sister as a freebee.  Turned out to be a disappointing and expensive Bday present</li>
    <li> My girl likes the product...but when she opened up the box one of the charms fell off the bottle</li>
    <li> Perfect new perfume at discounted price. Beyond satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. The smell is wonderful. I first found this in Maces , after an hour of searching for a perfume both me and my children could agree upon. We ended up agreeing Dot would be a great smell for their mother. Well she loves it, but I must admit I love it more.  Every time I smell it on her I just want to be close so I can bury my face close to her neck and smell her. Thank you seller for making the big bottle affordable it was a perfect I&#x27;m sorry gift as she was running out of her little bottle we got a year ago.</li>
    <li> Great value for money. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! It is the best i&#x27;ve had in a while and it really does last all day. I constantly smell it on myself, which makes me happy. The smell is so delicious, it has a fruity sweet scent, but is not overpowering in any way.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It smells great and you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price! Everything from the shipping to the product exceeded expectations!</li>
    <li> really like it ! Packed good, and this product is adorable!&lt;br /&gt;I hope to own more of this kind of perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>
    <li> the wings are broken!&lt;br /&gt;i am so upset.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing feminine, floral scent perfect for summer but beware who u purchase this from because i had bought this earlier at macys at quite a pricy amount so when i saw it on amazon at this price i jumped at it thinking i was getting a good deal. But if you buy this from IPICKBEAUTY then your in for huge problems cause these folks are selling watered down fake perfumes. My advice is try a different seller on here like amazon.com or one of the others.</li>
    <li> Seductive scent and beautiful bottle. Fast shipment. I love this fragrance and would definitely recommend it to any man looking for a gift.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers before me have stated, this bottle came with the two large wings broken off. Even though I knew it might happen, this is just NOT okay! The wings don&#x27;t even fit back the same, as if they&#x27;re from a completely different bottle altogether, whic makes me feel like it&#x27;s a fake!! The scent also doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as the real one and has NO staying power! I should have bought it from the store where I know it&#x27;s real.</li>
    <li> This is a very fruity fragrance, that really does last you 5-6 hours. I get compliments each time I wear this scent!</li>
    <li> Great gift for my daughter, she loves Marc Jacobs Dot perfume and super speedy shipment, thanks for a great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance - was a replacement for fragrance I had been using for years - so it was a long process to find another scent.  The only thing though is I&#x27;m not a fan of the bottle shape - really the top - there are times I like to take my fragrance with me when I travel and the shape is just so awkward and difficult to pack.  But if you are looking for a scent that is not over the top floral this is it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
    <li> Best price I could find.  Same as the stuff in the stores for much less.  As others have mentioned this scent is flowery and kind of sweet, so it&#x27;s best for a young woman in my opinion.  My teenage daughter found this and liked it.  I gave it to her for her birthday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never buy perfumes at a department store ever again. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Love it!  So happy with this purchase &amp; Amazon was so quick in shipping my new bottle to me after there was a problem with the original order!!  Kudos to you Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was perfect and was delivered exactly when it said it would be. I love it!</li>
    <li> smells great and lasts all day. i had it shipped regular and had it like the next day.  awesome!  great job folks</li>
    <li> Gave as gift to ex in law, great fragrance. Should have kept it.</li>
    <li> If you like sweet florals very similar to Lauren by Ralph Lauren, you will like this one as they are very similar.  Dot&#x27;s bottle is just too adorable!  Great addition to the perfume table.</li>
    <li> Loved it! The bottle is beautiful and huge, it will last forever! Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance...too bad the ladybugs wings were broken off.  It was a gift for my daughter and she decided the packaging didn&#x27;t effect the fragrance but Marc Jacobs makes such a big deal about the package it was unfortunate.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this perfume as a gift for my wife - she absolutely loves this fragrance. Every time we go out she gets a lot of compliments and questions about it. Sadly this time Amazon did an awful job with the protective packaging in the shimpment, as the cap of the bottle that resembles a butterfly was broken. Luckily she still had the cap from the previous bottle.</li>
    <li> The only problem was that the cap of the bottle was completely broken and the ladybugs on the side and front labels were also broken.  At least it still smelled the same but all of the things that make the packaging cute were broken</li>
    <li> Perfume is great. Part of the cap was broken upon receiving it. Does not affect the product but we all like our pretty bottles.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancee as a Christmas gift and she loved it! Her favorite Marc Jacobs scent so far!  I couldn&#x27;t believe the size of the bottle for the price I paid!  This bottle would have been $90+ easily at the mall! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! I will purchase this again...and again...and again.</li>
    <li> I have full faith and trust in Amazon products. I ignored the reviews prefering to keep my faith in Amazon, but the perfume i received was indeed a fake perfume. I love Amazon products, prime and their customer service. It&#x27;s a shame this product was completely unsatisfactory. I&#x27;m going to have to buy it locally to be sure I receive an authentic fragrance.  First time this has happened to me. But please keep in mind there should be a label at the bottom of the bottle with Marc Jacobs information on it, as well as the fragrance lasts a long time. I sprayed it in the store and woke up smelling it on my shoulder and decided to purchase this as I loved the smell.</li>
    <li> My wife love it, excellent purchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too floral for my preference.  I smelled it one time only then purchased online.  Wish I would have purchased the Marc Jacobs So Fresh perfume instead.  The bottle is adorable though.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, the smell is light and not overpowering like other perfumes&lt;br /&gt;Price here is awesome compared to other major retailers</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes!</li>
    <li> I bought the item as a late Christmas gift and when it arrived the top of the bottle was broken just like many other people here have said. The scent seems to be original. While it would have been nice to receive the item like it was designed to be seen, I&#x27;m glad that I was offered a replacement or refund without even asking. Just wish that the known issues with keeping the bottle from breaking was addressed.</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but love the smell!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent, different from anything I&#x27;ve tried. I love it!!! Wish it lingered just a little bit longer, but I just re-apply!</li>
    <li> Had tried this in stores, but could not get a sample to try for more than one shot. Couldn&#x27;t resist the good pricing and am not .</li>
