<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This shaver is great. It cuts close and hold its charge well. I&#x27;ve got two and have had my first one for 5 years and it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea razors for many years and I have never had a problem with them.  My last one lasted over three years before the battery began to give out.  This razor is light, very easy to handle and use and it gives a very close shave.  I recommend this razor for anyone looking for a good wet/dry razor.</li>
    <li> Remember the first time when you started shaving - maybe you were 14, 15 or 16 ?  It was a struggle isnt it - specifically around the neck area and then you learnt and became a pro.    Learning to use a Electric shaver is something like that - you need to go through a learning curve.  I am going to first talk about electric shavers and then about this particular model    Let us get to the basics : Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)    Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs let us say you skip to shave over a holiday then start shaving on Monday morning. Foil shavers are faster and easier to adapt to, but there are a few downsides - foils are difficult to clean since the hair gets trapped in the inner chamber and foil shavers give you more burn compared to rotary blades.     I personally like Rotary shavers, and also more first time users are likely to stick to rotary blades compared to foils.     Norelco HS8420/20:   - Moisturizer is really nice thing to have - without a good moisturizer, you might get razor burns    - of the 3 heads, 2 of them dispenses out the moisturizer whenever you press a button  - Gives a close smooth shave - give your self about 3-4 weeks to get used to it   - Easy and comfortable to hold and operate  - Dual voltage charge to take it wherever you want to     After using it for a couple of weeks - I learnt something - which philips may not really recommend :   Apply any of of the shaving gels and work up a lather (I use Nivea) and then dispense only small quantities of the moisturizer on your skin.  This, I found to be the best way to save a few $s (by not buying less of the nivea refill) and also a very smooth and close shave.    Try this and let me know how it goes :)    Overall - a good value for your money, smooth close shave as long as you are willing to spend some time in learning how to use an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own this one but I do have the Braun Freeglider, which had a similar skin-conditioner gimmick, long-since discontinued. Do you really want some lotion applied before you are completely finished shaving? Plus it adds to the expense, especially once the mfgr DROPS the item and you have to search for parts. That is what happened to me. The Braun razor by itself still works fine, I should note.</li>
    <li> This is a highly rated product from Phillips Norelco and it truly is worth the experience moving from being a razor shaver to a electric razor shaver. Please take into consideration that once you use this product under wet conditions along with any available shaving cream of your choice (my choice being Proraso Shaving Cream), other than the advertised Nivea products, it will still work great and perform to its best quality in producing a close shave than you would have ever expected. Do not use this electric razor in \\&quot;dry\\&quot; conditions as you may bruise your face and even minimize the life of the blades since it was meant to perform at best in a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would not give you the desired results in all of your facial areas but that is why I still keep my little razor blade handy to get those tight spots and lining the sideburns and mustache. Mind you the HS8420 is not the PERFECT product neither can you decide to get RID of the razor blades  since they&#x27;ve been around for ages and still have an important role to play in your daily shave - let them just compliment each other.</li>
    <li> I got this razor for my husband, who loves it!  The Nivea cream keeps his face soft and unirritated.  I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002GJU2XI Philips Norelco HS8420 Nivea for Men Razor]]  Despite its peculiar appearance, this model outperforms the previous Cool Skin Nivea Norelco shavers (which I&#x27;ve used for a long time).  Since I have a Norelco-conditioned face, I needed no breakin period EXCEPT:    The user manual tells you to wet your face before shaving.  I used my prior Norelcos on  a wet face, so this was no problem EXCEPT:    I couldn&#x27;t feel the lotion spray on my wet face, and I exhausted the shaving conditioner cartridge on each of my first shave and second shave.  This could get expensive!    I started my next shave on a dry face, and I could feel the lotion spray and judge how much was needed.  I got three shaves before I had to refill the cartridge, and these shaves were closer than I had ever received on previous Cool Skin models, with no facial irritation.    Because of the open construction I could hear my whiskers being cut, and it now takes a longer time to get them all, but the closeness of the shave deserves the extra time.    For you wet-faced shavers, two applications of lotion are needed for left side face and neck, two more for right side face and neck, and two more for chin and front neck.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a great shave. Only thing I wish it had is a sideburn trimmer. I use it in the shower. Leaves face nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to order this product. However, after using it for a few times, I realized that, it is not as good as I expected. Takes a lot of time to shave and burns my skin, even with the moisturizer. Also, the biggest mistake I made is that I did not notice before buying that it does not have trimmer for sideburns. Bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, if someone wants a cheap shaver, like me, and expects not much, this is not a bad choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for the past 20 years. I&#x27;ve gone through some of the most prominent (and expensive) brands always with average results. I discovered the Philips Norelco three years ago in Europe -- and thank God I did! My skin can take abuse but there&#x27;s a limit to everything. With past razors, I would end up with a face in need of major post op work: after shave, cremes, lotions, baby powder etc. With this one, shaving takes under five minutes and a splash of after shave will do. The actual shave is as close as the one with those old barber&#x27;s razors, sharp as butcher&#x27;s knives, my grandfather used to deploy. If you prefer, you can shave in the shower: the Philips is designed to work with water all over. Just rinse under hot water for 30 seconds afterwards. As to the Nivea add-on, I don&#x27;t use it because I have discovered I have better results with any pre-shave lotion. Great product! Now I can shave twice daily.</li>
    <li> This item was ordered as a replacement for the same razor that had recently been damaged. The product arrived exactly as described. The person who I purchased the gift for seems very content with the purchase. The shave could be a little closer, but overall no real complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to specifically shave in the shower and it works great.  I have been using it exclusively now for about four weeks on my medium tough beard and it&#x27;s performed flawlessly.  It comes with a a lubricating system dispensing Nivea product but I have found other shave lubricants that work just as well so I don&#x27;t use the built in system.  It&#x27;s a nice feature though and it works great.  You have to purchase the Nivea cream in a dispenser and I don&#x27;t feel like ordering it special online.  You do need to use a lubricating cream vs a soap type product, it only requires a very small drop to cover your face the required amount for a smooth shave. Remember to move it slowly across your face to give it a chance to work, it&#x27;s not like a razor.  Great product &#x3D; very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a Panasonic (Model ES81532) electric razor for the last eight (8) years with good results but this Norelco beats it by a long margin.&lt;br /&gt;It has far sharper blades and requires a lot less pressure on the skin. My first shaves irritated my neck greatly and learned to back off on the pressure. Now I have mastered it and get faster and cleaner shaves with lighter touch.&lt;br /&gt;A two day old beard growth is almost as easy as a one day growth with this baby.&lt;br /&gt;My brother has one just like this and has been using it for over a year with great results also.&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea shaving cream is a great idea and works very well but I am used to Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave liquid since I constantly check how close the shave is in every area with my free hand and apply a little more pressure where needed.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is much quieter but it&#x27;s not underpowered since the revolutions of the blades is what cuts the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy and love it!</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco HS8420/20 Nivea for Men Razor is the best razor I have ever tried.  Not only does it give you a really, really close shave but you have the much needed relief from razor burn from the Nivea lotion that comes out from the head.  The razor is easy to use, set up and take care for.  Run the razor head underneath running water for about 30 seconds will get rid of the facial hair stubble that will collect inside the blades.  You can easily add lotion to the razor by using a special applicator that will inject into the handle.  The razor will charge for 6 to 8 hours and you&#x27;ll get an 30 minute charge.  It&#x27;s not necessary to leave it plugged in after charging.  I was highly impressed with how good it worked and I really enjoyed the nice, smooth and clean shave I received from it.  If you want a high quality electric razor then look no further because this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest recommendation possible.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and I made sure he used it for at least 2 weeks before he decided to give an honest review. According to him it does give a close shave but still not as good as a manual would and would he be willing to pay the money for the refills, no way he says. He does like the dispenser but it&#x27;s not worth it. He doesn&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin so there were no irritations. It&#x27;s lightweight enough and a big plus is that it&#x27;s waterproof so it can be used in the shower. Would have gotten 4 stars if it weren&#x27;t for those expensive refills.</li>
    <li> First I would like to thank the awesome Mr. Tony at Amazon.com customer service. He really helped me out of a bind. When the first razor I ordered got lost by the USPS he straightend everything out and had a replacement shipped 2nd day air via UPS. Thank you Tony!    Now, I bought this razor for my boyfriend, and he had reservations about it. Why so cheap? Why didn&#x27;t it come with a side burn trimmer? Etc. Well, he got it out of the box and it was brand new and had all the doodads and whistles. He charged it for 80 minutes. Now, before I go on I should mention he has pretty coarse hair and has very sensitive skin and so its a challenge to find something that&#x27;ll give him a good close shave that lasts, without irritation. Anyway, he charged the thing for 80 minutes (So impatient.) and then shaved his face, dry, without the conditioning cream. It took him 45 seconds, and he didn&#x27;t have to go over it anymore but to be \\&quot;Sure\\&quot; he kept at it for two minutes. The result? It was the closest, smoothest shave he has ever had, and there was not one bit of skin irritation. He loved it. He doesn&#x27;t have to shave as often because the razor gives him a VERY close shave, and it doesn&#x27;t take him as long. As for the beard/side burn trimmer? He didn&#x27;t need it the razor shaved, and sculpted those just fine. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for over 40 years and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  Because my face and neck is sensitive, regular blade razors would nick me too much.  I&#x27;ve used the Norelco Nivea razors ever since they came out and really liked how my face felt after shaving.  I thought my last Nivea razor gave me a nice shave but it doesn&#x27;t compare to this one.  I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to try this design but I got it as a Christmas present.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it is to use and no stubble left anywhere on my neck.  The lotion may be a little expense to use but it sooths the skin and lets the razor slide over the face and neck with no irritation.  I will never go back to a dry razor again.</li>
    <li> The HS8420 works as advertised. I bought this item because I really wanted the Nivea dispenser, but in my opinion my 7 year old Philips razor did a marginally better shaving job.  Specifically I have to press harder and go slower with the HS8420 to get the same results so it takes me a couple of minutes more to shave.  Not a big deal since the end result is good.</li>
    <li> I admit that I only got this razor for those times I&#x27;m away from home at a friend&#x27;s place. It&#x27;s a great little electric. Does what it does well.     There is no way to do tight spots like under my nose and above my mustache. There is no way to easily work around things like beards. It is primarily for clean shaven folks. Fortunately, it does a great number on my head.     I wish it worked better without the goop.     It is a wet shaver, working best with a damp/wet head/face. It is not really designed to work on a dry face/head. It will work but not as well.    It is very easy to clean (and I&#x27;d recommend you clean it EVERY TIME you use it). Nice fit in the hand.    Great battery life. Rechargeable. Norelco quality (in other words still uses that spinning circle of blades). Virtually NO weird grabbing or irritation.     Recommended for guys with shaved heads and clean cut faces.</li>
    <li> this the best shaver i&#x27;ve owned yet.price was right and the size of the shaver fits just right in your hand.the blades spin qickly and shave very close. this thing it easy to clean after each use.</li>
    <li> This is not my first venture into the wet/dry shaver arena.  My first was the Panasonic series (single and dual blade) but those models left me cold (and irritated from razor burn).     I opted to try the Philips Norelco because I got it for $25 from a deep discount store that was going out (the one I ordered from Amazon is a back up).     For those of you using Panasonic models and thinking of jumping ship, there is a huge difference and I&#x27;m not talking about just the lotion, although that is nice.     First, 3 heads most definitely shave better than the Panasonic single or dual system.  There were times that the Panasonics left me raw and although they claimed a simple water wash would clean the blades it just didn&#x27;t hold true.  I always had to remove the foil and get the brush out to get rid of hair clogged in between the blades.     Second, the Panasonics can be used with shaving gels or creams but you have to really clean the head or it will cake and harden.     Finally, this model is whisper quiet compared to the Panasonics and shaves without irritation.  I could tell the difference when applying after shave and not getting the burn I had become accustomed to with the Panasonic. The buzz from the Panasonic was so loud others in the house could hear it but nobody knows I&#x27;m using the Philips.     As for shave quality, the Philips does shave a little closer than the Panasonic although the head will have to be replaced about the tenth month.  A year, as the manufacturer recommends, is pushing it.     Is it blade close?  Surprisingly, yes.  I get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow long about 2 pm either way so it does shave as close as a blade.     A charge is good for about a work week&#x27;s worth of shaves and about the only thing lacking is a trimming blade, but that&#x27;s because the back portion is used to house the lotion container.     Can you shave without the lotion?  Most definitely and several times I&#x27;ve just used shave gel and nothing else.  If nothing else, the lotion in the unit makes a quick after shave balm if you&#x27;re in a hurry.     Unfortunately, lotion cost is rather prohibitive at about $6 a bottle but I&#x27;ve found it as low as $2 at Walgreens and the like when they get overstocked.</li>
    <li> This is a first look only since you&#x27;re supposed to give your skin 3 weeks to adapt to the razor, I&#x27;ll add more later as time goes by.  Out of the box it was much lighter than I had expected and was easy to hold.  I loaded it up with the lotion and charged it over night.  Used it in the shower where I usually shave with a Mach 3 power wand.  It was very comfortable and the lotion dispenser seems to work fine.  It comes out of the center of the top two rotating heads.  The lotion itself has a very faint scent of Nivea, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s noticeable to anyone else.  Shave went fine, no pulling or irritation afterwards.  Definitely not as close as a blade yet, but I was a little leary of going too hard first time out.  Some adapting over time will be necessary. I&#x27;m used to being able to shave by feel and know the sideburn cutoff with a blade easily.  It&#x27;s tougher with the round head to get a sense of what&#x27;s done and if there&#x27;s a clean, straight line.  Overall the impression was good.  I&#x27;m assuming the shave will get a little closer.  Still up in the air regarding the convenience factor verses a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it a while now and am still pleased overall.  The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that pumping out the lotion is a bit of a drag.  You have to do it several times during the shave instead of just lathering up once. Not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I normally shave with a regular safety razor, the 4-bladed kind. One day while shaving, I thought to myself, \\&quot;This is fine, but how could I shave in a way that is more expensive, takes a lot more time, uses more energy, is worse for the environment, and yet doesn&#x27;t work as well and is vastly more irritating to my skin?\\&quot; Luckily, the answer was close at hand: the Norelco \\&quot;Nivea for Men\\&quot; razor. This baby meets all my requirements, and then some. It only works with lotion sold in a special injector bottle, and you need a great deal of it. The rechargeable batteries supply little power to the anemic motor, so it takes forever to cut through my beard, and even then, it leaves an intolerable length of stubble behind. It&#x27;ll run for less than 30 minutes per charge, and if you&#x27;re lucky you&#x27;ll get three shaves out of that, so expect to have this thing plugged in all the time, drawing current. It really only works in the shower, so you&#x27;ll also use a lot of extra hot water standing there trying to get your stubble off.    And by the third day, my face felt like hamburger. The instruction book actually warns that this will happen, and insists that you need to give yourself a month to get used to a new way of shaving. Sorry, but I think after a month I&#x27;d look like the elephant man -- a hairy elephant man.    One final note: unlike many electrics, this razor has no trimmer, so you&#x27;ll need a safety razor to clean up your sideburns or other edges. All in all, this is the worst grooming device of any kind I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it.  This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned.  1st one lasted 5-6 years before it would no longer charge.  Love the built in Nivea Cool Skin Moisturizer dispenser.  Close shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for about a month. The one thing that I do like about this razor is that I can use it in the shower. But... it does not provide a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a month now, and I will admit I was a bit skeptical about the whole 21 day challenge that Norelco poses.  I have to admit that it was a bit difficult to not use anything else to shave during this time period but I have to say that I am glad I didn&#x27;t because I have noticed a difference in the closeness I get with the razor now.  I will continue to use it exclusively and hopefully it will only get better.</li>
    <li> This wet-dry rotary is superb! After years with wet-dry linears (Panasonics-good) I tried a cheap $5 rotary and was amazed -- so I bought the world&#x27;s only wet-dry rotary -- this Norelco -- and I am so pleased. I use it with shaving cream. Amazon&#x27;s price the best.</li>
    <li> Shaves as close as a blade razor, no nicks or bites, even on the occasional 2 days growth.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now, and it&#x27;s easily the best electric shaver I have ever used.  At this price, I&#x27;m thinking of buying a second one as a spare before they pull it off the shelves..</li>
    <li> Excellent performance.  I have had Norelcos in the past.  Decided on a Remington, based on CR review.  Had it a few months and now will donate to a charity.  This model is superb.</li>
    <li> Right off the bat, I was uncertain if this razor worked right.  It seemed to rotate terribly slow but I didn&#x27;t know anyone who had one to compare with.  I did like the Nivea system as it made for a comfortable shave.  But it never seemed to do a very good job.  Lately, it has gotten much less effective.  I suspect that the heads are already dull which is crazy because it&#x27;s only 15 months old and I do not have a heavy beard at all.  I have cleaned it several times with hot water but it doesn&#x27;t help.  Now, I use the razor to spread the Nivea shaving conditioner and then I shave with a regular safety razor.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> After many years... perhaps too many... and often times even shaving with a straight-edge, I decided to go with modern times and try friends and relatives suggestions about Norelco products. I bought the Nivea, tried it and found it a very pleasant experience. And extremly close, as well. I bought one for my best friend and now he uses one,too. Ah, the wave of the future.</li>
    <li> First off let me tell you never use the nivea moisturizer, go to any store and buy you a tube of Neutragena skin clearing shave cream. Next jump in the shower apply the shaving cream after you wash your face and let the norelco do it&#x27;s thing. I could not beleive how smooth the shave was and when i was done i applied thayer&#x27;s witch hazel after shave and i didn&#x27;t feel even the slightest stinging or burning it was that delicate on my face. Excellent job norelco excellent. For those that have course dark curley hair this is the thing for you give it a try I think you&#x27;ll be happy with the results just use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a gift for my husband.  He&#x27;s been using it for a month now and loves it.  Using his old razor was causing redness on his face and neck which is not happening now with this new razor.  I also ordered the replacement head and lotion refill which means he is set for almost a year.  A very good deal.</li>
    <li> Four EFFICIENT  Stars!!  I bought my first electric shaver, years ago, to get around water/cream shaving during Army field exercises and overseas deployments: it failed. I have unsuccessfully kept trying to find one over the years, testing my Dad&#x27;s many different types of electrics. This one WORKS: it efficiently chops down the beard to skin level, leaving smooth results almost as good as a blade shave. No break-in period and no irritation!! The independent floating heads and the creamy Nivea shaving conditioner, manually dispensed through 2 ports within the blade pods, help a great deal. But there 2 drawbacks: no pop-up trimmer and it takes 3 times as long to shave, with repeated passes over areas: about 6 minutes. 8-hour charge time for 30 minutes of shaving. Easy cleaning: daily or monthly; easy conditioner loading, low noise level. On a daily basis, I&#x27;ll continue to use my vibrating Gillette electric Mach3 shaver at home, but this Philips Norelco is now my road shaver &amp; for evening office touchups. Four SURPRISING Stars. (One Philips Norelco shaver, 1 can of Nivea For Men Irritation Control Shaving Conditioner, a flimsy charging base, charging cable, cleaning brush, and instructions)</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s several reasons for wanting to use an electric shaver versus a blade. For me, it&#x27;s been speed and comfort - an electric is faster, easier and less messy than using a blade and shaving cream. But, a dry shave with an electric is not as ultra close as a blade shave. Close enough for me, but if you&#x27;re striving for the ultimate in closeness, you typically need to use a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco is one of the few electrics that will match the closeness of a blade but it comes at a price - time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a dispensing system where you push a button and it dispenses a small amount of Nivea cream. The Nivea is great stuff - very soothing, moisturizes, and has a nice, light scent. You wet your face first, then shave and push the dispensing button anytime you want some Nivea. The problem is, you need to dispense quite a bit of the stuff to get a comfortable shave, which gets pretty costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep the cost down and maintain high comfort levels, I use a gel-type shave cream first. Do one pass with the shaver, dunking it in water a couple of times to clear off the shave cream that builds up, then do a final pass using the Nivea. That keeps the Nivea use down to a small amount, but you still get the benefits of using the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting shave is as close, if not closer, than any blade shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s essential that you use a light touch when using the Norelco - press too hard, and you&#x27;ll get irritation, especially in the neck area. Also, you need to clean the head when you&#x27;re done or the dispensing tubes will get clogged with the Nivea. Not hard to do - just run it under hot water while it the razor is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is water proof, and can be used in the shower. It&#x27;s very similar to the previous model (8040 and related models), but with some improvements in ergonomics and overall design. The concept is the same, however, so if you can get older model at a discount, go for that instead of the newer model. The shave is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even think of shaving dry with this razor - you&#x27;ll tear up your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is decent. A lot more plasticy than a premium razor, but in line with the price charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to get the ultimate in closeness from an electric, you&#x27;ll be happy with this. If, however, you&#x27;re looking for speed and convenience, a dry shaver such as the Braun Series 5 or 7 should be on the short list. If you&#x27;re unsure if you want to shave dry or wet (or want to do both), the Panasonic Arc IV is an outstanding shaver that can be used in both modes.Don&#x27;t even think of shaving dry with this razor - you&#x27;ll tear up your face.

    <li> The most outstanding feature of this shaver is its comfort...but that comfort comes at a price. The shaver uses an innovative Nivea lotion dispenser that you pump into the body of the shaver. As you are shaving you press a button to dispense it. This works great for me. Produces a smooth, comfortable shave, I never have even the slightest bit of skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in other reviews, the manual does ask you to try the shaver for three weeks. I have and am very happy with how comfortable it is. But it still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor blade. I find the heads too big on my face to be effective in between my nose and lips so I still use a razor for that. Also I do find myself having to go over spots multiple times to get a trim to my satisfaction. On the other hand I have had electric shavers that cost more and have not performed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check the cost of replacement lotion on Amazon and draw your own conclusions. The lotion that came with it is running low after three weeks of use. I can use shaving lotion or gel a lot longer before they run out and they cost less. But the comfort really is outstanding. Sometimes my razor still leaves my face red, this one never has. My face feels GOOD after using this, and that is certainly worth something. Comfort is a 5+ but closeness of shave and cost of replacement lotion brings the overall to a 4.</li>
    <li> every time i shave with this shaver i get cut unlike other electric shavers that I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
    <li> Shaving is part of the daily routine for most men and there are numerous means to eliminate the unwanted hair, from ordinary hand razors to fancy electronic devices. Many people stick with hand razors because an open blade is considered the best way to achieve a close shave. But there are some good electric razors out there and the Philips Norelco Nivea Razor is one of them. This waterproof razor dispenses Nivea skin conditioner as you shave, for a more comfortable shave than that provided by most other electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this razor when I first heard about it, but I was quickly won over once I tried it out and realized its ability to provide a comfortable shave. Pressing one of the buttons on the front of the razor releases the moisturizing conditioner directly onto your skin and this provides a nice amount of moisturizing before shaving. This conditioner protects the skin from irritation and it&#x27;s very good for its ability to add comfort to the shaving process. Pressing the release button for just a few seconds is usually all it takes to release just the right amount of conditioner to protect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cutting ability of the Philips Norelco Nivea Razor, it is quite good and performs just as well, if not better than, most electric razors. However, there is a catch. The manual that comes with this razor advises that you need to allow your skin time to acclimate to this razor, and that this will typically take about three weeks. Based on my experience, this claim is accurate. When I first used this razor, I wasn&#x27;t that impressed. My skin was not shaved as closely as I like and I had to use a hand razor for touch- ups. But the more I used the razor, the closer the shave became. The comfort was good from the start, but the closeness didn&#x27;t come until later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is cordless and it charges by placing it in a small base. You need to be careful with this because, if the razor isn&#x27;t placed just right, it won&#x27;t charge. The razor doesn&#x27;t snap or lock into place- it just sits in the charging base. Unless the metal elements are touching just right, the charging will not commence. This is why you need to be careful and make sure that the blue light appears on the front of the razor, as proof that charging is taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still keep manual razors handy when I need the closest shave possible, but the Philips Norelco Nivea Razor is a very good razor for both convenience and performance reasons. The addition of Nivea conditioner makes for a more comfortable shave and the blades shave at an acceptable level of closeness, provided you exercise patience and allow your skin time to adjust. Finding replacement bottles of Nivea conditioner can be a challenge and this razor doesn&#x27;t work well on dry skin, but other than these handful of minor complaints, the Philips Norelco Nivea Razor is a good shaving device that earns an easy recommendation.t won&#x27;t charge.

    <li> I got this razor for my boyfriend because I freaked out one day when I walked in on him shaving. There was blood all over the sink and his face. He told me that it was always like that when he shaved. I researched and searched for an affordable shaver that was for sensitive skin. I came across this product and was extremely excited! It works well, and does not cut him :) The only thing that he doesnt like is that it doesnt give him that close close shave. after he uses this razor, he goes over his face with his old blade razor. Im very satisfied with the results and would highly reccomend this to others. The only problem I see, is that you cant really get a close shave with this.</li>
    <li> I have had several shavers and this one is one of the better ones for me as long as I use it in a certain way.  I have used it over the sink using the Nivea lotion, in the shower with the Nivea lotion and in the shower using good shaving cream instead. I have received the best shave by far and the most comfortable if I use this in the shower using good shaving cream like Edge Gel.  Easy, smooth and close.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a website recomendation for a head shave. I am now using a regular blade. Norelco is standing by it&#x27;s 45 day performance warranty and giving me a refund. With this guarantee I think you can try it, since it may work for you better than me.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it! Bear in mind he is no Wolfman Jack, but he does need to shave every few days. This is a close shave for him and the lotion is awesome, he has sensitive skin and he says the shave and lotion has \\&quot;little to no burn at all afterward\\&quot;, for him that is really good.  Not having to shave every day for a long period of time means the three lotion replacements we bought are going to last long awhile. My recommendation is to do \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; on both the replacement heads and lotion when you order it (I do that on everything that has the option - namely my son&#x27;s diapers) because you ALWAYS save a few dollars. You never are forced into being charged or paying a membership fee to do this. It&#x27;s well worth it!  Overall this is probably the best shaver he has ever owned. He really doesn&#x27;t need some $300 thing. For someone who just needs to clean up every so often, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good shaver! I was sick of my razor because of the ingrown hair that i had, but with the philips shaver it never happens again!  I got to admit, it was weird at first, but when the skin gets used to it I was able to get results that are even closer than my razor!  The shaving cream is a little problem because it would run out very fast and it is pretty pricy.. but this shaver is waterproof and it give a nice smooth shave in the shower with no problem.  Bottom line, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite explain why, but this one is simply more comfortable and cuts closer than the senso-touch line.  I don&#x27;t use the goo, just shave when I wash my face.  A charge lasts me a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the worst thing I ever spent money on.  Don&#x27;t even think about getting this worthless piece of crap.  I was able to return it for a full refund though so it wasn&#x27;t all bad I guess.</li>
    <li> Norelco and Nivea are both two very reliable brands, so combining the two for this razor is, as expected, a good idea. As with any electric razor, you&#x27;re not going to get as close a shave as if you use a real blade and shaving cream, but in my experience Philips Norelco razors are about as good as you&#x27;re going to find. The razor can be used in the shower, which is good if you have a fogless mirror, and the addition of the Nivea moisturizer does seem to relieve some (but not all) of the slight irritation that any electric razor can give. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. It&#x27;s an interesting idea, if nothing else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for over 20 years. I probably have had about 6-7 different models. This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve had. It shaves the closest and with less irritation(even without using the Nivea). I&#x27;ve tried all the latest big Norelco&#x27;s with the latest triple action spinning with multiple size holes and shock absorber pads. None of those compare with the ease of this shaver. Even with a long beard this shaver does not rip the hairs or pull them. The heads seem to float on your skin and conform to your face. The old school Norelco&#x27;s always had a rough quality to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minus I can give it is it doesn&#x27;t capture all the hairs. Besides that, it is by far the best Norelco I&#x27;ve had. Oh, and no trimmer.</li>
    <li> I had a previous Philips Razor machine. it was a good razor, but it was worn out. I was looking for an alternative of wet&amp;dry razor and this fulfilled perfectly to my expectations. with the Nivea product to minimize the irritation and possible rash, makes the perfect combination.</li>
    <li> the battery lasts for at least 10 days of use, the shave is closer than any razor i have ever used (including gillette fusion power)  the shaving conditioner is expensive but shaving gel can be used instead</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned electric shavers in the past but gave up on them due to my sensitive skin. For the past seven years I&#x27;ve been using blades. Along comes Philips Nivea For Men electric shaver so I figured I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t get it it. It takes over 20 minutes for me to shave because I have to keep going over the same area multiple times and I&#x27;m talking like 20 or 30 times before the hairs are gone. Not only that but the shave isn&#x27;t even close. I can shave with a blade in two minutes. This crap razor always takes 20?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you Philips, I will NEVER buy an electric razor again. If anyone wants an electric razor, I beg you to pass on this one. It&#x27;s not worth it. I wish I could give a negative rating on this one. Don&#x27;t even buy Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> As a long time Norelco shaver user this very reasonably priced shaver gives the best shave I have ever had. I don&#x27;t like the Nivea push button dispenser so I use Neutragena shave cream (purchased at my local supermarket) which I like better.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin contours, but the rotary blades left sandpaper, and to have to constantly refill the &#x27;goop&#x27; as I call it makes for an inconvenient and time consuming shave. Take it from me, stick with the 5 blade traditional razor; it shaves closer than any electric period. This rates 1 out of 5</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE A MANLY BEARD. The flat heads will not take care of tough beard- it&#x27;s good for adolescent</li>
    <li> Guys, please don&#x27;t waste your money on the marketed Nivea shaving gel. I have used an in-shower Norelco for over 10 years (2 previous models now extinct). I use to think you had to use this special gel, until the cost was killing me. I tried my old shaving gel and it worked even better than the preferred Nivea. Don&#x27;t use shaving \\&quot;foam\\&quot; though. It is too thick and will clog the razor heads or just fall off your face and provide no protection.    I mentioned this to the customer service folks at Norelco 2 years ago. I realize this is a marketing partnership and money is at stake here, but how many buyers have opted not to buy this product because of the cost-many if you read these reviews. The rep was curteous but I could tell this information would never make it to the public. Please, don&#x27;t fall for the Nivea only pitch. You can have a great wet shave with gel and save a lot of money over the years. Save your money to pay your taxes. Jim-Branson, MO</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, but I found myself going back to cheap blade razors after I ran out of the canned Nivea - which you will run out of in no time at all, as other reviews have said.  On top of that the shaving process is incredibly slow here.  In order to get a close shave I have to go over each side of my face two or three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for about a year and a half and it helps with my sensitive skin.  Less breakouts, less ingrown hairs.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I just love the way it shaves with the lotion.  This is my fourth Cool Skin shaver in the past 14 years..</li>
    <li> For about $80 complete it is good value BUT NO trimmer and no travel lock. It also tends to leak lotion during travel so put it inside a small plastic bag within your travel bag and avoid a mess. For lightweight overall very good, perhaps just buy a seperate trimmer if you dont need that to travel as well. First set of blades (head) only lasted 7 to 8 months -- not 12 as advertized. If the second head doesnt last any longer Im done with this shaver - $40 every 8 months ? Hoping Norelco comes up with a newer Nivea option more like they prior models. I&#x27;ve had the last 4 models, this is their cheapest/simpliest yet in that category. The others had trimmers, travel locks, didnt leak and blades lasted. Keep the pouches from your old ones as well.</li>
    <li> The Norelco razor has performed very well everyday. I shave twice a day and now no need to put on electric shave or anything. It dispenses a cream through the head that stops irritation and lubricates the blades. Can go in the shower and cleans up under running water. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and Amazon had it for a great price.</li>
    <li> basicallyit&#x27;s a good razor, but when u try to refill the lotion into the cartridgeit just easily overflows out from the head.</li>
    <li> I have been using the norleco wet razors for fiteen years and this one is similar to the previous Norelco wet razors which have always been excellent. I have tried a lot of products to replace the expensive HS800 lubricant cartridge and by accident my wife found the best product yet. It is the Nivea moisturizing Face Wash. For the shaving lubricant to work properly it must be non-greasy, water soluable, lubricating, and will not clog the razor. The moisturing face wash does all that better than the HS800 refill, is faster(less strokes) and a 5oz tube($4.50) will last a year. With the face wash it is as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> Before this I was using [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco SpeedXL 8240XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] for a few years (have been using Norelcos for a long time now; have tried Remington/Braun/panasonic shavers but Norelco&#x27;s rotary shavers work best for me).    I found this razor to be as good as 8240 SpeedXL in terms of shaving PLUS the convenient feature of   Nivea conditioner dispenser is great - I got a cool shave without any irritation whatsoever.     Shaver is very light, small (will be good for travel use) (on the other hand, have to wait and see how long this shaver will last!)    Even the charging light on the shaver looks better than older models    I have only 3 complaints with this shaver:  1. No hair trimmer attachment (as in SpeedXL line).  2. Since there is no compartment below the razor heads (there are holes below that in the casing), as you shave, cut hair starts falling down (so have to only shave over a sink (or in shower).  3. Nivea refills seem to be expensive!    Great shaver otherwise!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade shaver nearly all my life, but have always envied electric users, who seemed to take much less time than I did, what with the lathering up and all. I tried a top-of-the-line Braun about a year ago, shaved with it for a month, and returned it at the end of that time, finding that it didn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as a blade and lather, and it irritated my skin (neck in particular) as well. When I saw that the Vines program was offering this Norelco that gave you a wet shave with Nivea lotion, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Alas, it came in far behind the Braun. First of all, the motor seems underpowered, and it sounds almost like a toy. It was impossible to get a close shave, especially on my upper lip and chin, as well as sideburns and the neck under the ears. Didn&#x27;t do too badly on the rest of the neck, but it seemed I had to go over any area repeatedly to get even somewhat close to what I was used to, and the constant repetition caused irritation. The lotion dispenser sounds like a good idea, but you have to keep pressing the dispense button throughout the shave. The one thing it does it clean itself well. 30 seconds immersed in hot water (and turned on) and all the whiskers, lotion, and detritus are thoroughly removed. If you&#x27;re already an electric shaver user, you might want to give this one a try, but if you&#x27;re a blade user this won&#x27;t convert you. I may grab it occasionally when I need a quick (and dirty) shave to look semi-respectable, but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll expect of it.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for over 30 years. T his razor has open back cutter heads &amp; a really neat Nivea lotion dispenser which delivers the closest, cleanest, non-burning shave I have ever had!!!</li>
    <li> I use a Gillette Fusion Power blade system razor and Gillette Gel cream and nothing works better for me than blade shaving. Electric razors are simply too much trouble and this Norelco with Nivea dispensing is no different. No matter what gizmos or conditioners they add on, electric razors still will not equal blade razors, probably until they have the technology to have a million individually-programmable lasers to zap off your wiskers electronically. Until that day, blade shaving will always be superior, and also simpler, quicker and easier. Gillette Fusion is expensive, but the cartridges last a long time and all you need is regular shaving gel. Despite the Nivea dispensing this Norelco still will not work as well as even a Gillette Mach III cartridge system. I will stick with my Fusion system. I simply don&#x27;t like electric shaving systems, I like blade shaving. I don&#x27;t see that changing anytime in the forseeable future.</li>
    <li> Works much better than I expected. Gets very close, better than any razor and I have very thick fur :)    Use that nivea gel too, works better than shaving cream. I have used razors and electric for over ten years and imo always works best while in the shower.</li>
    <li> Trazor so far works OK but having owned Norelco razor before this one is not as sturdy and kind of chincy in comparison to the other shavers that I had before.TShe quality of the product went down to the point that I will no longer purchase either Philipps or Noresco brands</li>
    <li> For years I had been looking for an electric razor that would come close to being as good as a blade for shaving with no luck. About a year ago, I got the Cool Skin 8040X and that was the end of the blades!     The 8420 is pretty much the same razor with a few differences. The run and charges times are not the same so it must use a different battery system. One&#x27;s not better than the other, just different.  The 8420  razor comes with the charger, head cover, a cleaning brush, and a trial size can of Nivea conditioner.      The fact that it is a wet system intrigued me. It uses Nivea shaving conditioner, which is injected into the back of the razor.  A nice no mess system ... a spout on the conditioner bottle fits in the razor and injects the conditioner.  When shaving, you press a button and a few drops of gel comes up through the heads.  You wet your skin, press the button, and shave. The conditioner goes along way (still some left after 2 weeks of use and this is a trial size can).  If you run out, in a pinch you can use liquid soap just fine.      The razor also has a nice rubber grip that makes it easy to hold when its wet.  The charger is your standard wall unit that plugs into a plastic base. The razor sits in the base. Takes about 4 hours to completely charge.  The instructions say you should not leave it plugged in all of the time.    The head cover is a plastic cover to protect the blades; useful for traveling.  While you don&#x27;t have the high cost of the blades, you do have the expense of the Nivea lotion.  I usually get about a month out of a can. Also you will probably want to replace the blades(about $30.00) every so often (about once a year) to get the optimum shave.    The most important thing is the shave. It really does shave as close as the blades and shaving gel system I used to use. In fact, it&#x27;s so close you can still cut yourself!</li>
    <li> This razor has caused me a lot of frustration.  It&#x27;s my first electric razor, and I chose it because I thought it would cause less razor burn than I get with a Mach 3.  It didn&#x27;t work.  After 20 minutes of rubbing my face with this, and then needing to get out the Mach 3 anyway, I have more razor burn than ever.  I really wouldn&#x27;t mind if it left a little stubble, but I can&#x27;t get this thing to even do that.  It absolutely won&#x27;t cut hair.  I&#x27;ve read the instructions and tried everything.  Soft, hard, slow, fast, against the growth, in circle, etc etc etc.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to shave a huge beard either.  Just a day or two&#x27;s worth of stubble.  I think I could make more progress by rubbing a rock on my face.  I thought I was buying a quality product based on the reviews and the price.   It&#x27;s a was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This is my first wet razor after using a dry shave electric for a couple of decades. I loved it at first, and I still love the shave it gives. It&#x27;s much closer than any electric razor I&#x27;ve had before, including an expensive Braun that didn&#x27;t last 2 years. The lotion dispensing system gives a great gliding surface which makes it easy to get close and go over tough spots a couple of times without irritation. I&#x27;ve also used it with canned shaving cream applied directly to my face as some other reviewers recommended, and it did well too, though losing the convenience of the on-board lotion dispenser. Overall, it gives a great shave and the price is lower than most in this category, so I&#x27;d rate it highly for that.     Here&#x27;s the bad stuff, though. It seems they&#x27;ve gone to extra lengths to make the thing small, and in doing so have sacrificed capacity, both in the lotion reservoir and in the battery life. Using enough lotion to get a comfortable shave will use up the whole reservior in 3 or 4 days. They certainly could have enlarged the reservoir and doubled the capacity and still had a sleek small machine. Also the battery life is a little disappointing. My old Remmington started off with a couple of weeks&#x27; battery life, and I decided to replace it when it got down to 5 or 6 days a few years later. This razor barely does any better than this, needing a charge every week or so. Plus, it charges from a stand rather than a direct connection, so when it gets low and stops dead (the Remmington got slower and slower for a couple of days giving fair warning) you can&#x27;t plug it in and keep shaving. I had to dry off and go back to the old machine when it conked out halfway through the shave. And the directions tell you not to leave it on charge all the time as that will reduce the battery life. A bigger battery might have addressed this issue, and a direct plug in charger would have been much better.    It&#x27;s a good razor and I recommend it for the shave quality. If you don&#x27;t mindfrequent refils and charges, it&#x27;s good for the price. Next time I think I&#x27;ll pay attention to those things before I buy.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth generation of these shavers, I lost one in Iraq.  I am pleased now as I was with the first generation, I hope they never stop making them as the item works for years until it can no longer keep the charge.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried so many different razors exactly like this one promising a \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave without all the nicks and cuts of a straight razor.  But this Philips Norelco is just like all the rest -- painful pulling, inadequate \\&quot;spotty\\&quot; shaving, and not what I was expecting.  I&#x27;ve tried it for the past couple of months and it just has not been worth the hassle.  One of these days I&#x27;m hoping to find a shaver that will actually do what it claims in the marketing.  Until then, I guess I&#x27;m stuck using my Edge shaving gel and straight razor.</li>
    <li> Ready for a totally smooth shave? Soft skin? No nicks and cuts? For men who do not like electric shavers in the past, give this one a try. My husband LOVES this shaver. The one downside is that you must replenish the nivea moisturizing gel that comes with it, to achieve the soft shave time and time again.</li>
    <li> Hi Amazon thanks for the quick delivery of my new Philips Coolskin Razor HS8420, I had the older version and it lasted me for three and a half years with many faultless shaves, the only thing that is really wrong with it is that the little button switch to fire it up  has become faulty so you have to give it a tap on something to get it to work, may even decide to get it repaired, might even be able  to do it myself, (grabs soldering iron and gets busy), but never the less a really superb razor and it certainly does a good job on tough bristle such as mine, commonly called a bluebeard.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a Philips Norelco HS8420 through Amazon.com.  This is my 2nd such razor.  I was sad when the head of my old razor broke off (I had previously dropped it many times).   I was delighted to find a new one on Amazon.com and was equally pleased with the great price with no shipping costs.  I plan to use the new razor for the next 5 years like I did the first one.  This razor has so many advantages over all other electric razors that I have used over the past 50 years...close shaves with or without the foam, easy to clean, light weight, and easy to maneuver all over the face.</li>
    <li> This shaver cut good for the first few times and then it does not cut  very uncomfortable to use.  It will not cut the hair under my chin and leaves a lot of stuble. The cutters are new, so I know it is not them. This is a very bad shaver</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I thought I&#x27;d be getting a decent razor but didn&#x27;t expect too much.  To my surprise it was so much better than I thought, and would have expected to pay at LEAST double.  Cuts well, and the being able to use the shaving conditioner as needed is great.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not what I expected.  Very small with a not too powerful motor.  Works fine, but I get the feeling it may not last too long.   The lotion is quite expensive and it uses more than my old Norelco.   If I had to do over again, would try and find the old style Norelco shower shaver again.</li>
    <li> Great for those who want to be able to shave electrically in the shower.</li>
    <li> I used to own the previous generation Cool Skin shaver that used the Nivea packets.  While I liked the shaver, I hated messing with the packets, and the plastic piece that covered the spring for the flip head eventually broke.    This shaver is a much better design. It shaves as well as the previous model, and has the advantage of being much lighter. I would highly recommend this shaver for people that have difficulty raising their arms and maintaining their grip. The cartridge-style lotion injection is much easier to use, and no lotion is wasted. Some reviewers have stated that the lotion does not last long. That has not been my experience - the lotion supplied with the shaver lasted me over two months, and the containers are smaller than what you get when you order replacements.  What I typically do is dry shave to get most of the stubble off, then use the lotion to finish up - maybe some people use it to start off, and that&#x27;s why they use it up so quickly. It does not irritate my face to dry shave initially, but I would not use this shaver strictly as a dry shaver - the lotion is really needed to get a good finished shave.    I also tried using this shaver once in the shower - I didn&#x27;t like the way it shaved wet, and the lotion is not really as effective as when shaving dry. I had to use a lot more lotion. I don&#x27;t recommend this shaver for wet shaving (even outside the shower with a wet face). Start with a completely dry face and dry shave, then finish with the lotion for best results.  Besides, shaving in the shower wastes water!    The charging base is small, and the whole shaver takes up less space on the counter than its larger predecessor.    PROS: Close as a blade        Lightweight and smaller than older gen        Excellent lotion delivery    CONS: No sideburn attachment like older gen had        Lotion cost (it is really required to use this shaver effectively)    Overall, this shaver is superior to the older model in every respect - the only thing I miss about my old shaver is the sideburn attachment. In fact, I&#x27;ve kept the old one just for that one purpose.</li>
    <li> The Good: If you have sensitive skin the HS8420 is the razor for you.  It shaves close without any signs of skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: The Nivea shaving conditioner must be purchased online.  It&#x27;s not sold in stores, so planning is required.  The charger base had to be replaced in it&#x27;s first year of use.</li>
    <li> I did all the comparisons and read all the reviews of all the shavers.  I didn&#x27;t want a shaver that had all the bells and whistles (that u never use) at almost 300$, and this one was hyped as \\&quot;just a regular razor that gives a great shave...and easy to clean (just a rinse))\\&quot;.  O ya, I got the one without the cream dispesner.  I bought it at Walmart (88$ by the way) and it&#x27;s awesome.  Feels close to a razor blade.  Don\\&quot;t hesistate if u want a straight up shaver that gives a fantastic shave.  My old one was a low end Philishave and I couldn\\&quot;t get replacement blades, or I would have kept it....but I wouldn&#x27;t have known what I was missing. Ya falla?  Go for it.</li>
    <li> I have loved Norelco products for a long time.  This one lives up to it&#x27;s heritage and improves on it by using a great lotion.  I like being able to rinse the heads after I use it.  The balance is good too.</li>
    <li> Have been through several rotary shavers (normal razors give me bumps). This is by far the best and most comfortable shave that I have gotten. The closeness is almost as good as a blade razor (but better than any other electric razor that I&#x27;ve had). It shaves great wet or dry.    My only gripes are:   1. No sideburn trimmer.   2. No travel case (I just use an old case from another razor).  3. The charging stand is nice, but there is no option for corded operations(as I do not always have power when I travel, but typically the shower trailers have a plug in but waiting each morning for a \\&quot;quick charge\\&quot; can get old). The one saving grace for this is the battery typically lasts me well over a week.      Overall like the razor, I&#x27;ll adapt to those monor inconvieniences for a good save. But add those three things and this will be 5 stars easy.</li>
    <li> Shaver received with no cutter head.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  It is the best electric razor I have ever owned.  It is a \\&quot;WetnDry\\&quot; style razor which means I can shave with it using my own shaving cream.  Seriouly, It gives me the smoothest and best shave I have ever had.  Better than a blade.                             Vaughn Baker</li>
    <li> I had one of the first Norelco shavers that used the Nivea cream/gel when they came out years ago.  I thought that product was absolutely fantastic and provided me with a very close shave, rivaling what I used to get with a blade, just without the time and hassle.  Well, after over seven years of use, that shaver finally died.  I took it with me wherever I went and it worked like a charm.    This is not that shaver.    After my old one died, I went back to using a blade for a good six months.  I longed for the speed and ease of my old shaver, so I went out and got the latest one that Norelco was selling.  On the whole, this shaver is pretty good.  If I use it everyday, it&#x27;s still really close and performs well, almost as well as a blade.  If I use it every other day, it becomes a little more time consuming and not as close.  There&#x27;s no way you should use this with more than two days worth of growth.  It&#x27;ll be quicker to shave with a blade.  Perhaps my biggest gripe with this shave though is the lack of an edging tool.  I have a goatee, and shaving around it with this is hard.  The old Norelco I had came with a trimming attachment.  This one did not.  So I still have to have a blade handy to trim appropriately around my beard.  I&#x27;d probably rate this at closer to 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because when it&#x27;s used consistently, it really is a pretty solid shaver.  It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean, and it fits far more comfortably in your hand than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have been razor-shaving my Italian-American face for 30+ years - fast, dark, heavy growth. There were too many cuts, new blades, &amp; as I get older, bumps &amp; wrinkles that couldn&#x27;t be trimmed neatly. I work as a professional, &amp; part of my appeal is my appearance. I can&#x27;t present well if I don&#x27;t shave well. With a full beard, I could not imagine clean lines without a razor. This shaver was a wonder! I was very concerned at first for the cost and terms of refund, if it didn&#x27;t work. I carefully read most of the reviews, the worst first, &amp; plunged ahead with the purchase. I went through the &#x27;face-breaking-in&#x27; period quickly, &amp; the shaver was soon working splendidly. I shave daily in the shower &amp; I recheck my appearance in the mirror after toweling off. There are no difficulties with sensitive skin after two passes. The razor requires regular cleaning - likely twice a month, but this is accommodated quickly and it returns to precision operation. And just to mention, I don&#x27;t use the Nivea cream. It is lightweight and fits very comfortably in your hands. No more cuts! No more extreme bleeding! Recharging is fast and easy. It travels well too! I will not go back to a razor! I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job.  My face still has hairs when it is done.  Not a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a dedicated fan of traditional wet shaving and my experience with several electric razors has left my bias quite intact. Until now, that is. The HS8420 is a pleasant surprise in that, when properly used on a wet face and with the accompanying Nivea lotion, it does not feel like your face is being cut to pieces. Reasonably close shave and smooth gliding over the skin. Gillette&#x27;s gel works as good as the accompanying Nivea lotion too. While I am not going to give up the luxury of the wet shave, this electric razor is a good thing for the weekday mornings when you are in a hurry to get out the door.</li>
    <li> My husband was tired of spending so much time shaving with a safety razor, having to lather and all, he researched for an electric razor &amp; this one came with good reviews, he has been using it for several weeks &amp; says it was worth the purchase, I noticed that on days when he doesn&#x27;t shave his stubble is not as course as when he was shaving with the safety razor,so that is a plus for me :).</li>
    <li> I just needed a cheap shaver . . . no way I would really give up my blades!  Well, after three weeks i notice that I use this machine every morning in the shower, and the blades are getting a rest. After a week I shaved as smooth as the blades, and I think it is now smoother. Neck, chin, no areas are problem areas anymore. I get a week at least on one charge, and the Nivea seems to last longer than most reviewers indicate. So far, a pleasant comfortable suprise for a small price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;after almost two years I find myself using this machine more than any other shaver. The blades only come out after a weekend or longer of not shaving. I would buy it again if it ever would stop work.  It has been a great buy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and was hoping to kiss his smooth clean face, and help him avoid razor cuts, bet instead I was presented with short prickly stubble. I chose this one because it could be used in the shower where he usually shaves or if he wanted a quick shave before work. He tried rotating in all directions and using the lotion that it came with in and out of the shower. After a couple of uses the lotion dispenser stopped working all together . He tried using his own shave gel or even soap , still he was not smooth. He went back to using a regular disposable head razor and decided to return this one. I would have expected better from something this price.</li>
    <li> My review could only be very favorable. I do have a question since I have not used an electric razor in some 25 years. Can the Nivea cool lotion HS170 be used with the 8420 razor? I am now using the irritation conditioner that pumps into the razor and would like to try the cool gel. Will this also work with the 8420?</li>
    <li> I bought this over priced razor thinking that it would be better then the 30 dollar ones that you can pick up at Walmart, but this razor isn&#x27;t built to shave course hair. I tried it with 3,2, and next day stubble, in and out of the shower, it couldn&#x27;t give a close shave, or even a ok shave. Save you money and your time with this P.O.S. shaver.</li>
    <li> The razor is fine but the Nivea lotion lasts no time at all in the razor.  I bought this for my dad and he says the replacement lotion is too expensive so he just uses Edge gel.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco HS8420 Nivea for Men Razor&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco HS8420 Nivea for Men Razor&lt;br /&gt;exactly as advertised, love this razor, this is my second one, that&#x27;s so i have a spare when the other needs new head.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of other Norelco Razors and this one gives me the best shave. The only thing missing is the pop up trimmer. The built in gel doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the HS8420 Nivea Razor.  His brother has an older version of this razor and highly recommended it. Likes the shaving conditioner idea.  He has small hands and likes the contoured shape of the razor, it&#x27;s easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor for about 3 years now and I wanted to write a review just to encourage its further availability from Norelco.  I think this is a great shaver and really enjoy being able to push the button as I am shaving and add the little bit of lubricant.  I have found that using just a little touch of the lubricant makes the blade seem to kick into overdrive and really create a smooth shave.  I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of advertising of this shaver, but I think it is a unique and helpful tool.  I definitely do not enjoy shaving, but this shaver certainly makes it more bearable.  I would say that I replace the blades more often than recommended (like maybe two or three times a year) but I consider this a small price to pay for the great, smooth shaves.</li>
    <li> i bought this for myself and it works great as an electric razor.  its has a very long battery life. i get about 2 weeks out of a charge. i then gave it to my grandfather who is 93 and he uses it everyday.  he lost it in a nursing home and made me buy the same one again. he said he had all different kinds and this one fit in his hands the best, it was light, waterproof and held charge longer then anything he had before.</li>
    <li> My husband is absolutely delighted with this razor, and this is after years of using a larger Norelco.  Why did we replace that one?  Sadly, he is a fighting a tough battle with Parkinsons and the larger, much heavier Norelco was dropped just too many times.    This razor is MUCH lighter, but still accomplishes a perfect shave.  Another plus is the lotion, especially when you live in the Denver area which is - a surprise I&#x27;m sure to many - a semi-arid climate.      And there is one more plus:  This little jewel rinses clean under a hot water tap.    I can&#x27;t imagine a better razor for someone who travels.  The razor and charger take up about a fourth of the space of the larger combo.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Up until this point (and beyond if, my 2/5 stars review is not a good enough indication!) I&#x27;ve been using a Gilette Fusion blade to shave, coupled with a Braun bodyCruzer when I don&#x27;t want to take the time to shave properly. The Braun does a decent job of keeping my facial hair down quite a bit, while the Gilette gives me a really close shave. I figured this Philips Norelco would get me somewhere in between the the Braun and the Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions are quite good with the Philips. It charges and indicates when the battery is fully charged (unlike the Braun...). It&#x27;s also a smart-looking waterproof unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s about where all my nice words end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) You have to dispense a ton of gel to stop your face getting torn up. I highly suggest, as other reviewers have mentioned, just manually apply some shaving gel as you shave. You&#x27;ll go through the packed-in tiny bottle of gel in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The shave is not close at all. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I got better results from my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) It takes AGES to shave. I had thought this Philips razor would speed my mornings up, not slow them down. I can spend over a minute on one side of my face, and it&#x27;s still not uniformly shaved, and I have to go over and over an area, which for the person who shaves a lot - he knows this can turn quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) In addition, it literally FEELS like the hair is being pulled out. It&#x27;s not comfortable at all to shave with this device. Just...ow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed. It&#x27;s almost 2010. There should be no question a shaver released today in the upper two-digit price range should do a decent job. This one simply doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s of course quite possible this shaver might work for you, but I just found myself going back to my bodyCruzer/Fusion combo, which do a far better job in less than 1/4 of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5 Disappointing.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco HS8420/20 Nivea for Men Razor provides a MUCH better shave than any Electric Razor I&#x27;ve ever used, although that&#x27;s not exactly a glowing recommendation. Every other Electric Razor I&#x27;ve used has chewed my face up mercilessly. I have VERY sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve finally found a disposable razor/shaving cream combination that didn&#x27;t irritate me, so I was very reluctant to try this new Norelco shaver. The instructions say to give it three weeks of exclusive use, so your skin can acclimate, which I did.....And although it irritated my neck and chin quite badly, at first, my skin HAS acclimated. There&#x27;s still some irritated spots , especially on the jawline and chin area, which I generally have to go over many times to get a close shave. Another reviewer laid out a perfect shaving scenario: Use some shaving cream for the first pass, then use the lotion dispenser for the second pass. The lotion is pretty expensive, and it goes FAST if you use it constantly. The razor itself is very easy to clean, and it keeps a charge for a pretty long time. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice razor, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This electric razor worked very well for me.  I liked the lotion dispenser, I think it really made the difference.    Only problem I have is that the lotion is almost as expensive as the razor when you need to refill it.  For that reason I gave this product 3 stars.  If it was more affordable it would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Having a very delicate skin progressively down selected me down to this Razor/shaver. Works like a charm everytime. Bought this every second year from Amazon as it works in the shower for a full week on a single charge, no maintenance as its washed off instantly. Norelco has changed the outside designs but thankfully left working well.  Have returned or retired all the other brands as most give cuts and some are very noisy. Yes you need to hold this one close to checkits on or off!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who had the older model of the same razor, but he broke it, so I got him this as a replacement. He says it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close (and I agree). It is faster for him than doing a manual shave, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus. He uses a shave gel on the face and uses the expensive nivea in the dispenser only as a second pass on the skin to save on the cost. Overall, its just OK and there are probably better ones on the market. If you&#x27;re interested in trying it, I&#x27;d recommend looking for the older model as it works just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for an older Nivea shaver.  I&#x27;ve used mine for about 5 years and replaced the heads twice-- so I thought it was time to get a new unit.  I have sensitive skin, and shaving with either a blade or dry electric causes irritation.  I used the Nivea dispenser for years with great results-- but now I use a non-allergenic body wash instead.  Just wet your face, apply a little body wash, and it works pretty much the same as the Nivea but without the extra cost.  The great thing about this razor is that it&#x27;s waterproof, allowing you to even shave in the shower if you like.  I also love the shape of the head-- no extra body parts to obscure your vision.  It&#x27;s easy to see exactly where you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
    <li> great razor but no longer in production, heads are outrageously expensive now</li>
    <li> fair to the price and you will like it very good price but not bad product, you get what you paid, happy</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for over a decade at least and this thing is a must have for the shower being as it&#x27;s waterproof. I can only speak as to it&#x27;s awesomeness for shaving the head as I have never used it on my face. The ability to distribute the Nivea shave cream is excellent as well.</li>
    <li> I buy it for my father and I will ship to him. It looks good, I think he will like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a year.  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard.  The motor is much weaker than my old 7735X but it got the job done with even less pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I was on vacation and let my beard get a bit long.  Razor was making noise (sounded like it was choking on the beard) and it was pulling worse than ever.  I had decided to grit my teeth and bear it until I felt my face getting wet.  I looked at my razor and it was covered in blood.  One of the extremely thin screens got dented and the blades, hitting the dent, had bent and pushed through the screen so what I thought was whisker pulling was actually the blades slicing my face up.  I had a 7735x before this and it was dropped and tossed around plenty without issue.  If they&#x27;re going to make the screens so flimsy that they get dented in a travel bag they need to include a blade cover and put a warning on it about catastrophic failure.</li>
    <li> product works well, i only use it wet and use regular shave gel to conserve the nivea lotion (expensive refill)</li>
    <li> razor gives harsh shave without dispenser lotion.the lotion gives you a smooth shave without iritation.the lotion is expensive and often plugs up in the head.very poor battery life and slow speed head makes for longer shaving time.the offer thay make is to try it for so many weeks before you want to return it.well by the time comes you just say the hell with it!</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Norelco with a Remington screen razor, and that really doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Got the HS8420, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  The floating heads work well on curves, it fits the hand easily, hold a fairly long charge, and the lotion dispensing system works well.  Much closer shave than my old razor or the Remington.    The big catch is the lotion... it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as well dry, and the lotion is fairly expensive and goes fast.  It&#x27;s fully waterproof, so I often shave in the shower and just use electric shaving gel instead of the built in lotion dispense.  Works great.  Out of the shower, I go with the built-in dispenser lotion.    The heads are extremely easy to clean due to their open back, so it&#x27;s no problem using this razor with other shaving gel options that you apply manually.  I would not recommend this if you want to use it as a dry shaver, but then that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed for anyway.</li>
    <li> My husband recently upgraded to this razor, after using a Philips Norelco Coolskin 6701X for the past 5 years.  The only reason he purchased a new razor is because his old Coolskin razor stopped taking a charge.  We searched all over for the Coolskin, and found this to be the successor.  My husband likes this new version.  He had to get used to the flexible heads (and having to push a little harder to make contact with his skin).  It leaves a nice, close shave and his skin looks great after use.  It works just as well as the 6701X, and he loves the fact that he can use it in the shower.  It is perfect for his busy schedule.      [...]</li>
    <li> You need to use a lot of Nivea in order to do one shave. The easy solution is to apply a thin layer of Gel/Foam to the skin prior to shave.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE:  The shaver heads are VERY fragile.  Hard/Brittle Plastic--and that degrades with time no matter what.  Mine has broken twice in less than six months.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco triple-header shavers for decades (and have Norelco triple header shavers lasting that long still in use! &amp; they never broke for no apparent reason).     The mounting is a snap in design, and it is weak!  Note the way that head is mounted, teed up like a golf ball -- making it easy to accidentally catch underneath &amp; bump off! A single drop, if that doesn&#x27;t break it right there, will likely create a crack that will fail completely relatively soon.  If you buy one, you will need to handle this thing with the kind of delicate care you&#x27;ve never considered for a shaver ever before!!  All the more difficult considering that at some point you will likely use this with soapy/slippery hands in the shower.      Norelco says it will replace the second failed shaver head free (it costs about half to a third the price of a new complete shaver).  But that&#x27;s only because I somehow still had the receipt.      The first time I tried to locate a replacement locally -- in Northern Virginia, basically a suburb of Washington D.C., a huge population center -- I only located two (2) replacement heads [and lots of empty shelf space] in a Target store.  That suggests, to me, breakage is a common problem.  This design has been out for a couple of years or so, so why else would basic spares be in such short supply??    IF YOU OPT TO TRY ONE, CHECK OUT LOCAL VENDORS &amp; SEE IF REPLACEMENT HEADS ARE READILY AVAILABLE.  IF NOT, CONSIDER RECONSIDERING -- THOSE EMPTY SHELF SPACES ARE SENDING A SIGNAL OF THIS PROBLEM!      If replacement heads are available, at half to a third of the price of the entire shaver, you&#x27;ll quickly see the folly in such replacements as a long-term operating strategy.  If it fails twice, you&#x27;ll be as fed up as I am.  It does work well when it works, but the price isn&#x27;t worth the problem.HARD ON THE SKIN -- YES, it can be!!  I found the Nivea cream works ok, but even better is to rub the bar of soap on the skin over the entire area to be shaved to develop a thick soapy film in the shower &amp; use that as the lubricant (many shaving creams are essentially foamed up soap, so this is hardly a novel approach); its faster &amp; easier than using the Nivea, which can otherwise thin out during use, leading to \\&quot;razor burns.\\&quot;  However, either way (soap, Nivea cream, or both combined) I&#x27;ve gotten \\&quot;razer burn\\&quot; areas in some tender areas if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> Positive: More streamlined than my previous Norelco and much easier to refill.  Neg:      Does not have flexible heads which is not as effective as my old razor. Did not come with a case for traveling.</li>
    <li> I knew how much I liked it when the one I had previously was stolen and I grew desperate to replace it.</li>
    <li> I have long suffered with shaving with choosing between a blade type razor and electric shaver.  I have sensitive skin, and the blade and shaving cream have bothered my skin.  This is true even when I use shaving cream for sensitive skin.  A regular electric is way to rough on my skin, and does not do a close shave.  This the best electric razor on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric shavers in my lifetime and used them for a quick, but generally unsatisfactory, shave between regular blade shaves. Now that I&#x27;m on blood thinners nicks and cuts associated with blade shaves can be troublesome. I&#x27;ve used this Norelco exclusively for almost two months and am most pleased with the way it performs. It follows the contours of the face well, is light weight, and close cutting. The Nivea lotion facilitates the process and eliminates the dry skin generally associated with blade shaves.  For the first time in my life I feel clean shaven  by an electric razor. Based upon my experience I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> I needed a second razor for a room I rent during the week for a job site away from my home.  This one appealed to me due to its light weight and smaller size.  Also, it appears to hold the charge for weeks (only charged it once since it arrived more than 3 weeks ago).   I do find that not having the cover / enclosure around the rotors like the older models does result in more hair bits on the vanity when I shave.   I haven&#x27;t tried the lather squirter capability as my older one that has a somewhat similar capability tended to gunk up after only a few days and I usually clean the heads every 10-15 shaves so was cleaning much more frequently. I probably will give it a shot in a the next week or two just to compare to the older unit and see if it avoids the extra hair bits on the counter top.</li>
    <li> can be used in the shower, have a lotion dispenser, the detail is that the loci brings very little, and it is difficult to get spare lotion</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shave I&#x27;ve had since I last used  a &#x27;Cut Throat&#x27; nearly 30 years ago. I cannot understand why this shaver is no longer on under maunfacture!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better shavers, but for the price, I&#x27;m really impressed. Shaving under the shower is really convenient. I took the advice of another reviewer and get some shave gel so that I didn&#x27;t use up the Nivea too fast, but I start out with just the water running, then a little gel, then a little Nivea for my tough old beard. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good thing they offer a money back guarantee. I was looking to replace my 12 year old Remington Intercept. I keep a shaved head and was hoping this shaver would be a good replacement. Nope. Returned it after the 3 week trial period. Would not recommend if you want a close shave.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and you get a relatively close shave for this Norelco .I am satisfied whit its&#x27; performance as I would shave with a blade every Sunday and use the shaver during the week.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Marshalls tonight to give it a shot. I have had horrible experiences with electric razors in the past, so nothing has ever worked better than a straight razor. Since Marshall&#x27;s said i could return even if I used it, decided to give it a shot tonight. I&#x27;m completely and utterly surprised. I keep rubbing my face cause a shave this close without a straight razor has never been possible. This razor was fast and worked for me right out of the box, even for curly African American beards. I definitely recommend this razor and cannot wait to see how it will improve using it for 3 weeks. Shaving and clean up was a in breeze in 10 minutes flat.</li>
    <li> Great shave even when not shaving daily, even though I don&#x27;t use the lotion.  And it doesn&#x27;t have to be taken apart to be cleaned.  Long-lasting battery life between charges.</li>
    <li> I usually shave with a straight razor or safety razor on a daily basis.  I purchased this due to a disability that has made it difficult to use my hands and arms, but I wanted to be able to keep shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea conditioner is perfect.  I usually end up chaffing with an electric razor, not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Using the Nivea as I shave, keeps my skin well, and the triple heads make it easy to just take a single pass while shaving.  It&#x27;s size is great to place in a drawer or my travel bag and the charge lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My son has the same issue with his skin, especially on his neck. I cleaned the heads good and he used it with 3 or 4 days growth. Now he wants one.&lt;br /&gt;Could have purchased a more expensive shaver, but this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Ive been using it for three days now and it shaves really well.  The shave is quick, the heads contour to the shape of your face so you can go from your neck to face seamlessly.  The lotion is great too.  only bad thing is there is not a trimmer on it for sideburns, moustaches, etc...and no it doesnt get as close a shave as standard razors, but....well....its not a razor...if what you want is a close razor like shave...use a razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver primarily due to the built in Nivea delivery system.  My wife bought me two shavers, 12 Nivea refill dispensers, and two extra blade cartridges,  in case Norelco decides to ruin a good thing by coming out with a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; model.</li>
    <li> I bought a Philips Norelco HS8420 shaver from Kmart for $60 on sale. It worked pretty good when it was brand new except that, even with the Nivea built in cream dispenser, it wouldn&#x27;t get the hairs on my neck without grinding on it for an extended period of time, which irritated my neck awfully, even with the lube. (Not to mention irritating my boss when I was late to work because shaving in the morning takes longer than using a traditional razor since the heads won&#x27;t get at the hairs on your neck without heroic efforts. Soon after the newness of this shaver wore off (my skin), the cream dispensers in the head began clogging constantly, requiring me to take the whole thing apart with micro-screw drivers to clear the clog. (Really?!) The worst part about the shaver, is that the greedy company thinks that they can get up to $160 to replace the cheap plastic head of the shaver when the budget plastic gears wear out on the head. Why not just throw the whole shaver in the garbage, charger and all, and buy 2 brand new ones. (2 new ones from another company all-together.) Don&#x27;t support this type of corporate greed. Buy another brand like Braun or Remington, who have semi-reasonable prices for their replacement parts prices.</li>
    <li> So convenient having the on-board conditioner in the shaver. No spilling. No goo on your hands. Shaves great in or out of the shower. Will shave for years with the same set of blades.  My first one lasted about 3 years before the battery went bad (not replaceable).</li>
    <li> This is quite possibly the worst battery operated shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Please, please, please do NOT buy this razor. The blades barely take off beard stubble and the only way to get a decent shave is to use a lot of the lotion. Plainly said, this is a horrible razor and I really wish Philips Norelco would reimburse me for this consummate waste of money!</li>
    <li> This product works as expected, nothing bad to say. Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in. Have been using it for at least the past 7 years. The latest model has a better system.</li>
    <li> I have a very tough beard and very sensitive skin. This is the only electric razor that works for me. Using Nivea makes so I don&#x27;t even feel the shave and my skin feels great after. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  He has had one just like it that he got as a Christmas present from our son several years ago.  so glad I found one just like it for him.</li>
    <li> have used the Norelco tchnology for many years and recently switched off to a foil shaver. It was very unsatisfactory. I then got the newest Norelco and it is wonderful!  It gives a great shave!</li>
    <li> This razor is great in the shower with shaving cream. When my first one finally gave up after quite a few years, I hated using a blade razor while waiting for my new Norelco.</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this razor but the newer version is a bit bigger and easier to handle. Also the battery life is longer. The shave is close and comfortable. I would recommend this razor to anyone that is looking for a wet/ dry razor.</li>
    <li> For electric razor users, this product is competitive with other electrics.  The built-in lubrication pump is a nice feature which takes the away usual sting.      Being able to run it under water or to use it in the shower is a definite advantage over other electrics that don&#x27;t offer this feature.    Although the instructions mention continuous use for 30 days to achieve similar or better than traditional blade razor results, I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case.  My first shave with a blade after one month&#x27;s of use was far superior.      Additional bonus for this razor is that it is super convenient and easy to pack for travel.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 15yr old son, only razor that he likes and uses with any regularity</li>
    <li> My dad, who has super sensitive skin, tried on this razor and liked it.  It gave a very close shave.  Not as a great as a hand held four blade razor (his usual), but pretty close.  He really liked the fact that he could use it in the shower.  Most importantly, after using it for a month, the dispensed conditioner seem to have a really nice effect on reducing shaving irritation for him. So much so that he plans to keep using it despite the slightly expensive refills.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for a couple of months and absolutely love it. I shave every 2 days and I have smoother than average facial hair and normal skin and this shaver gives me a very close shave. It is comparable to any manual razor I have ever used and better than any electric shaver that I have owned.    The key is in the lubricant. I have tried using the lubricant, using shaving gel and bath gel. When using the shaving gel and bath gel, I have irritation that lasts for a couple of hours and sometimes into the evening. The lubricant is great. It does not leave any irritation whatsoever. I do use Neutrogena Men Triple Protect Face After Shave and it keeps my skin soft the entire day. I would really recommend this.    The downside to this shaver is the lubricant. It can get expensive. Amazon has the kit for the cheapest price. I go through about one container of fluid ever month. So that&#x27;s $20 every 3 months. The overall price can quickly get comparable with an arcitec within the course a year. Keep that in mind when deciding this.    Overall, I love my purchase of the Norelco Nivea Razor. It is expensive but the cost of my face not being irritated is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this razors predecessor for approximate 10 years with great satisfaction. this razor however is a poor comparison and not nearly as well built. Does not dispense lotion well and is not nearly as close a shave as the older one. Tried using shaving cream and what a mess!</li>
    <li> This razor works well, and I have been a Norelco customer for years now.&lt;br /&gt;By Far my favorite part of this razor is that it&#x27;s EASY to clean....&lt;br /&gt;no nasty stubble bits being stored under the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;I find because this razor doesn&#x27;t store it&#x27;s stubble shavings that the razor heads don&#x27;t clog up nearly as fast.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not having to dig old hair and skin out from around the cutting blades (totally gross).</li>
    <li> I have bough three of these shavers, one for our primary home , vacation home and my dock kit.... love um.</li>
    <li> I love using this razor in the shower.   I have a hard face to shave and find that, even in the shower soaking wet, the moisturizer is a must have for me.  It helps somehow to grip the facial hair better while shaving (and feels much more comfortable than without it).  Perhaps I&#x27;m just not adept at using electric shavers, I found it difficult to trim around the edges of the face (side burns) preferring a normal razor for that.      The razor delivers on the ease of use and while marketed as a wet / dry shaver.  However, even with the moisturizer, I don&#x27;t see using this as a dry shaver without something to catch the clippings better.</li>
    <li> My beard acclimated to the razor in about 3 weeks, as the manual says to estimate as a trial break-in period.  The shave was fine and quick, about 3 or 4 minutes, but I really didn&#x27;t like having to hit a spot repeatedly.  I understand that the old Norelco three circular blade design has been around forever, but to me those just left gaps between them that you have to go over and over again. So, the shave was good but kind of tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I let my beard grow for 3 or 4 days, the shaver really didn&#x27;t like that.  My beard just laughed at it.  After 5 minutes my face was all blotchy with unremovable whiskers, after 9 minutes it looked the same.  No number of times hitting the same spots removed the whiskers.  Out came my trusty 4 blade razor with a motor in the handle and in less than a minute I was done, with a clean shave all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the design would please an older man.  It looks very much as a Star Trek or Transformers toy.  And I do mean toy, it really looks fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest reason I would stay away from this razor is a toothbrush I own that now resides under my sink. Made by the same company, it is a Philips-Sonicare/Crest-Intelliclean product.  Much like the razor&#x27;s lotion, the toothbrush requires special pouches of toothpaste that fit into the handle.  Also much like the razor requiring special replacement blades that will dispense the lotion, the toothbrush requires special brush heads that will dispense the toothpaste.  You can get around the lotion or toothpaste by buying regular products, but you can&#x27;t use anything other than the &#x60;real&#x27; brushes or blades.  I paid a lot for the toothbrush, only to have it soon discontinued by Philips, including accessories, so it is effectively useless without new brushes.  The brushes are so expensive on an auction site that it was actually cheaper for me to buy a whole new toothbrush.  Yes, a Sonicaire, but this time a &#x60;regular&#x27; one.  If the same thing happens to this razor, you might as well do as I did and throw it away or store it.  A couple of things bother me pointing to it not having much long term support; The charging base matches other razors, they didn&#x27;t change the color to match this razor, and I visited 2 drugstores, and while they carried this razor, and they had about 5 Niviea products stocked underneath them, they did not have the lotion that fits this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily cost of using this razor is going to be high.  The blades need to be replaced once a year according to the manual, but I&#x27;m sure with a beard like mine it would be more frequent.  The blades cost almost half of what the whole razor costs.  The lotion is expensive.  The trial .95 oz lasted me less than a month, probably closer to 2-1/2 to 3 weeks if you don&#x27;t count the days I didn&#x27;t shave.  That was with doing what another reviewer said to stretch out the lotion, washing my face and leaving it wet before shaving.  So, you might be looking at 1 container of lotion per month, look up the prices and add it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would stay away from this razor.  If you like electric razors get one of these that doesn&#x27;t have the fancy lotion dispensing system or a flat surface razor, not 3 circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to stick with my vibrating 4 blade razor and gel shaving cream that is hand applied.ht as well do as I did and throw it away or store it.

    <li> I needed a new razor and this was just what I needed.  The shaves aare not yet perfect, but I am sure they will be after the break in period.</li>
    <li> I found myself interviewing for a new job and decided I should get a new razor to get a clean shave. I originally went looking for a Norelco 8060x as the faster charging and automatic Nivea lotion refill seemed like a nice touch.  Well, all that practical stuff and the cool look of the stand attracted me.  I needed the razor immediately so I went to shopping instead of buying on Amazon.  To my surprise, the 8420 was the only one I found in several stores.  Even in Norelco advertisements for Nivea razors, the 8420 is the model they show.  So I got that one.    First of all, it does seem a bit plasticy and cheap in build. I think that keeps the price down, but visually it doesn&#x27;t look impressive.   Older Nivea models had a more sleek look and color design.  I know it is minor but the older models flat out looked better.  Functionally, I really like the razor.  You press a button on the front of the razor and it dispenses the nivea lotion.  I do wish it was automatic because I never quite know how much I should be using.  The instruction manual infers you should use as much as possible, but not sure how cost-effective that is.      Most importantly, the 8420 gives me a good shave.  The instruction manual says it will take 3 weeks for your face and beard to adjust to the unit and in about 2 weeks I was getting really close shaves.  More importantly I was getting good shaves without razor bumps afterwards.  No bumps, no irritation, just a good clean shave.  The only downside I see is the look of the device and the fact you have to guess at how much lotion you should use.  The good really, really outweighs the bad with this one.</li>
    <li> This is at least my fifth Norelco shaver, and it gives the closest, most comfortable shave of all of them. The lotion that is applied by the shaver really improves the results. The only thing missing is the trimmer which was a feature of many of my previous shavers, but I use an older model to trim my sideburns.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this razor today as a gift for my sweetie, its awsome its just what I wanted the style is so sophiscated.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, BUT CAN NOT FIND THE SHAVING CREAM TO PUT INSIDE THE UNIT. THE NORELCO STORE OR MANY OTHER STORE IN THE AREA ARE OUT OF STOCK, SO WHY BUY THE UNIT IF YOU CAN USE IT</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I keep it in the shower stall and grab it when I need a touch up.  It goes for multiple shaves without a recharge.</li>
    <li> this razor is fast.gives a good shave. i was useing a panasonic wet/dry cost 250.00,this razor blows it away at 1/4 of the price.i like it wet,and the cream is really nice too.try it you&#x27;ll like it.hint rub side to side first, then finish up and down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 92 years old with very sensitive skin. I previously used the Philips Norelco Arcitec for several years. The Nivea is even better than the Arcitec: even closer, and less skin irritation. I don&#x27;t seem to be using all that much of the shaving gel, a problem some have commented on.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT ORDER THIS RAZOR. I ALREADY HAVE ONE. AMAZON CHARGED ME ALMOST $20 FOR THEIR MISTAKE. BEWARE OF AMAZON CHARGES. DON JOHNSON</li>
    <li> I believe one reviewer indicated he uses this to maintain his clean shaven head. However, I have had disappointing results with it. It appears to be less effective with African American hair. I have better results shaving my head using Wahl&#x27;s $19 model 9918-6171 beard trimmer which the HeadBlade company markets under its own name for a much higher price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver, but it takes a really long time to get a close shave.  You have to do many many passes over the same area...  It feels fine, and works well, but it&#x27;s way more time-consuming than it oughtta be...</li>
    <li> I previously had a very similar model Norelco and wanted something close to the same. This fills the bill.  Operates in the shower, has the jel lotion on demand, easy to clean, and the battery lasts several days before recharging.</li>
    <li> This is the best damn razor I have ever used!!! My face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt!!! By far the best razor out there</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin. Everyone knows how electric razors can cause skin irritations, but with this there are none. This is my second one and I really love it.</li>
    <li> product with several defects &#x3D; the product came without the charger load. applicator of shaving cream does not work is broken. I used my old charger and the device but not guard carries the load.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return the device and get my money back. how do.</li>
    <li> WOW -I have been missing out. This is an amazing little device. I never would have thought in a million years that an electric razor could cut as close as a blade. I was wrong, I am very impressed, No more razor burn or cuts on my neck, this norelco with the shave conditioner is a must have, and this was even one of the cheaper ones at 79.00 dollars i couldn&#x27;t even imagine what the more expensive ones could do, probably shave your face for you. the only bad thing is that the shave conditioner is kind of hard to find in some stores. And the fact that the blades on this lasts 12 months is awesome too, the money I will save not having to buy razor blades will be nice. Goodbye blades, Hello Norelco.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother.  This thing is a piece of junk and I don&#x27;t no why anyone would want to subject their face, or anything else for that matter, to this butchering device.  Save your money, I did by returning it.</li>
    <li> Wow! I really had given up on electric razors. But, I really like this one. I cannot believe how close it gets. I especially like the built in shaving creme since I have sensitive skin. Cleaning is a snap annd battery life is great.[[ASIN:B002GJU2XI Philips Norelco HS8420 Nivea for Men Razor]]</li>
    <li> From constantly shaving up with a three blade this is a great adjustment.  The only negatives: Its lack for a longer use period without charge and the drastic increase in time it takes to shave if you are used to a blade.  Other than that, this product gives the smoothest shaves i have ever had with minimal irriatation which ended after about 4 days.</li>
    <li> Just learned that my son considers this his favorite.  Along with the conditioner it really does a great job and keeps his face soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied.  I was at first surprised by the light weight feeling of the razor but functionality is there.  The lotion reservoir is a big plus compared to the cartridge type Philips I had prior.</li>
    <li> I can highly recommend this razor, ease of use and the Nivea Philips Norelco Shaving Conditioner which I still have easily go along very well with this razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a wet use only shaver, do not try and dry shave because it will cut up your face up. This product comes with a sample for Nieva its the shave lotion, the shaver itself, cap, and small brush. It does a decent job, but you will quickly realize you need alot of the Nieva shave lotion to get a comfortable shave, I use a whole cartiage of lotion for a shave in the shower. If your like me your like me get the shaving gel not \\&quot;cream\\&quot; it works better then the lotion and will cost less. I wouldnt recommend this to those who need to shave a lot under their neck because it you will get small cuts from the shaver because we press a bit hard... but how can you press softly I dont know? Here are the pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels great in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Does a decent job of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The heads flex to your jaw for a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt cut very well in the neck and jaw line area.&lt;br /&gt;Has to be used with shaving cream or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Battery doesnt last very long if you shave everyday to get a clean cut.</li>
    <li> BUYERS BEWARE:  IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIND THE SHAVING GEL YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO USE WITH THIS RAZOR, AND WHEN YOU DO THE PRICE FOR ONE IS OUTRAGEOUS!!!  My husband loves his razor and has had it a couple of years now.  For the first few months we could find the shaving gel in a single bottle (no replacement cartridge though) at Wal-Mart.  Then I round a three pack with replacement cartridges on Amazon for around $15.00.  Now it is extemely hard to find.  Go figure...  We have resorted to one of the Nivea shave gel products.  Not sure what the problem is with the shaving gel and you don&#x27;t get an answer when you call Norelco.</li>
    <li> I got this rechargeable Philips Norelco Razor almost a year ago for my 16 year old son - he had never used an electric razor before.  He&#x27;s dropped the razor in the shower several times so it&#x27;s pretty durable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver, or its&#x27; predecessor, for several years. It gives the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had. But the Nivea for Men conditioner refills have suddenly become unavailable, rendering the shaver a useless piece of junk. Bad job, Philips Norelco!</li>
    <li> Really Close Shave and with the lotion there is little or no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and charge lasted for a week of shaving every day. This is&lt;br /&gt;a great little razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for about a year, now. It gives a GREAT shave, especially when using the lotion. Unfortunately, the lotion refills are almost impossible to find!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using as a dry razor, the heads tend to drag &amp; irritate. My OLD Norelco (Without any trick conditioner dispenser in it), gives a MUCH more comfortable shave.  I just bought a new head for my old unit &amp; prefer it by far over this unit without the goo.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that gets easily irritated, and this razor is the best thing that I found out there. I have previously used the older model of this this razor until it died on me, and so far this new model does a pretty decent job. It&#x27;s much smaller and lighter than others, so at first it takes a while to get used to its feel in your hand. Hovewer, this razor does have its drawbacks. The battery does not last long, and I get about 4 shaves on average before it needs recharging. Recharge takes a long time, you have to charge it overnight to get a full charge. It also does not have a \\&quot;quick charge\\&quot; feature like the the previous model. In the previous model, if your battery died, and you charged it for like 5 minutes, you could get another shave out of it. But not with this model, if your battery dies, you&#x27;re SOL. Also, if you plan to travel with it, you would have to find somewhere a sturdy travel case. This razor feels very delicate and would easily get damaged in luggage. Why am I still giving it 4 stars ? Because it gives you irritation free shave, and that is all that matters to me. I can live with other drawbacks until they come up with a better model.</li>
    <li> Best razor they ever made and then they stopped production...Why???</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Norelco shavers for over 20 years, and this is by far the best shaver they have ever made.  That includes their top of the line Sensotouch 3D.    So why shouldn&#x27;t you buy it?  Simple.  For some reason, Norelco discontinued this shaver and no longer sells the blades for it.  As a result, the replacement heads that used to go for $30, are now sold for $150 by opportunistic 3rd party merchants.  So, when your blades wear out in 6-9 months, you are out of luck unless you want to spend big money.    Frankly, it is outrageous that Noreco would simply cease its support for one of its products like this.  It shows complete and utter contempt for its customers.  Essentially, they have turned my electric shaver into little more than a disposable razor, not to mention that the company&#x27;s other options are simply not as good.    As I result, I am done with this company.  My next shaver will be a Panasonic or a Braun.  You have been warned!</li>
    <li> Firstly, the razor is good. Secondly, to my pleasantly surprised, it is packed with a Nivea Conditioner. Last, I receive the razor only 2 business days, although I chose the regular ship.</li>
    <li> Lots of good reviews already, but to help you decide, I have been using this in Afghanistan for 8 months now.  Not in a remote location, but still, I live in a tent.  So I am glad this thing will go for about 2 months between charges.  I only shave with it about 2-3 times a week though, but still, good battery life.  And, I cannot get the normal refills, which the one that came with it ran out in about 2 weeks.  So, I have been using Nivea after shave balm instead.  I just slather on a decent coat on my face, and then give myself a wet shave with the razor.  It has worked great in this manner.  It does take longer than my old Braun or even a normal razor, so not sure if I am really saving myself time, but I rarely have an irritated face after I shave.  I usually do with a razor or my other electrics in the past.  Plus, it is nice to use in the shower with just normal shower gel on my face.  Bottom line, it has been sturdy, has a great battery, and gives a good shave without irritation if you have some sort of gel balm or shower gel to use with it.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I rated with #3 because this razor irritated my neck even with lotion, so I&#x27;m using this razor for shaving my face, but my neck.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. Loved the first one which gave out after 5 years, so I bought another one!</li>
    <li> This is a really high quality razor suitable for both wet and dry uses. The product has a compartment for Nivea gel that is activated by pressing a button. What I do not like about this product is it takes time to learn how to use this product effectively. The need for a mirror to use it still makes it unsuitable to use in shower.</li>
    <li> The razor is ok, but the problem we have is finding a store that carries the Nivea shaving conditioner for irritation control.</li>
    <li> This is my second HS8420.  I had to replace it because of the batteries (3 years of daily use) don´t hold charge for more than 3 days.</li>
    <li> Shaves quickly and close. Holds a cage for multiple days and the added lotion dispenser things are great for a smooth shave. It was well worth the $65 that I paid for it. Two years later I still have it and still use it.</li>
    <li> I was very glad to find this item still available.  It is the best electric razor I have ever owned.  It has a pump built in that provides lotion to the heads for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver cuts very close. Without some sort of cream/lotion it will nick the heck out of your skin. But it seems to be a good value. I still use a razor on a daily basis, but this makes for a quick shave when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I&#x27;ve used it on other parts of my body with care. It works best on relatively flat areas. If you plan to manscape with it, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My father recommended it (he uses it) and so I bought this for my three teenage boys and they think it&#x27;s great!  No pain and easy to use!</li>
    <li> More than 10 years i was shaving with normal razor , because of my job last 1 year i had to shave every day that&#x27;s why i decided to buy electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;from my friends feedback i was really afraid that my skin will get Irritated after switching from normal blade to electric but i was more than happy when i got really close shave without irritation even after my first shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the quality and flexibility of the blades are amazing before when i was shaving with normal blade hardest part was my chin it took to much time and nerves to shave that area with this electric shaver every part of my face is same and easy to shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all i have shaved only 3 times with this shaver i will update my feedback and share my experience in one month</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver! I have had to replace it every couple of yrs. We have really hard water, so if he rinses it before putting it away, the buildup of minerals ruins the charger dock and locks up the actual razor heads. When I gave him this one for Christmas this year, I told him not to use water with it. Or else to dry it really well before putting it away. Other than that, he is very happy with it and it&#x27;s the only one he wants when it&#x27;s time for a replacement.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well but there is nothing to catch the shaved off whiskers, so they end up all over the place. It is waterproof so can be used in the shower, so there, all the stray whiskers would just wash down the drain. But sometimes hubby needs to shave when he is not in the shower. So it is messy. Also, if you want to use the built in shave cream reservoir, you have to use the specific Nivea product which is pretty expensive and difficult to find. We ended up getting some other types of cream and my husband just rubbed it onto his face, then shaved. He&#x27;s just not crazy about it so he went back to using his old shaver. Maybe I will see if this one will give my legs a closer shave than my regular razor in the shower! He&#x27;s not using it so why not?!</li>
    <li> This shaver is great gives my husband the best shave he has ever had no stuble he has heavy dark black beard and his face is soooooo smooth now!!!</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s marketed as a wet/dry razor (or at least it was when we ordered it).  My husband says it worked dry *only* if you use a ton of the lubricant gel it comes with.  At some point, he ran out--and like most busy people, he didn&#x27;t have time to seek out a refill.  After that, he says he can only use it in the shower (when his face is very wet, after being in there several minutes).  Since he&#x27;s not a big shave-in-the-shower guy, this razor has taken on a more passive role in his routine... sitting on the counter collecting dust.  :/</li>
    <li> He has owned this same brand for 7 years and it finally quit working.  I came to this website ordered this product with excellent service. The cost for this is MUCH cheaper from when they first came out</li>
    <li> Over the last 35 years I owned 1 Braun and 4 Norelco/Phillips electric shavers, two of them the top of the line at the time of purchase.  I like Norelco shavers but this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It really gives you a very clean and close shave, as good as a regular razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is in expensive and easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cleans very easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. No replaceable battery.  Once the battery dies you have to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;2. Power cord connects to the base, so if the battery dies there is no way you can use it with the cord&lt;br /&gt;3. it takes a long time (2 h) to charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a five star because despite the cons, it is an awesome shaver with an exceptional price.</li>
    <li> Norelco seems to be discontinuing this style of electric razors and the Nivea conditioner that goes with it.  The good news is that these razors will work just as well, if not a little better, with a good shaving gel, so don&#x27;t throw them away just yet.  Yes, it takes a little more time, but the shave is closer than the Nivea conditioner and for me, the gel was easier on my face.  You just have to rinse the head of the razor a little more often.  Not to mention the price of the shaving gel was far cheaper than the Nivea conditioner.  You don&#x27;t even have to put the gel on very heavy, a dime size bit of gel usually does my whole face.  I do recommend that you order a new razor head for this razor soon, because they may discontinue them soon and they need to be changed out once a year.</li>
    <li> Not really a fan tried it and then gave it away. Ya it works but not as well as I&#x27;d hoped it would. I would not suggest buying this one.</li>
    <li> The Razor is great!!!!!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> i had this shaver for a year until it died on me was upset so didnt wana buy it again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i spent $30 on another one and it was so painful to shave with and was rubbish quality.... wasted $30 of mine trying to be too cheap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i re purchased this one and im so releived to have a good close comfortable shave yet again.... it comes with moisturiser that you can press a button and comes out onto yur skin while yu shave this is amazing and soothing and stops me gettin rashes after shaving...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this product and higly recomend it to all...</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my boyfriends birthday, I was super exited to see so many good reviews about it. when I received the package the box the razor was open and coated in someone else trimmed hair, along with the shaving product was already empty. So when I called customer service to try to get a new razor sent out or a refund the person on the phone was completely useless to me! The man on the phone wouldn&#x27;t even answer the questions I had. I am appalled and grossed out with amazon and this product.</li>
    <li> Like the concept, but this razor is more trouble than it is worth. Could be particularly difficult to keep if Nivea stops making the shave gel for this specific razor.</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s recommended use is with water and I will use a unit dry, since I don&#x27;t shave in the shower but usually on the go.</li>
    <li> I prefer the good old skinny feeling in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the bulkier newer edition.&lt;br /&gt;I stocked up on them, as long as they are still available!&lt;br /&gt;(They are also cheaper)</li>
    <li> The product wasn&#x27;t nicely builded. very Poor quality. I would buy another razor from Philips instead.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Meet all my expectations. I would order again.  I really like the built in Nivea lubricant.  This is my 3rd Norelco.</li>
    <li> For its price, the quality of this product is amazing! Some similar models cost in upper $100s but this one does the job well. The Nivea smooths the skin better than foam, so it glides on the face.&lt;br /&gt;The service of the seller was also very good, fast and professional!</li>
    <li> I am not getting the smooth and close shave I thought I would get. I have had other electric shavers I received better results from, not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> Holds charge a long time without need of recharge... Seems like the blades went dull really fast... And the built in conditioner is purely vanity... As they say you need to use their brand of conditioner</li>
    <li> Cool, refreshing gel.  Sharp blades.  Agile, pivoting heads. I love this shaver.  The nice, clean, slim design finishes the job.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> I have a 20 year old Norelco I was hoping to replace with this.  I ended up giving this to a friend.  You HAVE to use this in the shower.  It has no place to hold cut whiskers.  Made quite a mess all over my sink.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  My previous Norelco also had a lotion depensing option, but it was manually operated.  I like the push button dispensing on this new shaver.  I get as good a shave as a blade with less work and mess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review after owning this shaver for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an electric shaver because as a Jew and we&#x27;re not permitted to use razors but I still wanted the best shave possible and I still think I made a great choice. I ran into a problem when I found out the blades use a &amp;#34;lift &amp; cut&amp;#34; system, which is also forbidden. Once I removed the lift, the closeness of the shave was gone but hey, that&#x27;s part of the deal and I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the soothing cream feature because I&#x27;m not so punctilious to shave every day and many times have a day of two of stubble which can make shaving kinda painful. A long time ago I had a clog in one of the shaver heads preventing release of the conditioner and after clearing, it still comes out unevenly but it&#x27;s alright. I use a very light amount of the Nivea cream and to date haven&#x27;t even finished my third one so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver still works after all this time but sometimes I have to do many passes so get all the hair which can really irritate the skin. I&#x27;ve experimented with different methods but it has been persistent. For that reason and the clumsy dock system is why I gave it four stars (although I&#x27;m sure some people out there prefer dock charger). Besides for that, I&#x27;ve been really impressed with its durability (I travel a lot and it sometimes gets banged around), longevity (over 3 years) and general reliability.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. It even came with a small shaving cream as well. It was packaged well and it was unopened. Would absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product...my only complaint is you have to order the lotion online because you can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere.</li>
    <li> Shaver is nice but the lotion is hard to find and expensive. I have replaced it with a different Norelco</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver about 10 days and by using the Nivea lotion I can get a shave approaching a blade (better in some regions of my face).  I&#x27;ve also found that I can use TRESemme naturals mosture conditioner as a direct substiture for the Nivea lotion applied from the shaver and it works every bit as well.  I tried some other products as hand applied replacements for the expensive and hard to find Nivea lotion (which is very nice), but it needs a lot of water, no oil and slick, the tresemee conditioner mentioned above really did the trick.  I&#x27;ll save the Nivea for when I travel, but in the shower I&#x27;d just as soon hand apply to my entire face and then shave, a little goes a long way.  This is a great low irritation shaver... needs a trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> It works great for me,lotion and shaver together , push button for cream and shave,also great for heavy beards,TRY it.</li>
    <li> My father likes this model.. He has had 5 of them I think.. They do a good job, however I have had to replace them more often than I think I should have to.  It is easy to handle for my 85 year father.. I do not think any of the stores carry this model anymore.  It is sure easy to get only however.</li>
    <li> a really good razor, do the job in really good way, very flexball, reach every spot on the neck, im very happy with it :)</li>
    <li> I have used an old Norelco rotary shaver before and loved it. This one came with a bad head (one of the cutting heads). I have to shave by rotating the shaver to use the other two heads in order to get a close shave. I have been dealing with it for now but plan to contact manufacture for replacement as the seller is offering the product only. I hope this goes well.</li>
    <li> Compared to the first generation &amp;#34;goo razors&amp;#34; from norelco this one just seems to lack power and charging ability. I mean it works ok and gives a fairly good shave and it is easier to keep clean but it just doesn&#x27;t seem as well made as their products used to be.</li>
    <li> Great Value - Only $20 more than buying just the replacement blades.  I have had this same razor for years, this is my 3rd version</li>
    <li> Good shaver. Good service. Was delivered quickly &amp; in good shape. My husband really likes the Nivea conditioner that the shaver dispenses through the razor head. It makes shaving much easier.</li>
    <li> I bought one for one of my sons for Christmas &amp; just ordered another one for the other son.  They both love it!  Very comfortable, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> this shaver is best i ever had had norelcos in past but this is best by far it is so light to hold and the blades glide over face with ease especilly with cream ejector would buy again</li>
    <li> The razor gives a very close shave, but part of that is due to the Nivea shaving lubricant that the razor dispenses.  The unit that I received was at least two years old (based upon the registration card&#x27;s information) and was discontinued last year (according to the company).  The company no longer produces the Nivea cream, but you can still get the replacement heads that it uses.  The razor is comfortable in one&#x27;s hand (very thin).  One annoying fact is that there is no trimmer (e.g., for one&#x27;s sideburns) like every other Philips electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> very good! very good! very good! very good! very good! very good! very good! very good! very good! very good! very good!&lt;br /&gt;very cool machine&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it</li>
    <li> Well it does a good job but my older Norelco has 4 yellow lights that tell how much charge is left so I can keep it charges I don&#x27;t have room in bathroom to keep it in charger all he time</li>
    <li> I like very much Good product, very good Personally, I strongly recommend everyone to buy My friend saw all praise</li>
    <li> Replacement for 8000 series I had owned for 5 years.  Performs better than the original with consistent smooth shave and little, if any, irritation to the skin.</li>
    <li> I had a Cool Skin 8040, which after a few years of good behavior, decided it would rather sound like a diesel truck. I had recently replaced the head and cartridge, and gotten a 3-pack of Nivea, so I was glad to find someone with the HS8420. The 8420 doesn&#x27;t have the trimmer attachment or the travel pouch, so if you started with this model, you&#x27;d miss those, but the old accessories and the head, cartridge, and Nivea from the 8040 work fine with the 8420.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that Norelco isn&#x27;t replacing the 8420 with something similar. The new ones are wet/dry, but use external shaving products, making the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaving less convenient.</li>
    <li> I really do like this razor and was glad to find a replacement for my other 10 year old  Nivea razor that died a well used death.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 20 years. This razor gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor. I use a shaving gel with it instead of the cream that comes with it do to availability. I would suggest this to anyone. Be sure to allow plenty of time for it to recharge. The charge lasts me about 10 days.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor ever . but what happened to the price!!!&lt;br /&gt;the first one I bought in Marshalls for $40 just as a back up for my other&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second one here for $93.00&lt;br /&gt;Now the cheapest is $175.00 Crazy&lt;br /&gt;I have looked around online and seen prices up to $650 on newegg  Crazy&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong it works great , but the quality of the razor construction is at about $80 tops&lt;br /&gt;I would have a good hunt online before you buy if I were you!!</li>
    <li> This is a great system, BUT-without the proprietary Nivea skin lubricant/conditioner, it&#x27;s just another electric razor. You will note that this Nivea product is shown as unavailable and Amazon does not know if or when it will be available. I called Phillips/Norelco and THEY do not know if or when it will be available. They offered no alternative. Selling a product that requires specific supplies and then not ensuring that those supplies will be available is an appalling lack of customer service. The system works great, but I would avoid buying it-too late for me, but not for you. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This razor is great since its hard for me to get a close shave here in Afghanistan. I love the shave gel option so i can get that close shave</li>
