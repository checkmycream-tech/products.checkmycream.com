    <li> Larger than what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> product as advertised and described.</li>
    <li> Works like it should I got it in a few days after I order it</li>
    <li> Does not work as I had expected it to. Thankfully it was only a few dollars</li>
    <li> not made to actually work like one you see at the dermatologist. It does&#x27;t sit on the skin right so it doesn&#x27;t do anything on either side. It also took WEEKS to get here. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I would send it back but it would take weeks!</li>
    <li> This gets the job done, only on some spots.</li>
    <li> It is worth the money and it works</li>
    <li> Didnt receive the item as pictured - substituted with a different setup - not as good</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. Decently made.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really pop the pimples ..</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how this tool is supposed to work so I don&#x27;t use it. It arrived fine and looks ok but no instructions or anything, just a tool for something. I wished it said something but there wasn&#x27;t even a package. it just came in an envelope so if you know how to use this it should be good for you.</li>
