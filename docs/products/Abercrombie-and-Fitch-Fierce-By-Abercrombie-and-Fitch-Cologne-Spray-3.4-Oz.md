    <li> Wife LOVES this cologne.  Bought it and every time I spray some on, she hugs me and doesn&#x27;t want to let go.  DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> a gift item for a son, really lovely!</li>
    <li> as always, smell is awesome</li>
    <li> First, let me clarify something.&lt;br /&gt;After 30 mins of putting it on, I thought it was fake because I could not even smell even a tiny bit of it any more.&lt;br /&gt;However, the next morning, when I woke up (around 12 hrs after), I could smell it clearly.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is without a doubt, one of the best ever created.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, good product. And great shipping too.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Couldn&#x27;t be happier! I was skeptical but turns out it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> If your thinking of buying this item... Stop thinking and do it now! This is hands down the best cologne I have ever worn!</li>
    <li> IS NOT AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT.  ONCE YOU SMELL IT AND SEE IT&#x27;S COLOR, YOU KNOW IT´S A FAKE COLOGNE SOLD AT THE PRICE OF THE AUTHENTIC ONE.&lt;br /&gt;IT´S JUST SOME KIND OF MIX OF ALCOHOL!!!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long after spraying on body like how it used to be when I buy in the store - quality lessen</li>
    <li> Similar toi Montblanc. It is a very nice scent but wont last long. Expensive considering the brand and the guy in underwear in the bottle</li>
    <li> Weird orange color, smells off, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> we bought this for the price online vs the store price. However bad mistake, this smells like alcohol. We gave it a month of use, and ended up going to the store directly to buy a REAL bottle that the smell lasts forever. Sorry, was not impressed with our package</li>
    <li> This smells awesome on my husband. The bottle is large enough to last a long time and a great anniversary gift! Hopefully wont replace again until next year.</li>
    <li> Although the description says it&#x27;s Abercrombie &amp;  Fitch Fierce. What I got was a cheap imitation knock off. The smell lasts for maybe am hour at most. And isn&#x27;t even the correct color. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> its smell like Mount Blanc but even better , women loving it alot&lt;br /&gt;i love it especially in night time</li>
