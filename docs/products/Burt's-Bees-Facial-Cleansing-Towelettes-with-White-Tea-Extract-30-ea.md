<ol>
    <li> These towelettes make me feel so clean and fresh!! Great for camping!!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant on the face.</li>
    <li> I usually have a terrible relationship with face wipes. They either leave my face oily or they are too dry and do nothing. These leave your face feeling clean and fresh. I never feel any irritation when using this product. Knocking off a star because of the smell (which reminds me of juicy fruit gum!) luckily it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> I love how fresh and clean my face feels when I use these towelettes. My face tends to become greasy by the afternoon, and a few quick swipes of a Burt&#x27;s Bees towelette makes me feel as fresh as I do when I&#x27;m heading out in the morning. They have a nice smell. I am planning to take these towelettes camping, and I know they will easily wipe away the dirt and dust of the campsite.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes. I use them every night to remove my makeup. They also help with my breakouts! They are kind of big, so I cut them in half and get an extra month out of the pack!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. The scent is nice enough, and the towels work very well. Gets the mascara off! I love the snap closure, every one is just as moist as the first. I keep these at my bedside and use them daily. Does not dry out my skin!</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful relaxing smell. Will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love Burts products and this one is no different.  It removes makeup gently and cleanses good too.  My face feels cleaner using these towelettes compared to using a face wash with my hands.  My young daughters don&#x27;t care for the smell so I ordered the unscented for them and it&#x27;s gentle enough for them too (age 9 and 11).</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and these are my favorite cleansing towelettes. Gentle and refreshing, they do a wonderful job of removing my makeup!</li>
    <li> I love these. Way way better than the regular brand name ones -- Burt&#x27;s Bees is all natural and they feel so wonderful on your skin. Instantly feel clean and refreshed.  Others leave &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; type feeling. These are wonderful for your skin. I&#x27;m spoiled!</li>
    <li> These cleansing towelettes are perfect for when you can&#x27;t use a sink for some reason, like when you are camping. They take off all your makeup, even eye makeup, and leave your skin nice and clean and fresh, and the smell is wonderful. I love these for on the go...I keep a pack in my bag. I will continue to repurchase these. Burts Bees makes some of the best products around and these are no exception!</li>
    <li> I love all Burt&#x27;s bees product. I use these  every night. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer. Has no chemical / medicine odor, and cleans her makeup off perfectly at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve even used them once or twice to clean my face - the towelettes are durable and don&#x27;t leave lint behind.</li>

I really love them! Very convenient and affordable.</li>
    <li> A little dry and a little rough, but no irritation (and I tend to be sensitive to lots of brands)</li>
    <li> Your face actually feels clean after using these wipes unlike some other wipes that make your face feel more greasy after</li>
    <li> I love these cleansing towelettes. They do a great job without drying my skin and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I liked them fine, although I like the grapefruit ones better after trying them both.</li>
    <li> Love them. They make my skin feel super soft and clean</li>
    <li> Love these! They are exactly what my face needs!</li>
    <li> I like these for my acne-prone, middle-aged face routine. I&#x27;m also very sensitive to strong scents, and I find these pleasant. I only wish each towel were a bit smaller, or the pack were cheaper, but I cut them in thirds, so it works.</li>
    <li> I use these wipes for my shaved bald head daily. They do not shed on a day or two worth of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell great and are very refreshing.</li>
    <li> These facial towelettes are amazing! No burning or stinging. They are the very best I have tried and I now use only these.</li>
    <li> Bought them in an emergency since my usual organic products were over and I had to wait for them to arrive at the mail. Worst decision ever. Its true they took my facial makeup off (had to use 2) but it burned my skin very badly. I noticed just as I finished using them my face was burning and red. Also felt super dry. Even after 20 minutes, my face felt like it was still burning. Even my eyes turned red and had to use eye drops because I could not take it. I will not buy any other Burt Bee&#x27;s product for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> works great and smells good takes off makeup good</li>
