      <li>My hair is pretty damaged (split ends and very crunchy) from being dyed and bleached.</li>

      <li>i had this product before and got a new one</li>
      <li>I have attached a photo: Left side old straightener, right side Royale Nano straightener.</li>
      <li>I got roped into buying this at a mall kiosk for $80, way more than I usually spend on myself.  </li>

      <li>Brings out the natural oils in hair and leaves it bouncy just as I like.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It was a gift for my mom, but she actually likes the green better anyways</li>
      <li>I have VERY course hair and for the longest time I was looking for a flat iron that could get my hair straight without an extreme blow out.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine from here! I actually bought mine from the actual company! i got it for $180 and on the website it is $300. It is really great!!!!!!!!!!! i just luv it! it is so amazing!!!!!!!!!!! iT is 100% ceramia. but dont buy it from amazon cuz they r usually used or broken!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works really good on my course hair. Brings out the natural oils in hair and leaves it bouncy just as I like.</li>
    <li> Love these flat irons! They get hot quickly and stay hot!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get mine here but I payed $120 this is such a good deal, plus the flat iron works wonders</li>
    <li> Great pair of flat irons....I love them!!!</li>
    <li> I used it one time, it dropped on my hard wood floor and broke.  The warranty didn&#x27;t cover it.  You&#x27;d think it would - it&#x27;s not like it fell on cement.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to use more than 3 times in the same part of the hair to get it straight. It is really powerful and you can adjust to the temperature you want.</li>
    <li> love my hair straightener.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  I got it because a friend recommended it and I have not been disappointed.  She swears by hers.  I was a little skeptical at first because I have natural hair but it really does get it straight and even my co-workers are asking if I got a perm.</li>
    <li> Just what my sisters wanted! They had one before which was pink and purchased for $75 at the mall. That broke because it was dropped so we purchased this on and they&#x27;re happy!</li>
    <li> Poorly made product. i purchased this product at a local mall in the Fall of 2013. This flat-iron literally fell apart within 1 year, and with very limited use.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I got roped into buying this at a mall kiosk for $80, way more than I usually spend on myself.  I liked it as a straightener but couldn&#x27;t curl my hair with it like the lady at the mall could.  A piece of the ceramic came off too.  It still works, but it just randomly chipped off once and it would have cost a lot to ship it and get it replaced so I just lived with it.  It works well, but it was way overpriced and frustrating that a piece broke off.</li>
    <li> Very unsatisfactory service.  I purchased from this company and the irons were warped.  They refused to do anything about it..said I should have opened the box and checked it first (as he always did with his purchases).  This is purchasing in person...online there is no warranty and according to the salesman there is no money back policy at all.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the performance and price of Royale Ceramics.  I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Saw this at the mall for $135.00. Looked it up on Amazon, purchased it for $40.00. LOVE it!!!! Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this hot iron worked great for about a week. Then wont get hot.</li>
    <li> i had this product before and got a new one and it is defective and when i plugged it in for the first time it died and would not turn back on, very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I am super impress by this iron for the results and for the price. I loved my friends and decided to try and purchase for less on line. I got it for 1/3 the price. Resulting in me buying two.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair curling iron I got it,it&#x27;s v easy to manipulate ,light in wight ,gives very nice curls.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed without the ridiculous price at the mall.</li>
    <li> I saw this in the mall at a kiosk for twice the money and this one is the exact brand that they were selling. This straightener works perfect. The heat is adjustable and the ceramic area is large enough to do a large section of my hair. My hair is waist length and I only use it once a month to limit the damage that heat may cause.</li>
    <li> it is just ok, thought it would be a lot better</li>
    <li> I have VERY course hair and for the longest time I was looking for a flat iron that could get my hair straight without an extreme blow out. THIS FLAT IRON IS THEE BEST THUS FAR!!! I promise you wont be disappointed! It was delivered in a very timely matter and came in a great package including clips to help with styling! THIS THING DOES THE JOB BABY!! not only does it get your hair bone straight, but it also gives you hair a great shine finish without the oily base! GET IT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the real product. It&#x27;s a clever shell but it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Love. Straightens my hair really fast and leaves it feeling really soft</li>
    <li> Giving this 3 stars as i ordered purple but received green, otherwise it would have been a 5. It was a gift for my mom, but she actually likes the green better anyways so its a win still. great straightener!</li>
    <li> it does not heat up fast at all. Then it does not get that hot. Does not stand up to what they said it would do. Very mad about it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a stylist for 22+ years and this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used. Straight hair is soft and silky; curls last all day. So glad I found it here at a great price and not the $250 they wanted for it at the mall!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! My hair is pretty damaged (split ends and very crunchy) from being dyed and bleached. I try to straighten it to make the puffy mess of hair look a bit better (I know I should cut it but I&#x27;m waiting for it to get a little longer). With my old straightener my hair still looked very damaged and puffy. This straightener actually makes my hair look less damaged!  I have attached a photo: Left side old straightener, right side Royale Nano straightener.</li>
    <li> Really love these flat iorns. 😊</li>
    <li> These are great. My wife loves them. Her hair is so coarse and after using the irons for the first time, her hair came out smooth and shiny.</li>
