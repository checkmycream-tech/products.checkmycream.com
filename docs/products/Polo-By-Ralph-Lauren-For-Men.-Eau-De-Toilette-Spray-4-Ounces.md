      <li>My favorite men&#x27;s cologne!</li>
      <li>My husband has worn this cologne for over thirty-five years now and I love it too!  </li>
      <li>That being said, the Bleu De Chanel samples are awesome and highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Received as listed and in excellent new condition!  </li>
      <li>Love the smell of it on my hubby</li>
      <li>Most Men&#x27;s cologne smells as Women&#x27;s cologne with a splash of Manly scent added.</li>
      <li>Some AVON after shave is better.</li>
      <li>Its &#x27;ok&#x27;, not something I&#x27;d heartily recommend.</li>
      <li>most people dont buy a cologne or perfume online without ever smelling it</li>
      <li>amazon love love all your products</li>
      <li>I love the scent of Polo.</li>
      <li>My husband loves this basic Polo, as well as many who comment to him when he&#x27;s wearing it !!!</li>
      <li>Very strong, so, go lightly until you know your smell capacity.  </li>
      <li>it makes my life so easy</li>
      <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and if you already like it, you may as well save the money and buy it online and get free shipping too.</li>
      <li>enjoy buying on line</li>
      <li>I always get compliments when I wear the Polo original.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and have had positive comments ... not to mention the fact that it drives my girl friend (soon to be wife</li>
      <li>This will last for a good amount of time.  </li>
      <li>Amazon has always been good to deal with, so I go to do a return, only to find I cannot return this.</li>
      <li>It was shipped and arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Polo cologne has a very unique scent, that is characterized by leather and pine fragrance notes, distinguishing it from the more common spice and citrus scents, that are so popular today.</li>
      <li>Nice big bottle.  </li>
      <li>It is a little strong initially, maybe even overpowering at first, but then it mellows, and has a nice forest/woods feel, not citrusy, that is nice.  </li>
      <li>The original Polo cologne by Ralph Lauren, is a classic cologne for men that was first introduced in 1978.</li>
      <li>I have been using this brand for 2 years...and will buy the same again when this one empties :)</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I had never smelled anything quite like it and it, at first ...</li>
      <li>My girl friend suggested this fragrance and I will admit that when I first tried it, it caught me by surprise.  </li>
      <li>Despite a great deal on the 4oz size vs. the 2oz size, this Polo doesn&#x27;t smell like the Polo (standard, green bottle, original)</li>
      <li>Polo cologne is a truly great scent, that is very invigorating when it is first applied, and that will last all day long.</li>
      <li>Its lasts a long time, and can seem pleasant enough.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, I give the classic Polo cologne for men by Ralph Lauren my highest recommendation!  </li>
      <li>A little pricey, but worth it to smell better then your grandpa.  </li>
      <li>I was fortunate enough to receive a two-ounce bottle of the Polo splash cologne as a birthday gift in 1978, shortly after it became commercially available, and I have been using it ever since that time.</li>
      <li>its much cheaper here</li>
      <li>Very earthy smell to it much recommended for all occasions.</li>
      <li>or if it is the real deal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s classic, classy and bold.   </li>
      <li>Polo cologne is very powerful, and it must be applied sparingly, but it will last for the entire work day, which is the most essential feature for any cologne.</li>
      <li>was a little on the strong side to suit my taste.  </li>
      <li>Not much to say about this other than that it&#x27;s a classic and one of my favorite colognes...</li>
      <li>This is the only cologne that my husband really likes...</li>
      <li>, I was surprised to find it at the price I did on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>However, when I go to the fragrance counter at stores and sample a ton of fragrances, I have to admit that I don&#x27;t really find Ralph Lauren fragrances appeal to me personally.  </li>
      <li>As a teenage boy, he is really looking to impress the ladies.</li>
      <li>It may seem old school, but the ladies of the year 2012 still like it or maybe they just like me.</li>
      <li>Spent too much $ on this 4 this 2 happen!</li>
      <li>This is one of two classic sents from the 80&#x27;s the other being Drakkar.</li>
      <li>In contrast, most other brands of cologne for men have rather limited longevity, and only last for a few hours.</li>

    <li> best! smells wonderful with a lasting effect...</li>

    <li> The original Polo cologne by Ralph Lauren, is a classic cologne for men that was first introduced in 1978.

    <li> Good size for the price! This was requested by my fiance.</li>
    <li> My girl friend suggested this fragrance and I will admit that when I first tried it, it caught me by surprise.  I had never smelled anything quite like it and it, at first ... was a little on the strong side to suit my taste.  Now I will wear nothing else.  I love the fragrance and have had positive comments ... not to mention the fact that it drives my girl friend (soon to be wife) crazy.  A little on the expensive side, but a little goes a long way, so in the long run, I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellalnt service and excellant product</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance. Deep and sultry. A little woodsy, and musk.  Very strong, so, go lightly until you know your smell capacity.  A little pricey, but worth it to smell better then your grandpa.  This is the fragrance that launched the house of Lauren.  And now you know why. It&#x27;s classic, classy and bold.   You&#x27;ll smell like a million bucks, even if you work at Wal-mart.</li>
    <li> Despite a great deal on the 4oz size vs. the 2oz size, this Polo doesn&#x27;t smell like the Polo (standard, green bottle, original) I am used to.  Smells like Brut cologne.  Soapy.  Disappointed.  Stick with the 2oz sizes and best to smell before you buy (at the store) perhaps?  That being said, the Bleu De Chanel samples are awesome and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Received as listed and in excellent new condition!  My husband has worn this cologne for over thirty-five years now and I love it too!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this basic Polo, as well as many who comment to him when he&#x27;s wearing it !!!</li>

    <li> This is one of two classic sents from the 80&#x27;s the other being Drakkar. It may seem old school, but the ladies of the year 2012 still like it or maybe they just like me.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Polo. I have been out for a while so when I saw it on Amazon I purchased it.  I always get compliments when I wear the Polo original.</li>
    <li> It is a little strong initially, maybe even overpowering at first, but then it mellows, and has a nice forest/woods feel, not citrusy, that is nice.  However, when I go to the fragrance counter at stores and sample a ton of fragrances, I have to admit that I don&#x27;t really find Ralph Lauren fragrances appeal to me personally.  I got this as a gift, and probably would not have bought this one myself.  Its lasts a long time, and can seem pleasant enough.  Its &#x27;ok&#x27;, not something I&#x27;d heartily recommend.</li>
    <li> Polo is always the best and the best price is from Amazon always. You can not find a cheaper price anywhere.</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift to my dad ... really good...</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne that my husband really likes...one bottle will last him 4 years!!  I have to admit, I was surprised to find it at the price I did on Amazon.  Very happy with the purchase...happy husband, happy wife always leads to happy life!!!</li>
    <li> Already shopping for Christmas 2014 and this is among the favorites.  I buy this every year for the same person and it always goes over well!</li>
    <li> What can I say?... it&#x27;s polo at a great price... My wife loves it!...</li>
    <li> Bottle was leaking upon receipt. Today the tube to the sprayer came loose inside, with no way to fix! Spent too much $ on this 4 this 2 happen! Uhhhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few days later, got refund, and don&#x27;t get me wrong -we love Polo!!</li>
    <li> Not Wild about it.. Some AVON after shave is better.</li>
    <li> The best cologne available for Men. Most Men&#x27;s cologne smells as Women&#x27;s cologne with a splash of Manly scent added. Not this one, it&#x27;s all male.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with others...this is NOT Polo cologne...it is after-shave...watered down so the fragrance fades within an hour of putting it on.  The real cologne lasts all day and a little goes a long way (short spray on either side of the neck is all you need).  Won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> this isnt a review of how polo smells. most people dont buy a cologne or perfume online without ever smelling it so im assuming you already like the scent if youre here. my 5 stars are because this product is 15-20 bucks more expensive for the exact same bottle if you buy it at the big dept store that throws the parade in nyc. its much cheaper here and if you already like it, you may as well save the money and buy it online and get free shipping too.</li>
    <li> Good price and packaging.</li>
    <li> Nice big bottle.  This will last for a good amount of time.  Can&#x27;t find this in the store&#x27;s anymore.</li>
    <li> Just like store bought</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it on my hubby</li>
    <li> Gift to hubby!  He smells so good!</li>
    <li> I  started using this spray recently and it looses its scent about 1/2 hour after I put it on. I don&#x27;t know if it is a counterfit product or if it is the real deal. I have purchased Polo before and the scent of the product can be noticed the next day.Polo in the past was a (almost pungent) cologne. What I recieved was some very weak Polo which loses it&#x27;s scent quickly. I have tried to find a way to contact and return the item and can&#x27;t seem to get through to amazon</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Polo since 1985, I know what Polo smells like. My wife of 27 years keeps me supplied with Polo by way of birthdays and Christmas. Polo bought in stores has always smelled the same all these years. I was down to  a few squirts  so I just decided to buy from Amazon. I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is or what has happened to it but it smells terrible, almost putrid. Amazon has always been good to deal with, so I go to do a return, only to find I cannot return this. I guess I just learned a $65 life lesson here.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for his birthday.  It was shipped and arrived quickly.  The price was a little cheaper then at a department store plus I didn&#x27;t have to drive to a mall to buy it.</li>
    <li> Yes it was .I enjoy buying on line it makes my life so easy thank you amazon love love all your products</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  My favorite men&#x27;s cologne!</li>

    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for a member of my family.  As a teenage boy, he is really looking to impress the ladies.</li>
    <li> It was for a gift and my cousin is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Polo is the bomb... Never fades ...polo has a lasting whiff</li>
    <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
    <li> This must be a knock-off. It does not have the same scent as the ones I have purchase at stores.  It is very weak and the scent is gone within an hour or two - disappointed. I won&#x27;t purchase again. .</li>
    <li> i like this item alot</li>
