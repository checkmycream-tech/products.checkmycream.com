    <li> It finally came last night, I use this before I apply the aloe gel also by nature republic! I woke up the next morning and my skin was extremely smooth. Although I have some visibly large blemishes and have some pimples, I cannot feel the texture of those after using this toner + the aloe gel.</li>
    <li> Very gentle to my skin</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this toner!  Lovely,  light scent,  not drying. I have dry/combination skin and this is the only toner I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>

    <li> The size of the packing was smaller than i expected. It&#x27;s about the size of my hand, but it has a lot of product in it. I only use a few drops of this for my daily routine.

    <li> I have combo-oily skin, that has been clear for most of my life. Recently it has been breaking out really bad and there was dead skin that wasn&#x27;t shedding (dry, dull patches). After trying various things, I stumbled upon this product and ordered out of desperation. This product took care of these issues for me. I still have acne scars that will fade in due time, but my skin is smooth and more supple. The only con is how small it is for how much I paid, but that is minimized compared to the results.</li>

    <li> works fine.&lt;br /&gt;better than another regular toners.(at least for me &#x3D;p)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent. It does do a very efficient job at cleaning the oil and dirt off of skin, but it also felt irritating and caused some redness. It definitely did not moisturize for me. I should add that my skin is not particularly sensitive, and it&#x27;s combination. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> Feels good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty good Aloe liquid to keep face moisturized daily.</li>
    <li> I like this. It&#x27;s light and fresh and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great toner! Doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin and cleans off all the excess dirt and make up left after you have washed it! It&#x27;s a great product and will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> very nice if you dont want to irritate your skin becuase of the aloe vera. the most sensitive skin types can use this.</li>
    <li> This toner is wonderful! I have enlarged pores on my nose and after using this for a week, I can already see an improvement. It&#x27;s not drying and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell. My skin tone is so much better than it was before using this!</li>
    <li> Gave it a week, and my skin was soft and moist. I&#x27;d vouch for this product any day.</li>
    <li> Used this after a face wash, and it was amazing! I usually use cream moisturizers and they leave my face oily after a while. I didn&#x27;t think this would make my face feel as moisturized as it did, and it was not oily at all. It also has a very refreshing smell!</li>
    <li> not bad for the price!</li>
    <li> Very nice product, makes my skin soft and glowy. The service is excellent, together with it I received as well a sample of skin masks. Thank Nature Republic!</li>
