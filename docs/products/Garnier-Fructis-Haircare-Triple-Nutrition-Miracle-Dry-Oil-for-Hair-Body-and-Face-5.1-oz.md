      <li>It looks wonderful on skin especially on the arms, elbows, knees, and legs even on the neck line.</li>
      <li>If you use this on the face I would use it sparingly on the forehead or greater surface area of the cheeks.  </li>
      <li>and it has cleared up the eczema even better than the prescription.</li>
      <li>I love Garnier, most products, but the scent of this is blah.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fabulous for hair!</li>
      <li>What I really REALLY love from Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Nutrient Spray.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this this product to many people who are looking for nourishment/moisture to their body/face/hair.  </li>
      <li>Garnier has given many the results they are seeking, and advertised is correct as described.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This gives my hair a lovely sheen and brings out the wave, without frizz.</li>
      <li>many uses one bottle</li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t prevent me from using it, but if I wore perfume or scented lotion, it would be more of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance, and it is inexpensive as well.</li>
      <li>The smell is okay.</li>
      <li>try it you will love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon b/c</li>
      <li>Warning though, use a light touch!</li>
      <li>I would love if it smelled like apples or almonds, I love almond scent.</li>
      <li>I do not like the shape of the bottle, although it is visually appealing,</li>
      <li>But this one is makes my hair more manageable and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better off just to use Not your mothers products that smell better and don&#x27;t make you a greaseball</li>
      <li>I love an oil/spray, but not if it can&#x27;t blend in and not look oily.</li>
      <li>and I have had many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I LOVE Garnier products</li>
      <li>Love it on hair as we&#x27;ll...</li>
      <li>I will use this more toward winter in the evening, but it&#x27;s just another product that I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>I love this triple nutrition oil for hair, face and body.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product......smells like summer.</li>
      <li>I found this product in WAL MART, and when I went to get more, I could not find it anywhere, and not in any of the oyther stores I looked in.</li>
      <li>but if you cut off your damaged hair and then start using this, it will keep the ends nourished and healthy</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product and the results I have seen since using this product, as a hair/face/body regime.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hopefully it will do something really great for someone else, since it has amazing reviews elsewhere on the &#x27;Net.</li>
      <li>I have used the garnier thicker oils to pull out rod sets and roller sets,although this says it&#x27;s for the face,I wouldn&#x27;t dare apply it to my face,however I enjoy this,it has a light scent and are very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair super soft, manageable, and smells incredible.</li>
      <li>The fragance is too strong.  </li>
      <li>meant that I went through it all the more quickly since it was everywhere</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helped my hair a lot, it does give a nice shine but really does not make my hair greasy looking.</li>
      <li>Does add light oil to body, no problem except on face where I break out.</li>
      <li>fabulous for feet and for legs.</li>
      <li>That I could use it to smooth the frizz on a humid day</li>
      <li>Even with light use on the ends of my damp hair, it still ends up oily and greasy.</li>
      <li>Nice but smells too much like avocadoes.</li>
      <li>Put any amount of this oil on your hair and you will instantly be transformed, as though you had joined the ranks of the \\&quot;great unwashed\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It has helped smooth the dry/frizzy ends.</li>
      <li>Fabulous stuff</li>
      <li>Works great for my dry feet and elbows too.</li>
      <li>Great for dry, aging hair</li>
      <li>It is also great for suoer dry skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my hair - which can get dry and out of control - and it was great for that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d heard so many positive reviews that I had to buy some to see what the fuss was about.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff! I have fine, thin hair and it makes it so soft. I only need one spray. If you use too much it will make your hair look stringy and oily. Easy does it!  This bottle will last me a long time.  It is also great for suoer dry skin. Use after a shower or bath.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME!!! I have SJOGRENS SYNDROME, which causes all skin and tissues to dry out. It is PAINFUL to say the least. I have tried all products (within my $ range) and NOTHING worked! Until I found GARNIER FRUCTIS TRIPLE NUTRITION MIRACLE DRY HAIR AND SKIN. It is just AWESOME!! FROM HEAD TO TOE AWESOME!!! It has a very lite smell, and the oil is QUICKLY ABSORBD, and leaves no oily feel, just SMOOTH AND SOFT SKIN, and my HAIR IS SOFT AND SHINY.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I found this product in WAL MART, and when I went to get more, I could not find it anywhere, and not in any of the oyther stores I looked in. Not even in CVS. I found it online here in AMAZON, for the EXACT same price I paid at WAL MART, AND FREE SHIPPING too! I will continue to buy this product from AMAZON...THANKS AMAZON...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair look so sleek and beautiful, and my skin glow.</li>
    <li> Nice but smells too much like avocadoes. Great as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Some say that this product makes your hair greazy and oily, I did not find that it makes my hair oily at all. I concentrate the oil at the ends of my hair, only apply 2 pumps max if you think that it is making your hair oily. I have used many dry hair oils as my hair is long and I want my hair to continue to grow healthy and chose this product because it was cheaper than my usual hair oil, so I took a chance on this. I also want to mention that I actually have very oil hair and skin naturally and find that this product does not make my hair oily-again, only apply to the ends of your hair. My hair is definitely less frizzy, super shiny, and soft. The only down side is, everyone kept touching my hair and asking how i had gotten to make it look and feel so healthy. Great product, use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Awful. No matter how small the amount, I look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for weeks. I saw somebody else say they used it for shaving, so I may try that so I&#x27;m didn&#x27;t completely waste my money. Am going straight back to L&#x27;Oreal Multi-Restorative Total Repair dry oil - I should have never strayed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard so many positive reviews that I had to buy some to see what the fuss was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination-dry skin,  which is also very sensitive.  I&#x27;m a henna addict,  and my hair is about two inches longer than my chin.  My hair is quite fine,  too,  and there&#x27;s a natural wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small amount on my hair ends: not much difference other than my hair felt weighed down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on my skin: It doesn&#x27;t do anything bad - it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face:  When I&#x27;m really, really dry I use baby oil or coconut oil and they&#x27;re lighter, more effective and fairly idiot proof. Garnier&#x27;s product feels heavier, greasy and just not something I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically it has a very limited use for me, but the bigger problem was that any potentially great results are completely overshadowed by what is honestly one of the most foul-smelling beauty products I&#x27;ve ever encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even put my finger on it - without looking at the ingredients, the smell is sort of honey, sort of sickly, sort of rancid. Maybe a generic sort of &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will do something really great for someone else, since it has amazing reviews elsewhere on the &#x27;Net.</li>
    <li> For starters I&#x27;m male, so for guys looking for skin care products that will make your skin look less like a you&#x27;ve been rolling around in gravel and look smoother this product seems to do it for me. I have combination skin (facial area) and my forehead and cheeks are normally awaiting hydration to hit while my T-zone and nose needs less of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair and skin this is a great product. for bodily skin you just spray, rub, and go. Hair is a bit tricky this is a nice product for all hair types it seems, but I have thick wavy/ curly hair that gets a lot of volume and frizz D: When it&#x27;s not kept short.&lt;br /&gt;  I would suggest towel drying your hair (let it still be somewhat damp) and then using the oil, if you want an even coverage you can comb it through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My hair is normally craving hydration to fight the humidly arid climate in Georgia. This product did help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but for facial skin a little more could be desired:&lt;br /&gt;  For acne prone skin yes you can use this product one of the ingredients is olive oil which inhibits the growth of the acne causing bacteria, no it does not clog pores (as far s I can tell and this is from using the bottle until the very last drop for over a month)&lt;br /&gt;but I used it sparingly. Like I&#x27;ve stated above this is better for hair and body it seems. Guys this can be used as a moisturizer but it will make you have shiny patches of skin so wait about an hour or two to use it after you&#x27;ve shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As for the ladies, Once again it can be used effectively on hair to give it a nice shine and if you straighten your hair I would suggest to use it because as a Dry oil is gives shine without weighing hair down and some women and girls totally need it after frying their hair for ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt; It looks wonderful on skin especially on the arms, elbows, knees, and legs even on the neck line. If you use this on the face I would use it sparingly on the forehead or greater surface area of the cheeks.  Be selective about where you use. A suggestion would be along the cheek bones or any other area that you want to have a shine or highlight on even if you don&#x27;t wear make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product  time and time again (because it&#x27;s the only that seems to hydrate my thirsty and at times lifeless hair without it feeling stiff or weighed down and without me having to invest in a expensive conditioner).</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous for hair! Very satisfied. Leaves it shiny and in great condition, and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect multi-tasking product that gives my hair sheen and manageability and leaves my skin soft and fragranced. I always take this when traveling. My hair is very fine and wavy and extremely frazzled and dry from a recent foil highlighting. This gives my hair a lovely sheen and brings out the wave, without frizz. However, I do not apply it on the top of my head or at the hairline where my hair is thinner and finer, because it makes it looks greasy. A great dry oil to use on legs after shaving, while the skin is still damp and also helps smooth rough hands, heels and elbows. I love the fragrance, and it is inexpensive as well. GOOD STUFF!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this oil on my hair.  I use it on my feet.  I have very dry, cracked heels and I massage this oil into my feet and seal it in with Gold Bond Restoring lotion with CoQ10.  Afterwards, my feet feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when ordering it, but the product does indeed work nicely for my hair as well as my skin. It has a very very faint pleasing scent and seems to add life back to my hair and feels silky on my skin. I do not like the shape of the bottle, although it is visually appealing, once I get some of the product in my hands, it&#x27;s very difficult to grasp and spritz again. It&#x27;s too slippery. Great product though!</li>
    <li> I have very good results with this product on my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Love Love This Oil!! I use it when shaving my legs. It leaves my legs feeling soft and helps limit the razor burn feeling I get. It has been getting hard to find in stores but once I found it here I stocked up! I don&#x27;t use it on my face, oil + my face &#x3D; ZITS. I have used this on my hair. I have dry hair from constantly coloring it but I use this on the ends only. It has helped smooth the dry/frizzy ends. I spray it on towel dried hair and used it sparingly - too much will leave your hair greasy. The spray comes out in a light mist, so a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Still, I would not buy this product again. Half the day&#x27;s over, and STILL my hair looks wet/greasy. One coworker even jokingly mentioned that my hair looks like a wig -- and I agree (hair has a weird shiny-plastic look). It&#x27;d be great if I could return this. Two stars instead of one &#x27;cause it stopped my hair from getting frizzy again, but I plan to wash this stuff out as soon as I get home. Oh, and smells like baby powder :/</li>
    <li> I love Garnier, most products, but the scent of this is blah. Just smells like olive oil to me. It&#x27;s too oily to just spray on my hair, so I put it in my hands, a tiny bit and use on my ends. I only spray it on my hair if I plan on putting my hair in a bun then washing it out or you&#x27;ll look like a grease fest. I love an oil/spray, but not if it can&#x27;t blend in and not look oily. I have a different spray that is an oil, but dries on hair completely soft/not oily, so I was disappointed that this is not great. I tried it on my face which was fine, and normally my face is very sensitive, but again, oily can end up with breakouts so I&#x27;ve only tried that once. I will use this more toward winter in the evening, but it&#x27;s just another product that I won&#x27;t buy again. I LOVE Garnier products as most are apple scented, but this is a no scent, boring scent, weird scent. I would love if it smelled like apples or almonds, I love almond scent. I also agree with some other posts about the bottle is shaped weird so it&#x27;s slippery, thus also why I don&#x27;t like to spray it into my hair as it slips. Not cool.</li>
    <li> good for hair body lips u name it. many uses one bottle</li>
    <li> I love this oil, you can apply it on your skin or hair, light and smells great. We use it regularly and the spray works very well.</li>
    <li> Like it, very lovely texture,easy to use, but bottle size is too wide fot my  hand :)</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local grocery store and i can&#x27;t say i&#x27;m fond of it. Even with light use on the ends of my damp hair, it still ends up oily and greasy. I hated this product enough to complain to the actual company. I haven&#x27;t used it on my skin yet but I may give it to my boyfriend considering most of the successful reviews are from men. So this product doesn&#x27;t work for fine, white girl hair. What I really REALLY love from Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Nutrient Spray. It leaves my hair super soft, manageable, and smells incredible. Over one month of use has left my hair in such a better shape than it was in previously.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the worst dry oil product on the market.  The only reason for using this is to acquire a completely neglected and unwashed hair look in no time at all.  I have been using it very successfully however, as a WOOD FURNITURE POLISH.  Not even kidding.</li>
    <li> I use spray oil on my daughter&#x27;s hair every day. We use [[ASIN:B00GTBZXTC Suave Professionals Light Oil Spray, Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil &amp; White Orchid 3 oz]]. It works great but smells a little strong for my personal taste so I wanted to give this one a try as well. What a disaster. I (attempted to) lightly mist both our hair before I took her to preschool and by the time we got there our brushed hair had separated into greasy strings. I was so embarrassed at the way she looked I had to explain it to her teacher so she wouldn&#x27;t think my kid had wet hair all day. Part of the problem is that this stuff is just greasy, and part of the problem is that it doesn&#x27;t mist, it sprays, so you can&#x27;t get an even application. It&#x27;s awful.</li>
    <li> Great for dry, aging hair</li>
    <li> I used to have dry, curly hair. Now that I use this it looks wonderful and feels great too! So if you have dry hair, use this when you get out of the shower. You will notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product......smells like summer.</li>
    <li> I only use this on my skin, not on my hair. Moisturizes really well and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> its okay, the fragrance could be a little nicer</li>
    <li> i see this product from magazine then i purchase from amazon&lt;br /&gt;my hair kind of dry and malnutrition thank you again..</li>
    <li> I love this triple nutrition oil for hair, face and body. I use it after I shower along with the Garnier Fructis &amp;#34;Daily Care Silky Secret Leave-In&amp;#34; spray. Warning though, use a light touch! I usually spray it in my hands and then work it into my hair while it is still wet. Then I rub my hands together to use whatever is left over as a hand moisturizer. My hair tends to be dry, so I love this oil. It is a bit difficult to use the spray if you are spraying it directly onto your hair, because the bottle gets slippery. Plus it&#x27;s hard to keep track of how much you&#x27;re using -- another reason why I spray it into my hands and then apply it that way. The oils are avocado, almond and olive oil ... the only thing I would improve is to include argon oil, which is included in many of these Garnier nourishing products. I just buy argon oil by itself and apply a small amount of that to face and hair. I have not used this Garnier Triple Nutrition oil as a body moisturizer but I would imagine it would be similar to applying it to my hands -- it is very fast to absorb and does not feel oily after a few minutes. Definitely love this product!!</li>
    <li> Eh, made my hair look a tad greasy. Great for the skin though, but I just wouldn&#x27;t tout it as a 3 in 1.</li>
    <li> I tried this product with and without wet hair and it did not work on my hair. I did not try to use it in the shower and it may be just what I should have done. It may work of others but I did not keep it.</li>
    <li> Has a light pleasant fragrance.  Feels nice on my skin without being sticky or oily.  It&#x27;s not quite as lasting or silky skin feeling as NUXE Huile Prodigieuse (my fav), but for the price, it&#x27;s great for everyday use on feet and elbows.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I have purchased Garnier Fructis Nutrition Miracle Dry Oil for Hair, Face and Body.  The first time I purchased it, I used it primarily for my skin/body, found that once applied a very greasy film, but absorbed into my skin within a matter of seconds, giving a sheen look without the greasy look or feeling, I was amazed.  The second time I used it primarily for my hair which made my hair softer and shiny.  This time I am using it for Hair, Face, and Body.  I like the fact that it includes avocado, almond, and olive oil necessary nourishment for the body/hair/skin.  The packaging was neat and enclosed in a separate bag, and delivery was on time.  This product can last quite a while depending on use, and the smell is nice, not strong or over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Garnier has given many the results they are seeking, and advertised is correct as described.  It allows people to see what type of results can be expected from using their products.  I would recommend this this product to many people who are looking for nourishment/moisture to their body/face/hair.  I have noticed that the men in my household are also using it for their skin, hair and body.  I am pleased with the product and the results I have seen since using this product, as a hair/face/body regime. The price varies depending on the store purchased from, the most reasonable price I have seen this product is on the Amazon website.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Put a small amount on your tired or puffy face and voila, you look more fresh than ever!  This product has been a godsend for dry winter season.  I use it both on my face and body.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, it is pretty subtle.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily and is perfect to combat static.</li>
    <li> I noticed that a majority of people did not have success with this product on their hair, but it depends on your hair type. If you have thin or straight hair, this product will definitely not work for you; however, if you have thick curly hair it will do wonders. My hair is naturely extremly coarse and thick, and this product makes it much softer and much more manageable. I recommend using it on dry hair prior to styling. If you use it on wet hair it will not prevent frizz. If you use it after you style your hair, you will probably end up with hair that looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed. Another thing I love about this product is that it allows me to brush through my extremely curly hair without making the curls frizzy or making them go flat. I love this product, but once again it only works on a very specific hair type in a very specific manner.</li>
    <li> Use this product regularly on my hair and scalp. I like the smell and the results on my hair are great.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel oily which is a plus.</li>
    <li> * for best results, do use sparingly! *&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly, frizzy, dry, hair. I use this right after I get out of the shower and spray 4 spritz aprox. Then comb. It&#x27;s helped my hair a lot, it does give a nice shine but really does not make my hair greasy looking. I wouldn&#x27;t however, recommend using this is straight hair or dry hair. It&#x27;s best used on wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for skin: I&#x27;ve used this on my legs, and it gave them great hydration!! I&#x27;ve also used it on my face, I have acne, and oily skin...using this in replacement of a moisturizer....I&#x27;ve noticed actually LESS oil! No breakouts either.</li>
    <li> The oil itself is nice. It&#x27;s not too greasy and absorbs really quick. The smell is okay. Not very pleasant but not bad either. Why the 1 star? The spray bottle is horrible!!!!  After the very first spray it started dripping if you tip it to one side. This gets messy when you&#x27;re spraying yourself.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I have very dry, frizzy hair and even a small amount made it look like I hadn&#x27;t showered in weeks. The first time I tried to use it I just tried spraying it directly on my hair from about 8-10 inches away. Terrible idea, it sprayed one spot of my hair and I had to quickly rewash it because it was so oily. The second time I used it I sprayed a little in my hands and put it in my hair like you would a leave in conditioner and still it was overly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I found it useful for was shaving my legs outside of the shower, it did a good job of moisturizing. It did clog the razor so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest doing that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sole reason I decided to write this review was because I noticed today that there seemed to be mold growing inside the lid and on the pump of the bottle. I have never seen this on any other product, and it&#x27;s a little disturbing to me.</li>
    <li> For hair, as many have said before, a little goes a long way.  For my waist length hair I only use 2 &amp;#34;spritzes&amp;#34; in my hand and rub into the bottom half of my wet hair and it works well.  On skin, like that it penetrates fairly quickly without leaving a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I do NOT like about it is it&#x27;s aroma.  For me, it&#x27;s not a pleasant scent at all</li>
    <li> It works well without greasy buildup.</li>
    <li> I used this as a pre-shampoo conditioner.  I loved it!  You use just a few drops before shampooing. This aided in the effectiveness of my shampoo.  The result was softer, fuller hair.  My hair is very think but with a fine texture.  It is curly in the back and straight up front (naturally), this makes it difficult to find things that work for my hair.  This Product calmed down the crazy hair I normally see and allowed for a more uniform look without much need for styling.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome ! I have thick natural curly hair . I spray 2 squirts in my hair after washing it and it detangles ans brings a shine. If you have wild , dull looking tangle prone hair you owe it to yourself to grab Miracle oil. You can use this on your skin too! Gets rid of any dryness on the knees , elbows feet or anyplace ya got a dry patch. I am a Miracle oil user for life!</li>
    <li> this is so NOT what i thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> Very oily makes hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Yes, the label says you can spray it directly onto dry hair in order to give it shine, but let&#x27;s be real, that&#x27;s a terrible idea. You have to remember that this product is straight oil. so spraying it right on your hair is going to make it look. . .oily. Now, I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months, and I have been very satisfied with is. I apply it by spraying a generous amount onto my hairbrush, and then working through my damp hair after showering, starting at the tips and working up to the roots. This way, the dry ends of my hair get the highest dose, and my roots just get enough to make them shiny. I have also used this method of brushing through on dry hair to give it more shine and to hydrate my tips, which does work, but I have to caution you to be wise about where you first pull the brush through because that spot may end up looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my hair type. I have long, thick, straight hair that was severely damaged at the tips. This oil isn&#x27;t going to fix any damage (it&#x27;s not one of those seal up your split ends types) but if you cut off your damaged hair and then start using this, it will keep the ends nourished and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I recently started using this on my skin as a moisturizer and it truly does feel great. You can use it on your face (very sparingly! and don&#x27;t spray!) or work it into the skin on your body. I like to spray a couple times on my palms and then work it onto my arms and legs- it warms up as you rub it and feels like a massage oil or something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: this product works great if you use it properly and sparingly on your hair, and it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer. I might move on to a coconut oil treatment for my hair, but I will keep this around as a moisturizer, and I would fully recommend this to anyone who wants a cheaper oil treatment.</li>
    <li> I sprayed it on my hair like other spray I used before. And it felt like I just got out of a swimming pool full of oil. It&#x27;s super oily and makes my hair looks all wet and dirty-looking. Never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother.  Too watery.  The fragance is too strong.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better off just to use Not your mothers products that smell better and don&#x27;t make you a greaseball</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really keep my hair healthy but since my hair is dry, I use this oil as it doesn&#x27;t have a bad odour nor does it have an oily feeling.</li>
    <li> This is making my hair less dry and shining. I have dry curly hair and had tried other products before. But this one is makes my hair more manageable and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon b/c it&#x27;s getting harder to find in stores. I have very long hair and a little spritz after the shower and the knots practically fall loose and my hair dries shinny &amp;healthy looking. Works great for my dry feet and elbows too. I don&#x27;t recommend using it on your face because it seems like it would clog pores and gives the look of an oily sheen. Too much in the hair will do the same there too. Priced equivalent to what I pay at the stores and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Put any amount of this oil on your hair and you will instantly be transformed, as though you had joined the ranks of the \\&quot;great unwashed\\&quot;.  Seeing as I bought it for hair and it is counter-productive to put this on hair, they should be thankful I gave it three stars.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the three stars is it&#x27;s ability to help with skin dryness, even on my face.  It really is a dry oil, no oily residue and moisturizes very nicely.  I have rosecea, so the idea of putting an oil on my face made me cringe, but my face has been cracking and flaking by midday using my normal moisturizers under my makeup, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I used it sparingly at first, but now I am really generous with it on the dry areas of my face and my face has regained its normal appearance and is VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on my body and find that it prevents that dry itch that so often comes with winter, much better than Lubriderm or the other lotions I have used.  It absorbs quickly anywhere I use it.  I found using two coats makes it extra effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the scent and it kept my husband from trying it, so I recommend they work on that.  Seeing as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was very high up on the list of ingredients, I think they could work on that.  The scent doesn&#x27;t prevent me from using it, but if I wore perfume or scented lotion, it would be more of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Do NOT use this on your hair unless you are an actor WANTING to look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in a month or more.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Give it a try on the dry areas of your face.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use it on your hands and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  February 7, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered that it works very well as a makeup remover.  Removes waterproof mascara and semi-permanent eyeliner as well as foundation.  I tested it against Avalon C Face Wash and it removed my foundation at least 50% better.  If you have particularly dry skin, it is terrific.  I usually follow it up with the Avalon C or Ivory soap to remove the excess oil, but if you are using a wash cloth, you may not need to do that.  I use a baby wipe because terry cloth is too rough and aggravates my rosacea.</li>
    <li> Does add light oil to body, no problem except on face where I break out. Now I use the remainder on my legs and arms but not on my hair because it clashes with my cologne. Smells sort of like baby powder which I find off-putting on adults. Will not buy again unless they come up with a unscented or maybe citrus version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy but this is one the best after shave moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used... And I&#x27;ve used products from Lancôme, Sisley and La prairie. Goes on dry and with moisturizers that won&#x27;t make your face look oily. Love it on hair as we&#x27;ll... It&#x27;s like an all in one.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my beard because it works great and is half the price of beard oil.</li>
    <li> I love this company! I use their shampoo and their 3 minute conditioner. I have been trying to grow my hair for a while now and luckily I think I finally found a solution. I don&#x27;t have really dry hair, (I&#x27;m only 20) but even without using hear objects or playing with it my hair doesn&#x27;t seen to feel 100% soft and smooth (maybe 70%) like it does now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I got this cause now I have a high chance of even faster growth.</li>
    <li> easy to use and no mess and leakage. fragrance is good too</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. not very moisturizing. I usually use baby oil and when i ran out, started using this. a little does NOT go a long way. smells like barbie dolls (so, ew).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not so miracle--ee for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair - which can get dry and out of control - and it was great for that. But I also ended up using it on my skin over the winter. When I got a bit itchy, I used this. It is quick to apply, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy. And it smells good - not perfumed, but just like the avocado and almond oils that are in it. Also, this little bottle lasts forever. I bought my first one in the fall and six months later, I still have nearly half left.</li>
    <li> Fabulous stuff I use it all the time makes my hair great ... fabulous for feet and for legs. try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> I like it! A little goes a long way, and I like that I can use it on my hair as well as my skin. Excellent price too!</li>
    <li> Sadly, I offered some to my mom-in-law (80+ years old) and now have to send her every bottle I can find!  I don&#x27;t know if they stopped making this but suspect so since it&#x27;s now almost impossible to find, even online.  I see that they have instead come out with different products for each body part.  They will lose a customer if they discontinue this since it&#x27;s the overall convenience that had me buy it to begin with - something to keep the hands soft that I could tuck into my purse, glove box and desk.  That I could use it to smooth the frizz on a humid day meant that I went through it all the more quickly since it was everywhere I needed it to be. I&#x27;ll go back to good old almond oil if this is discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am older and my hair was drying out.  I use just a little after my shower and my dry, straw like hair gets nicely moisturized.  Makes my hair shine and I have had many compliments.  It is nice to know that is also good for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is great. I use it after I get out of the shower, I rub some on the ends of my hair and it heals my split ends and feels like I just got a haircut!</li>
    <li> I have used the garnier thicker oils to pull out rod sets and roller sets,although this says it&#x27;s for the face,I wouldn&#x27;t dare apply it to my face,however I enjoy this,it has a light scent and are very easy to use. I spray on my scalp/hair and go. I also can use it to flat iron my hair as well because it&#x27;s very light.</li>
    <li> I have coarse african-american hair. 4c for my naturals. Usually oils do absolutely nothing to soften my dry hair but this stuff works wonders. I use this after deep conditioning and styling and it locks in the moisture in my hair for days! normally the moisture doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. my hair feels silky (as coarse, curly hair can get) and soft!</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a boxed set and I have really greasy hair so I didn&#x27;t know what I would use it for. My 3 year old has been fighting eczema since she was born and it&#x27;s so sensitive that the only thing that doesn&#x27;t hurt is a steroid ointment prescribed by the doctor.  I thought I would try this and it has cleared up the eczema even better than the prescription. I am so in love and grateful that my daughter is finally itch free :)</li>
