      <li>I need to  use it more often to see results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still satisfied.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light fragrance not over powering</li>
      <li>I have tried many other skin repair emollient&#x27;s but Immuderm works the best.  </li>
      <li>I truly use it religiously twice a day; and  I would be more than happy to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>so many times claims prove not to be true.</li>
      <li>I liked it fine, but there isn&#x27;t much you can do in the way of eliminating wrinkles when you&#x27;re my age!  </li>
      <li>My skin appears  smooth and felt softer.</li>
      <li>Have used this for several years and it is a truly great product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is light and non-greasy but moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>and I think is is good for old skin.</li>
      <li>Some one else asked me excitedly (on my birthday when she learned my age - 60), \\&quot;Where&#x27;s your winkles?\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>It gentle on the face, and is great on old age spots &amp; smoother wrinkles.</li>
      <li>This one is most promising and I will continue to use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week and the rash and itching is greatly reduced.  </li>
      <li>Superior product for repairing dry skin and restoring elasticity.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and a half; it&#x27;s a very nice cream that absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>like this product very much</li>
      <li>/&gt;Service was ok the second time around&lt;br</li>
      <li>(a big problem for me with most skin products)  and leaves my skin with a glow.</li>
      <li>When I first put it on and rub it in, it feels &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I had used Immudern years ago as a hand cream and marveled at how it made my hands look years younger and never followed up on ordering more.</li>
      <li>I have used many products through the last 40 years.</li>
      <li>I think it really does help with lines on face and hands.</li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Less is more-</li>
      <li>Its a little drying, so once in a while need a more moist moisturizer as well</li>
      <li>I love the moisture it gives without feeling heavy and greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been plagued by eczema for months and have tried four different types of non-prescription treatments, including fresh aloe vera, and nothing has worked but this product.  </li>
      <li>So far I see no change at all in my skin.</li>
      <li>Really like this Norwegian cream...</li>
      <li>So far I like the way my skin looks</li>
      <li>At this point it&#x27;s too early to tell what the long-term effect of this product will be.</li>
      <li>Maybe it only works on we Old Ladies . . .</li>
      <li>After only 6 days I am certain I will definitely be ordering Immuderm again as my face is softer each day after such a short period of use.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes immuderm could help with my extremely dry skin problem, but alas ,it evidently was too much to hope for.</li>

<li> Unfortunately, the effect does not last very long.</li>
<li> half off!</li>
<li> I used it morning &amp; night and anxiously waited to see any change</li>
<li> No better or worse than the average moisturizer , but it does feel heavy and a little uncomfortable as a night moisturizer.</li>
<li> I am disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference then how my skin looked already. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, didn&#x27;t help like the story in the advertisment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for five years, and I&#x27;m 72 years old and look great!  Wrinkles just aren&#x27;t forming.  Best product ever, never mind it is so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Immuderm Cream. Am still using it, will see the result after four to six. Then will know if it work.</li>
    <li> When I first put it on and rub it in, it feels &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; but after a few minutes my skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product very much</li>
    <li> immuderm skin repair makes a big difference in the quality of my skin.  I am 74 and it does a lot to hide the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I had used Immudern years ago as a hand cream and marveled at how it made my hands look years younger and never followed up on ordering more. But when I saw it had eye cream I ordered it again and started using it on my hands, face and the under eye cream as well and have been getting compliments on how my skin looks so radiant and healthy. Immuderm has me as a client for life!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.It did diminish my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It did what the Company said it would. My skin appears  smooth and felt softer. Good skin is imperative for me and so many times claims prove not to be true. This was a pleasant surprise !</li>
    <li> keep reordering this as it cares for the skin without a worry</li>
    <li> I am disappointed.  I had high hopes immuderm could help with my extremely dry skin problem, but alas ,it evidently was too much to hope for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year and I like it.  Who knows what my skin would look like if I were using something else?  It feels good and I like the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I have used Immuderm Skin Repair Emollient for a month and notice no difference. Save your money, time and expectations!</li>
    <li> BEST JAZZ EVER!!! 😊😊😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been bying this product over the years.&lt;br /&gt;First time it was stop at the boarder. I had to reorder again.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product It also last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Service was ok the second time around&lt;br /&gt;Still satisfied. I would order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff...cleared my problem quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife says, It&#x27;s very good for her skin, Excellent!</li>
    <li> My regular moisturizer.  I love it!  It is not the fountain of youth, but provides deep moisturizing and is not greasy or heavy. Recommended by my Dermatologist.  I am very happy with it and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> After trying 3 or 4 hundred products, I&#x27;ve finally stumbled upon something that actually seems to work for me. I can&#x27;t say it will work for everyone, but it makes my skin feel great and after two weeks....I think I may be looking at a few less lines.</li>
    <li> Really like this Norwegian cream... nice texture, not too greasy. Been using it for about 1.5 years. Keeps my skin healthy and happy.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the ladies and the gents.  It gentle on the face, and is great on old age spots &amp; smoother wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Have been using product for about 3 years....excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd tube .. This is a great price... half off! It lasts forever.. Not sure I&#x27;m seeing a big difference though</li>
    <li> Immuderm does wonderful things for your skin.  I use it in place of the moisture cream I had been using for years.</li>
    <li> Product has an excellent reputation. My wife swears by it and would never run out. Recommended for anyone who is looking for an effective skin treatment.</li>
    <li> . . . but I&#x27;m not sure it really does!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and a half; it&#x27;s a very nice cream that absorbs well.  Who knows how my skin would be if I didn&#x27;t use it???  It&#x27;s as good as anything and one tube lasts me about a year with two or more applications a day.</li>
    <li> Like it. Was recommended by a friend. Its a little drying, so once in a while need a more moist moisturizer as well</li>
    <li> Superior product for repairing dry skin and restoring elasticity. Have been using for several years and it works.</li>
    <li> I use this cream during th day unde my makeup and at night beofre bed.&lt;br /&gt;There is some improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and non-greasy but moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by eczema for months and have tried four different types of non-prescription treatments, including fresh aloe vera, and nothing has worked but this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week and the rash and itching is greatly reduced.  I also use it on my face and have noticed a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing. I used Immuderm religiously and did not see any change.  I used it morning &amp; night and anxiously waited to see any change but there was none.  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Works better than other very expensive lotions I have tried.  After only 6 days I am certain I will definitely be ordering Immuderm again as my face is softer each day after such a short period of use.  Can&#x27;t wait to compare after 30 days of use.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR SOME TIME WITH GOOD RESULTS.  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT AND I WILL CONT TO ORDER IT ON AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several years and it is a truly great product.  I recommend it heartly!  Skin shows great improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this skin repair cream. Although, I did not get  \\&quot;miracle results\\&quot;; I received excellent ones. I really enjoy using it. It melts into your skin, does not irritate my eyes (a big problem for me with most skin products)  and leaves my skin with a glow. One day a good friend of mine complimented me on my make-up and I had to say, \\&quot;But Karen, I&#x27;m not wearing any make-up.  That was a terrific experience.  Some one else asked me excitedly (on my birthday when she learned my age - 60), \\&quot;Where&#x27;s your winkles?\\&quot;  I truly use it religiously twice a day; and  I would be more than happy to recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I use this every am and pm.  I love the moisture it gives without feeling heavy and greasy.  I stopped using it for awhile and could see and feel a difference in the texture of my skin,</li>
    <li> cheaper and quicker than the manufactuer</li>
    <li> This product is WONDERFUL!!!  Makes me look 10 years younger than my age of 70!!!  I recommend it to all people even younger than I am!!!  Wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second tube. It has a nice light fragrance not over powering and I think is is good for old skin. I use it on face and hands and arms.</li>
    <li> I have used many products through the last 40 years. This one is most promising and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful feel and healing quality that gives me home for better skin.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite!  I have tried many other skin repair emollient&#x27;s but Immuderm works the best.  It repairs my skin cells.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She has been using it for a year now. She feels it makes her skin look younger.</li>
    <li> I need to  use it more often to see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Immuderm for over a year and I love how it evens out my skin tone on my face and neck.  My Mom introduced me to the line and I now use it in lieu of wrinkle cream.  Also excellent for reducing fine lines on a woman&#x27;s cleavage!  Less is more- so if you have extremely oily skin like I do, use sparingly on the face.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this product because it feels very good on the skin, and I have very sensitive skin. It also shows remarkable changes on wrinkles right after application. Unfortunately, the effect does not last very long. At this point it&#x27;s too early to tell what the long-term effect of this product will be.</li>
    <li> This is non greasy and is cheaper than a lot of other skin repair creams on the market. No major appearance difference, but can tell somewhat that it is making my facial line lessen some.</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  I liked it fine, but there isn&#x27;t much you can do in the way of eliminating wrinkles when you&#x27;re my age!  But, I plan to continue with it as it seems like it is improving my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sued this product twice a day for two weeks. So far I see no change at all in my skin.</li>
    <li> No better or worse than the average moisturizer , but it does feel heavy and a little uncomfortable as a night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use Immuderm on top of Hada Labo Toykyo Replenishing Hydrator and EVERYONE has noticed the difference. A touch goes a long way.  Wait till you see how it works on your neck.  I have paid alot of $$ for other creams and this one works for me.  I gave some to my sister-in-law who loved it and gave some to her sister who now loves it.  Maybe it only works on we Old Ladies . . .</li>
    <li> Feel it did not live up to the hype that i had read on line.  Would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It has resulted in strengthening my 82 wife&#x27;s arm and leg skin greatly reduced garden injuries.&lt;br /&gt;Remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;John O. Enander 2-27-2013</li>
    <li> So far I like the way my skin looks, I no only use on my face, but on chest and arms as well. I will keep on buying it</li>
    <li> I think it really does help with lines on face and hands. I use it every night and morning. I will be buying another one when I run out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, when my husband used this after skin grafts on both legs, it helped with the healing process. Very good product!!!</li>
