<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> !&lt;br /&gt;Finally found one again.  Take it anywhere and get up and close for cosmetics. Thanks. I recommend one for home and travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these mirrors for many years, so I got this one for the 2nd bathroom.  It has saved many steps.  There&lt;br /&gt;are other magnifying mirrors, but none of them are as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I have used these mirrors for the past 20 years....have tried many others, but NEVER have found one at any price as good as this!!!  Whenever I leave one, by accident, on vacation, I am lost without it until I can order another!!  This time I am ordering three!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these &amp; a friend approached me &amp; said she was unable to find one.  The store where I bought mine no longer carried them.  I got online to Amazon.com &amp; found the Big Eyes Magic Focus Magnifying Makeup Mirror instantly.  I ordered it for her &amp; she called &amp; said she received it in 2 days.  I am very impressed with the product &amp; the wonderful service.  My friend loves the mirror.</li>
    <li> I will never be without one of these!  Makes doing all your beauty maintenance a piece of cake!  Great product.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this mirror, because I thought it might have a distorted image.  NO WAY - this is really all it claims to be.  The mirror has no distortions in any way.  A really great product; I would definately recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Finally a mirror you really can see things with. So good for eyebrows and make-up especially as you get older and you need glasses to see these things. Bought a second as a gift for my sister as she kept borrowing mine and she loves hers as well. Fast shipping, very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> My mother has had one of these mirrors for years, every one in the family used it. They are great for other things besides makeup, I use mine to trim up my moustache now that my eyes are not what they used to be.</li>
    <li> I love this magnifying mirror! Since I am vision impaired, I was always struggling with trying to get my makeup perfect. This mirror helps me so much. I truly love it.</li>
    <li> I love my mirror. I am getting older and my eyes are not what they used to be. This mirror magnifies just right. It doesn&#x27;t show things I don&#x27;t want to see. The only drawback is that it scratches too easily. Both my sister and I have bought about 10 of them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mirror!  It is such a great product.  I have used these mirrors for many years, but now that my eyes are changing and I need to use readers, this is extremely helpful for close-up work.  I use this mirror when I apply my eye make-up and while plucking my eyebrows.  I have also used it when I have gotten something in my eye that I cannot see well in a regular mirror, like a small fuzz or eyelash.  The mirror unscrews from its goose-neck, so it is easy to travel with, or you can leave it as is and just bend the very flexible goose-neck, to fit into your luggage.  I have bought many of these, and everyone who comes over and uses them, end up ordering one for themselves.  I highly recommend this Big Eyes Mirror!</li>
    <li> The mirror was even better than described, came beautifully boxed, well packaged, and in a timely manner.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item due to the fact you can no longer get it in my area. I already have 1 of these and really like it.  My eyesight is not very great so this helps.......tell it like it is.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror for expertly applying eye-make. Let your eyes look their best, try it! You will not regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> Love!  I have to have it to put on eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these mirrors for many years.  Bought a second one about 5 years ago and just bought another one for travel.  Would be nice if it was lighted but it is a great mirror and will last for years.</li>
    <li> THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE ABSOLUTE BEST MIRROR YOU WILL EVER NEED. GAVE ONE TO 5 DIFFERENT FEMALE RELATIVES &amp; THEY REPORTED TO ME THAT THEIR HUSBANDS &amp; DAUGHTERS USE IT ALSO. IF YOU NEED GLASSES, YOU WON&#x27;T NEED THEM TO APPLY EYE MAKEUP OR DO EYEBROW PLUCKING OR EVEN FINDING THINGS ON YOUR FACE YOU NEVER KNEW WERE THERE. I HAVE ONE IN EVERY HOUSE WE OWN &amp; CAN&#x27;T SURVIVE WITHOUT ONE. IT NEVER WEARS OUT &amp; THE GOOSE NECK WORKS PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t apply make-up or pluck your eyebrows without glasses, then this is the mirror for you.  It&#x27;s like... having the eyesight when you were young!</li>
    <li> This is the best magnifying mirror on the market- no distortion. Perfect for applying eye makeup.</li>
    <li> ordered it one day it came a few days later. It was just what i wanted. My wife can see everything real close now. it is a great makeup mirror</li>
    <li> I had a mirror, like this one, for 20 years and it was the best! I scratched it with a cleaner and needed a new one. The cheaper ones are no good. I found the exact same one on Amazon! It is great for make-up and getting those contacts in! I can&#x27;t be without it. The price was lower than the one I purchased 20 years ago! I strongly recommend this mirror.  The quality is great!</li>
    <li> This mirror makes difficult tasks such as insertion or removal of contact lenses a breeze. Great also for attaching fiddly earrings or applying eye makeup. For me,it is an essential item in the bathroom and for travel, the mirror can be removed from the stand.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MAGNIFYING MIRROR ON THE MARKET. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I use mine daily.  I used to sell them at my Merle Norman Studio and also used them when giving make up lessons.  They fold up for traveling and are a great investment.</li>
    <li> I will admit that this one eyed, small, magnifying mirror, is very difficult to use.  I am sorry I did not read all the reviews more closely as I may have bought a more expensive but larger mirror.  For me this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This mirror is absolutely amazing!    Those of us with older eyes, especially those of us who wear glasses; will appreciate being able to actually see our face again with eyes of a teenager through this mirror.    This is the second Magic Focus I have purchased for my mother as she has worn out the first. Oh, not the mirror itself but the base as she carts it everywhere!    I almost kept this one!    Great product! They even offer a compact. However, for travel, the stand on this one is a must.</li>
    <li> i had to rate this 2 , it somehow made it to my house without breaking, it was packed to the breaking point and only to find out for 30 dollars all plastic , it really should cost a mer 8 dollars  not to mention shipping,</li>
    <li> For over 40, this is the magnifyer to get! I can see the wrinkles up close and personal... darn it! Great product!</li>
    <li> I wear reading glasses and I couldn&#x27;t put on makeup without this mirror.  As I get older, I need this mirror more and more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for many, many years, but needed another one for the sake of convenience (upstairs and downstairs locations). Could not do many facial and eye things without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for plucking eyebrows as even w/out glasses one can see. I was expecting a bigger mirror to apply my makeup but when using it you can only see part of your face. However it is great for doing individual eyes, etc.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described and I was very happy.......until I saw a mirror at Walmart in the makeup department that works just as well and it was $2.99. Similar size and it can be stuck to a bathroom mirror.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.... it is the second one I have purchased because I liked the first one so much I wanted one exclusively for travel. It is the perfect size to apply makeup and it is easily adjusted for various surfaces. This site offered the mirror for the best price.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, helpful product.  My husband and I had 2 before and managed to lose them on vacations.  We went without one for about 3 months, and relized this was one of the best products ever, not just for eyeliners and makeup but for all the little things on your face you, can&#x27;t see but you are sure other people can.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 86 year old mother in law and she loves it.  She had one years ago, but as others have done, left it in a hotel room. I also have one, probably 15 years old and use it more in recent years than ever before and I too love it!</li>
    <li> Best part: you tip the mirror on it&#x27;s gooseneck to get the best angle. My only problem is accidentally leaving it in hotel rooms when I travel, but it&#x27;s cheap enough to just replace!</li>
    <li> This mirror shows almost more than I wanted to see!  So amazing.  Absolutely perfect for checking pores and plucking eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I wear eye glasses and without this mirror my eye makeup would look comical. The goose-neck allows me to configure the mirror in just the right way for the light source and the correct height for where ever I happen to be putting on my makeup, tweezering my eyebrows, or removing an eyelash from my eye. I keep two around just in case one breaks I will not have to wait while I order another one. I keep the spare in my travel bag so I never forget to take it when traveling. Excellent product design!</li>
    <li> Love the mirror.  This is my third one as I have a habit of leaving them in hotel rooms but it is great!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. After trying many more expensive products I find this one the easiest to use. Unfortunatly I have left 2 at hotels. I think they just blend in too well! I&#x27;ve tried the smaller size for travel but find this one worth the trouble of packing (and Losing!) I think I will buy 2 this time in case they stop making them.</li>
    <li> My bride of 26 years has been unable to replace her treasured \\&quot;Big Eye\\&quot; cosmetic mirror - it was perfectly suited for our travels and she is not real happy about it no longer being available.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for tweezing eyebrows!  It is easy to do with this mirror because your hands are free due to the ability to position the mirror right where you want it.</li>
    <li> Thanks to AOL I found a replacement for the best 5X home and travel mirror I have ever owned. The first thing in my luggasge is my folding makeup mirror. I would never receive the compliments about my makeup being so perfect, if it were not for this mirror. False eyelashes are easy to put on with the mirror. Who ever sees it wants to know where they can buy it. Until now it has been impossible to find in any of the NYC stores.</li>
    <li> this mirror is great!  allows you to see the things you never could before.  It&#x27;s gooseneck makes it easy to position and it&#x27;s light weight makes it easy to pack and travel with.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST mirror I have ever used for magnification.  I bought one of these years ago and have not found anything better...  I have forgotten to bring this mirror with me while traveling and bought one that said it was 10X magnification and I was surprised to find that I couldn&#x27;t see as well with it as with the 5X magnification mirror from Big Eyes. I don&#x27;t know how they do it; but they make a better mirror.  I bought the one that can be attached to your bathroom mirror with suction cups so that I can take it with me when I travel.  I also found that if you put a drop of water behind each suction cup before applying to the bathroom mirror, the Big Eyes mirror stays on for a very long time.  You truly won&#x27;t be disappointed if you get one of these.</li>
    <li> Magic Mirror Focus Big Eyes Magnifying Makeup Mirror 5X - White [Misc.] My wife tried the mirror while visiting my Mom who has had one for years. My wife (Diane) fell in love with it so my Mom sent her one from Seattle to Wisconsin.It seems to be a very nice product.</li>
    <li> This is not as sturdy as I would have liked.  Sometimes the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; moves by itself because of the weight of the mirror.</li>
    <li> It was a stocking stuffer for my wife and she loves it. She has mentioned how much she loves it a couple of times since so it was a hit.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  Without it I couldn&#x27;t put on my eye makeup.  It is terrific for plucking your eyebrows too. I have four of them so I can take one with me on trips and have one on my houseboat.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO KNOW WAS IN THE DESCRIPTION.  IT WAS RECEIVED PROMPTLY AND IN GOOD CONDITION.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. It is hard to find, but was exactly as advertised and much appreciated.</li>
    <li> great at your makeup desk. love it</li>
    <li> I love/hate this mirror - it is high quality, flexible and sturdy.  The only problem is it makes any facial issues look 10 times worse - i.e., facial hairs look like the redwood forest trees and pores look like volcanic craters.  But i recommend it to anyone who wants honesty about their facial condition.</li>
    <li> This gives up close look at your face or eyes. It is wonderful! Nice to have the flex neck to move as you need it.</li>
    <li> This mirror shows me more on my face then I really wanted to see :) LOL Helps me see well enough to insert and take out contacts as well as apply my make-up.</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT mirror for bathroom, travel, etc.  You can see very clear and close up.  Has bendable arm to help position however you need to face lighting.  I ordered one for each sister - this is a Great Gift.</li>
    <li> This item was ordered to replace one just like it from the same company this over 30 years old. It works great to look at the face when magnification is needed.</li>
    <li> Great little mirror, I take it traveling and it is terrific for my makeup stuff love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these mirrors for years. They are the best for putting on eye makeup. They would last forever if I would quit leaving them in motels when traveling.</li>
    <li> this has to be the best magnifying mirror I ever own, I orignally bought this at JC pennies back in the early 90&#x27;s! This mirror is so good that I needed another one, not because the first one broke but so my Husband and I no longer have to share. As you age your eyes start to fail and this mirror lets you do things that you did when you were younger.</li>
    <li> My stepmom has had one of these for possibly 10 years now.  Every time I&#x27;d visit I&#x27;d go into the bathroom &amp; sneak a peek up close of my face eeeek!!! Okay so I finally had to find one.  I wrote down the info from the bottom of hers &amp; found that these are still made in the USA!  Ordered it &amp; now eeeek!!! the eyebrow hairs I was always trying to pluck were actually crows feet!  The magnification is awesome &amp; I like the small size and balance you can achieve with the twisty neck.  This is great for those of us that are eyesight challenged, I can see without needing my glasses.  Caution: be prepared to see more than you want!</li>
    <li> The mirror is great. Just perfect for traveling and home as well. Shiping was quick and it arrived it excellent condition. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product suits my needs very well.  It  is lightweight, easily transportable and not too large.  I use it everyday when applying eye makeup.  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I had a Magic Mirror for many years.  The flexible neck wore out and&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a new mirror.  Obviously, I love this mirror for makeup and&lt;br /&gt;face checking.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my new Magic Mirror.  I have previously had one for many years, ordered through a catalog but couldn&#x27;t find it any more, thus my Amazon search turned up the same mirror.</li>
    <li> So now I&#x27;m overtaken with appropriate self-loathing as I take in the now-made-vast scenery of pores, peach-fuzz and blemishes on my facial terrain.  Thanks, MM, for making my day.</li>
    <li> I REALLY NEEDED THIS -LOVE IT....CANNOT GO WRONG IF YOU PURCHASE IT.....</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror.  I have been using one of thes for 15 or so years and just can&#x27;t do my makeup without one.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to me years and years ago. Have never replaced it. This one I bought for my daughter who has just reached her 50&amp;#34;s. She uses mine when she visits but now has her own. :-)</li>
    <li> Gift. it was what  I was looking for. I  have bnot asked the other people I gave them to but will.</li>
    <li> Love this Makeup magnifing mirror It&#x27;s just the right size to take on a trip - not too small - not too large.. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> LOVE THE BIG EYE MIRROR!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I have purchased at least 10 of these mirrors. I have given them as gifts and when I travel I take one and leave it on purpose or by accident. It folds up pretty small to fit in your suitcase. Very high quality magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> Without the Big Eyes mirror I could never put on eye makeup. I have used one for over twenty years, and when I left it in a hotel in S.America recently I thought I&#x27;d have to go without makeup for the rest of my life because I couldn&#x27;t find one in any stores.  Thank goodness I thought to look on Amazon and found they are still available!</li>
    <li> magnifying is good  however bottom metal  piece falls out of plastic very easily&lt;br /&gt;however you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these mirrors for several years, what a difference it makes when applying make up.. I had left mine at the; motel while on a trip. Called the motel when I got home but no return answer.I was very glad to find one on Amazon and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I was elated to find this mirror. I bought one years ago and was wanting an extra one as a replacement should something happen to this one.  I like it so well I bought several for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother to see up close to put on her makeup.  This is her second one.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother whose vision has been worsening over the past few years.  After reading other reviews, I decided this would be perfect because it does not blur no matter where you look at it.  It really is AWESOME, she said she hasn&#x27;t been able to see this well in a mirror ever.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll love this mirror, if the closeup of the flaws on your face don&#x27;t freak you out!  This is my fourth one - over a 30 year period!  I couldn&#x27;t live without it.  It sits in the window of my bathroom, and I knock it off all the time but it doesn&#x27;t break.  You can unscrew the mirror from the gooseneck stand and take it with you when you travel.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement and over-the-top ordering and delivery.  Better than expected.  Extremely pleased.  This was NOT&lt;br /&gt;available in my area and I was delighted to be able to find it here. Keep up the good work. Yu are appreciated. Yhanks.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MIRROR!  DON&#x27;T LET THE PRICE OR DESCRIPTION FOOL YOU!  THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR APPLYING EYE MAKEUP!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> that I didn&#x27;t like was how clearly I could see the hair on my face!  It was pretty darn scary!</li>
    <li> All my friends want this mirror too!  The flexibility of the stand makes it work and the magnification is just right.</li>
