<li> , it may not have this same result with other people</li>
<li> I have Type-1 Diabetes and so deal with itchy, dry skin and scalp.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with dry itchy scaly and this is helping a lot in the healing process.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Very light and soothing</li>
    <li> I guess its supposed to be applied with your fingers.  There is no way to get the product onto the scalp and not make your hair look all greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the same product that I was buying from my hairdresser, but costs a lot less.  Great product and it moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
    <li> We started using this item while my daughter was going to the Empire Beauty School as a client.  After moving away from the area, I was unable to locate the Scalp Treatment in stores and had to purchase online.  This works wonders because she has long, thick curly hair but an extremely dry scalp.  Now that we are living in Hawaii, the humidity was really taking a toll on her scalp so I order this online and she no longer walks around the house scratching her scalp.  I grease her scalp about twice a week.  Apply in small amounts.  This is light and a cool scent which we both love, not greasy and runny on the scalp or face.  Great product and worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have used that calms my itchy scalp. I&#x27;ve been wearing braids for the last few months &amp; this product works wonders when my scalp becomes irritated...the tingling sensation is soothing and immediately calms my scalp. Design Essential products are the best on my hair!</li>
    <li> Disappointed completely when I received it.  No box, no description ... Looks like a sampler or tester ....</li>
    <li> Great products..a must have helped my scalp tremendously!</li>
    <li> I have Type-1 Diabetes and so deal with itchy, dry skin and scalp.  I have tried many products and this is just another in a long line of disappointments.

    <li> I love the Design Essentials Anti-itch +Scalp Treatment. It met every expectation that I had. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Product works as it should, however for me it drys my scalp out, it may not have this same result with other people but I have psoriasis of the scalp. Great cool, tingling feeling :-).</li>
    <li> Found out about this product at a salon --now order it online.&lt;br /&gt;Good for itchy scalp/dandruff --has slight odor (medicated).&lt;br /&gt;been using it for yrs --use the Design essential shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;DE has great products !</li>
    <li> Great no more itches i recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> This is not too greasy and at the same time it soothes my scalp. I&#x27;ve had a problem with dry itchy scaly and this is helping a lot in the healing process.</li>
    <li> Great treatment for scalp.</li>
    <li> One use of this works like a charm. I wear protective styles allot, braids, twists, and sewins, so this keeps my scalp from itching.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thick hair gel.  How you are supposed to get this down to the scalp I&#x27;ll never know.  Not for serious itching.</li>
    <li> I have brought this item before but this particular purchase doesn&#x27;t appear to be as strong as my previous purchase.  But  i like design products.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....Have used it for year !!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It seems to help control my scalp itch as well as can be expected. You need only a dab, not a glog.</li>
    <li> Started using this through my beautician.  Love the  stimulating  tingle that it gives to the scalp.  It  has helped my hair to grow and thicken.</li>
    <li> Stopped the itching immediately!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Design Essentials products fan, and I&#x27;ve been using their products (cleansing shampoo + conditioner ) mainly on my dreadlocks. Unfortunately, I just couldn&#x27;t use this product on my scalp as it is too greasy. The bottle arrived drenched in grease before I could even open it. Not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time. Received it quick.</li>
    <li> Design Essentials are great products!</li>
    <li> Well I purchased this product for a friend who said that he liked it for his dry scalp and so I thought that I would try it on my son.  Well he did not like it.  I guess it work for some and not for others.</li>
    <li> If you have ever had an itchy scalp, this is the treatment that works right away. It also calms down the frizziness.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Lightweight and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I even take it to the salon for my weekly appointments.  My stylist has added to her line of Design products utilized.</li>
    <li> I received the shipment on time. They did a good job wrapping the product. Very professional and very easy to order.</li>
    <li> I LOVE USING DESIGN ESSENTIAL ANT-ITCH AND SCALP TREATMENT. VERY SOOTHING TO YOUR SCALP. I USED THIS PRODUCT ON MY DAUGHTER.</li>
