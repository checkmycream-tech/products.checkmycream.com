      <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for over 10 years for a cheaper and better product to appear in the market and that has not happened</li>
      <li>I have used Mach3 shaving blades for many years.</li>

      <li>You&#x27;d get a better shave from a disposable Bic than from these blades.</li>
      <li>Best price ever pretty much</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer described them, you have a more comfortable shave from a kitchen knife.  </li>

      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>I DONT THINK THESE ARE ORIGINAL MACH3 BLADES.</li>
      <li>He gets about 3-4 weeks worth of shaves from one cartridge!  </li>
      <li>Also, &amp;#34;strop&amp;#34; the blades after each use (after you clean the blades) by runnng the razor backwards up your forearm about 10-15 times.  </li>
      <li>At the end of the shave I can feel the skin being clean of stubble.  </li>
      <li>The price is a super bargain on this site</li>
      <li>I have been shaving with the Mach 3 for many years and although these blades were new in the box, every one of them hurt my face.</li>
      <li>These razors give a nice shave, but my husband only gets one or two shaves from each blade.  </li>
      <li>An old kitchen knife would do a better job.</li>
      <li>Makes me rethink whether it is worth the annual fee when Amazon Prime knows there is a problem and does nothing but to allow this to continue.</li>
      <li>fell right off.</li>
      <li>Great quality as usual</li>
      <li>Husband cares about value and likes a close shave without auctioning off his first born to get it.</li>
      <li>product as stated and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought blades online thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>This was one of many gifts to my son and he only likes these razors and this brand.  </li>
      <li>5 Stars for sure, for the last 10 years!!</li>
      <li>Not ad good as safety razor but alot safer :)  use with hair conditioner (weird, right?)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these same razor blades for nearly 15 years and they have always been great and simple to use.</li>
      <li>With the original Mach 3 blade, the shave is always smooth, the blade seems sharp.</li>
      <li>Its always hard to find a good deal on these things, but these guys have a pretty decent price and inexpensive shipping; it was  not headache transaction and prevented me from having to make a trip to wal mart or target so two thumbs up in book!</li>
      <li>Service was fast.</li>
      <li>But not by much once shipping was included.</li>
      <li>Why should razors cost so much?</li>
      <li>The shipping was reasonable.</li>
      <li>I now belong to Dollar Shave Club which is incredibly reasonable.</li>
      <li>Purchasing these blades through the internet was much cheaper than buying them in the store.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if they are some kind of knock-off or simply old, but I had to throw them away.  </li>
      <li>I wonder if the purchased blades are truly new or re-packaged sharpened blades.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It gave me cuts and provided a more intense sting on the facial skin than blades usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can clearly see the difference between store bought Mach3 and the ones from Amzon.</li>
      <li>I may be old school at this point and don&#x27;t like change to my hygiene routine.</li>
      <li>Wish they would have said these were a decade old.</li>
      <li>Blades were 10 years old.</li>
      <li>very suspicious low quality of the blades.</li>
      <li>So far he still asks for them for Xmas.</li>
      <li>The package and the blade all seem normal but definitely the blade is not even passable quality.</li>
      <li>Not sure what is going on with this company, as I&#x27;ve used Gillette brand Mach3 blades in the past-- always loved them.  </li>
      <li>Their is a reason why these things are so expensive and successful and that is because they are the finest wet shave razor on the market.</li>
      <li>Trying to use these blades would be impossible, they are as good as a scraper.</li>
      <li>I purchased the 16 pack through Amazon and saved at least 30% off from big box or super drugstore chains.</li>

<li> have tried several other blades.....</li>
<li> Looked brand new but were dull &amp; glue from strip</li>
<li> The smoothing coating substance (blue) will pill off after a two-three shavings (none of the locally bought items have ever done that) while the blades become dull and start scratching instead of shaving.</li>
<li> He has a very rough beard and loves these razors, but these blades are way too expensive to wear out so quickly.</li>
<li> Bought these blades because of the great price, but they are awful.  </li>
<li> There is no much to say about shaving blades.</li>
<li> I still haven&#x27;t gotten use to the 5 blade or the electrical vibrating one&#x27;s and find that the three blade Mach3 gives my skin just enough stretch for the deep cut and a smooth moisture strip, without giving me a bloody cut.</li>
<li> The blade feels rough, like the disposable razors.  </li>
<li> plain and simple.</li>
<li> feels very much  like fake.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are the only blades my husband will use.  He gets about 3-4 weeks worth of shaves from one cartridge!  Excellent!</li>
    <li> The quality of these is not even close to the ones I purchase from a local retailers. The smoothing coating substance (blue) will pill off after a two-three shavings (none of the locally bought items have ever done that) while the blades become dull and start scratching instead of shaving. I&#x27;ve witnessed this behavior on several separate occasions / lots (silly me, should have gotten a clue from the beginning...).</li>
    <li> It works as it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> This was the worst purchase I ever made. The blades cut me face!!! I had to contact Gillette to get re-imbursed. They sent me coupons for future purchases.  I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap. Never again!!!!</li>
    <li> Purchasing these blades through the internet was much cheaper than buying them in the store.  Service was fast.</li>
    <li> Bought these blades because of the great price, but they are awful.  Not sure if they are some kind of knock-off or simply old, but I had to throw them away.  You&#x27;d get a better shave from a disposable Bic than from these blades.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Gillette Mach3 Replacement Cartridges (16-pack) through Amazon from MZPhoto on December 16, 2008.  I didn&#x27;t want to review a product I had not used yet.  I purchased them because the price cannot be beat and I was running low in my supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these blades for a couple of months now and I find the blades terrible.  Like another reviewer described them, you have a more comfortable shave from a kitchen knife.  I thought maybe we (my wife and I) had a few bad ones so I keep using them.  ALL of them are bad.  I have to shave every other day with these so my face can recover from the burns that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier than December, my wife had seen a blade sharpener on TV and ordered it.  I tried it a couple of times before throwing it in the garbage.  The sharpened blades would last one shave and then cut skin.  These blades that I assumed new out of the box are the same as my previously resharpened blades.  I wonder if the purchased blades are truly new or re-packaged sharpened blades.  I refuse to believe that Gillette would themselves put out such an inferior product.</li>
    <li> There is no much to say about shaving blades. I just love this brand and use it always. I just rated 4 stars because I ordered 2 packs of 16 cartridges but have got 1 pack only.  I did contact the seller and got the refund for the pack that was missing, so no complaining about that.</li>
    <li> I thought I had hit upon a bargain with the price listed. But then when I took the first swipe, it was clear that I was stupid to buy this. With the original Mach 3 blade, the shave is always smooth, the blade seems sharp. At the end of the shave I can feel the skin being clean of stubble.  Not with this. Something is not right with the blade. I am scared to glide the blade along my chin as the movement is very rough and stubborn. The package and the blade all seem normal but definitely the blade is not even passable quality. Avoid this like a bad shave.</li>
    <li> Great price, great razor!</li>
    <li> These razors give a nice shave, but my husband only gets one or two shaves from each blade.  He has a very rough beard and loves these razors, but these blades are way too expensive to wear out so quickly.</li>
    <li> Outstanding buy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These cartridges were in excellent condition when they arrived. in their factory retail packaging. I do quality Control for a living and i have no complaints with the product that I received. The shipping was reasonable. and you cant beat the price. a great price for a great product! plain and simple.</li>
    <li> A friend told me that he buys his shaving blades from Amazon so I gave it a try. It was cheaper. But not by much once shipping was included. These Mach 3 were the worst blades I ever used. I have been shaving with the Mach 3 for many years and although these blades were new in the box, every one of them hurt my face. All 16 of them. It seemed like they were defective or something and I had to throw them all away. Will not buy blades from here again. I never had a problem with the same blades bought from a retail store.</li>
    <li> Not sure what is going on with this company, as I&#x27;ve used Gillette brand Mach3 blades in the past-- always loved them.  I thought buying them from here would be a good price on many blades. I&#x27;m not sure if this company is selling fake or knockoff blades.   But these are worse than anything-- I had to resort to using my wifes cheap $1 razors to finish my shave--- plain horrible   Don&#x27;t make this mistake -- you&#x27;ll end up throwing your money in the trash.</li>
    <li> Always use these and got them $10.00 with promo code I found off slick deals. Best price ever pretty much</li>
    <li> This was one of many gifts to my son and he only likes these razors and this brand.  So far he still asks for them for Xmas.</li>
    <li> Fast, cheap shipping and as good a price as walmart or any place else.  Its always hard to find a good deal on these things, but these guys have a pretty decent price and inexpensive shipping; it was  not headache transaction and prevented me from having to make a trip to wal mart or target so two thumbs up in book!</li>
    <li> This is a the product my dermatalogist suggest I shave with. The price is a super bargain on this site</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these same razor blades for nearly 15 years and they have always been great and simple to use.</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  They&#x27;ve always worked way better than any \\&quot;for women\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve tried.  Too bad they&#x27;re so overpriced.  Why should razors cost so much?</li>
    <li> Works as advertised!!</li>
    <li> Great buy, fast delivery, better price/product than $ &#x27;o month!</li>
    <li> With all the razors out there these days, I find that Gillette&#x27;s Mach3 is still my favorite. It&#x27;s not the cheapest thing out there, but neither is it the most expensive. I still haven&#x27;t gotten use to the 5 blade or the electrical vibrating one&#x27;s and find that the three blade Mach3 gives my skin just enough stretch for the deep cut and a smooth moisture strip, without giving me a bloody cut. I may be old school at this point and don&#x27;t like change to my hygiene routine. 5 Stars for sure, for the last 10 years!!</li>
    <li> great shave ... and I didnt have to ask for the razors from behind the counter at the local grocery store that sells the same razors at nearly 2x the price !!</li>
    <li> These seem to give me the best results compared to the many options available.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several other blades.....I always come back to these..&lt;br /&gt;The best shave, tho quite pricey.</li>
    <li> Best. Cartidges.  Ever.  Not ad good as safety razor but alot safer :)  use with hair conditioner (weird, right?) for an awesomely smooth shave.  Also, &amp;#34;strop&amp;#34; the blades after each use (after you clean the blades) by runnng the razor backwards up your forearm about 10-15 times.  This actually sharpens the blades and makes em last a lot longer and reduces irritation.</li>
    <li> Very very misleading!!!! Picture shows TWO boxes of 8 count. Granted I should&#x27;ve read details, and thought I did. But after getting one box I came to check! For the price I would&#x27;ve NEVER ordered paid this price for one box of 8!!! Will be DOUBLE checking next time!</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT WAS GREAT WHEN FIRST CAME OUT NOW THERE ARE BETTER ONES OUT THERE.</li>
    <li> I have used Mach3 shaving blades for many years. This is the first time I bought blades online thru Amazon. I can clearly see the difference between store bought Mach3 and the ones from Amzon. I DONT THINK THESE ARE ORIGINAL MACH3 BLADES. THEY ARE INFERIOR QUALITY BLADES. I AM DISAPPOINTED, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Mach 3 makes shaving a pleasure.  Sinful.  I will go to Confession.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! I only got eight blades not sixteen as pictured. Read all the reviews...(I did not). My mistake was I never thought to look and confirm the quantity. Apparently I am not the only person to make this mistake. Amazon Prime is letting&lt;br /&gt;us get ripped off by deceptive advertisement. Makes me rethink whether it is worth the annual fee when Amazon Prime knows there is a problem and does nothing but to allow this to continue.</li>
    <li> as described, works great</li>
    <li> Great value for a name brand blade. I been buying from Costco, but these are half the price for the same razors you can not go wrong.</li>
    <li> I will not purchase these blades ever again. Upon receiving, I noticed that the packaging was slightly faded and when you open up the actual blades, the gel coating (the strip of green/blue) had actually MELTED on some parts of the blades. This concludes that the storage facility of these products are not the best of conditions, which will harm the performance of the actual blades against your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave me cuts and provided a more intense sting on the facial skin than blades usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-AmazonPro Reviews&lt;br /&gt;Est. Since 2003</li>
    <li> The blades sold by this seller are fake! You should never buy any blades from this seller, he/she is not honest at all.Trying to use these blades would be impossible, they are as good as a scraper. An old kitchen knife would do a better job. For more information, see this website: [...]</li>
    <li> Its just work perfectly as intended</li>
    <li> Blades were 10 years old. Looked brand new but were dull &amp; glue from strip fell right off. None of them worked. Wish they would have said these were a decade old. You learn I suppose.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my bf dad and he loves them. Great quality as usual seeing that it is a Gillette. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great value, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Razors.  Do razors need a 5 star rating? Only bought them on Amazon because they are ridiculously expensive and I had an Amazon gift card.  I now belong to Dollar Shave Club which is incredibly reasonable.</li>
    <li> excellent product and great service from seller. Recommand both to everybody.</li>
    <li> great product! product as stated and fast shipping! A+</li>
    <li> very suspicious low quality of the blades. feels very much  like fake.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to get a good deal of this and they charged me full price!</li>
    <li> I always like this over the latest versions.</li>
    <li> One reason I spend money buying the Mach3 is because they have always given me a smooth shave with no nicks.  I have just started using this refill and I have already cut myself twice.  The blade feels rough, like the disposable razors.  Not sure what the problem is or if I just got a bad bunch.</li>
    <li> Now a days the price of Mach 3 replacement blades are through the roof. I purchased the 16 pack through Amazon and saved at least 30% off from big box or super drugstore chains. They are so expensive these days that the retail stores keep them under lock and key. These are the origional, no knock offs and they are the best deal I have found. When I run low on the blades I will reorder from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price and came on time</li>
    <li> Very good price and quality product very happy with purchase thank you very much excellent material for easy grip and handling&lt;br /&gt;excellent product</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Saw these as a deal on DealNews and ordered them.  Great price for these!</li>
    <li> Their is a reason why these things are so expensive and successful and that is because they are the finest wet shave razor on the market. I&#x27;ve been waiting for over 10 years for a cheaper and better product to appear in the market and that has not happened</li>
    <li> Husband cares about value and likes a close shave without auctioning off his first born to get it. (Are we up to 8 blades yet?) He is quite happy with 3. I use the blades to shave my legs after he finishes with them for his daily face and neck shave. He looks great and my legs look smooth at the beach. No cuts or nicks.</li>
