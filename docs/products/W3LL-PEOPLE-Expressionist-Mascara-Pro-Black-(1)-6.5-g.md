      <li>I love, love, love this mascara!!</li>

      <li>This is the best natural mascara I have ever used!</li>
      <li>I did my research and thought I had found the perfect all- natural yuck-free mascara.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love knowing that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on my face was made in a kitchen, not a lab.</li>
      <li>The mascara itself works its magic by lengthening and separating the lashes.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Most mascaras make my eyes itchy and watery, however I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had any product one with this one.</li>
      <li>Just lovely.</li>
      <li>I love that part.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in mascara LOVE.</li>
      <li>Oily lotion will make it bleed more so</li>
      <li>Coverage is how I like it, more of a stain for lashes than caking on.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this product!  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t waterproof, but I prefer that, as it easily comes off with my make-up remover of choice (coconut oil) and doesn&#x27;t clump that way that so many waterproof mascaras do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural/organic mascaras that are available out there and have found that the W3ll People mascara delivers some of the best results.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a great buy for someone looking for a natural mascara that still performs!</li>
      <li>no clumping, clean look!</li>
      <li>Great all natural mascara.  </li>
      <li>the coolest thing about this product is I dont think it can EVER clump regardless of how many layers you apply, the bottle also raps tightly around the brush as you&#x27;re taking it out, so there&#x27;s no excess on the brush - Just perfect.</li>
      <li>Easily removed with coconut oil.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t clump, but not waterproof or even smudge proof.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easily and makes my lashes thicker and fuller.</li>
      <li>I think that this alternative to conventional mascara is an excellent substitute.</li>
      <li>I will say that it looks AMAZING when first applied.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
      <li>If you can handle a slight curl and great definition, this is the mascara for you!</li>
      <li>I suggest curling lashes applying  mascara in two to three  light coats( depending on desired outcome) and re-curling.</li>
      <li>Overall a great buy</li>
      <li>I never realized just how much time it would take to find products I liked after switching to chemical-free makeup, toiletries, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural mascara that actually works, and this product is the perfect fit!</li>
      <li>I am a huge advocate for chemical-free, as-natural-as-possible beauty products, but when it comes to mascara, I tend to go full chem.</li>
      <li>but with a regular eyelash curler and one layer of this I was good to go -</li>
      <li>I really, really, REALLY wanted to love this mascara, but I just can&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>but it looks good enough to me!</li>
      <li>I know this mascara is popular amongst the natural beauty community</li>
      <li>The fact that it is pure is just bonus!!</li>
      <li>You can do two coats, or more, if you want to get a more traditional mascara look.</li>
      <li>Super buildable if you want to go there.</li>
      <li>The second time and all subsequent uses since then I have been so impressed with the lengthening, thickening and curling effect.</li>
      <li>My new favorite mascara period.</li>
      <li>Love the natural ingredients as well!</li>
      <li>Love to use this and not worry about the junk I&#x27;m putting near my eyes!</li>
      <li>The easy removal is actually one of the things I love about it.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t crumble or clump too much, and after the third or fourth application getting used to the brush I was able to build some great defined volume.</li>
      <li>Makes me want to use it more frequently.  </li>
      <li>it is worth the price for anyone who values natural and safe cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>But that is the case with most natural mascaras.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wear contacts and have struggled for years to find a mascara that will both stay in place but is not loaded with terrible chemicals. This mascara has come to my rescue! I&#x27;ve been using it for around a month now and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is everything I hoped for. After trying a few other &#x27;good for you&#x27; mascaras and being underwhelmed by the performance vs price I stumbled across W3ll People. This mascara is just as good as other mascaras in this price point that have all the nasties included. Used to wear Dior and Tarte mascaras and this performs just as well. Doesn&#x27;t crumble or clump too much, and after the third or fourth application getting used to the brush I was able to build some great defined volume. Stays all day and then comes off with my regular face soap. Love to use this and not worry about the junk I&#x27;m putting near my eyes!</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t give you doll eyes.  Just get that out of the way.  But I have a lot of lashes they just need grooming to look nice.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t clump or make my eyes look ridiculous. Some mascaras give you this jagged lash look where it looks like you have 30 layers then it starts flaking. Not this stuff. I really like it.  I bought it b/c my eyes have started getting red when I wear mascara.  It&#x27;s weird. I never had that before but it just started and I had to do something.  I tried this and the problem is gone.  This makes my eyes look nice without making my eyes look caked with makeup.  I can tight line, put this one, and put one small smudge in the corner of my top brow and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a non-toxic mascara whose performance compares to conventional products. Lots of positive reviews on this one and I was so glad to find it available through Amazon!!! 2 days later I had it in hand and am now a convert!!! The brush is particularly awesome.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Super black and defining. The brush is similar to Chanel&#x27;s with the little plasticy nubs. Works great to comb through lashes. Mascara lasts all day with minimal flaking. Easily removed with coconut oil. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try W3LL PEOPLE mascara for a while, as my friend who is a vegan beauty vlogger raved about it to me. I absolutely love it. The brush has shorter bristles which amazingly prevents clumping. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch which I have had issues with with other brands. Overall a great buy and I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This mascara works great!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best mascara I have ever used. Prior to getting W3LL PEOPLE Expressionist I had been rotating between Lorac, Benefit and Tony Moly (Korean Brand) but all of these would either flake, make my eyelashes stick together or look over applied. Expressionist is none of these things: the formula not only is all natural which is so important when using a product daily like mascara but the formula is creamy as opposed to a liquid or gel like other mascaras. I have blonde eyelashes that are decently long but thin and this mascara quickly coats each last, root to tip and combs through them with each application making them look fuller than they actually are. After a full day of work and a workout the mascara stayed in place and only had the tiniest amount of smudge on my lower lash line (see photo). Absolutely a great buy for someone looking for a natural mascara that still performs!</li>
    <li> BEST mascara ever. No clumps just volume and length. Super buildable if you want to go there. Like that there&#x27;s no weird chemicals.</li>
    <li> The W3ll People mascara is one of the best. I&#x27;ve tried several natural/organic mascaras that are available out there and have found that the W3ll People mascara delivers some of the best results. The mascara itself works its magic by lengthening and separating the lashes. I&#x27;ve found that I can build multiple coats while its still wet and it doesn&#x27;t become clumpy. This is my favorite mascara!</li>
    <li> You would never know that this mascara is natural. I&#x27;ve worked hard to make better beauty choices, but I have had the hardest time kicking my Loreal Voluminous Mascara addiction. Well, it&#x27;s happened. This mascara builds and lengthens in only two coats, and does not clump. Best benefit is that I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my lashes than ever!</li>
    <li> Comes off and smears black under eyes during the day!</li>
    <li> Nice brush applicator is very fine and helps to apply this mascara without clumps and smudges.  The mascara goes on smoothly and looks natural.  In order to achieve the heights I want out of my mascara, I have to apply layers, letting it dry between applications.  I currently have 5 different vegan mascaras in my makeup kit because I&#x27;ve been trying to find one that is acceptable.  This one still doesn&#x27;t deliver as I had hoped, but it&#x27;s a far cry better than the others.</li>
    <li> nice but not as high brands or drug store mascara&#x27;s , it has really fine brush which didn&#x27;t really give that long lash effect. i liked it since know it is organic and docent have any harsh ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascaras I have ever used! The fact that it is pure is just bonus!! The brush is amazing too…..no clumping, clean look!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Goes on easy, lasts long and even better that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to smells.  For weeks I continued to catch a wiff of a yucky smell and kept thinking it was from a new clothing item I&#x27;d bought with a smell which I washed with other clothes. I though the smell had been transferred to a whole load of my clothes.  Then, while applying this mascara, the wand went right by my nose and I realized the smell was coming from the mascara.  I quit wearing it immediately and haven&#x27;t smelled that odor since.  Like I said, I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and it is possible that others would not notice it because it was not strong.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will never go back to other mascaras.  I have tried multiple organic and non organic / conventional mascaras and this ranks in as one of the best.</li>
    <li> I would say 4.5 stars.  So far this mascara stays on all day with very little bleeding under the eyes.  But it did bleed a little for me and the type of lotion I use.  Oily lotion will make it bleed more so beware if you use oils on your face.  But that is the case with most natural mascaras.  What&#x27;s nice is that oil will remove it too.  You dont need harsh chemicals to take it off!!  I have had no irritation with this product while traditional mascaras burn my eyes.  Coverage is how I like it, more of a stain for lashes than caking on.  You can do two coats, or more, if you want to get a more traditional mascara look.</li>
    <li> I really, really, REALLY wanted to love this mascara, but I just can&#x27;t.  I will say that it looks AMAZING when first applied.  I don&#x27;t normally choose a black mascara, as it&#x27;s so hard to find one that looks natural on me, but this one leave my lashes looking soft, natural, and beautifully well-defined.  My issue is that it just doesn&#x27;t last! I&#x27;m constantly finding black smudges under my eyes and along my brow line.  I thought maybe my 12 hour work shifts might have something to do with it, but even on days when I apply it for a few hours out, it still smudges everywhere.  I LOVE the W3LL PEOPLE brand, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  Don&#x27;t be deterred from trying their other products, they&#x27;re fantastic!  Plenty of people obviously love this mascara as well, so it might just be my wacky body chemistry :( Sad for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural mascara that actually works, and this product is the perfect fit! It applies evenly and the wand is very nice. It isn&#x27;t waterproof, but I prefer that, as it easily comes off with my make-up remover of choice (coconut oil) and doesn&#x27;t clump that way that so many waterproof mascaras do. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and it coats well. Would definitely recommend-- it is worth the price for anyone who values natural and safe cosmetic products.</li>
    <li> I admit I was not expecting much from this product because it is natural. I gave it a shot because of the reviews and because I was looking for a non toxic mascara. My expectations are more than exceeded! It does not give the same thickening that I get from other drugstore brands, but my eyelashes look beautiful. For occasions when I need a little extra I will just invest in falsies with non toxic glue.</li>
    <li> My Daughter turned me on to your product, I got the mascara yesterday and put it on right away. its light looks great. I fell asleep with out washing my face , so i thought great its gonna be a hard to get this off , but it was not , no black smudges around my eyes. I love it and i feel good about wearing something that is not harmful to me !</li>
    <li> I am SO happy with my decision to buy Well People mascara. It was a top choice by a blogger I follow and since one of the last things I&#x27;ve changed over to a chemical free/natural lifestyle is my makeup I&#x27;ve been wanting to really find the right mascara for me. Mascara is basically the only makeup I wear and so it was important to me that it would last all day and look like normal mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand that comes with Well People mascara is awesome! It applies the mascara really well and I experience minimal clumping. (I believe clumping only occurs because I stopped wearing mascara for so long and now I&#x27;m out of practice applying it.) The color is just like any mainline mascara color and it lasts all day for me. I&#x27;ve experienced some warm weather and sweat and it has maintained. I will say that I doubt it would last through crying ;) but I think that&#x27;s a good thing all things concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this brand and would heartily recommend it to ANYONE wanting a really good mascara. This isn&#x27;t just a really good &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascara. It&#x27;s a really good mascara period.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Does not smudge much, defines lashes.</li>
    <li> Great mascara!  Very, very black!  Gets the job done quickly, no clumps!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin and this one worked on me.</li>
    <li> Although I have heard great things about this brand,  I  was hesitant to order the mascara based on a couple of reviews saying it was  &amp;#34;wet and might streak&amp;#34;, however I can confirm that is not at all a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and ordered because I really wanted to complete the circle in my natural skin and makeup  switchover -and mascara was just about the last hold out.&lt;br /&gt;I have long lashes, but they are very fine, straight  and some are pale. This formula goes on evenly without clumps and can add length and thickness if applied properly. I suggest curling lashes applying  mascara in two to three  light coats( depending on desired outcome) and re-curling. My lashes look natural, yet lush , dark and full, which is exactly as i want them to look-and I have zero irritation. I am a contact lens wearer and I am very sensitive to any products on my skin or eyes. If I was dressing for a mega-event this might not give me the wow factor I need, but for every day, I really love it, and feel happy that I&#x27;m not putting bad stuff in my eyes or on the planet.</li>
    <li> It looks good and I feel so much better it doesn&#x27;t have all those toxic ingredients!  Is it the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn?  No, but it makes up for it by not killing me.  :)</li>
    <li> I never realized just how much time it would take to find products I liked after switching to chemical-free makeup, toiletries, etc. After more than a year of searching for a mascara that I didn&#x27;t hate I finally found this wonderful product! My only qualms are the plastic tube and wand (I try to produce as little waste as possible and these aren&#x27;t even recyclable) and the fact that I have to order it from Amazon (more materials, energy, and waste to get it to me). Baby steps...</li>
    <li> I will admit that I have not tried other natural mascaras, but after trying this one I don&#x27;t need to! This mascara is amazing, even after years of using the &amp;#34;big, bold&amp;#34; lashes mascara. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with flaking and have used it in both dry and very humid climates. I have absolutely found my new mascara for life!</li>
    <li> I adore all of W3LL People&#x27;s products, but this might just be my very favorite. They took their time in introducing a mascara, but their hard work pays off. 100% recommend, even to people who don&#x27;t mind chemicals in their cosmetics. It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Works wonders for my easily-irritated eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of W3ll People and have tried several of their products and adored most of them. Carbon Beauty sent this to me to try and... meh. I am a huge advocate for chemical-free, as-natural-as-possible beauty products, but when it comes to mascara, I tend to go full chem. I have dark lashes and don&#x27;t wear mascara on a regular basis — only for going-out and special occasions. When I wear it, I want it to show. A lot. If you like a more natural look — or are blonde — this is what you want. It doesn&#x27;t smear (but I never wear mascara on the bottom lashes anyway) and does last all day. I wear contact lenses but had no problems with flaking.</li>
    <li> This mascara provides beautiful dark black lashes with no clumping!  I love that part.  The only downside is that is wears off a bit onto my eyelids and does not look as vibrant as the day goes on.  This is the best natural mascara I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product!  I did my research and thought I had found the perfect all- natural yuck-free mascara. It went on great- my lashes looked amazing. However,  within 2-3 hours I had raccoon eyes. The mascara dries into a powder which gets everywhere :-( And I was really careful not to rub or touch my eyes! I was really disappointed.  I thought I had found &#x27;the one&#x27;. My search for the perfect, yuck-free mascara continues...</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a natural mascera for a while that doesn&#x27;t clump, make my eyes itch, and lasts all day. This one met all 3 needs. Most mascaras make my eyes itchy and watery, however I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had any product one with this one. It was so light, and coated my lashes easily with one swipe (I have very blonde lashes), and lasted all day without the need to reapply. I have been using it daily for about a week and so far no complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Goes on easily and makes my lashes thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> Great all natural mascara.  Yes it smudges if you wipe your eyes but otherwise I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  The easy removal is actually one of the things I love about it.  Makes me want to use it more frequently.  No clumping, separates the lashes nicely and two coats looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in mascara LOVE. This mascara goes on well AND stays on all day without flaking! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and looks great too. It&#x27;s not as \\&quot;full\\&quot; as some of the non-natural mascaras but it looks good enough to me! I love knowing that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on my face was made in a kitchen, not a lab. (Ingredient wise).</li>
    <li> It separates my eyelashes but doesn&#x27;t coat them very well.  I need to keep reapplying the mascara and it still doesn&#x27;t coat my lashes as much as I would like.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m surprised that this product is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as it out performs my usual brand. no flaking or smudging but a cinch to remove. i&#x27;m on my second tube, i really like it!</li>
    <li> It flaked and gave me dark circles after an hour or two. I since started using Juice beauty. It lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I know this mascara is popular amongst the natural beauty community so don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know 3 stars isn&#x27;t a raving review. I need a mascara that can hold a curl really well and this mascara isn&#x27;t that. I have tiny lashes and the wet formula here just doesn&#x27;t do the trick. It does, however define very well! If you can handle a slight curl and great definition, this is the mascara for you! Love the natural ingredients as well!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t clump, but not waterproof or even smudge proof.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I think that this alternative to conventional mascara is an excellent substitute. It will seem like a lighter application and less dramatic than others of the non-natural variety, but I appreciate its fine coat that does not clump and stays secure throughout the day. W3ll People continues to impress me.</li>
    <li> Super natural looking lashes that last all day and wipes off easily at night. I have very short thick lashes, so the chances of them curling is almost close to impossible - but with a regular eyelash curler and one layer of this I was good to go - the coolest thing about this product is I dont think it can EVER clump regardless of how many layers you apply, the bottle also raps tightly around the brush as you&#x27;re taking it out, so there&#x27;s no excess on the brush - Just perfect.</li>
    <li> Great mascara! Doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes off easily with natural makeup remover. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Best Mascara!!! I lov W3LL People!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this mascara!!</li>
    <li> This surprised me. I was not impressed at the first go. I think the brush was not coated enough. The second time and all subsequent uses since then I have been so impressed with the lengthening, thickening and curling effect. Just lovely. Now if only they could make it without the beeswax.</li>
    <li> My new favorite mascara period. Does a magnificent job at thickening, lengthening and separating my lashes. I only wear natural make up so that makes it extra fab.</li>
