      <li>As I use the shears, I dip the blades into the blade wash to get some of the dirt and hair out between the blades and combs to keep them clean and lubricated as I work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the identical formula for trademark purposes, but I would bet it&#x27;s very similar.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really works well getting all the fine hairs out of your clipper blades.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.   </li>
      <li>I use it on my Oster Fast Feed after every haircut, and it keeps the blades super clean.  </li>
      <li>The cap is just the right size to use as a bowl for cleaning.</li>
      <li>I use it first to clean away any coatings that are on newly purchased blades and combs, then as a wash and lubricant after I finish using the shears.  </li>
      <li>it really cleans the blades!</li>
      <li>I clip my horses and this keeps my blades from getting hot and keeps them lubricated .  </li>
      <li>This bottle should last me many years.</li>

      <li>because I enjoy the butch look and feel of a short cut.  </li>
      <li>is SO much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s instructions clearly point toward detachable blades although it does not specify anywhere so for anyone looking to clean fixed blades I suggest finding alternative unless experienced with clipper on at least a novice level!</li>
      <li>if you want your investment  insurance policy renewed this will certainly help a clean blade is next to godliness</li>
      <li>Keeps your blades clean and lasting.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, if you use clippers and don&#x27;t clean them, its your personal choice....</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this wash.</li>
      <li>Then I oil as normal.   </li>
      <li>If you know what this stuff is, you cant live without it, if you use electric</li>
      <li>Since I paid a fortune for my new Oster clipper, I decided to also use the cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Like using new clippers every time.</li>
      <li>and the work like new again.</li>
      <li>Really cleans and lubes the blades so it is ready for the next hair cut.  </li>
      <li>It has the EXACT same smell/consistency/attributes of WD40.</li>
      <li>This time, after buying some BETTER clippers than I&#x27;ve had in the past, I decided to also try this cleaner.   </li>
      <li>Ok but found it locally for a dollar less</li>
      <li>It keeps my expensive Oster clipper blades in good shape.  </li>
      <li>I recommend only for detachable blade systems not fixed blade systems where a user may submerge too much and cause fire or clipper damage!</li>
      <li>Cleans, oils the blades, no residue, no heavy grease left overs.</li>
      <li>Only way I use this on fixed blades is removing the blade from clippers and cleaning with brush!&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I cut my hair every weekend, every few weeks I run my clippers in a small dish, with a little of this stuff and it gets all the little stuff out, they work 100x better after i clean them out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just a little after each grooming cleans them up ready for next use.</li>

<li> not much to say here in that the wash cleans the shaver blades  .. thus it works.</li>

<li> I only use very small amounts as this stuff seems like wd-40 but does its job!</li>
<li> It can happen in other ways when we least suspect!</li>

    <li> It cleaned my blades well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a question... Is this WD40?  It has the EXACT same smell/consistency/attributes of WD40. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the identical formula for trademark purposes, but I would bet it&#x27;s very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might save money by just using WD40. I think this is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please smell and use WD40 and tell me this blade wash is not the same thing.  I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to give it four stars, but I&#x27;m knocking it down a star for the price.  You have to use a good portion of it in order to fill up a reservoir to clean the blades.  I can&#x27;t see myself getting more than 5-6 washings out of it.  You might save money by using WD40. (I&#x27;m not a spokesperson or anything, I just don&#x27;t like getting ripped off).  Almost $13 for this stuff that smells like kerosene.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering it I like it it really cleans the blades!</li>
    <li> This works really well. I have 3 clippers that I needed to clean and sharpen. 1 had some corrosion and this wash made all 3 sparkle and removed most of the corrosion. I highly recommend this wash.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, it lubricates and sanities your clippers.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;We have three large dogs.&lt;br /&gt;We keep the blades clean with this wash.&lt;br /&gt;It works great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> EPA approved!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeFernandeze Hill</li>

    <li> Does the job as it should. Cleans, oils the blades, no residue, no heavy grease left overs.</li>
    <li> great product. use it all the time. recommended</li>
    <li> Keeps your blades clean and lasting.  I also use it on those pricey disposables.  They last 5 times as long.</li>
    <li> Blade wash for washing clipper blades! I recommend only for detachable blade systems not fixed blade systems where a user may submerge too much and cause fire or clipper damage! Oster should further protect itself by adjusting the label to reflect so! Only way I use this on fixed blades is removing the blade from clippers and cleaning with brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s instructions clearly point toward detachable blades although it does not specify anywhere so for anyone looking to clean fixed blades I suggest finding alternative unless experienced with clipper on at least a novice level! The fire/damage risk for newbies and amateurs using it, is too great I feel! I have personally caught on fire &amp;#34;edgers&amp;#34; from oster spray! It can happen in other ways when we least suspect! I only use very small amounts as this stuff seems like wd-40 but does its job!</li>
    <li> if you want your investment  insurance policy renewed this will certainly help a clean blade is next to godliness lube her next</li>
    <li> This is a great blade cleaner and the only blade cleaner I use. I use it first to clean away any coatings that are on newly purchased blades and combs, then as a wash and lubricant after I finish using the shears.

    <li> I&#x27;ve always cut my husbands hair but never really cared or worried about how well I cleaned the clippers I guess.   This time, after buying some BETTER clippers than I&#x27;ve had in the past, I decided to also try this cleaner.   Well worth it.   Really cleans and lubes the blades so it is ready for the next hair cut.  Just put a small amount in a small dish and run the blades in it for several seconds.  Then I oil as normal.

    <li> Clean your blades and save on hair care costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buzz because I enjoy the butch look and feel of a short cut.  It will only be a few months before the savings from not going to a barber kick in, then every cut will be money in the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less is SO much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you go Oster, you never go back.</li>
    <li> Cleans the blade head as described. Works much better than the spray cleaner does. The first time I used this I cleaned my trimmer with the spray, then used this cleaner and was amazed at how much hair was still in the blades.</li>
    <li> Works like magic on our Oster Pro hair clipper. Cleans the clipper blades really good.</li>

    <li> great product, got more out after I thought it was clean. left a little oily residue so it helps lubricate too. definitely a must have</li>
    <li> Does its job quite well. Cleans and lubricates the blades</li>
    <li> this stuff works great on my clippers.  I shave my head once a week and use this to clean the blades once a month.  The cap is just the right size to use as a bowl for cleaning.</li>

    <li> Must have. Enough said if you have animals.</li>
    <li> Fine. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this works so well, but it does and I will never be without it!</li>
    <li> A must have if you spend the money on a nice set of clippers. Keep&#x27;em clean and oiled!</li>
    <li> I was glad I purchased this product. It really works well getting all the fine hairs out of your clipper blades. Just remember to oil your&lt;br /&gt;blades afterwards, because this is a solvent cleaner.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it is made by the same company of the clippers I purchased. It&#x27;s a very good blade wash and I recommend it to others. I have used it several times since my purchase and I will continue to buy this as long as they sell it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
