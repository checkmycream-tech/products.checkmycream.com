      <li>Great product, good price</li>
      <li>I was happy to find a set of three at a good price.</li>
      <li>but the quality is good.  </li>
      <li>The sprayer nozzles are of good quality and adjustable for mist to stream.  </li>
      <li>They are wonderful for mixing my own homemade cleaning products, etc&lt;br /&gt;However, has anyone else had an issue with the spray nozzles breaking easily?  </li>
      <li>the containers were Great Quality but the sprayers were very cheap out of 3 sprayers  </li>
      <li>Great alternative to the plastic cheap spray bottles.</li>
      <li>I ordered these for making my own cleaning supplies.  </li>
      <li>and I liked the idea that I was using a recyclable product for my cleaning supplies</li>
      <li>I ended up with three silver bottles, which are nice looking.</li>
      <li>2 star because they are nice looking but no star for performance.</li>
      <li>Indeed, the bottles came all in nice silver.  </li>
      <li>Very cheap design.  </li>
      <li>I really love these bottles.</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing 3 bottles from dollar tree and replace the top spray handle.</li>
      <li>That is okay</li>
      <li>I figured that was OK</li>
      <li>These are great for basic home and auto use with a good size.  </li>
      <li>While the bottles seem OK and do spray well, the bottom line is I need 3 spray bottles I can tell apart.  </li>
      <li>Can purchase a much better quality of 1 or 2...</li>
      <li>I, also, received three in silver, therefore not being able to distinguish one mixture from another if I were to use these bottles.  </li>
      <li>They work great with the adjustable nozzle, are a great weight, hold a good bit and at the same time stylish for our high end store.</li>
      <li>They are so good that I was willing to give one to a friend and kept two for myself.  </li>
      <li>Other than that they are great!</li>
      <li>Too easy to get bleach water for instance on rugs.</li>
      <li>The plastic top can become warped and pop off if you hold the full container by just the plastic head.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so true when people say quality is much better than quantity...</li>
      <li>Now they work fine.</li>
      <li>That color is fine so not a problem.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for months (almost a year) and everything seemed fine, but yesterday I opened the 2 bottles that had contained mixtures using vinegar to make refills and to my horror</li>
      <li>2 of them are fine.  </li>
      <li>The body of these are fine, but the cheap plastic spray nozzles were cheap and plastic.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about the bottles when the arrived-</li>
      <li>They were easy to fill with a soap/water mixture and always misted evenly with just the right amount of liquid.  </li>
      <li>Better quality than expected, adjustment on sprayer is ok, but could be better</li>
      <li>they look really cool</li>
      <li>Then my wife loves them so much she had me buy three more.</li>
      <li>The bottles are nice, not heavy.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was clued in to this nozzle-misnomer, so I already knew I was basically buying bottles and would have to replace the nozzle soon.</li>
      <li>I make up essential oil spray mixes, so it&#x27;s a nice looking bottle that the EOs won&#x27;t (I don&#x27;t think) eat through on their way to world dominance.</li>
      <li>The holes are so tiny I would have never seen them, but I&#x27;m lucky the bleach didn&#x27;t ruin my counter top and floor where it leaked.  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Would love to see item available in other colors.</li>
      <li>I took the chance and got them for my salon to keep near the shampoo area to help keep things clean.</li>
      <li>I could easily tell apart my different cleaning sprays.</li>
      <li>If you do order them, I recommend to have a back up cheap alternative head for them.</li>
      <li>structurally sound solid aluminum spray bottles.</li>
      <li>Until then, my bottle with the spray nozzle lid sits unused in my shower, ready for the day to be united with a working nozzle.</li>
      <li>really wish i had all three colors though.</li>
      <li>All the bottles looked very presentable in each exam room where they needed to be kept.  </li>
      <li>and she feels like she can put on as much hairspray as she desires.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They spray very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These may be advertised as \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot; but I now believe that they are an inferior metal that mimics the appearance of stainless.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using one with a mixture of dish soap and water for when I want to spray down and clean one or two dishes quickly.  </li>
      <li>I highly do not advise putting any strong chemical solutions in them as they are not zinc coated inside, which will cause the can to corrode.</li>
      <li>Evidently they don&#x27;t take action if their partners are misleading the consumers.</li>
      <li>That is true even for the bottle that only contained water.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a very successful job of false advertising that this company is clearly not going to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I spray the hair down most of the time.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it does say \\&quot;misc\\&quot; next to the description but other reviewers experienced the same thing</li>
      <li>Like many of the reviews have said, all three of mine were the same brushed aluminum color.  </li>
      <li>The aluminum spray bottle was right next to the fire box and came through with flying colors....</li>
      <li>If you want a nice spray bottle (I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to know if they will last) and don&#x27;t need to tell them apart, this is your product.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves his new Weber grill but he is always using my plastic spray bottles for his BBQ.</li>
      <li>All three of them broke after the first or second refill.  </li>
      <li>these  bottles are super durable, however after about a month of use one started leaking around the rim and wouldnt stop, then the second started leaking from where the pump handle piston moves and then the last one stoped working altogether about 40 days after reciept.  </li>
      <li>great bottles, i still have them but the pump/head on them is only mediocre.</li>
      <li>but I was really hoping for different colors that way</li>
      <li>As far as bottles go, this one does its job.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a spray bottle for your plans for something that&#x27;s not gonna be is that frequently</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a common thread size, so I should be able to slap on a pilfered Windex (or the like) nozzle and spray away.</li>
      <li>I use one to old grape seed oil and use it every</li>
      <li>but they seem okay with poor reviews/returns.</li>

<li> The sprayed action broke within a few weeks, and the stream of spray is weak and does little more than dribble out of the bottle.  </li>
<li> The cleaning crew bottles are ugly hardware store but work amazing.</li>
<li> the spray nozzle will die long before the bottle itself.</li>
<li> Now the last one has jammed too.</li>
<li> Why dos the photo show three bottles in three vibrant colors and why does one receive three dull grey colored bottles?</li>
<li> The other two leaked constantly, both at the neck</li>
<li> But obviously you need to be very careful when ordering from Amazon.com.  </li>
<li> Some f us learn the hard way and hope these review will help other buyer be clear of what they will actually get...</li>
<li> one black, one blue, one silver.... not the case.</li>
<li> the product shows 3 bottle of purple, black and aluminum... and there was no choices to make if you want either color or 3 of them, which led you to believe it will be three different colors, and it was not..</li>
<li> We had the big test last month when we had a small fire.</li>
<li> and I suppose these might get the job done, but if you need it to be used on a regular basis, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> Chances are that this is a fluke, but be careful if you order them.</li>
<li> But a few months later another stopped worked (the pump/spray mechanism stopped working with distilled water in it).</li>
<li> No packing slip or other paperwork.  </li>
<li> Should have listen to other reviewers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In addition to being delivered 8 days late, I only received silver bottles.  Yes, it does say \\&quot;misc\\&quot; next to the description but other reviewers experienced the same thing so it&#x27;s a very successful job of false advertising that this company is clearly not going to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should change the photo but they seem okay with poor reviews/returns.</li>
    <li> Indeed, the bottles came all in nice silver.  so no color combination.  but the quality is good.  I use them for floor cleaning products.  I had to use a permanent marker to distinguish them.  Good value!</li>
    <li> Spray heads work great and have the finest mist I have ever seen. Bottle is thick and durable. Would love to see item available in other colors.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be coming in multiple colors like above, it only comes in one color, and for me it was silver. That is okay I guess, but I was really hoping for different colors that way I could easily tell apart my different cleaning sprays. Oh well. Sigh. Other than that they are great!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for making my own cleaning supplies.  I&#x27;ve been using them for months (almost a year) and everything seemed fine, but yesterday I opened the 2 bottles that had contained mixtures using vinegar to make refills and to my horror I found that the insides had been corroded and the silver finish around the neck was flaking off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may be advertised as \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot; but I now believe that they are an inferior metal that mimics the appearance of stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had zero problems with the bottles that did not contain vinegar, so I will continue to use them for things like water, but I&#x27;m disappointed to say the least. I was really excited about the bottles when the arrived- they look really cool and I liked the idea that I was using a recyclable product for my cleaning supplies, guess you know where those bottle are now.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;m a barber and I spray the hair down most of the time.  When I came in a pack of three, one was already broken when I received it, the other lasted about a month, and the third had last about two months.  Very cheap design.  If you&#x27;re looking for a spray bottle for your plans for something that&#x27;s not gonna be is that frequently and I suppose these might get the job done, but if you need it to be used on a regular basis, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> the containers were Great Quality but the sprayers were very cheap out of 3 sprayers  1 works great! the 2nd one works O.K. and the 3rd dont work at all</li>
    <li> Ordered these for windex bottles at our jewelry store. They work great with the adjustable nozzle, are a great weight, hold a good bit and at the same time stylish for our high end store. I thought I would get a mixture of colors that are shown, but only received the silver. That color is fine so not a problem. Great alternative to the plastic cheap spray bottles.</li>
    <li> While the bottles seem OK and do spray well, the bottom line is I need 3 spray bottles I can tell apart.  It didn&#x27;t happen.  All three are silver.  Amazon.com could not confirm if there was a problem when I called them regarding the previous review.  They also seemed less than interested in the fact that a third party is posting bad information on the Amazon website.  If you want a nice spray bottle (I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to know if they will last) and don&#x27;t need to tell them apart, this is your product.  But obviously you need to be very careful when ordering from Amazon.com.  Evidently they don&#x27;t take action if their partners are misleading the consumers.</li>
    <li> These are excellent.  They are so good that I was willing to give one to a friend and kept two for myself.  I use one to old grape seed oil and use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new Weber grill but he is always using my plastic spray bottles for his BBQ. You guessed it....they melt next to the BBQ. So I turned to Amazon to find a metal spray bottle. I was happy to find a set of three at a good price. I never thought of a Beauty Supply place. We had the big test last month when we had a small fire. The aluminum spray bottle was right next to the fire box and came through with flying colors....no melting. Now I borrow his spray bottles for my plants.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these and they work great.</li>
    <li> One of my set didn&#x27;t work from day one. The other two leaked constantly, both at the neck and then you&#x27;d spray! Too easy to get bleach water for instance on rugs. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered this set, believing that what was pictured would be what I received.  Not the case.  I, also, received three in silver, therefore not being able to distinguish one mixture from another if I were to use these bottles.  They are being returned.  I suggest that the seller either change the photograph in order to represent the product properly or send the three colors as shown.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are a rip off.  The seal at the neck is not secure, so if you shake the bottle or knock it over, the solution leaks out!  Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. When I received three of these, all aluminum, a year ago and one didn&#x27;t work. I figured that was OK, I didn&#x27;t need three. I use them with water only for laundry and spraying the cats when they get on the furniture. But a few months later another stopped worked (the pump/spray mechanism stopped working with distilled water in it). Now the last one has jammed too. Worthless and a pain in the a**, now I need to find another spray bottle that doesn&#x27;t look like garbage to keep in my living room.</li>
    <li> Bottles leak all over the place and are very cold when using them.  I would not recommend at all; even for the price.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t screw together correctly. As soon as you pick up the bottle and try to spray it the bottom container falls off the sprayer and 2 out of the 3 sprayers don&#x27;t spray. simply horrible! returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> Should have listen to other reviewers. These are great bottles if you just want to look at them. I took the chance and got them for my salon to keep near the shampoo area to help keep things clean. The cleaning crew bottles are ugly hardware store but work amazing. These silver ones do not. 2 stopped working w/ in a week. Now the 3rd is acting up. I ended up purchasing 3 bottles from dollar tree and replace the top spray handle. Now they work fine. If you do order them, I recommend to have a back up cheap alternative head for them. 2 star because they are nice looking but no star for performance.</li>
    <li> 6 months in and only 2 of the 3 sprayers even work at this point :(&lt;br /&gt;I am using vinegar based cleaners so that may be the issue but I didn&#x27;t even get to refill a single bottle at this point so very disappointed,</li>
    <li> Better quality than expected, adjustment on sprayer is ok, but could be better</li>
    <li> These are great for basic home and auto use with a good size.  I have one containing a mixture of car detailing stuff, another with just water for ironing and the third as back-up.  The sprayer nozzles are of good quality and adjustable for mist to stream.  The seller should either note that color is not an option or place an option on the post, as I thought I was getting 3 different colors as in the post but to my surprise i received 3 silver cans. Thus the 4 stars rather than 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I highly do not advise putting any strong chemical solutions in them as they are not zinc coated inside, which will cause the can to corrode. (The seller should have stated this on the post as a warning to those that are looking to use chemicals)</li>
    <li> Um.....yeah. So, these should be marketed as bottles with a lid that LOOKS LIKE a trigger spray nozzle, because in the end, that&#x27;s all it is. I ended up with three silver bottles, which are nice looking. For two weeks the nozzle worked, and now it has given up the ghost. Luckily, I was clued in to this nozzle-misnomer, so I already knew I was basically buying bottles and would have to replace the nozzle soon. It&#x27;s a common thread size, so I should be able to slap on a pilfered Windex (or the like) nozzle and spray away. Until then, my bottle with the spray nozzle lid sits unused in my shower, ready for the day to be united with a working nozzle. As far as bottles go, this one does its job. I make up essential oil spray mixes, so it&#x27;s a nice looking bottle that the EOs won&#x27;t (I don&#x27;t think) eat through on their way to world dominance. Just need a nozzle so we can annihilate all germies with the touch of the trigger (spray). Three stars for the price and shininess of the bottles, docked two for the crappy &amp;#34;lids&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I would receive the colors in the picture, received all aluminum</li>
    <li> We received the silver bottle but only one, not the three pack. It works well for my toddler&#x27;s hair spray obsession. We fill it with water and she feels like she can put on as much hairspray as she desires.</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviews have said, all three of mine were the same brushed aluminum color.  I knew that going in and that is actually why I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They spray very well.  I have been using one with a mixture of dish soap and water for when I want to spray down and clean one or two dishes quickly.  I haven&#x27;t had any issue with the heads being clogged or the trigger failing.  The plastic top can become warped and pop off if you hold the full container by just the plastic head.  I always half hold the bottle and half hold the spray trigger.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as a set of 3 bottles.  I only received 1 bottle in my shipment.  No packing slip or other paperwork.  It is unacceptable to not receive what I paid for.</li>
    <li> i was under the impression i would be getting whats in the picture. one black, one blue, one silver.... not the case. three silver arrived, not what i was expecting or wanting, but is tolerable. structurally sound solid aluminum spray bottles. the spray nozzle will die long before the bottle itself. really wish i had all three colors though. no color coding for this guy... &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> We got these for cleaning medical exam tables.  All the bottles looked very presentable in each exam room where they needed to be kept.  They were easy to fill with a soap/water mixture and always misted evenly with just the right amount of liquid.  They never clogged, dented, or broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Not appropriate for DIY cleaning. Although the bottles themselves are durable, the plastic spray mechanism stopped working within a few weeks. That is true even for the bottle that only contained water.</li>
    <li> Why dos the photo show three bottles in three vibrant colors and why does one receive three dull grey colored bottles?</li>
    <li> these  bottles are super durable, however after about a month of use one started leaking around the rim and wouldnt stop, then the second started leaking from where the pump handle piston moves and then the last one stoped working altogether about 40 days after reciept.  great bottles, i still have them but the pump/head on them is only mediocre.</li>
    <li> I really love these bottles. I use them at my massage studio, as well as at home. They are wonderful for mixing my own homemade cleaning products, etc&lt;br /&gt;However, has anyone else had an issue with the spray nozzles breaking easily?  I&#x27;d be happy just to know where to find replacement sprayers...</li>
    <li> Do not buy these. The nozzles are very poor quality and one already stopped working. Now one of the bottles started leaking and I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a few uses. Not reliable.</li>
    <li> These bottles didn&#x27;t hold up at all.  All three of them broke after the first or second refill.  The sprayed action broke within a few weeks, and the stream of spray is weak and does little more than dribble out of the bottle.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy them if I were you.</li>
    <li> I thought these spray bottles would be perfect for what I need.  2 of them are fine.  The 3rd one however had a leak on the side of the bottle and bleach leaked out of it.  The holes are so tiny I would have never seen them, but I&#x27;m lucky the bleach didn&#x27;t ruin my counter top and floor where it leaked.  Chances are that this is a fluke, but be careful if you order them.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these. Then my wife loves them so much she had me buy three more.Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> the product shows 3 bottle of purple, black and aluminum... and there was no choices to make if you want either color or 3 of them, which led you to believe it will be three different colors, and it was not.. Mine came just gray metallic color which I describe it as (aluminum). One of the can bottle came dented... It is not worth the purchase of these product for $11.75, which I paid including the shipping &amp; handling... Can purchase a much better quality of 1 or 2... It&#x27;s so true when people say quality is much better than quantity... Some f us learn the hard way and hope these review will help other buyer be clear of what they will actually get... Happy shopping...</li>
    <li> The body of these are fine, but the cheap plastic spray nozzles were cheap and plastic. Traveled with one and the contents ended up all over my suitcase even though I screwed it on as tight as I could and turned off the spray nozzle.</li>
    <li> The bottles are nice, not heavy. The spray nozzle lacks in quality. I used mine once a day for two weeks and it broke.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price</li>
