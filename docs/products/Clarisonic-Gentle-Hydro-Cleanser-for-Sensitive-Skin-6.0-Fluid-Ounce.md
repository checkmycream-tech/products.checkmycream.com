      <li>highly recommend it :)</li>
      <li>It is especially good for sensitive skin or for more mature skin that needs a creamy cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
      <li>this seems to apply a little more easily with a slightly more oily feeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, as from what I can tell it works just as well as the old stuff if not</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and acne prone so it won&#x27;t take most of the cleansers out there without an alergy reaction.</li>
      <li>yet I believe better when product placed directly on the brush.  </li>
      <li>The blue refreshing gel cleanser is actually more gentle on my skin, so I ended up buying that</li>
      <li>It is very gentle &amp; fresh..</li>

      <li>It has a funny smell to it as well.</li>
      <li>Ok this was a big mistake to buy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very calming and fantastic for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>This is definitely a great winter product, but if you are acne prone, i would be careful especially in the warmer months.  </li>
      <li>and it feels soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I like the end result, soft, clean skin.</li>
      <li>I really do love my clarisonic facewash- I have tried using a few others on my clarisonic mia and haven&#x27;t found anything else that leaves my skin as smooth as this does.</li>
      <li>Used with the Aria kit it gave great results and left your face cleaner than any other product I have used.</li>
      <li>When I use this with my Clarisonic Mia on my face it feels so smooth and soft afterwards, better than some other hydrating cleansers I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I agreed to allow her to conduct a bacterial evaluation of my face - much to her surprise</li>
      <li>Not anything really special...just another cleaner</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this one.</li>
      <li>A gentle cleanser that I use every day.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, is very gentle for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>After I use the clarisonic machine, I have enough on my face to clean my eyes and remove all the makeup.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s nice to find a product that won&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin, but is still powerful enough to help keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend $25 or more for a tube of cleanser if I can get 3 times the size at CVS at 3 times less the price.  </li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t honor their warranty if you don&#x27;t buy their products from a worthy enough retailer by their snobby standards and</li>
      <li>My dry face gets all soft without becoming irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t experience dryness from it, it really cleanses every little bit of my skin, and it&#x27;s great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It is gentle and leaves my face soft.</li>
      <li>Soft and gentle on skin.</li>
      <li>, I had only a very mild spot next to an eye.  </li>
      <li>and I always worry about trying something new.  </li>
      <li>My wife has very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Keeps my face exfoliated and very soft.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product works well for me without skin irritation or an allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>this cleaner was far harsher than the normal cleaners sample bottle that comes with the Clarisonic itself.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ve never tried Clarisonic Hydro Cleaner for sensitive skin, buy this now!</li>
      <li>Also, it has a more pearl/cream color versus the old white, and it has a slight floral smell this time around.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Either the formula has changed or there are 2 versions for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 40s and have battled breakouts since early 20s.</li>
      <li>On the very plus side, a cosmetic associate stopped me selling a product to get rid of facial bacteria.  </li>
      <li>I like to for sensitive skin..</li>
      <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>as i have adult acne.  </li>
      <li>However, let me reiterate, it works just as well if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and use this product with the Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System.  </li>
      <li>I replaced my old cleanser with this.</li>
      <li>I would suggest this to anyone that does have sensitive skin like myself.</li>
      <li>so I got the sensitive cleanser for her.</li>
      <li>I have used things that were too harsh on my skin and too gentle, it was like I was Goldylocks, until this one was just right.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using it everyday and can see the difference. Tucson is hard on your skin but this is great</li>
    <li> Received my Clarisonic for Christmas and have used it daily since then. It cleans and moisturizes my skin and it feels soft and clean.</li>
    <li> My wife has very sensitive skin so I got the sensitive cleanser for her. Unfortunately (at least for her skin) this cleaner was far harsher than the normal cleaners sample bottle that comes with the Clarisonic itself. Then there is the issue of the warranty scam that the manufacture runs. They won&#x27;t honor their warranty if you don&#x27;t buy their products from a worthy enough retailer by their snobby standards and Amazon.com is not worthy in their book. Buy at your own risk for those two reason.</li>
    <li> Does a great job cleansing leaving skin feeling hydrated. Use on and off with foaming gel cleanser. Would definitely continue with this product.</li>
    <li> This might work for some, but I had to return it because even though it said &amp;#34;sensitive skin,&amp;#34; it made my face all red (My skin is dry except for an oily t-zone and is allergic to facial SPF). The blue refreshing gel cleanser is actually more gentle on my skin, so I ended up buying that instead (I used that for a month before trying this one). The brush and gel cleanser are great products. Keeps my face exfoliated and very soft.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry and sensitive skin, and I have tried almost everything on this planet to use with my Clarisonic; nothing seemed to quite work for my skin, but this cleanser. I have used things that were too harsh on my skin and too gentle, it was like I was Goldylocks, until this one was just right. Really, it&#x27;s awesome. I don&#x27;t experience dryness from it, it really cleanses every little bit of my skin, and it&#x27;s great for everyday use. It smells awesome, too, which is something that&#x27;s not common for cleansers for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I like to for sensitive skin.. It is very gentle &amp; fresh..</li>
    <li> as i have adult acne.  i use the clarisonic cleaner and this cleanser and have very few breakouts.  it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Clarionic Gentle Hydro Cleanser is an excellent product.  I don&#x27;t like to spend $25 or more for a tube of cleanser if I can get 3 times the size at CVS at 3 times less the price.  I tried the cheaper cleanser with my Clarisonic brush and it was messy and leaked off the brush onto the counter after use, even after cleaning.  The Clarisonic product is thick, creamy, and really lasts a long time.  You really don&#x27;t need much on the brush; I&#x27;ve tried very small amt on my face, then using the brush. Works fine yet I believe better when product placed directly on the brush.  I will take a deep breath and buy the better product.</li>
    <li> I really do love my clarisonic facewash- I have tried using a few others on my clarisonic mia and haven&#x27;t found anything else that leaves my skin as smooth as this does. Yes it&#x27;s expensive but you only need a small drop- My husband and I both use this, and I think one lasts us for about a month- and we both use the clarisonic once a day, so I would say this bottle has about 60 uses? worth it to me!</li>
    <li> I do like this cleanser it feels like it hydrates my skin and cleanse it well, I use it with the Clarisonic soft facial brush. I just wish that it will foam even just a little.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cleanser for sensitive skin. It is gentle and leaves my face soft. It cleans your skin, without striping it. It also has a&lt;br /&gt;light, clean scent.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it makes my skin really dry.</li>
    <li> Using this cleanser with my Clarisonic Mia daily has helped keep my skin clear and soft.  I love this product!  I have very sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s nice to find a product that won&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin, but is still powerful enough to help keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> Love my clarisonic and this cleanser.  I have very sensitive skin and this product works well for me without skin irritation or an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> The container&#x27;s seal was obviously broken and I don&#x27;t think the full amount of product was in the container.  I didn&#x27;t send it back out of laziness!</li>
    <li> When I bought the Clarisonic Skin Care Brush I thought that the solution that comes with the brush was just a scam. I was wrong. My skin is extremely sensitive and acne prone so it won&#x27;t take most of the cleansers out there without an alergy reaction. I&#x27;ve been using this product it&#x27;s been 2 months now, twice a day, and never had any problems with it, on the contrary. After using this product your skin feels clean but not dry as well as smooth too. All you need is a dab or two of the solution because it spreads easily all over your face and neck. One tube will last you more than one month and it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic makes cleansers for every need but this one, that was the first they launched is still the best.</li>
    <li> My face has never felt so smooth and clean! This was much less expensive than purchasing elsewhere. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and very luxurious and soothing without being greasy. Cleans well. I use with my Cheap Clarisonic knock off and it works great.</li>
    <li> Soft and gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> Along with the mia, this cleanser is excellent. I&#x27;m 50 and need a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t suck me dry. This works very well, surprisingly well. After I use the clarisonic machine, I have enough on my face to clean my eyes and remove all the makeup.</li>
    <li> I use my clairsonic daily. Find this one to be the best for my face. Leaves a very clean feeling without drying. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Just a few months ago (just after Summer 2012) Clarisonic added/removed a few ingredients from the previous Hydro Cleanser wash for sensitive skin to make this new formula. I was a bit reluctant to make the expensive purchase since my skin is so picky, but I bit the bullet anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did, as from what I can tell it works just as well as the old stuff if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy utilizing this with his hands (I don&#x27;t have a Clarisonic), I did notice a few differences. this seems to apply a little more easily with a slightly more oily feeling. To me, it feels like I use a little less of it than when I used the old formula -- meaning more bang for the buck! Also, it has a more pearl/cream color versus the old white, and it has a slight floral smell this time around. However, let me reiterate, it works just as well if you have sensitive skin. My dry face gets all soft without becoming irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;ve never tried Clarisonic Hydro Cleaner for sensitive skin, buy this now! If you&#x27;re coming over from the original face wash, I think you&#x27;ll be just as happy here as you were before.</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews but just have to for this cleanser. I am in my early 40s and have battled breakouts since early 20s. This cleanser used with clarisonic has changed my life. No more breakouts, even the very stubborn ones before my cycle!! Nothing ever worked for me, and I tried everything. Try this and you will not be sorry. Best $25 spent ever.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT ORDER THIS.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I always worry about trying something new.  Leaves my face feeling smooth and soft and no breakouts!  On top of all that it smells wonderful and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product, even with using the Clarisonic scrubber, does not feel like it cleans the skin at all. It leaves an oily film behind and feels like the pores are clogged instead of cleaning it like their other products. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used with the Aria kit it gave great results and left your face cleaner than any other product I have used.</li>
    <li> Ok this was a big mistake to buy. As the original brush works great. I thought the cashmere brush would be even better. No..... It just smoochs the soap around the face not really cleaning.  I am sorry I bought it. I know I will not use it.</li>
    <li> Not anything really special...just another cleaner</li>
    <li> When I use this with my Clarisonic Mia on my face it feels so smooth and soft afterwards, better than some other hydrating cleansers I have tried.  I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, but it does last a long time (I only use a dime size dot once a day).  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was careful when ordering this. Either the formula has changed or there are 2 versions for sensitive skin. I really don&#x27;t like this one. It has a funny smell to it as well.</li>
    <li> Not bubbling enough.  Leaves kind of  a lotion feel and don&#x27;t like the smell as much as the regular cleanser by Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> A gentle cleanser that I use every day. It is especially good for sensitive skin or for more mature skin that needs a creamy cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic and Gentle Hydro Cleanser for Sensitive Skin about 3 years now and absolutely love it.  It does give my skin a &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling, however moisturizer eliminates that.  I have that with all cleansers so it not something I can&#x27;t deal with.  On the very plus side, a cosmetic associate stopped me selling a product to get rid of facial bacteria.  I agreed to allow her to conduct a bacterial evaluation of my face - much to her surprise, I had only a very mild spot next to an eye.  I credited the cleanliness to Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Works really nice. Like it</li>
    <li> As Advertised-Work Great</li>
    <li> This works great and really cleans my skin! I would suggest this to anyone that does have sensitive skin like myself.</li>
    <li> Arrive in timely manner and works well with my skin for the past month. I can tell dead skin is all removed. Works best on Clarisonic brush.</li>
    <li> This is an okay cleanser but I would not buy it again because it is not much of a moisturising cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I use. I received it as a gift a couple years ago with the Clarisonic brush and have been buying it ever since. You only need a little bit so it lasts a long time and is well worth what you pay for it!</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell and feels good on my skin.  I like the end result, soft, clean skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, is very gentle for those with sensitive skin. Product competitive priced and ships quickly. I replaced my old cleanser with this.</li>
