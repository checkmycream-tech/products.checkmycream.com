    <li> They are very good for the price. They have a bit of a strange smell even after washing. The thumb hole is a little tight and stiff. I got them for working in a cold office and they seem to be working out great for that purpose.</li>

    <li> Incredibly, incredibly itchy! Just a very cheap, nasty chinese product. Stay away!</li>
    <li> They smelled a little weird, but other than that they&#x27;re pretty good. I wish they went further up my hands, though</li>
    <li> love these, went back and purchased 3 more in different colors. good thick material and makes a great fashion statement</li>

    <li> not nearly as long as shown in picture.  they came up a drop past my watchband</li>
    <li> I really like these gloves!! They are soft &amp; warm &amp; fit larger hands well!</li>
    <li> These gloves took well over a month to arrive and the quality is not that great.  They were pretty inexpensive and so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> They were unraveling when I opened them.  I will have to sew them to keep the stitches together.  Not well made.  My first pair was fine so I ordered another but I am disappointed with quality this time.</li>
    <li> Great gloves great value! They fit well and keep my hands warm. I actually ordered two more pairs.</li>
    <li> These gloves are just great.  I have arthritis in my hands and 2 big dogs.  The gloves allow me to go out to play early in the morning and after dark when it&#x27;s pretty chilly here in Northern California.  I&#x27;m getting a back-up pair!</li>
