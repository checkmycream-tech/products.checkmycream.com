      <li>and it was amazing to take it off each time and see how much more the incision had closed!  </li>
      <li>First time in three months I have been rash free...</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t healed completely, but it has filled in significantly.</li>
      <li>IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT ,BUT HAS TO BE ALTERNEATE WITH OTHER METHOS TO PROVOC  HEALLING .</li>
      <li>Right on time delivery.  </li>
      <li>She used Manukaguard the first few days and had great results with the cooling and healing.</li>
      <li>First of all, the &#x27;medicine&#x27; is one of the best kept wound treatment secret I know of.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;Shipping was VERY fast.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t  give this a higher rating even though it was working.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works !</li>
      <li>Infact the first time I used it the tube split</li>
      <li>Granulation tissue filled in quickly, and medihoney actually helped with the pain the minute I applied it..</li>
      <li>I am a health professional and can say I would recommend this to anyone with an uninfected significant burn or abrasion (who isn&#x27;t allergic to honey).  </li>
      <li>Its also good for burns and everyday cuts and scrapes, and acne too!</li>
      <li>Great healer for moderately wet to dry wounds.</li>
      <li>Works very well on wounds.</li>
      <li>THANKS FOR HAVING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>It sped up the healing so much</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing.</li>
      <li>Worked very well on my dogs cut on his leg.</li>
      <li>really helped heal toe ulcers</li>
      <li>Seems to help much better than other wound dressings for foot ulcers.</li>
      <li>and my sugars went steadily upward.  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is real, natural honey but don&#x27;t put it in your tea:  </li>
      <li>I went back to a run of the mill antibiotic cream and healing picked right up again.</li>
      <li>The tube is a little smaller than I was expecting, and the honey is NOT a gel, but it is the kind of honey I wanted.</li>
      <li>My regular doctor then sent me to a specialist and  he told me that the steroid cream was way to strong to be using long term.</li>
      <li>He prescribed another cream that was essentially the same only not as strong and said that the rash was eczema.</li>
      <li>healing was much faster than expected, in a week was ready for prime time with no additional oozing, leaking, or any infection.  </li>
      <li>This is recommended over wounds to draw out infections and prevent further infection and improve healing which it does very well.</li>
      <li>As far as medical use, so far seems to work very well.</li>
      <li>I am amazed and I simply have no explanation as to why these products very dramatically stalled the healing progress.</li>
      <li>The TheraHoney has completely cleared up the rash on my face within one week.</li>
      <li>Unless you are totally against using normal wound care, I would skip this stuff.</li>
      <li>but it definitely doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this stuff to take the place of my bacitracin but it really has a limited use.</li>
      <li>In my case it did not see to have much effect other medicines have.  </li>
      <li>I kept it on the skin until the blister leaked out completely, then after the blister skin started to dry out and peel</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A thousands of years old remedy in a tube!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle and effective wound therapy.</li>
    <li> IT IS THE BEST THING EVER.... I&#x27;ve been fighting 2 bedsores on my legs for 2 1/2 years with wet to dry until my sister-in-law told me about this. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 or 4 months and my sores went from 5 in. round and 5-6 inches deep on both to 1 cm. round and 2 cm. deep on one and 3 cm. round with 4-5 cm. deep on the other.. I WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE... THANKS FOR HAVING THIS PRODUCT. It has already blown my Doctors away on how great it has healed my wounds.</li>
    <li> Seems to help much better than other wound dressings for foot ulcers.</li>
    <li> Excellent for healing wounds and scratches of a severe nature</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a diabetic who had a few wounds that were resistant to healing. This product was recommended by a wound care clinic. Wow,this stuff works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> Great fro diabetes patients!</li>
    <li> I like this product. Will use again</li>
    <li> My mother has ulcers on her legs and TheraHoney is healing them faster then any other medicine that has been supplied by doctors.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a rather effective product</li>
    <li> dont know yes hasnt been long enough.</li>
    <li> excellent for wound care healing.</li>
    <li> Stickey, stickey, stickey.  I had heard you can put it on a pimple to heal it.  No you can&#x27;t.  It makes a big glob of yellow on your face, and if you put it on at night, it will be all over your pillow case and hair.  I haven&#x27;t used it under a bandage.</li>
    <li> really helped heal toe ulcers</li>
    <li> Great product. I helps heal faster than others</li>
    <li> I was given this from a wound clinic that had been treating me for a botched bone spur surgery that did not heal for 18 months. This is made from honey that bees only feed from the echinacea plant. The echinacea plant produces cabidinyol &amp;#34;CBD&amp;#34; which promotes healing</li>
    <li> I bought both Manukaguard and TheraHoney for my aunt&#x27;s 2nd degree burn. She used Manukaguard the first few days and had great results with the cooling and healing. The only problem was it crystallized and pulled on her skin so she switched over to TheraHoney hoping it wouldn&#x27;t crystallize since it&#x27;s in a tube and it&#x27;s a gel. Within seconds of application, her wounds started to itch to the point that she had to wash her arm down with saline solution. We&#x27;re guessing even though the tube says &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; manuka honey, there must be other ingredients not listed that gave her the terrible allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT ,BUT HAS TO BE ALTERNEATE WITH OTHER METHOS TO PROVOC  HEALLING .</li>
    <li> Excellent for healing of &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; wounds.  This is not meant to be used on unopened skin, scratches, etc.  This is recommended over wounds to draw out infections and prevent further infection and improve healing which it does very well.</li>
    <li> I read nothing but good things re formal medical studies of honey for foot ulcers. I was amazed when using this stalled healing for weeks. I went back to a run of the mill antibiotic cream and healing picked right up again. I have no explanation for this. This applies to this and also a different medical honey. I had done extensive research and was convinced honey was going to cure my foot ulcer. I am amazed and I simply have no explanation as to why these products very dramatically stalled the healing progress. Don&#x27;t avoid these just because of this one review because in formal medical settings this stuff has worked minor miracles. I wish I knew why it didn&#x27;t work on me. Maybe I have some weird allergy to the honey because while I used it the callous around the ulcer because incredibly thick. Once I stopped, the callous reduced itself to nothing. I am speechless.</li>
    <li> This product is great in repairing Diabetic Wounds. It was recommended to me by a nurse. It works great and you can see that in a couple of weeks the wound starts to close. I just wish it was a bigger amount of honey.</li>
    <li> Right on time delivery.  Use this for my husbands wound care. Keeps bandages on with out having to worry about them coming off.</li>
    <li> I had surgery july 29th 2013, and my incision wasn&#x27;t healing all the way, and this stuff was recommended to me by a wound care specialist.  This stuff is amazing.  It sped up the healing so much and it is very easy to use.  I changed the dressing with the therahoney on it once every ~24 hours (after I showered) and it was amazing to take it off each time and see how much more the incision had closed!  I would absolutely recommend this stuff.  Its also good for burns and everyday cuts and scrapes, and acne too!</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order.  My husband has leg ulcers.  This worked the best of the various products.  It hasn&#x27;t healed completely, but it has filled in significantly.</li>
    <li> For months I have had a problem with a rash around my lips. The doctor said it was an allergy and prescribed a strong steroid cream. It helped some but did not take care of the problem. My regular doctor then sent me to a specialist and  he told me that the steroid cream was way to strong to be using long term. He prescribed another cream that was essentially the same only not as strong and said that the rash was eczema. I used that cream for 6 weeks and still had the rash. I came across the TheraHoney while searching  for Manuka honey. It said it could be used for eczema. Long story short. The TheraHoney has completely cleared up the rash on my face within one week. First time in three months I have been rash free...If you have exhausted all the medical avenues I suggest that you try this honey. It works...</li>
    <li> Great natural product.</li>
    <li> IT WORKED BETTER THAN NEOSPORIN</li>
    <li> The tube is a little smaller than I was expecting, and the honey is NOT a gel, but it is the kind of honey I wanted.&#x27;Shipping was VERY fast.</li>
    <li> I became familiar with this product while I was in the hospital. It was used to treat some leg sores and I was and am amazed at its healing properties. If you had told about this, I would have dismissed it as being an alternative heath method. I would have been very wrong. I am keeping the product on hand from now on.</li>
    <li> Amazing, what else can I say !!!</li>
    <li> it has worked for me no infection on a opened wound from surgery</li>
    <li> Great healer for moderately wet to dry wounds. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend she said its the only stuff she uses for her son.</li>
    <li> A good product and recieved what I had order will order again.  Just wish the tubes were larger in size.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t  give this a higher rating even though it was working.  The warning for diabetics to watch sugars when using it is not to be ignored.  I used it for less than a week and my sugars went steadily upward.  If you aren&#x27;t diabetic, by all means use it!</li>
    <li> As far as medical use, so far seems to work very well.Its very thick though,which makes it very hard to squeeze out. Infact the first time I used it the tube split so I have to store it in a little plastic baggy now.So the tube has to be redesigned or made stronger some how. So you have to be careful when you squeeze some out.</li>
    <li> use for dibriding and has started to work and remove necrotic tissue with good results that can be seen by the eye in a short time</li>
    <li> Very good product.  A little expensive but worth it.  It does not work overnight so be patient.  Very soothing.</li>
    <li> Medical honey? I had the same results with honey I bought from the store. So for me this was too spendy. Also my doctor didn&#x27;t agree with my decision to use honey therapy. I did anyway and saved my leg from an advanced diabetic ulcer!!</li>
    <li> my wound is closed at 100 % with this product , I try Aloe and other products but this is work fast.</li>
    <li> it,s a wonderful product for burns.we have used it on steam burns and burns from spilling boiing water on a foot and arm with excellent results.i would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for what I used this ointment for, I had problems with my feet and it had broken skin open sores. After using this ointment it helped healing I would order more. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Good natural wound treatment. Debridement occurs in conjunction to healing skin.</li>
    <li> I used on a wound and like others I read would make the healing faster.  In my case it did not see to have much effect other medicines have.  Every body heals differently.</li>
    <li> Worked very well on my dogs cut on his leg.</li>
    <li> I admit, I was reeled in by all of this talk about homeopathic remedies. I had heard great things about this honey but it definitely doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I was expecting this stuff to take the place of my bacitracin but it really has a limited use. This might be best as just a burn cream and not for everyday cuts and scrapes. One thing that was annoying is that it leaked out of any bandage and gets everything sticky. I also didn&#x27;t notice any impact on healing time or pain reduction. Unless you are totally against using normal wound care, I would skip this stuff.</li>
    <li> Therahoney Gel is a great product which helps speed the healing oif cuts and burns when used under a bandade or other dressing..</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> omg, had a 5inch second degree burn on knee and this stuff just worked better than anything else.  I kept it on the skin until the blister leaked out completely, then after the blister skin started to dry out and peel, medihoney kept the raw site hydrated and protected.  healing was much faster than expected, in a week was ready for prime time with no additional oozing, leaking, or any infection.  Granulation tissue filled in quickly, and medihoney actually helped with the pain the minute I applied it..&lt;br /&gt;I would say it is a miracle product, if I believed in miracles.  Lets just say its slightly unconventional science.  BTW- I am a health professional and can say I would recommend this to anyone with an uninfected significant burn or abrasion (who isn&#x27;t allergic to honey).  I later had the occasion to apply it to my face after a falling bicycle took a big chunk of skin off my nose.  Extremely rapid healing.</li>
    <li> Great product,  Hospicerecommended</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  First of all, the &#x27;medicine&#x27; is one of the best kept wound treatment secret I know of.  This stuff is real, natural honey but don&#x27;t put it in your tea:  It is treated with chemicals to make it more effective.  My daughter is a nursing student who learns about various treatments and this one is one, if not the.  I</li>
    <li> Works very well on wounds. It&#x27;s heals in about a month.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully on the sores on my daughter&#x27;s tender feet.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works ! Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> I like the product I think it is on the expensive side though works great on wounds that are healing slow. I have diabetis so healing of any wound is important.</li>
