### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with the purchase!</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t perfect but will do for now</li>
      <li>in all this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Has a good fit and works great!</li>
      <li>The mask was of good quality and arrived promptly packaged nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>great product, great price, shipped very quickly, highly recommended</li>
      <li>I love this mask, I use it six times per day.</li>
      <li>Quality could be better, items lost shape.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>but so far I think it is a good difference.</li>
      <li>My mom is petite and a shorter mask of this quality would fit perfectly; she had a small face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product fast delivery and reasonably priced</li>
      <li>It fit my tubing and the price was right.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Extremely large for a regular adult.</li>
      <li>I have found that it is very convenient to use a mask with my nebulizer instead of having to hold a big fat tube in my mouth.</li>
      <li>There is no medicine cup attachment for a nebulizer, so if you buy it, save your old one.</li>
      <li>only draw back is that Id like to purchase an adult mask, same quality, but a little smaller (length wise).</li>

<li> Does not fit well on patient.</li>
<li> A bit small but works for me!</li>
<li> Before the mask I held it with my hand or used my teeth to hold it, now I can relax and complete a boring task in comfort.</li>
<li> and as I am supposed to inhale through my mouth, this mask is useless.</li>

    <li> Mask is not ELONGATED, in fact it is the same length as a child&#x27;s mask. I am an average size female and the only way it fits is if I keep my mouth clamped shut and as I am supposed to inhale through my mouth, this mask is useless. There is no medicine cup attachment for a nebulizer, so if you buy it, save your old one.</li>
    <li> Helped my mother take her breathing treatments.</li>

    <li> It works just like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> great product, great price, shipped very quickly, highly recommended</li>
    <li> A bit small but works for me!</li>
    <li> Works well. No funky smell</li>
    <li> This mask is just what we needed to replace the kid sized masks that we had.</li>
    <li> Quality could be better, items lost shape.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, I use it six times per day. Before the mask I held it with my hand or used my teeth to hold it, now I can relax and complete a boring task in comfort.</li>

    <li> Fits the face.  Meets every expectation.</li>
    <li> Good product fast delivery and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Does not fit well on patient.</li>
    <li> Only comes with a mask and tube. It does not come with the nebulizer compartment to store the liquid albuterol in it. Not suited for my needs.</li>
    <li> This item was thin and flimsy, but it does the job considering that its a face mask and not expensive at all.</li>
    <li> ...product leaks out sides and bottom.</li>
    <li> Has a good fit and works great! It is different than the one it was replacing but so far I think it is a good difference. It fits snuggly and stays on. The tube stays in and doesn&#x27;t pop out. Very happy with the purchase!</li>
