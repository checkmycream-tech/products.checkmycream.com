      <li>I&#x27;m an African aamerican woman with a caramel complexion and this makes perfect highlighter in Medium Bronze.</li>

      <li>I love this bronzer.</li>
      <li>The brush was ok</li>
      <li>so I use this on areas of my face that the sun would naturally hit and it looks great.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and the medium bronze doesn&#x27;t really show.</li>
      <li>Definitely good purchase, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It may not be a good bronzer for you if you&#x27;re going for a sun kissed or more dramatic look, unless you&#x27;re very fair skinned.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, but it doesn&#x27;t give the bronze color i was looking for</li>
      <li>This was good, I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was, but great for a travel makeup bag or for</li>
      <li>I love the color, all day wear, but always finishes quickly</li>
      <li>Overall, I can see this looking great on all complexions because it&#x27;s not too orange or too brown, yet it does add a sun touched glow to the skin.</li>
      <li>and I have light brown skin</li>
      <li>I am light skinned by the way.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>I bought the light bromze</li>
      <li>The bronzer isn&#x27;t smooth, and it barelt comes off on the brush.</li>
      <li>I really do enjoy</li>
      <li>Another pain point is the bronzer itself crumbles and breaks apart super easy.</li>
      <li>I like this product - I was worried that it would be too dramatically dark, but it shades exactly and perfectly.</li>
      <li>I loved this Blush, the color match with every possible style &amp; clothes..</li>
      <li>I use this for eyeshadow and I am very fair skinned and this color is not too dark, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>I really liked how smooth it was and how nicely is brushed on my skin.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>and I am pleased with it when I am doing a natural face.</li>
      <li>Just the right color and size.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too  dark which is perfect for daily use.  </li>
      <li>Maybelline New York Fit Me Bronzer in medium.</li>
      <li>It would be great for a flat look, but for me it just didn&#x27;t personally work and I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
      <li>I only wish it were shipped better because the powder arrived in pieces.</li>
      <li>I love my bronzer, just as I expected, recommend this to anyone who wants to achieve a more natural look.</li>
      <li>im just really a fan of maybelline..</li>
      <li>it was very pink/orange.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t show much color</li>
      <li>These blushes were not designed to travel in a purse and since they are so lightly pigmented that is a big problem because I find myself needing to reapply it often.</li>
      <li>I got it, and it looked like how it showed on the picture, but when I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t really show besides the sparkly part.</li>
      <li>I cannot gaurantee that it will stay on the whole day.</li>
      <li>It is for that reason  that l only buy the Fit</li>
      <li>I actually don&#x27;t use this as bronzer because it isn&#x27;t as good as other bronzers I&#x27;ve found (go with Rimmel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use your own brush, but other than that, it provides a soft bronze color for my eyelids.</li>
      <li>I have never used a bronzer until recently and was extremely excited to try.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this bronzer from other stores, and was able to see it on my skin.</li>
      <li>It really is not worth paying more than $3.00.</li>
      <li>I own at least 6 blushes/bronzers and counting.and almost every trip to the drug store</li>
      <li>It added a very subtle, natural glow that&#x27;s appropriate for work and still very pretty.</li>
      <li>my complexion the Medium warms my face up with just a natural hint of color.</li>
      <li>I had to apply a lot of product and it didn&#x27;t look natural</li>
      <li>I got the medium that goes well with my natural beige foundation.</li>
      <li>The picture is much lighter and more subtle looking than the actual product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing. Only problem, it came damaged; however, not damaged to the extent that it&#x27;s not usable. Totally usable still and I&#x27;m loving it! Just got it today, but I&#x27;ve used it on myself and my mother! Works wonderfully and will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product according to its very cheap price. I really liked how smooth it was and how nicely is brushed on my skin. However, the brush that comes with the bronzer is not that good. It is okay/decent. It takes me a while to blend out the bronzer with the tiny brush which is time consuming. The product itself is pretty subtle (doesnt show as much) unless you dab a lot for the powder to actually appear on ur skin. I cannot gaurantee that it will stay on the whole day. But overall, the bronzer works and it&#x27;s cheap so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t show much color and I think it might be breaking me out too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, very cheap and good quality</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t use this as bronzer because it isn&#x27;t as good as other bronzers I&#x27;ve found (go with Rimmel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this more as a shadow for my eyes since it&#x27;s light and great for day makeup. The brush is useless. Use your own brush, but other than that, it provides a soft bronze color for my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I really do enjoy Maybelline New York Fit Me Bronzer in medium. I own at least 6 blushes/bronzers and counting.and almost every trip to the drug store I find myself trying to procure more of them. So why the three stars? The packing is just repulsive. The clear plastic top has broken off the body of almost all of the Maybelline blushes that I have bought. Another pain point is the bronzer itself crumbles and breaks apart super easy. This is something I have now come to expect. It is for that reason  that l only buy the Fit Me bronzer when Rite Aid has it on sale for 40% off. It really is not worth paying more than $3.00. These blushes were not designed to travel in a purse and since they are so lightly pigmented that is a big problem because I find myself needing to reapply it often. This bronzer has very limited staying power. I continue to repurchase these because I love the price and yes I admit you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;On my complexion the Medium warms my face up with just a natural hint of color. It&#x27;s not too  dark which is perfect for daily use.  I use this as my daily bronzer and I am pleased with it when I am doing a natural face. You can wear it alone, with a tinted moisturizer or over your foundation. I have done all three and it comes out very nice.</li>
    <li> It would be great for a flat look, but for me it just didn&#x27;t personally work and I won&#x27;t purchase again. I really wanted a shimmery sun kissed look and this one was just flat. It worked great on my daughter though who has a lighter skin tone than me so it probably just depends on your skin tone.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is about 1-2 shades deeper than my actual skin tone. It added a very subtle, natural glow that&#x27;s appropriate for work and still very pretty. No sparkles. It may not be a good bronzer for you if you&#x27;re going for a sun kissed or more dramatic look, unless you&#x27;re very fair skinned.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and the medium bronze doesn&#x27;t really show. It still gives me a little glow if I want subtle color, and it stays on longer than I thought. :)</li>
    <li> The brush is dull, like a cleaning brush. And the color is lighter than I expected.</li>
    <li> I got the color cuz it looks like it will look good on me, and a bit darker than my skin tone. I got it, and it looked like how it showed on the picture, but when I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t really show besides the sparkly part. It is kinda useless for me now.</li>
    <li> I love it! I only wish it were shipped better because the powder arrived in pieces.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer! Good color and no sparkle.</li>
    <li> I think for the price this is great. I have very fair skin so I use this on areas of my face that the sun would naturally hit and it looks great. Its not glittery and goes on nicely. The brush that comes with it is garbage so I use my own. I ordered the medium shade.</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick. However, i have a hard time getting it to show up on my skin and I have light brown skin and i ordered the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade. I had to apply a lot of product and it didn&#x27;t look natural it was very pink/orange. The brush was ok but I think the powder would look better on someone with a fair complexion.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing of this bronze and I absolutely love it. I have fair skin, but it gives me very good tan color. though I would recommend to use different brush, this one is too small. the bronze seems small but I have used the previous one for 8 month every day, so it&#x27;s economy too. Definitely good purchase, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I loved this Blush, the color match with every possible style &amp; clothes..Just loved it!</li>
    <li> awesome product. flawless coverage. brightens your face. glowing beutiful skin. completes any look. for all seasons. i recomened this product.</li>
    <li> Thus arrived broken, but I felt it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of getting a replacement.  I was quite sad because it was a get color.</li>
    <li> My sister in law loves this stuff so I gave it a try and totally agree with her</li>
    <li> Great bronzer! Running low now and ran out to the drug store just in case to have a back up.</li>
    <li> I have this on a subscribe and save.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer. Yes the brush is stiff so you might want to use a different brush. I got the medium that goes well with my natural beige foundation.</li>
    <li> I love my bronzer, just as I expected, recommend this to anyone who wants to achieve a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Why they put glitter on this?? Seriously, how can somebody fake a tan with glitter all over the face?&lt;br /&gt;The color is great, but the sparkles ruin everything.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised....100% satisfied</li>
    <li> For some reason .. If I use a bronzer I feel like I&#x27;m going above and beyond.. like I&#x27;m doing EVERYTHING I can hehe&lt;br /&gt;so .. that&#x27;s not such a bad thing :)</li>
    <li> It came in cracked so I was a little disappointed. I didn&#x27;t return bc I did paid like $4 for this. So its okay. Still has enough for me to use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell when I put it on, I don&#x27;t recommend it. My fave isn&#x27;t that tan and I still can&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
    <li> Great product, you have to apply more than once though. Easy to build it up and looks really good.</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer. Stays on all day. You want this in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> The little brush is a joke, but I like the bronzer!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this for eyeshadow and I am very fair skinned and this color is not too dark, it&#x27;s just right. Works well and doesn&#x27;t sit in the creases of your eyes like some do. This is a good product, I would buy it again as soon as I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product only because all maybelline products were buy one get one at rite aid.  I bought the light bromze and it did not show on my face so I exchanged it for the medium bronze and it was perfect.  Not too dark and just a touch of color.  I am light skinned by the way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African aamerican woman with a caramel complexion and this makes perfect highlighter in Medium Bronze. It doesn&#x27;t have any glitter or that obnoxious shimmer that never looks good on darker complexions. The little brush that is included actually comes in very useful - and this comes from someone who uses professional makeup brushes. Overall, I can see this looking great on all complexions because it&#x27;s not too orange or too brown, yet it does add a sun touched glow to the skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product - I was worried that it would be too dramatically dark, but it shades exactly and perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great for touchups, when on the go.  An item I keep in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Sort of refresher during the day.</li>
    <li> I am very pale and so thought I would have no problem with the product showing up. I don&#x27;t know how it could not show up on anyone, it is so pigmented. I purchased the medium bronze and the color was horrible. It was very unnatural and didn&#x27;t resemble a bronze at all; it looked me like the residue of a fake tan, very orangey and dark. The picture is much lighter and more subtle looking than the actual product. The brush was also pretty bad, using it left all the product piled on one small spot on my skin. Overall, this bronzer was a waste of money and I would not reccomend it to anyone; indeed quite the opposite.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have never used a bronzer until recently and was extremely excited to try.  I must say that it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> This was good, I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was, but great for a travel makeup bag or for you &amp;#34;emg make up powder moment&amp;#34; would fit nicely in a small purse</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t wrapped at all and the powder all broke</li>
    <li> Love the brush that came with, perfect for contouring!</li>
    <li> I luv my bronzer cause I only wear bronzer on my face. I don&#x27;t use foundation anymore. O rsther the radiant look on my skin. Plus it feel&#x27;s good not to feel like I&#x27;ve got caked up base on . Look&#x27;s really good whith my tan leg!s and arm&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Thx maybeline bronzer</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the worst bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used. The brush is too small and hard as a rock. The bronzer isn&#x27;t smooth, and it barelt comes off on the brush. I apply it over and over and I don&#x27;t get any glow. It&#x27;s horrible. I&#x27;m a huge fan of bronzer, and I recommend the E.L.F. brand!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but it doesn&#x27;t give the bronze color i was looking for, I felt that it&#x27;s very light on my skin.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered damaged. See attached photo.</li>
    <li> Perfect color. I will definitely order it again. And I like the little brush that came with it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good color bronzer for lighter toned skin, no shimmer or anything it&#x27;s matte and does the job well.</li>
    <li> I have bought this bronzer from other stores, and was able to see it on my skin. For some strange reason, I rub and rub and I see nothing different on my face. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> im just really a fan of maybelline..</li>
    <li> Although this product was inexpensive it still was not worth the price.  I read the reviews and even found some recommendations from make-up artists.  I cannot believe they would use this product.  I am fair complexion so I ordered the medium shade.  Even with a larger brush the product is not visible on my face.  It&#x27;s as if no color is there.  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> item as described, love this color, thank you</li>
    <li> Color was great for my medium-tan skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave shimmer all over the place like some do.</li>
    <li> Just the right color and size. Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Came on time, but arrived open and the brush was missing. still haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> I love the color, all day wear, but always finishes quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walgreens and it is loosely packed in the container. The brush shape helps me contour a line in my cheek bone and then flip it sideways to blend. After reading these reviews I wouldn&#x27;t trust this seller but go to your favorite drug store and give this product a try. I also have a blush from them and both show up amazingly well on my skin.</li>
    <li> the brush sux but i love the color</li>
