      <li>Love the soap.</li>
      <li>Love it;  </li>
      <li>With that being said I also feel that a man should not smell like women&#x27;s perfume like most &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
      <li>you are here for a shampoo alternative (sulfate and paraban free!)</li>
      <li>I always feel very clean and refreshed after showering with this.  </li>
      <li>This is some pretty good soap.</li>

      <li>I find the benefits well out weight the strong pine smell.</li>

      <li>Quick shipping and do think the product helps!</li>
      <li>this soap smells very strongly of pine tar - exactly like a campfire.</li>
      <li>Whatever the culprit os, this soap has made a HUGE difference.</li>
      <li>Some on here are turned off by the smell, but I actually enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap is a great product, especially if you have skin conditions like psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>(ie: after washing off) and the soap itself mellows greatly after water is applied (and its left in the tub).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wash morning and night follow up with an oil free moisturizer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lovely.  My fianc&amp;eacute; calls it old man soap.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap!!</li>
    <li> I have Psoriasis. I have been using this product for nearly 40 years. I used to have to drive long distance to little mom and pop natural vitamin stores, which were the only places that carried it, only to find they were out but they would special order it for me! Now I get it delivered to my door! Life is great.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only soap I use. It doesn&#x27;t turn your bathroom black. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Cleans as good as any soap and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue as long as you rinse well. I usually take what is known as a Navy shower, so the lather stays on my skin longer and if you have been brainwashed by commercials and you wash by rubbing the bar of soap on yourself, stop it now, buy a washrag and start getting really clean!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing.  It has a great smell and very clean afterwards.  We have very hard water in AZ, which makes it difficult for most soaps to lather; however, this soap provides tons of lather.</li>
    <li> Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap is a great product, especially if you have skin conditions like psoriasis.  However, this vendor, \\&quot;PharmaFrag\\&quot; in Monroe, NY is fraudulent!  They tell you that you are paying for a much larger quantity than you actually receive.  I signed up for a \\&quot;6-pack\\&quot; and only got one!  Buy your Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap from someone else - THESE PEOPLE ARE FRAUDS!  Look at the other reviews below.</li>
    <li> The soap itself has a very strong smell, especially if you leave it out on a shower rack. Washing with it leaves almost no irritation for sensitive skin and the strong odor does not linger on your body.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this soap is absolutely addicting.  I have been excited enough to share it with friends and family.  1 person out of 10 did not like the fragrance, so I guess it is not for everybody.  My skin loves this and does not feel dry after use.  Since it is strongly anti-fungal I know it helps my skin stay healthy... I really love their Pine Tar Shampoo &amp; Conditioner also.</li>
    <li> MAN! BEARD! FLANNEL! BEARD! SOAP! CLEAN MAN! CLEAN BEARD! MAKE BEARD SOFT FOR LADIES! YOU BUY! BE MAN! GET LADIES!</li>
    <li> The Pine Tar Soap was recommended to me by my father.  Great product for dry skin.  Will definitely use again.  Recommended to other family members.</li>
    <li> I have been using Grandpar&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap for a couple of years. I use when I&#x27;m taking a bath including washing my hair. It really leaves my skin soft and smooth. Great soap.</li>
    <li> If you want really soft elbows use this product.</li>
    <li> This is such a fantastic product. I have used this soap for well over 30 yrs and will forever use it. And the price from this dealer is the best too. Shipping,very fast.</li>
    <li> I love it works great and smells manly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I bought it on the recommendation of a hair stylist who recommended it for people with super fine hair. My hair won&#x27;t do anything--no volume, won&#x27;t curl, even falls out of rubberbands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started washing my hair with this (do not use conditioner) and now it&#x27;s like having a whole new head of hair. Now it holds curls for days, stays up in hairstyles with only a few bobby pins, and it&#x27;s really soft. A final benefit is that I used to have to wash my hair every single day or it would look nasty and greasy, but now I can go up to three days without washing it, and it looks just as good the third day as it did the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are here for a shampoo alternative (sulfate and paraban free!) then here&#x27;s some advice: Do not try to brush or comb out your hair at all until it&#x27;s fully dry. This soap leaves a little bit of &#x27;tack&#x27; on hair and you&#x27;ll have breakage if you try to brush while wet. Once it&#x27;s dry, it combs very easily and looks shiny and matte. The level of tack it leaves is like having texturing cream in your hair, so not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gah, love this stuff so much. I&#x27;ll never use another shampoo or conditioner again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note: I also do a white vinegar rinse once every 2 weeks now, and start fresh, just to prevent build up.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff and smells like a campfire (which I love). He only uses this soap.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a different smell, not exactly unpleasant; but campfire-like.  It lasts well on the soap pad; lathering well, not getting mushy, not melting away.  I think we spent about $22 for 6 bars; not cheap, but would purchase again as they wash &amp; last well.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve also purchased this as a gift for my dad; he remembers the scent from childhood &amp; enjoys it.</li>
    <li> Really nice soap. In the winter time my skin gets really dry and itchy. The pine tar soap really helps take care of that problem.</li>
    <li> Great product,  I have dry, itchy spots and when using this product the problem went away.</li>
    <li> There are two types of people in this world.  Manly men who use this soap, and women.  If you are a manly man, then this soap is for you.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them but I do not like the smell.  I don&#x27;t use it and I can&#x27;t even go in the bathroom after him its very strong.</li>
    <li> Bought this soap for my boyfriend and now I use it religiously.  It doesn&#x27;t get anymore natural and good for your skin than this.smells so good!</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps oily skin in check&lt;br /&gt;-Clears acne if that&#x27;s an issue for you&lt;br /&gt;-Anti fungal properties (you will be very clean!)&lt;br /&gt;-I love the smell which is like an old woodshop smell... very manly (but you may not like it)&lt;br /&gt;-Good soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Skin drying - consider using a moisturizer after getting out of the shower for sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne but still use this soap because I like the anti fungal properties and really like to be clean and fresh. Might be OCD but hey- I&#x27;m clean!</li>
    <li> The scent was strange at first but now I love it.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my beard but it is great from head to toe.  Don&#x27;t let the smell fool you! lol it smells just like you think pine tar would...a campfire :) but you you smell fine after...</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years and the soap is very easy on your skin.  I would say the only drawback is it will cause staining on the shower floor it is white in color because this is dark brown in color.  You will find yourself scrubbing up the floor trying to get this stuff off of it, so I have stopped using it.  However, it is very good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s natural and good for skin in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;So i will recommend it to my friends that have the same skin.</li>
    <li> If you love to smell of pine trees this is for you. Some people dont like the smell, but I love it</li>
    <li> I have been using Grandpa&#x27;s Tar Soap since the 50&#x27;s!!!!!  Bought my first bar  at Charley Owens Drug Store in Shepherdstown, WV.  Years later when Charley died I would order it from the factory.  Now, I buy it from Amazon.com---the easiest way to buy America&#x27;s finest soap!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. He loves their smokey smell and uses it all the time. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I still have five bars but I&#x27;ll get through them.  I&#x27;m not sure if it helped my skin at all.  I&#x27;d hoped for natural, earthy smell; maybe not &amp;#34;pine-like&amp;#34; but something other than this. This does smell earthy...like an oil rig.</li>
    <li> Not going to lie, was very worried when I opened the package and the smell of campfire assaulted my nostrils (it really is that strong).  Hoowever, the scent does not linger at all on the body (ie: after washing off) and the soap itself mellows greatly after water is applied (and its left in the tub).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already seeing positive results on dry spots on my hands and has replaced my shampoo.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I will ever use again! I only wish they made a shave soap!</li>
    <li> This is some pretty good soap. I love the smell, and it lathers very nicely. Some on here are turned off by the smell, but I actually enjoy it. Ordering more to have a good supply on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for cleaning up after a long sweaty day.</li>
    <li> I have been using only this soap now for 6 months. The scent is strong while using, but rinses completely away. I feel that the scent is not bad for a man. With that being said I also feel that a man should not smell like women&#x27;s perfume like most &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
    <li> They are not kidding when they say it&#x27;s a strong smell!  I wanted to use it, but couldn&#x27;t get past it.  My boyfriend uses it for his shampoo and body soap and it smells really great with his body chemistry.  Don&#x27;t store in a small space, it may overwhelm you :)</li>
    <li> If you have skin irritation or terrible itch, this soap will definitely help</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was warned that the smell was weird, but figured I&#x27;d try it anyway. How bad could it really be?  It&#x27;s a soap... right?!  Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very effective, but my family couldn&#x27;t get past smelling like a smoky campfire.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> Great all natural pine tar is the best for the Bearded man! Great on skin and dosnt strip natural oils away.</li>
    <li> Men don&#x27;t use an froo-froo body wash that&#x27;s scented with lavender or berry.  We don&#x27;t use some weirdly named wash (like the AXE brands) AND we don&#x27;t want to smell like Dove.  Here&#x27;s the alternative. Make your shower smell like a pine forest.  It&#x27;s soap so it works like any other.</li>
    <li> This soap cleanses my skin with out drying it out, and has a nice smell to it. It also appears to help me with my acne (mild). I use it once a day in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I also washed my hair with it a couple of times, and it worked well for this purpose.</li>
    <li> This healthy soap won&#x27;t strip all the oils out of your skin and leave you dry as the Mojave. It smells like pine tar, but I knew that going in. I originally bought it to get rid of the flaky skin under my beard. I stuck with it because it left the rest of my skin feeling healthy, too. I use it from head to toe, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, especially to guys with beards.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Nothing else handled my acne like this soap</li>
    <li> this soap smells very strongly of pine tar - exactly like a campfire. in an enclosed space (read: shower or bathroom) on a warm day it can be overwhelming if you&#x27;re not into that kind of thing, however the scent from using the soap isn&#x27;t so bad. I started using this to combat beard dandruff, and the results were mediocre. A noticeable decrease after a month of use, but not a cure.</li>
    <li> We are currently living in Italy. Since we got here mne and my wifes faces have broken out. After speaking to many others stationed here we determined that it may be the shower water causing this. Whatever the culprit os, this soap has made a HUGE difference. Both of our faces have cleared up quiet a bit! I love the clean feeling after using the soap, similar to the feeling of using a bar of Ivory soap on my face. When i first used the soap, my wife turned her nose up at me and said there was no way she would be using it because of that smell. I convinced her to at east try it out and she has not looked back since. The smell is a bit strong, at first I equated the smell to that of fresh blacktop being laid on a street, but not quite exactly like that. After a while, I became accustomed to the smell, and now find it rather pleasant. Whether you hate the smell or love it, it does not last long at all. Overall, excellent soap, we plan on keeping this soap stocked in our cabinet. As a bonus, it lasts quite a long time, we both use it daily.</li>
    <li> Just found this soap and tried it.  Works great on the skin for skin problems and dryness and just a good general soap, but the pine tar smell is very strong.  I have to double plastic bag it to control the pine smell, and use a travel soap container in the shower,  The smell does not stay with you and the soap lathers white.  I find the benefits well out weight the strong pine smell.</li>
    <li> To me this soap smells to very close to freshly laid asphalt.  When the bar is newish, It also makes your bathroom smell like that. If that smell would bother you then you wouldn&#x27;t want this soap.  My wife and I like the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is a very nice quality soap that does a great job of removing body oils.  There is nothing I hate more than getting out of a shower and my armpits still smell rank.  Unlike commercial soaps, this has not been a problem with this soap.  I always feel very clean and refreshed after showering with this.  Also, it does not leave a smell on you.  So no, you will not smell like freshly laid asphalt after showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this soap is it does not become a mushy mess at the end of its life.  My soap dish, is a soap rack so it doesn&#x27;t hold water.  However, even with that other soaps become a mushy mess at the end.  This one just shrinks down and fades away.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and do think the product helps!</li>
    <li> In my 64 years I have tried a variety of soaps, none compare to Pine Tar and your price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
    <li> As advertised. Thank you.</li>
    <li> As a bearded caucasoid cis-gendered heteronormative 1st generation American male, I take very good care of my groomsicle. This is by far the best soap/shampoo bar I have ever used. The smell is of piney woods afire; the feel is of cleanliness and hygiene. The power conferred upon one&#x27;s hair and beard cannot be equaled. Hot water is a must for best results. Above all, remember: when meeting, the greater beard has the right of way.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Been using for awhile now. It&#x27;s definitely a mans soap.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that controls my perleche and seborrhea. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without it.</li>
    <li> This works very well on dandruff and seborrhea. I prefer it when I am in a humid environment; when I have used it while on road trips through the Southwest it felt over-drying on both hair and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells woodsy, and you will smell like a pine tree when you have used it--if you are used to smelling like a gardenia this might be a little strong for you. I think it smells nice.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great stuff.  My wife has said that there is less blemishes on my skin since I have been using it.  Love the smell as well, really nice man scent-  not over powering or fruity.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap that I have ever used. It does a wonderful job at cleaning without leaving any residue and my girl enjoys the smell.</li>
    <li> Fast to soap up but lather does not last.</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get over the scent!</li>
    <li> Excellent soap to use for psoriasis!! Highly recommend! Quick delivery and service.</li>
    <li> This is the pine tar soap that I generally use on a daily basis. I like it very much. I feel it cleans better than your average deodorant soaps. It also leaves a masculine scent on your skin. Overall, I feel this is a very good soap.</li>
    <li> We use this during spring, summer, and fall when we plan to be outdoors. Old timers here swear it helps keep away ticks. It does smell like a campfire when lathered, but the odor does not linger (at least to humans) and we don&#x27;t mind it. We also use it when camping. A bar lasts a long time,and skin feels good using it.</li>
    <li> Love the soap! Love the  Scent!! and it helps with my psoriasis....but I would use it anyway..it&#x27;s very cool! I keep it in my travel bag to be sure I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My girlfriend bought some for me last Christmas and I&#x27;d been looking to resupply.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I use it in place of bar soap and every once in a while in place of shampoo. Really like the scent. My girlfriend started using it as well. I think it works best lathered up on some sort of scrubbing device. You will probably notice a unique waxy feel when rinsing it off but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Works for it&#x27;s need, but is too stinky for my wife.  She says it makes the whole bathroom smell like weird bacon.  I had to stop using it for her.  I know tar soaps don&#x27;t smell great, but this one is very pungent to us.</li>
    <li> After developing PUPPS and doing tons of research, I kept coming across praise for Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap. It has seriously worked miracles. After using it for the first time, the itch was gone, and within a week, the rash was completely gone. I highly recommend this product for any pregnant woman experiencing PUPPS!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few days and the smell is horrible. My brother have been using it for a few months now and it helped him sclera his skin - he was breaking out a lot. Now he is using for his body &amp; hair and says it works amazingly.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great.</li>
    <li> The Soap is Awesome. But it Smells like a South Carolina Truck Stop.....Next to a Trash Incinerator.....Somewhere in a pine forest.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  My grandmother used it when I was a young child.  I rediscovered it again over a year ago.</li>
    <li> Definitely a soap for a man who appreciates manly soaps!  Reduced acne, smells of charcoal but still smells natural and a bit woodsy.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff; smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful on the skin.  Works better than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products through out life that help and cater to my irritating skin conditions. From anti-dandruff hair products to antiperspirant deo, and now this, and its by far the best soap ever. It smells like fresh cut alpines and makes my skin well hydrated. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Good deal.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and asked my dermatologist if he recommended using pine tar soap.  His response was that it was an old wife&#x27;s tale.  I haven&#x27;t been back to him in 5 years.  Why?  Old wives are sometimes right!  Every time my skin starts to dry out, I switch to Grandpa&#x27;s and in three days I&#x27;m back to normal.  Love this soap!</li>
    <li> Smells great, prevents dry skin to a degree.</li>
    <li> This soap is stinky but you get used to the smell. After a while, it&#x27;s not too bad! But the important thing is that it keeps my back acne under control! Ever since I started using this soap, my skin has been much smoother! Less breakouts! Try it! It&#x27;s a must in my shower :)</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. Go get it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for many years now.  I really believe in it.  It is good for the skin and although you may not smell like a flower you know that you are clean.  It also does not dry your skin out.  I do believe that it soothes and the oils are good for you.  I do not use anything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like creosote. You&#x27;ll need a container with a tight lid to store the bars. Freezer bags, one inside another, are almost good enough. But it does work, just like people say it does.</li>
    <li> Use this soap everyday; have very dry skin and seems to help.</li>
    <li> Soap is great and so was the service.</li>
    <li> Brings back memories of my youth, as my Dad always used this soap. Smell - what smell?  This is Pine Tar soap - not  some perfumed body wash. If you wish to be really clean, try this soap.</li>
    <li> A good price for a great product :)</li>
    <li> Smells like a bonfire and does the job.</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap!</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Perfect for a lazy old man.</li>
    <li> Love it;  this is the best product for any minor cuts, itches, etc.  It is the only thing that helped me with PUPPPS when I was pregnant. V not only did it help, it cured me!!!!! You will not be disappointed with this product. Fast shipping from this seller.</li>
    <li> This soap is AMAZING. It cleared up all the pimples and zits on my chest after two uses, and it also helped with my dry skin under my beard. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells great if you like the smell of Pine&lt;br /&gt;2. Clears skin while not drying it out&lt;br /&gt;3. Helps with dry skin&lt;br /&gt;4. Leaves skin feeling great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts-&lt;br /&gt;1. Pine smell is very strong! Keep this in mind if you don&#x27;t want the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I use this instead of shampoo and for bathing. Its amazing stuff helps keep acne at bay, kills fungus and controls the seborrhea dermatitis I have on my scalp. The detergents in regular shampoos aggravated the seborrhea so much it was spreading across my scalp. Ive been using this soap for 3 years and now only have 1 small patch left. For acne if you lather up real good as if you were going to wash your face, spread this all over the acne then let dry for about 20 minutes...lather up again and wash off with a wash rag your skin will clear in bout 3 weeks. Wash morning and night follow up with an oil free moisturizer.  Amazing stuff!!</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever! I used this Pine Tar Soap on my Grandchildren, (which they have sensitive skin) it made their silky clean and no blotches of red irritation. Yes, I would order this product again. The Pine Bar Soap has an outdoorsy scent as well.</li>
    <li> definitely a campfire smell- not bad, just different; though your body doesn&#x27;t retain much of the scent (which is good); good suds, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a month now, but I can already tell you I will not be without it again.  I can wash my hair with this as well and love that it doesn&#x27;t make my naturally curly hair frizzy.  I follow my hair wash with an Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse and it works wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, however all 6 bars were taped together, all the boxes were damaged, and they had stickers on top of the tape that could not be removed.  I was going to use these for Christmas gifts, but due to how bad the boxes look I most likely will send them back.  The photo shows a nice box without the tape and added stickers.  I will buy these from another seller next time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for psoriasis!</li>
