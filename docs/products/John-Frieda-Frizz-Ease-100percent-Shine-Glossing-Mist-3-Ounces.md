<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is very inexpensive, so I can&#x27;t really fairly compare it to my $28 usual serum. Still, I had high hopes for it based on reviews. It does certainly tamp down the frizz, but it also leads to a bit of a stringly look if you&#x27;re not careful how much you put on. I think it&#x27;s a decent product, and I will use what I have. But, you have to be careful not to put too much on. I didn&#x27;t have the problem with the much more expensive product that I&#x27;m used to using. Just wanted to save some money. I think it&#x27;s a decent product and buyers will be reasonably pleased if they don&#x27;t compare it to high end more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time, works</li>
    <li> A little of this gives good shine to hair and light control without the crusty hard feel of regular hair sprays. So a really good alternative. Repeat buyer of this product for the last 3 years.</li>
    <li> I like this shine spray better than the shine spray made by Tresemme, It is much less greasy and overall smells better. My recommendation is to be careful how much you use. 1-2 squirts goes a long way and can leave your hair looking greasy if you put in too much. Spray from an arms length away because the nozzle has a pretty good spread! Love this product especially for the price</li>
    <li> This product is really pretty impressive. When used as directed (which is hard to read, due to small print) it is wonderful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair shine and how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I love the gloss this adds to my hair. Have gotten so many compliments on my shiny hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great Hair product.. It works very well when I blow out my hair</li>
    <li> Light hold, provides some shine and is not sticky. I love it.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on how shiny my hair is!</li>
    <li> Great product, not available locally so this was the only way I could try this. Look forward to trying other Frizz Ease product with the help of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews, I love this product but can no longer find it in the Seattle area. So happy that I thought of Amazon:) Really makes your hair shiny. I have used it for years. Grey hair, colored hair ..... still shines:)</li>
    <li> Tried other brands, but I always get back to John Frieda. I have long straight hair that desperately needs to be cut (which I don&#x27;t do), and use this and the JF anti frizz serum in the morning. Makes my hair shiny without looking greasy</li>
    <li> love this product! leaves your hair super shiney and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Easily the best shine spray I&#x27;ve encountered yet (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other drugstore brands). It doesn&#x27;t leave my fine hair piece-y, doesn&#x27;t weight it down, and doesn&#x27;t make it feel slick and oily. It delivers a very shimmery shine, the kind you don&#x27;t see outside of advertisements except for on a few lucky Asian heads. While the smell bothers me a little, I still give this 5 stars because the price is unbeatable for something so effective and useful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple shine products. The ones I&#x27;ve previously purchased have either not worked, left my hair greasy looking, smelled awful or all of the above.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that does none of the above and imparts an awesome glossy shine.  It also adds hold without stickiness or stiffening my hair.  I have highlighted blonde hair, and I have noticed that it seems to be harder to get blonde hair to shine, that brunettes seem to have shinier hair.  I&#x27;m so glad to have finally found something that works great on my hair that I immediately purchased two more.  The price had already gone up $1, and it will probably get even higher, or I may not be able to find it.  I&#x27;m going to see how long this supply lasts and order a six month supply.  John Frieda products usually work well on my hair, and they have a clean, fresh scent without being too sweet smelling.  I frequently air dry my naturally wavy/curly hair, especially in the summer when it tends to be more humid, and this product defines my curl as well.</li>
    <li> After drying your hair and BEFORE heat ironing gives remarkable shine and protection from the heat element</li>
    <li> i expect glossing mist but this feels watered down. Made my hair dry but i am still using it. As long as my hair doesnt fall out i will still be using it... after all i did pay for it.</li>
    <li> I love the John Frieda Frizz Ease 100% Shine Glossing Spray!</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with this spray! When used correctly, this light-weight formula won&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy. I have very frizzy hair (usually), and with this, it turns my hair into manageable curls. The company on Amazon was quick to send it and it was received in great condition!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Gives good control, effective at de-frizzing, and great gloss finish.  I also like that it&#x27;s a spritz-on product instead of having to put it on by hand.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that truly makes my hair SHINE !</li>
    <li> Perfect shine spray with a great smell.</li>
    <li> It does make my hair shinier - just be careful you don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look like you haven&#x27;t washed it in weeks. I spray my hand once per side of my head and then I just run my hand through my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 yrs and love it. A light spray ( hold bottle about a foot away from your hair) will make your hair super shiny. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it look oily. However, it will if you spray a lot on too close to your hair. I use it after styling my hair and I am good to go. I bought it via Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it at WalMart and it ended up being a better price here on Amazon- delivered to my door! I work full time so the home delivery is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I am irritated that they discontinued it. But purchasing from Amazon was great and received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> It gives your hair a youghtful shine. It also makes your hair easier to manage and it does not effect hair color.</li>
    <li> Great for a great shine...love it</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Been using it for a number of years.  Just can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy. It makes your hair look so shiny. I get compliments all the time on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I was so hoping this product would work as well as most of the John Frieda products do.  However, sadly it is not up to par.  In order for the ends of my hair to stay glossy I would need to reapply ever 30 minutes or even sooner.  Also, I did notice that my hair became brittle after using this product.  I&#x27;m sad to say I will be returning this.  On a positive note the item arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used shine serums and sprays before, but nothing was ever as good as this product. Everything I&#x27;ve ever used made my hair go from dry-looking to looking like an oily mess, no matter how little I&#x27;d use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super surprised by this product. It never made my hair look oily; only shiny and healthy. I&#x27;m super happy about this purchase, and I think you&#x27;d be happy about it, as well.</li>
    <li> This is my best hair secret.....just a few sprays of this mist and your hair will be transformed into a shiny, glossy, stunningly beautiful crowning glory!  Every single time I use this mist, I get compliments. People compliment my color, my style....everything....but they don&#x27;t realize that this mist is what really makes my hair shine. Literally!  I love this stuff. I promise if you use it, you will be noticed. A great product.  Just don&#x27;t go overboard and use too much.  It only takes a few sprays to do the trick!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for a long time and hope to continue doing so as long as it  is available and have recommended it to others</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful, it makes your hair feel course, dry and heavy. It doesn&#x27;t stop frizz either.</li>
    <li> This is only &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;....not sure what it actually does but it doesn&#x27;t do much for shine.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The best hair glosser i have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, such shine! I highly recommend, it does what it claims. Thank you Amazon and KAO  for a great price.</li>
    <li> Does not really work very well, at first it seems like it is smoothing and calming down your hair.  But, after a few hours the frizz comes back.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this product for 15 years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and it does what it claims to do well.</li>
    <li> Gets my hair frizz free in humid Florida ,works better than more expensive products I&#x27;ve tryed.Cant understand why they would discontinue selling it in stores,they need to bring it back</li>
    <li> Thus adds shine without weighing hair down. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I really like John Frieda products. I suggest using this with frizz ease sheer solution.</li>
    <li> I really like it, it gives a gloss and a shine that my hair didn&amp;#34;t have before. it does a good job of controlling the &amp;#34;frizziesz&#x27; of my very fine ,thin hair....</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a great shine!</li>
    <li> I love John Freida everything.  This product is awesome, it makes your hair smooth without making it feel or look oily.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it is much smaller than I expected. I wonder why it&#x27;s not in stores anymore. It&#x27;s the best non-greasy anti-frizz spray. I wish it came in a bigger bottle! I would honestly buy buckets of this stuff.</li>
    <li> wow.  makes my hair shine like a models hair.  easy to use after styling hair.  love the way lights reflect.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and cost effective. One spray in my hand and run my finger through it does my whole head.</li>
    <li> This adds immediate shine that last thru the day.  Does not weigh hair down.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my hair shine without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very shiny! Great product!! The only issue is if you put a little too much my hair gets really oily.</li>
    <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair. Provides great shine - I really have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> Great for my frizzy naturally wavy/curly white girl hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked EVERYWHERE in stores for this Glossing Mist.  I &#x27;found&#x27; it at &#x27;my&#x27; Walgreens, over a year ago, and purchased it there, until over 1 year or so, and they no longer carried this John Frieda product! I tried local stores, WalMart, CVS, even whet on line to John Frieda...couldn&#x27;t even purchase it on line!  I was delighted when I saw it on Amazon, ordered 6 !  I HATE the usual hair sprays, and this Glossing Mist is so fantastic. I have naturally curly hair, red, and this Glossing Mist leaves my hair in place, without the sticky, hard feeling of usual hair sprays, and the Shine is AWESOME!  I receive compliments every time I use it, and of course, recommend it every time I can!  Why it isn&#x27;t available in my stores, I haven&#x27;t a clue, but so glad it&#x27;s still available thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your hair soft and shiny and not greasy. I have salt and pepper colored hair by the way as I&#x27;m &amp;#34;old dog&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It does add shine but the scent is overpowering and lingers at full power for 2 days or more. I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not shiny as expected when sprayed into hair. I noticed you have to put a lot to make it shine but shine doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Great for hair extensions. Adds shine, but doesn&#x27;t get greasy, or clump together your hair. This is some of the best stuff I have tried and I do try a lot of hair products.</li>
    <li> I expected a better product specially because I chose product based on previous reviews. My hair is naturally wavy when I straighten my hair I have a lot of baby hair sticking out and the product does not help to get them down</li>
    <li> It is a little oily but it does the job. Very shiny too. I recommend it. It works for both types of hair.</li>
    <li> People rave about this stuff to me, but I just have not been able to enjoy it. Instead of leaving my hair shiny and luxurious looking, this stuff makes my hair a sticky mess. It really mats down my hair to my scalp and makes me look like I have semi wet, slicked back hair which is usually not the look I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for about a month before just giving up on it.  Now an almost full bottle sits at the back of my cupboard haunting me.</li>
    <li> Smells good but it leaves hair oily and wet looking</li>
    <li> Works fine, not sticky at all, and smooth out hair, but I actually don&#x27;t like any artificial scent.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable shine!  Nothing else like it!  I&#x27;ll be going back for more!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Makes your hair shine, but use very sparingly.</li>
    <li> Love the non greasy shine this gives my hair. My only issue is how quick it seems to go. A little bit does not go a long way so if you have a thick full head of hair a bottle this size won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> My hair gets super frizzy during the humid summer months. I use this just before I walk out the door and into the mugginess.  It works well enough for me to buy again but it isn&#x27;t some miracle cure for battling all my frizz but it does calm it down. A word of caution: less is more with this product. If you use too much it will make your hair look greasy/oily.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off for many, many years. Not sure if they changed the product or my hair texture changed but it&#x27;s just okay now. I find the shine oil you rub between your hands works so much better. When I use the oil I get compliments on how shiny and frizz free my hair it. I have curly hair and straighten it everyday.</li>
    <li> This made my blonde hair look oily right after I showered ! I wasn&#x27;t happy that I had just washed and blow dried my extra long hair which takes forever to put this on and look like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in months !</li>
    <li> Makes your hair incredibly shiny!!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what  I expected, gives my hair shine and takes care of my frizz. Added bonus, it has a wonderful scent. I would recommend this to anyone with curly fine frizzy hair.</li>
