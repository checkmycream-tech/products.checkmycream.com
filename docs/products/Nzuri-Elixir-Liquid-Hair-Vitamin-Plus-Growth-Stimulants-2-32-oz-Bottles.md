      <li>I love it and as a side bonus my skin is more radiant than ever!  </li>

      <li>The taste is interesting</li>
      <li>I noticed after a month of use my hair had a healthy sheen.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>I would compare the taste to grape juice, not Welch&#x27;s grape juice but more of a Juicy Juice type taste.</li>
      <li>My nails are the healthy and growing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s giving my metabolism a boost and my hair really looks great</li>

      <li>so i have 10 more bottles to go</li>
      <li>and I will purchase more of this product when I run out.</li>
      <li>cause the taste was ok.  </li>
      <li>My hair did not grow or look healthy.</li>
      <li>The gentleman I talked with was very polite &amp; a great help.  </li>
      <li>I have tasted liquid vitamins that were much more palatable.</li>
      <li>I did notice that my hair was softer and appearing more fuller.</li>
      <li>Sure, your hair will still get split ends, but everywhere else is healthy and did I mention SHINY?</li>
      <li>My hair had stopped working for many months</li>
      <li>After 3 months of use my hair has grown 4 inches, nails are hardening, skin tone has evened out, and best of all my hair itches because the hair is growing rapidly and not because I have a dry and flaky scalp.  </li>
      <li>My hair is thickening up, not as dry and just looking marvelous.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smell: The smell is very sweet sort of like a fruit juice.  </li>
      <li>shipping is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>With in 3 weeks my skin luck a whole lot better already had hair growth and my nails are totally healthy</li>
      <li>thanks for producing such a wonderful product that does what it says.</li>
      <li>So far so good .</li>
      <li>and you get a powerful punch in this elixir!</li>
      <li>, i have been diagnosed with hypo thyroidism and my hair has come out significantly</li>
      <li>I also liked that this product can be used in many different ways.  </li>
      <li>keep coming back to this product for good reason.</li>
      <li>I wanted to comment on the flavor, which I find not bad at all.  </li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a tremendous help in aiding my hair growth, but who knows, maybe I just haven&#x27;t noticed.</li>
      <li>Oddly enough, though purchased for hair, it has been most remarkable in helping with acid reflux, hiatal hernia...and has allowed me to completely eliminate medications for that, I do watch my diet but after several months on this have just enjoyed three days of rich Thanksgiving food with no reflux events.</li>
      <li>This has been great for my hair, it has thicken, lengthen, stop breaking, less dandruff.</li>
      <li>If it bothers you then you can drink or eat something afterwards that takes away the taste but overall pretty good.</li>
      <li>and my nails are actually growing longer now and are looking really nice.  </li>
      <li>and my nails are actually growing longer now and are looking really nice.  </li>
      <li>product is great, I didn&#x27;t notice anything the first two weeks but toward the third week I have noticed that my hair is thicker and I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of new growth (haven&#x27;t measured yet)</li>
      <li>product is great, I didn&#x27;t notice anything the first two weeks but toward the third week I have noticed that my hair is thicker and I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of new growth (haven&#x27;t measured yet)</li>
      <li>Get the right vitamins and this will help your cause.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update 2 weeks later:  I had ordered 2 more btls of Nzuri Elixer but was sent Nzuri Vida instead.  </li>
      <li>and then you sort of get the aftertaste that is more medicinal like you actually are tasting the vitamins</li>
      <li>The reason is no because soon as I started taking the product to help my hair grow .it made my hair fall out I have lost my hair in the top of my head and middle</li>
      <li>Wash hands first with soap and water and emerge nails into liquid for 5 minutes at a time.</li>
      <li>i have hair growing again.i wash,get hot oil tx&#x27;s weekly</li>
      <li>I discontinued use of my multi-vitamin and biotin to give this product its fair chance being it is not cheap.</li>
      <li>the drink does have a particular taste but that is just because it has so many different vitamins.</li>
      <li>I am just drinking it straight as is.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I filled a spray bottle with the mixture (I mixed together 12oz of \\&quot;distilled\\&quot; water (SmartWater brand) 1 tbsp of Aloe Vera Juice, 1 TBSP of EVVO, 1 tsp of Castor Oil &amp; 1 tsp of Argan Oil).  </li>
      <li>I drank 2 capfulls straight w/o mixing.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
      <li>eat.my scalp is so much healthier now.i highly recommend this supplement.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Taste: Everyone is different but for me the taste is not bad at all</li>
      <li>It has assimilated synergistically with my body to aid in overall better health as far as general health while helping with hair somewhat.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>As long as hands are clean, you do not have to discard or refrigerate the portion used for your fingers)&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair has actually grown longer so for what that is worth</li>
      <li>and I am also using a new cuticle oil , so that might be contributing as well .</li>
      <li>and i just started a new bottle.  </li>
      <li>Why I come back to this product over and over is because of the EXTREME amounts of vitamins and how healthy my hair looks.</li>
      <li>thick 4B hair fertilizing my hair is very important to my life style.</li>
      <li>And as of today 5/13/14,  2 days short of a month I can say ive seen positive results thus far.</li>
      <li>I am not see significant growth yet but the breakage is must less.</li>
      <li>If you have thinning hair and you wonder why that is when you really don&#x27;t see your family line having such a problem, then its nutrition.</li>
      <li>So far my nails have grown in well.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I took the recommended doses as mixed in with citrus drinks - orange, grapefruit, etc. - to mask the absolutely horrendous smell and taste.  </li>
      <li>Nail formula (soak your nails directly in the elixir.</li>
      <li>I get busy and just forget about it.  </li>
      <li>So far the Nzuri has not thickened after being in the fridge.  </li>
      <li>I have been taking it for nearly 2 months now</li>
      <li>Not only does the hair on my head, eyelashes, well, all over(even in those places where I would prefer the hair NOT grow so fast) grow faster than my hair EVER has.  </li>
      <li>I cut 4 inches of my hair off 1 week before I received my bottles and so far I&#x27;ve gained an inch.</li>
      <li>with the product if all is well I will purchase the remaining 2 bottles to complete my 90 day review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Grows fast as well as the seems to support the overall health of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice now and I just can&#x27;t say no to more vitamins for my hair. It hasn&#x27;t been a tremendous help in aiding my hair growth, but who knows, maybe I just haven&#x27;t noticed. Why I come back to this product over and over is because of the EXTREME amounts of vitamins and how healthy my hair looks. Sure, your hair will still get split ends, but everywhere else is healthy and did I mention SHINY? I noticed after a month of use my hair had a healthy sheen.&lt;br /&gt;Some people mention their skin glowing after using this product, but I don&#x27;t see results in that area-not that I was looking for that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I keep coming back to this product for good reason. Take care of your hair further with spray leave-in conditioners and heat protectants!&lt;br /&gt;FYI: VERY POTENT VITAMIN TASTE, MIX AND DRINK IT WITH SOMETHING!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: May take a day or two for processing, but they&#x27;ve always shipped via Priority for me.</li>
    <li> My hair grew more than an inch a month drinking these vitamins! Great product and great price! Highly recommend.  Taste isn&#x27;t bad; smells way worse than it tastes.</li>
    <li> Im using this product to re-grow my hair after using something else that made me shed like crazy. So far my nails have grown in well. Hopefully I will see results with my hair soon.&lt;br /&gt;I like nzuri a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about a month in and I&#x27;ve had about an inch and a half of new growth of haif and my nails have grown much faster. In order the retain the hair growth you have to practice good hair care maintenance. I&#x27;m really happy with nzuri and I will purchase more of this product when I run out.</li>
    <li> I received my order in perfect condition in three days .. love this company. not sure if the product works yet but im hopeful... this is a great seller will use them again. the drink does have a particular taste but that is just because it has so many different vitamins. im hopefu it will work , i have been diagnosed with hypo thyroidism and my hair has come out significantly so im hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used 1 bottle and I already see the difference. If you have thinning hair and you wonder why that is when you really don&#x27;t see your family line having such a problem, then its nutrition. The stress of the job or school will show on your hairline. Get the right vitamins and this will help your cause. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This product has worked for me. My hair had stopped working for many months now I have used it for two months and I have had two inches of growth. From 17 inches of length to 19 inches. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> After trying numerous hair supplements, I found Nzuri Elixir through Amazon reviews. I have used it for around 6 months and believe my hair has shown improvement and growth because of it. I actually like the taste. It&#x27;s kind of fruity. I will continue to get the two bottle value.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It helps keep my hair feeling and looking healthy. My hair is also longer&lt;br /&gt;than it&#x27;s ever been! Grows fast as well as the seems to support the overall health of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I started to use this product in late November of last year.  My hair growth seemed to slow, my scalp was always dry, had an uneven complexion,and had soft nails.  After 3 months of use my hair has grown 4 inches, nails are hardening, skin tone has evened out, and best of all my hair itches because the hair is growing rapidly and not because I have a dry and flaky scalp.  Oddly enough, my eyes are a brighter brown now, which run in the family.</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, though purchased for hair, it has been most remarkable in helping with acid reflux, hiatal hernia...and has allowed me to completely eliminate medications for that, I do watch my diet but after several months on this have just enjoyed three days of rich Thanksgiving food with no reflux events. It has assimilated synergistically with my body to aid in overall better health as far as general health while helping with hair somewhat. My hair has actually grown longer so for what that is worth it might be due to this elixir, but I cannot say enough about it for the relief of indigestion!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for hair growth. I give it 2 stars cause the taste was ok.  My hair did not grow or look healthy. Not a good product  for me</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s only been 30 days since purchasing them but by the end of week 2 I did notice that my hair was softer and appearing more fuller. I cut 4 inches of my hair off 1 week before I received my bottles and so far I&#x27;ve gained an inch. I have received a few compliments on my skin but chose not to tell anyone what I&#x27;m taking until  I finish the recommended 90 day amount. The taste is not the greatest but the anticipated end result is my motivation.</li>
    <li> Love,love,love external wellness is optimal to hair performance as I have thick 4B hair fertilizing my hair is very important to my life style. If your current supplements are no longer doing the trick. Step it up, I did and it was good decision. The taste is interesting you may want to mix with a drink.. Hello ..,it&#x27;s vitamins and you get a powerful punch in this elixir! It&#x27;s giving my metabolism a boost and my hair really looks great and I feel great on the inside. Go for the 360 package for hair health!💥</li>
    <li> this product is unbelievable With in 3 weeks my skin luck a whole lot better already had hair growth and my nails are totally healthy</li>
    <li> Not sure if this helped my hair to grow because it was difficult to consume daily...the taste is not good (OK...it&#x27;s gross) and seems as though it could be improved. I have tasted liquid vitamins that were much more palatable.</li>
    <li> This is the second 3-month period I have used this product. My hair has grown about 4 inches. My mother and sister have started taking this because of my results. The only thing wrong with this product is that it tastes disgusting. Eugh!</li>
    <li> I am rating Nzuri with only 2 stars for now because I have only been taking it for one week.  I wanted to comment on the flavor, which I find not bad at all.  To my taste buds, it is a cross between prune juice flavor and/or fig flavor.  I drink it just before eating a breakfast because of comments of nausea after drinking it. Occasionally I do feel a slight nausea, but it lasts for only 1-2 minutes.  I get busy and just forget about it.  So far the Nzuri has not thickened after being in the fridge.  In a couple of months I will update this review with 5 stars....I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 weeks later:  I had ordered 2 more btls of Nzuri Elixer but was sent Nzuri Vida instead.  Because I thought it was a C&#x27;mas gift from my dtr, I opened one bottle, but found out it was my original order, but sent the wrong Nzuri product.  I couldn&#x27;t get the Amazon website to work for a return, so I phoned customer service.  The gentleman I talked with was very polite &amp; a great help.  I can only return the unopened bottle and get refund for one bottle.  For the great customer service I am adding another star, but will still update this review in another 2 months. (with food, I don&#x27;t get any nausea).</li>
    <li> ive been taking nzuri for 1 month now and i just started a new bottle.  my hair feels fuller and seems a tad longer but its only been a month.  something is happening!  i plan on being on this product for year so i have 10 more bottles to go so hopefully i get the growth im looking for. BEWARE  THE SUAVE SMOOHING SYSTEM MAKS YOUR HAIR FALL OUT!!!  IT HAPPENED TO ME. THATS WHY IM USING NZURI TO GROW IT BACK.</li>
    <li> I recently tried some vitamins in pill form and they broke me out (the main cause being the amount of Biotin in the pill) so I ceased using them and started looking for something else that was good for the hair that doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction in me and after reading tons of reviews this product is the only one with solid reviews and no mentions of side effects except nausea and another plus for me personally is the amount of Biotin in it which is very low.  I also liked that this product can be used in many different ways.  So I purchased the product on Tuesday and just received it yesterday which was Wednesday, so shipping is fantastic.  Now onto the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: The smell is very sweet sort of like a fruit juice.  It&#x27;s comparable to the likes of prune or grape juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste: Everyone is different but for me the taste is not bad at all and I don&#x27;t feel the need to mix it with anything.  I am just drinking it straight as is. I would compare the taste to grape juice, not Welch&#x27;s grape juice but more of a Juicy Juice type taste. It taste that way going down and then you sort of get the aftertaste that is more medicinal like you actually are tasting the vitamins but it&#x27;s nothing to be gagging over, at least not for me.  If it bothers you then you can drink or eat something afterwards that takes away the taste but overall pretty good. Also, one other note is that the mix did not thicken up upon refrigerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses: There are four ways you can take this vitamin:&lt;br /&gt;1. Orally (2 capfuls/1oz directly or mixed with water or juice)&lt;br /&gt;2. Hair spray (Leave in spray: Mix 12oz of distilled water, 3oz of Nzuri &amp; 2 TBSP of Olive Oil or you can also add one capful to your weekly deep conditioner or add 1/4 cup to your daily hair moisturizer.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Skin formula (Apply Nzuri in the a.m. and just before bed to entire face with a cotton ball)&lt;br /&gt;4. Nail formula (soak your nails directly in the elixir. Wash hands first with soap and water and emerge nails into liquid for 5 minutes at a time. Do as often as you like. For best results 3 to 4 times a week. As long as hands are clean, you do not have to discard or refrigerate the portion used for your fingers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already tried three of the 4 ways as of yesterday:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I drank 2 capfulls straight w/o mixing.&lt;br /&gt;2. I filled a spray bottle with the mixture (I mixed together 12oz of \\&quot;distilled\\&quot; water (SmartWater brand) 1 tbsp of Aloe Vera Juice, 1 TBSP of EVVO, 1 tsp of Castor Oil &amp; 1 tsp of Argan Oil).  I will also be applying a capful to my weekly deep conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;3. I didn&#x27;t have any cotton balls so I just dabbed some on a paper towel and applied to my face after I cleansed my face before bed and this morning.  It did not leave a sticky residue on my face at all, in fact I find I don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer after applying this to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initally purchased one bottle as I wanted to try for 30 days and observe any complications etc. with the product if all is well I will purchase the remaining 2 bottles to complete my 90 day review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will adjust my stars accordingly after each review cyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stars as of 11/12/12: 5 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/18/12 \\&quot;SKIN\\&quot; UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;This update is just for my skin. My regimen has been washing my face morning and night with a cleansing face wash, apply the Nzuri and after it dries (about 1-2 minutes) follow up with a moisturizer (even though sometimes I can go without using a moisturizer). I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results as others have been saying but maybe it takes longer than 7 days so I will review again after a month. Even though I haven&#x27;t had \\&quot;dramatic\\&quot; results doesn&#x27;t mean I haven&#x27;t had results. I DO notice a difference and my skin is clearing up from the breakout I had a month ago along with the 2 small blemishes it caused. They are almost completely unnoticeable which I&#x27;m very happy about. So I like what it&#x27;s doing and will continue to use and I think I will order my other two bottles soon as I don&#x27;t want them to be out of stock when I go on to the 2nd and 3rd month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/12/12 \\&quot;HAIR\\&quot; UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;This product is great, I didn&#x27;t notice anything the first two weeks but toward the third week I have noticed that my hair is thicker and I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of new growth (haven&#x27;t measured yet) and my nails are actually growing longer now and are looking really nice.  I purchased my other two bottles a few weeks ago to make sure I had enough to continue with the 90 days and I&#x27;m glad that I did!  The only weird thing is the order I received the second time, the liquid is a little darker than my first bottle and both bottles were fresh so I&#x27;m not sure why that is but it still taste the same.e to use and I think I will order my other two bottles soon as I don&#x27;t want them to be out of stock when I go on to the 2nd and 3rd month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/12/12 \\&quot;HAIR\\&quot; UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;This product is great, I didn&#x27;t notice anything the first two weeks but toward the third week I have noticed that my hair is thicker and I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of new growth (haven&#x27;t measured yet) and my nails are actually growing longer now and are looking really nice.

    <li> I ordered two (2) bottles of Nzuri Elixir and was sent two (2) bottles of Fruta Vida, hmmmm what in the world is that??? Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ive been tracking the results of this product very carefully. I discontinued use of my multi-vitamin and biotin to give this product its fair chance being it is not cheap. And as of today 5/13/14,  2 days short of a month I can say ive seen positive results thus far. My nails are the healthy and growing. My hair is thickening up, not as dry and just looking marvelous. My skin is glowing I am constantly getting compliments. I love this product and have 4 bottles in reserve, I also invested in the Nzuri Vida 10 in 1 vitamin. I follow the directions on the bottle. I put two caps of each in my green smoothie, every morning. I am afraid I am a customer for life. I have since introduced it to many of my friends and family and I am all the results they see. thanks for producing such a wonderful product that does what it says.</li>
    <li> 1. I&#x27;m not trying to get my hair thick; I want it loooonnnngggg.  2. Can I mix it with soda?  The prune juice taste makes me gag, I want to try it with Dr. Pepper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I get my long hair?</li>
    <li> I received the bottles intact , packaging well secured , no dents ,leakage or damage to box.  I have been using the vitamins for appx 3 weeks since I received them . So far so good . No untowrad side effects from the vitamins .  Not halfway through bottle #1 . I can provide a more thorough review upon the completeion of the bottle .  I have been using the vitamin in my daily green smoothie mix . Hair pretty much the same ... can say have noticed strength in nails , but no substancial or out of the ordinary growth .  The weather is warming, skin not so dry  and I am also using a new cuticle oil , so that might be contributing as well .</li>
    <li> You feel the tingle in your hair follicles instantly.  I am not see significant growth yet but the breakage is must less. And it tastes great.....</li>
    <li> The reason is no because soon as I started taking the product to help my hair grow .it made my hair fall out I have lost my hair in the top of my head and middle</li>
    <li> This has been great for my hair, it has thicken, lengthen, stop breaking, less dandruff. My hairdresser has notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Where do I begin...&lt;br /&gt;I took the recommended doses as mixed in with citrus drinks - orange, grapefruit, etc. - to mask the absolutely horrendous smell and taste.  It worked...a little.  But yes, this stuff is simply rancid.  Strike one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking the doses, I saw no improvement whatsoever.  I get it...the point is to be a dietary supplement.  But I saw nothing gained from taking this, even in addition to an already lean diet and workout program.  Strike two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I noticed that after taking a dose of this stuff, I would get extremely nauseous and have some stomach cramping, even if I didn&#x27;t take the whole dose.  Strike three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dumped both bottles down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to tell you that you will experience the same.  Rather, I share the experience, and it looks like some others did as well.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about a month now.  I have not seen any results.  I have locs that are thinning at the roots.  As of today I don&#x27;t see my hair thickening up.  I give it a 2 star because it does have a lot great nutrients. I still have another bottle and hope to see results by the end of the second bottle.</li>
    <li> yes, it works!!!  I am an Black woman with super tight, thin, coarse hair. Not only does the hair on my head, eyelashes, well, all over(even in those places where I would prefer the hair NOT grow so fast) grow faster than my hair EVER has.  It also grows thicker! I love it and as a side bonus my skin is more radiant than ever!  Im very pleased with this product and will always use it. I have not gone nonstop with the recommended 6 month program yet but, I will.  I however, have been using this product for over 4 years sporadically and have gotten awesome results everytime.</li>
    <li> i am very satisfied with this product.have been taking chemo meds that made me go bald in spots in my head.now i have hair growing again.i wash,get hot oil tx&#x27;s weekly,watch what i eat.my scalp is so much healthier now.i highly recommend this supplement.</li>
    <li> This product taste awful and if you take it before breakfast it will make you throw up. I can&#x27;t believe how some people like the taste. I have been taking it for nearly 2 months now and I can say that this product helped me grow hair faster but did not stopped hair fall.</li>
