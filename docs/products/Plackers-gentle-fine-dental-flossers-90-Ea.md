      <li>That being said, these work and they&#x27;re an ok product, so 3 stars.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I can find these on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>But the flossing performance counts the most, and this product is tops in that regard.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve used ones which are much better.</li>
      <li>I will say that more cleaning effort is needed for these picks personnaly.</li>
      <li>I like these more than any competitors</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure what I paid for these as I write this, because they get me to floss every day between every tooth, and when I run out I buy more.</li>
      <li>I love getting my teeth nice and clean now, and try to use them after every meal.  </li>
      <li>This particular Plackers flosser is great.  </li>
      <li>These were of good quality and the price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I love the guarded pick at the bottom...</li>
      <li>I bought this product because of the good comments I read and the price, but I really was a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>its a good product, but product image needs to be updated because its very misleading.</li>
      <li>heard so many people including my dentist saying floss picks just don&#x27;t work as well as good old floss</li>
      <li>Easy to carry when traveling.</li>
      <li>pick easily cleans all my teeth.  </li>
      <li>This is easy.</li>
      <li>These are easy to use and slide between teeth almost effortlessly.</li>
      <li>So easy to handle, no unwieldy wads of used floss.</li>

      <li>and these fit easily through them to get the job done.  </li>
      <li>The floss glides perfect between tight teeth without breaking or fraying.</li>
      <li>These little flossers are flavorless and odorless, which is perfect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are fantastic floss-picks.</li>
      <li>This are nice because they are thinner than others and will slide between contact points much easier.</li>
      <li>Fit between my close teeth and don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These make it so fast and easy!</li>
      <li>In the morning, I&#x27;ll take a clean flosser from the bag and floss my teeth before I brush them.</li>
      <li>I had bought a package before and found them to be the best I&#x27;ve used, though more expensive than most - but they&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
      <li>The Plackers gentle fine dental flossers are so much easier to get between the teeth and are strong and sturdy to use, even though they are very fine.</li>
      <li>The transaction was quick and smooth per Amazon, and the flossers arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>they are the best , hardly ever break.....</li>
      <li>These are hard to find in the store, and the 4 pack is a great deal!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the Gentle Slide Plackers, but for me, these work better.</li>
      <li>pleased with this product and highly recommended!</li>
      <li>They do an adequate job.</li>
      <li>I love this particular brand and variety of flosser because it never breaks and the floss itself doesn&#x27;t fray like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>These specific plackers are perfect for people whose teeth are very tightly spaced, they never break, and the floss is very fine</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;ll admit that normal dental floss is probably a cheaper and better way to go if that works for you.</li>
      <li>very comfortable to hold, and easy to reach molars in the back   3.</li>
      <li>Plackers make flossing fast and easy.</li>
      <li>Happened to notice this product on the Amazon site and was pretty excited.  </li>
      <li>They are durable and great for &#x27;tight teeth&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I ordered gentle fine and got micro mint.  </li>
      <li>(i have the gentle fine version) for additional comfort.</li>
      <li>I bought Plackers Gentle Fine flossers from Amazon, provided by Preferred Mart.  </li>
      <li>Was happy to find this online since I have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
      <li>This is the last kind.</li>
      <li>I have used several brands, and these are really just as good as the rest.</li>
      <li>But the little guarded pick works well, the floss itself is fine and strong, and overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I would&#x27;ve rated it good if i hadn&#x27;t tried other ones</li>
      <li>so it glides right in.</li>
      <li>These particular GENTLE FINE flossers are great for tight teeth and don&#x27;t shred.</li>
      <li>Although I still think these are the best flossers on the market, my current bag (lot number 20603) seems to have floss of slightly lower quality than any bag I&#x27;ve used before.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> TMI, but relevant - my teeth are close, so regular flossers are either too soft and shred, or too wiresharp cutting into my gums. These guys got it right, the floss doesn&#x27;t shred or break, and at the same time, doesn&#x27;t feel like a metal wire between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Happened to notice this product on the Amazon site and was pretty excited.  Those of us with very tight teeth are unable to use some flossers.  This helps a lot</li>
    <li> Update (Feb. 18, 2015): Although I still think these are the best flossers on the market, my current bag (lot number 20603) seems to have floss of slightly lower quality than any bag I&#x27;ve used before. One in every six or so flossers will have floss that snaps off the flosser immediately upon trying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling this new problem is caused by the use of thinner floss, which can&#x27;t withstand as much force when it&#x27;s slid between teeth. The floss arcs and the load is transferred towards the arms, which causes a break at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, the company has come up with a new design, which fixes the slightly design issue with the pick I mention in my review. The new design also seems to use less plastic for the handle. I hope this cost-savings on the handle is partly transferred back into the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, I&#x27;d prefer if they just raise prices or reduce the number of flossers per pack, if they need to. It&#x27;s a bit of an inconvenience and waste of material to include several flossers which effectively can&#x27;t be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Original Review Below---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fantastic floss-picks. My grandfather&#x27;s a dentist and I first got introduced to floss-picks after he brought some home from his office. I don&#x27;t really have the finger dexterity to use regular floss. The floss-picks he gave me were very easily shred or snapped by my tight teeth, and I&#x27;d sometimes end up with little fibres between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These don&#x27;t have that problem. In the morning, I&#x27;ll take a clean flosser from the bag and floss my teeth before I brush them. I usually do this while reading the news or checking my email. Because these flossers don&#x27;t shred, you can use one to clean your entire mouth. I just keep a tissue nearby to wipe it off as I&#x27;m flossing my teeth. I mean if you sanitised it well, you probably could use one flosser forever, I tried snapping the floss once with my finger and couldn&#x27;t do it. I actually ended up giving myself a slight laceration. Hurray for male bravado!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other end of the flosser is sharpened into a toothpick, which is shielded by a bit of plastic that you have to twist away first. I like this design. It stops your palm from being pricked by the pick. Unfortunately, while I was able to use the floss just fine, I couldn&#x27;t fit the pick between my teeth. People with tight teeth might have trouble using the pick. It&#x27;s still nice for removing plaque from tooth surfaces before brushing, though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the flosser has a nice ribbed design, so it&#x27;s pleasurable to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand. Overall, this is a well-made and designed product. However, about 1-in-10 flossers have floss that&#x27;s slightly wispy, like how a wool sweater sometimes has some fluffy or wispy threads. The wispy floss is harder to stick between my teeth, but the average person shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. No floss ever gets caught between my teeth or anything like that either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to clarify. I got 4 packs of flossers with 90 flossers in each pack. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. That&#x27;s 360 flossers!The other end of the flosser is sharpened into a toothpick, which is shielded by a bit of plastic that you have to twist away first.

    <li> Order received in a timely manner.  Was happy to find this online since I have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Plackers.  They make flossing my 5 year old&#x27;s teeth much, much easier.  And, the price was superb.  Shipping was fast, absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> My teeth are close set and these fit easily through them to get the job done.  With the arthritis I have in my hands, dental floss was not an option.  I can control these though.</li>
    <li> for me this really is the only one that fits the space between my teeth without snapping up into my gums. They are really tough for being so fine; they never shred on me even on a tooth or two that has a bit of a rough filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an empty Altoids Gum tin or something similar it&#x27;s a perfect way to take them with you in your bag or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These are the strongest floss-picks I&#x27;ve found.  They&#x27;re very difficult to break while flossing your teeth (unlike many other brands).  From what I understand, flossing is essential for maintaining dental health - starting with a pack of 4, I use them so often, I&#x27;ll be ordering these again soon.  I hope they continue to make these for all of eternity.</li>
    <li> I could only find these on Amazon. Thank God! They are the best, strongest flossers. I love the guarded pick at the bottom... other flossers have flimsy picks. The floss is strong and fits perfectly between my teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on anything else but this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered gentle fine and got micro mint.  Not pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I hope amazon prime will sell it too.&lt;br /&gt; It can get the food out in my back teeth which other other brand of floss string, and floss stick ( I have tried almost all the brands in the market)</li>
    <li> I love these because I have super tight teeth. Whenever I go to get my teeth cleaned, I remind the teeth cleaning lady that she should please use the finest floss she has, and then she comments on how tight my teeth are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I went to the store the other day to stock up since I was out of flossers. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere! Are they discontinuing the product? I hope not! I ended up buying another product (I think the brand was Dentek or something like it) and they were absolutely horrible. The floss stretched and ripped, and it was too thick to get between my teeth without making my gums bleed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon still sells the Plackers gentle flossers. My roommate thought I was crazy when I got those delivered (after all, who needs 360 flossers all at once?). But I&#x27;m happy, cause it looks like I&#x27;ll be set for the coming year ;)</li>
    <li> They work great, and don&#x27;t break as often as other flosser brands - including other flossers that are also made by Plackers. I order the &amp;#34;Gentle Fine&amp;#34; brand on Plackers over and over. If you had other flossers break on you, try the &amp;#34;Gentle Fine&amp;#34; brand. And these flossers certainly beat sticking your fingers in your mouth like you have to do with conventional dental floss. Ewww !</li>
    <li> VERY difficult to find floss picks that aren&#x27;t flavored with mint!  These are the easiest things for my kids to use to floss.  Finally, no mint taste so they are more likely to use them!</li>
    <li> i have stuck with this brand for two years now. these are the best flossers out there    1. there is a long sturdy handle so your fingers won&#x27;t touch your lips or teeth (bacteria transfer)  2. very comfortable to hold, and easy to reach molars in the back   3. doesn&#x27;t shred any more than the best flossers out there    areas could use improvement:   1.still occasionally shreds and tangles on these chipped fillings i have (but other brands do too). if i am careful i don&#x27;t have this problem.   2. could be thinner (i have the gentle fine version) for additional comfort. but please don&#x27;t make them WIDER because then i can&#x27;t reach the very bottom of my teeth  3. make em cost less, haha</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in the store, and the 4 pack is a great deal! These specific plackers are perfect for people whose teeth are very tightly spaced, they never break, and the floss is very fine so it glides right in. Terrific Product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands/types of these, but these are the only ones I will use! They are durable and great for &#x27;tight teeth&#x27;. I had a difficult time finding these at local drug stores recently- but I was pleased to find I could purchase a 4 pack online! I was tired of wasting time searching for them at drug stores- because like I said before- I will not purchase any other type of flosser! This one is the best! The shipping was fast and it&#x27;s a great value!</li>
    <li> I hate mint. It doesn&#x27;t matter what variety or type of mint it is. I hate it. These little flossers are flavorless and odorless, which is perfect. I&#x27;ll buy these again when what I have runs out.</li>
    <li> The flossers were mint in flavor.  As you can see from the order I did not want mint</li>
    <li> Very, very durable with a nice fine thread (my teeth are pretty close together). I bought several packs and had to give some away. It&#x27;ll take forever to finish one pack.</li>
    <li> I have very tight spaces betweekmy teeth and most flossers break.  These are the only ones that stand up to the challenge.</li>
    <li> This are nice because they are thinner than others and will slide between contact points much easier. I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Plackers make flossing fast and easy. Flossing is a chore and face it, something that takes up time, but these little flossers simplify. I even keep a few in my bag.</li>
    <li> These work very well, especially for tight fitting teeth. Easy to use and effective tool for plaque control and debris removal.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was predisposed to dislike these... more plastic single-use disposable items in the waste stream! But they get me to floss on a fairly regular basis, which I never did with the bulk stuff despite dire warnings of dentists. So I uncomfortably push my principles to the background and become a bit more of a consumer... one with cleaner teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare this brand to others (with the exception of random freebies from friends over the years), so as a review this is probably not too useful. But the little guarded pick works well, the floss itself is fine and strong, and overall it&#x27;s a good product. Will re-order the same type when this bag is empty...</li>
    <li> Love these! Fit between my close teeth and don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> They are flossers.  They do break or wear thin eventually, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  They do seem stronger that other ones that I have used.</li>
    <li> best flossers money can buy!</li>
    <li> This is one of those weird products where if you haven&#x27;t tried it before, you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re going to get. There are a few flavors of these out there - ones with mint crud stuck to the floss, ones with a green plastic floss, and ones with the white shreddy kind of floss. This is the last kind. The plastic ones are easier to work with for me, and (especially if you have crowded teeth like I do) they minimize the risk of shredding. That being said, these work and they&#x27;re an ok product, so 3 stars.</li>
    <li> These little things are great, and easier than standard floss for little hands to use.  My two sons, 8 &amp; 3, used to refuse to floss, but now they do it on their own with these.  It&#x27;s also nice to keep some in my bag for when something gets stuck in my teeth if we go out to dinner.  I have used several brands, and these are really just as good as the rest.</li>
    <li> I love this particular brand and variety of flosser because it never breaks and the floss itself doesn&#x27;t fray like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> No more excuses not to floss. These make it so fast and easy! No strange smells and perfect for our 4-year old&#x27;s little hands.</li>
    <li> This particular Plackers flosser is great.  The floss does not stretch or break and is fine enough to get between any teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands &#x27;lazy way&#x27; to floss,they are great~</li>
    <li> This is a lot of flossers.  You probably do not need this many flosser but they are certainly the best type and brand for any type of teeth.  Husband has tight teeth: loves them.  I&#x27;m gap toothed: love them.  Dog: loves them.</li>
    <li> They do an adequate job.</li>
    <li> I use dental flossers every day. At a store I usually look for something on sale or a store brand and the quality of the flossers can be hit or miss. These were of good quality and the price was very reasonable. I will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I recieived not the product in the picture. Its false advertising. In the picture it says 20 additional flosses with the total of 110. However, the real product had 90 in them.  Please be honest in advertising.</li>
    <li> Reordered because we like the product.  All aspect of the order was as expected.</li>
    <li> My husband introduced the Placers to me.  They are fantastic for all of my teeth - both the ones that are tight and even those that have more space in between.  I love getting my teeth nice and clean now, and try to use them after every meal.  The handle is long enough to use, yet small enough to get way back to the back teeth. Thanks, Plackers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had the string break on me, when everything else has, makes a huge difference in dental hygiene, cuts down on frustration too.</li>
    <li> These are great. I floss after every meal, as i cannot stand the feeling of food stuck between my teeth.  it took me about 6 months to go through all 360 flossers.  These are strong, thin enough to get between tight teeth, and sturdy enough to clean my whole mouth with just one flosser.  I highly recommend these to anyone.  Unfortunately, when i reordered I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention and bought the Plackers Gentleslide (http://amzn.to/1muICLc) and they are just awful.  I&#x27;ll write a review on that product, but ugh, tragic.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find them in the local store any longer.  Amazon to the rescue :-)</li>
    <li> An excellent product.</li>
    <li> heard so many people including my dentist saying floss picks just don&#x27;t work as well as good old floss&lt;br /&gt;they should all try this out&lt;br /&gt;1 pick per time, won&#x27;t break, flexible enough so it wraps around the teeth and go inside the gum&lt;br /&gt;now I don&#x27;t have to deal with fisting my mouth every day...</li>
    <li> I bought Plackers Gentle Fine flossers from Amazon, provided by Preferred Mart.  The transaction was quick and smooth per Amazon, and the flossers arrived quickly.  I had bought a package before and found them to be the best I&#x27;ve used, though more expensive than most - but they&#x27;re worth it.  Other flossers had fatter strings that were difficult to push down between tight teeth, and the strings were prone to shredding and sometimes breaking.  This required the use of two flossers, which negated their lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Plackers have a single thin cord that seems to be very strong.  They&#x27;re easier to use, and one floss-pick easily cleans all my teeth.  The floss-picks have a plastic \\&quot;wrap-around\\&quot; that protects you from the point at the tip.  To use the point, you have to flex the wrap-around part until it breaks off.  I could do without this \\&quot;protective\\&quot; part.  I&#x27;d prefer a pointed tip, and a sharper point at that.  But the flossing performance counts the most, and this product is tops in that regard.</li>
    <li> This is the finest floss I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s our 3rd order.</li>
    <li> Ain&#x27;t nothing better than these!</li>
    <li> Now, I&#x27;ll admit that normal dental floss is probably a cheaper and better way to go if that works for you. I buy these because I HATE standard dental floss and don&#x27;t use it. However, I do use these things, and don&#x27;t have to force myself to do it! I&#x27;m not even sure what I paid for these as I write this, because they get me to floss every day between every tooth, and when I run out I buy more. They are comfortable (unless you don&#x27;t take care of your teeth, in which case pretty much any dental product is uncomfortable) and are very quick and easy to use. 100% recommended, especially if you know you should floss but hate &#x27;normal&#x27; dental floss. Try these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I like these more than any competitors - I tried the cheaper store brand and one other (forget the name) and didn&#x27;t like them, stopped using them, and eventually threw them out and bought these again and scarcely miss a day!</li>
    <li> These work pretty much as described; I have had a couple incidents where they have shredded and I needed to use regular floss. Also I was disappointed when I received the shipment because the ad at the time stated a bonus in each pack as 110 instead of 90.</li>
    <li> They work great. Much much easier to use than other flossing methods and very cheap for how long they take to run out.</li>
    <li> its a good product, but product image needs to be updated because its very misleading. photo shows 5 pack of 110 count, when in fact its a 4 pack of 90 count. if you shop by price per unit, this may sway you in the wrong direction.</li>
    <li> they are the best , hardly ever break.....</li>
    <li> Sorry but flossing the old way is just too awkward. This is easy.</li>
    <li> Lots of them - NO mint flavor which is great in my opinion - can&#x27;t stand the stuff.  Could be a bit stronger I keep getting the floss stuck and breaking it.</li>
    <li> Flosses without breakage,  Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.  Best of all floss products.  Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly recommend to my family and friends</li>
    <li> I hate the ones that stick in your teeth and never come out. These work to clean my teeth and are a good price</li>
    <li> These are the only dental flossers I can use. I have tried other types and couldn&#x27;t stand using them. It is funny how different each brand and kind can be. The Plackers gentle fine dental flossers are so much easier to get between the teeth and are strong and sturdy to use, even though they are very fine. It only takes one of them to floss all of your teeth. I am so glad that I can find these on Amazon.com. My local stores stopped selling them.</li>
    <li> thanks to these I can floss all the time. I hate wrapping the floss around my fingers and this makes it sooo easy!</li>
    <li> I like to alternate between using dental floss and Plackers. I have tightly packed teeth and a lot of times floss breaks and some floss seems too slippery to be doing its job. These particular GENTLE FINE flossers are great for tight teeth and don&#x27;t shred. I&#x27;ve also tried the Gentle Slide Plackers, but for me, these work better.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. You get a few months supply and the thin but strong floss is great for a deep cleaning</li>
    <li> Fantastic between tight teeth and really like the product.</li>
    <li> Yay, not flavored! (flavor really irritates my gums)  The floss is very fine, but it is very strong.</li>
    <li> Love that these are unflavored which has become impossible to find locally in my area. The floss glides perfect between tight teeth without breaking or fraying. I like to put a few flossers in plastic bags to have on hand in the car, at the office, etc, so it&#x27;s great the toothpick is protected which prevents the pointed end from poking through the plastic bag.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and slide between teeth almost effortlessly. For the value, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
    <li> I tried a few different kinds form various manufacturaters and this is def a better product than others. I  bought a four pack and will stick with them in the future.</li>
    <li> Perfect way to make flossing easy. No mess, no bother. Easy to carry when traveling. hated flossing before finding these</li>
    <li> The stores around here all carry the mint version of this pick, and I can never find the plain ones.  Although more expensive than what I can buy locally, I like that these are unflavored.  They are also very tough and I like how they have a protective cover over the pointy-pick end.</li>
    <li> I happen to be in Dollar Tree and noticed plackers floss my teeth are pretty tight so i decided to give it a try. They worked quite well and lived up to its claim, no shredding. I purchased mint flavor and that was a plus. I will continue to purchase this floss.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipment.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These flossers hold up to there name and are noticable thinner than other flossers out there by the same or different brand. I can&#x27;t say that I personally had trouble with normal flossers, but my wife hated them to no end. With these flossers she doesn&#x27;t experience pain trying to force them between her teeth, and we both agree they slide in and out easier with no loss of durablility of the floss. So far we haven&#x27;t had one break on us while flossing. I will say that more cleaning effort is needed for these picks personnaly. With normal sive picks, shoving them between teeth normally contacts both of my teeth, but this product is so fine that I have to run it up and down multiple times. I don&#x27;t mind the extra effort for the added feeling of control and comfort. Overall a five star product and I will purchase again for a similar price.</li>
    <li> All floss picks claim to be break and shred resistant.  These actually are.  A fold away guard exposes a surprisingly sharp pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
    <li> Not what they advertise &amp;#34;thread NEVER breaks&amp;#34; but is useful and cheaper that other competing brand in the market today</li>
    <li> These Plackers are designed for flossing between tight teeth and they  are PERFECT.  They alao work good for rnormal teeth.  KIDS CAN ISE THEM ALSO.  We shared them with family members also.</li>
    <li> Never could floss my daughter&#x27;s back teeth, it was too hard to get in her little mouth with regular floss.  This product did the trick.</li>
    <li> I have tight teeth, and flossing can be really difficult. These make it much easier, and can be used anywhere...as long as any people around you don&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> I hate using dental floss, but since my dentist recommended Plackers, I actually enjoy flossing. My crowns on the back molars are tight and its no problem with this product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These plackers are essential, so I get them by the score. Good prices, as usual, on Amazon. If you think you hate flossing your teeth, you need to try these. So easy to handle, no unwieldy wads of used floss. So fast. So painless. Gotta have them.</li>
    <li> Flossers work well for tight teeth.  Wish they would also make them for back teeth- maybe they will in the future!</li>
    <li> These dental flossers work great for me. I can get in between even my crowded teeth without much effort at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my teeth spaces and new style gives you&lt;br /&gt;great toothpick on the handle. Floss while watching TV</li>
    <li> ........floss while you are driving......discreet at work......the best i&#x27;ve used......</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  Haven&#x27;t had one break yet.  The material is more like fishing line than the usual coated string that most dental floss is made from.  It is not waxed which was a bonus for me.  Best flossers I have used.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the good comments I read and the price, but I really was a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I got these ones instead of the ones in the pic http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Gentle-Fine-Floss-Picks-90/dp/B002YGHXPS/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_1&lt;br /&gt;which sure its the same brand but they are much thicker and the string is not very tight.&lt;br /&gt;The pick has a little rounded finish, it could be more sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I would&#x27;ve rated it good if i hadn&#x27;t tried other ones but I&#x27;ve used ones which are much better. I&#x27;ll just keep looking for them.</li>
