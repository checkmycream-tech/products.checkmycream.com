      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>Love these...</li>
      <li>now I am thinking I might should have ordered more.</li>
      <li>My customers love these.</li>
      <li>and I keep reordering them because they are absolutely perfect for my essential oils that need to be in a spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>hey came a long way in shipping and arrived perfectly.</li>
      <li>The nozzle sprays a fine perfect spray, no drips and the spray diameter is not so wide you lose perfume.</li>
      <li>long, lovely glass vials.. perfect to fill with your own favorite parfum, eau de toilette, or homemade essential oils.</li>
      <li>Great for travel or your daily bag.</li>
      <li>Great for the essential oils that I have!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased one pack (12) and my customers raved.  </li>
      <li>These are real glass, frosted, slim, elegant, and tall</li>
      <li>We could not find these anywhere else among our tried and true wholesalers.</li>
      <li>these ones are 1000x better plus classy (non-plastic) looking!</li>
      <li>I have tried one out so far for a homemade perfume made out of essential oils and Everclear alcohol and it works great.</li>
      <li>I will surely reorder in the future if these are still available.</li>
      <li>While they do take some time to get here, its worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>Takes a while to arrive but well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>A few of my customers have asked for refills of their fragrance sprays, and these held up nicely, hand wash easily.  </li>
      <li>Nice heavy glass soft finish and spray that works...great for those of us who make our own perfumes.</li>
      <li>This comes with six nice frosted glass vials about 4&amp;#34; long with gold caps</li>
      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy more when I need them.</li>
      <li>Given the cargo backup on the west coast, we are thrilled these keep slipping in from China.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried laying the bottle on its side yet to see if it leaks, but the top screws down securely</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable, the shipping time was reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>I ordered these in November and received them about 3 weeks later, not bad for shipping from China.</li>
      <li>and so far is working very well for my essential oil mixes.</li>
      <li>I came back and ordered 36 bottles and only 2 were defective, still worth the price.  </li>
      <li>My main concern is that I was only sent 6 when the description clearly states 12.</li>
      <li>I did not wash the gold plated caps because I didn&#x27;t want them to tarnish, but I do and did wipe them clean with alcohol and dried immediately</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quality product. Very pleased with my purchase. My customers love these.</li>
    <li> These are SO cute. They work for both oils and water-based formulas.  We could not find these anywhere else among our tried and true wholesalers. Given the cargo backup on the west coast, we are thrilled these keep slipping in from China. Still, we continue to hope these will someday be made in the usa. We do recommend a label as this glass would shatter if dripped on a tile surface.</li>
    <li> Love these and I keep reordering them because they are absolutely perfect for my essential oils that need to be in a spray bottle.  Never have had any problems with the sprayer and no leaks if it&#x27;s laying down in my purse!  I just have to stop sharing them with everyone...lol</li>
    <li> Very nice quality. Received more than a week ahead of scheduled delivery. I immediatelytested one and it worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> These things are what I have been looking for, better than the plastic atomizers that breaks after 8 sprays....nonono....these ones are 1000x better plus classy (non-plastic) looking! I love it!</li>

    <li> Love these bottles... I will surely reorder in the future if these are still available. It&#x27;s hard to find these right now.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful to make travel sizes of your favorite sanitizer (OnGuard from doTerra for me) and perfumes, etc.</li>

    <li> My customers keep asking for these so I keep ordering.  I originally purchased one pack (12) and my customers raved.  I came back and ordered 36 bottles and only 2 were defective, still worth the price.  A few of my customers have asked for refills of their fragrance sprays, and these held up nicely, hand wash easily.  I did not wash the gold plated caps because I didn&#x27;t want them to tarnish, but I do and did wipe them clean with alcohol and dried immediately, they polish up nicely.  While they do take some time to get here, its worth the wait.  These are real glass, frosted, slim, elegant, and tall so you get a nice amount.  I will definitely keep these in stock.</li>
    <li> Great for the essential oils that I have!</li>
    <li> I love these!  Great for travel or your daily bag. You can fill them with your favorite fragrances, mouthwash, water, or anything without oil.</li>
    <li> This comes with six nice frosted glass vials about 4&amp;#34; long with gold caps and so far is working very well for my essential oil mixes. It takes a couples weeks to receive as it comes from Singapore but Ben ships it soon after ordering!  I will probably buy more</li>
    <li> These are a great find, so glad I got them. The nozzle sprays a fine perfect spray, no drips and the spray diameter is not so wide you lose perfume. I haven&#x27;t tried laying the bottle on its side yet to see if it leaks, but the top screws down securely so I doubt it will leak. The frosty finish on the glass is good for writing the perfume name on it with a sharpie. The price was reasonable, the shipping time was reasonable as well. I would definitely buy more when I need them.</li>
    <li> Good item as described, works well!</li>
    <li> I ordered these in November and received them about 3 weeks later, not bad for shipping from China. All appear to be in working order. I have tried one out so far for a homemade perfume made out of essential oils and Everclear alcohol and it works great. My main concern is that I was only sent 6 when the description clearly states 12. I would not have ordered them if I would have known I was only getting 6.</li>
    <li> Works great for making ur own spray perfumes out of bought roll ons or non spray bottles. love them and will suggest them to others. Takes a while to arrive but well worth the wait. And great quality.</li>
