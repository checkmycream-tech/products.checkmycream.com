<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to use &amp;#34;poofs&amp;#34; years ago and changed to something else. However, upon seeing this product which claimed to exfoliate, I decided to try them. I&#x27;m very glad I did! They make me feel so clean and my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> Very soft and nice collection of different colors</li>
    <li> First one fell apart within two weeks the second one is going on two weeks and starting loosing shape.  Good thing i bought in a package of six so they will last me a couple months.  They are soft but do not hold up any better then ones I&#x27;ve purchased from local stores.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotional item.  this type of product is not something I normally use but I found it be superior to the ones I tried in the past.  It&#x27;s larger and fuller and does feel soft on the skin  but at the same time stimulates and does the job of exfoliating.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Not as large as I hoped, but for the price, this is a great deal!</li>
    <li> I answered this survey once already and it was removed.</li>
    <li> Lathers really well, met expectations, it could be a little more exfoliating but I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> They are not very strong, they come apart after a weeks use</li>
    <li> Great durable product! As advertised!</li>
    <li> They are not as big as I expected but good enough. They are a good size.</li>
    <li> excellent quality items, nice price and fast shipping, thank you!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotional item and was surprised. I have bought similar items and they were not as nice as this.  I like the colors and I like the feel.  If feels good, not scratchy.</li>
    <li> These are very soft. I wish they exfoliated more! Pretty colors, though.</li>
    <li> They hold together well, longer than most others.  Will surely be buying more.</li>
    <li> These are very attractive.  I love the colors and that almost makes them very worth it. Unfortunately, they are much smaller than I expected based on the product listing and the reviews...and I am a pretty small person.  They also are not a &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; as I thought they would be.  I guess the netting is finer than expected.  They feel rather like a dry wash cloth instead of a loofah pouf.  I will use them, and they look adorable but they are not quite what I expected.</li>
    <li> à la paix has bugged me weekly to review these since I purchased them, so here you go: They&#x27;re bath sponges. They&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different kinds of poufs. This is the best one I have used. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great sponge that is nice and soft and not overly abrasive on the skin. The price is also fantastic. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that I&#x27;m a guy and the colors are very feminine.</li>
    <li> They are really full and fluffy, perfect poofs! 😁</li>
    <li> I always use a poof instead of a wash cloth. I have ever since I started using body wash instead of a bar of soap. So when I was offered this pack of Exfoliating Shower Poofs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion and thoughts about it I definitely ordered a pack. I was so excited for them to arrive. I didn&#x27;t realize how much came in the pack, but I&#x27;ll tell you now, I won&#x27;t need to buy more for the rest of the year! These work great too! They aren&#x27;t like the little tiny pathetic poofs that you get with a bottle, these are the thick fatty kind. I also like that they are slightly different from each other. I definitely recommend these Exfoliating Shower Poofs for everyone who uses body wash or shower gel.</li>
    <li> I have been using loofahs for most of my adult life and I love them. I have used different types, shapes and sizes of loofahs. I mostly buy them from grocery stores or beauty shops only because I like to see how they are before I use them. I was a bit skeptical when I received these loofahs for review. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come in pack of 6 with different color shades. They are lightly woven which I love. I have some tightly woven loofahs and they are very tough to use and require a lot of soap. Since this come in pack of 6, I have loofahs in every bathroom now for everyone. They do appear to be well made but only time can tell if they are durable. Overall I am happy with this pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received.</li>
    <li> I received my Mesh Exfoliating Bath Sponges today and I used them today in my Shower, I love how it came in a 6 pack of pretty different colors. They were made with a sturdy material not cheap mesh. The soap lathered up very nicely on these sponges and they were very easy to hold onto. I love how they have the little handle on them so that you can hang them in the shower, that makes it easy access for anyone needing to use it. It&#x27;s rough but soft enough for your skin. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I love a good exfoliating bath sponge and this is definitely a set of sponges to love. As soon as I got these in the mail I got so excited because these are huge, much bigger than the little sponges I have. They are very dense and aren&#x27;t skimping on the material at all. Also, the colors of this set got me happy too. I don&#x27;t like a boring sponge, even though it&#x27;s just going in the shower. My husband instantly tried claiming the blue one but I wouldn&#x27;t let him have it. In the shower, these lather up SO WELL. They exfoliate wonderfully and leave my skin feeling clean and smooth. The material is also gentle on my skin which is great because many other sponges cause irritation and redness on my sensitive skin. I am definitely going to keep this whole set of 6 for myself and I better not catch my husband trying to use one! I never thought I could become so passionate about a sponge before now. I am so happy with these! *promotional discount received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. A+++++++</li>
    <li> This is a great package of exfoliating sponges! The colors are fun and very attractive, making your shower look happy! I did order them though a special deal to try them and share my honest opinion. They do work great and create a nice lather with my liquid or bar soap. They feel great on my skin and the results are great, my skin feels nice and smooth. Great quality and I do like them very much. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> The sponges are wonderful. Not hard and scratchy at all, but still get you nice and clean. Not too large either.  The rope attachment is also smooth and easy to hang. Overall, A+</li>
    <li> Wow I was extremely surprised at how well these worked, Normally with my children these type of sponges either dont clean well or they do not foam up good. However these re not like this at all, they were amazing,  little soap went  a long way and after being a part of a little kids bath routine for a week there still in one piece and working. The colors were very bright and drawing that was a big hit, I really really enjoy them and i felt that with the combination with my soap my skin was very soft. I don&#x27;t think i will buy another sponge. Other than this brand, They washed up in my washer well, I did not dry them i hung them up but over all they were soft enough to be used on a 2 year old and tough enough for even the hardest working man. My husband was impressed as well. these are well worth there price and are amazing would definitely recommend them and purchase them again,&lt;br /&gt;Kim Coble</li>
    <li> I have purchased these several times. They are better than most on the market.</li>
    <li> Awesome they work wonderfully. Ive bought other ones that are rough but this one is soft and doesn&#x27;t scrap your skin. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> By Far the BEST I&#x27;ve tried&#x27; These are by far the best ones I&#x27;ve used. They are very soft but yet strong enough to remove dried pipe dope from my hands and arms. I couldn&#x27;t have put this product to a better test. I am impressed and highly recommend this bath sponge to everybody</li>
    <li> Much better quality than expected</li>
    <li> Very nice on the skin. Only thing is the pack of 6 seems too many :)</li>
    <li> Big and fluffy like I like. Very happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, but well made and they do the job.  :)</li>
    <li> We like these very much. They&#x27;ve been in use for a month, and don&#x27;t show any signs of wear quite yet. Definitely these will be what we get in the future as well.</li>
    <li> These were not &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; as describe and they have started to unravel only a few weeks of use for each (I shower on a daily basis, sometimes skipping a day). I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I felt silly for ordering a package of loofahs, but I am so glad I did! They came in record time and are really top-notch and so lovely! The customer support at Comets Creations seems friendly, too!</li>
    <li> Great product - arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> Pretty solid, better texture/feel than most bath sponges.</li>
    <li> A very good price for quality bath sponges. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> So far these &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; have been great. They exfoliate well without being too aggressive. They are very attractive in a neutral sort of way which is why I chose them initially.</li>
    <li> The best!!they aren&#x27;t cheap feeling and they do not tear easy. And getting g 6 in a pack is beyond worth it because me and my family go thru these so fast!!!</li>
    <li> I like these better than any I&#x27;ve tried through the years...just the right size and very soft.  I definitely will buy these again!</li>
    <li> the quality is great and the colors are beautiful. love these</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised and seem to be quite durable. Feel good on the skin and not too rough.</li>
    <li> These are not &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;. They are small to medium at best. However, good quality material.</li>
    <li> does not deserve its price...&lt;br /&gt;u can get locally much better quality for less money...&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how this product has gotten a high ratings...</li>
    <li> The product is fine, but I like the rougher quality. shipped and packing was fine. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Freaking awesome. The soap I use doesn&#x27;t really sud up by itself, but with one of these babies, it&#x27;s suds everywhere!</li>
    <li> I got sick of the poufs I would buy at the store unraveling or falling apart, so I figured I would look for something nicer. These seem much nicer than your average Target ones. They are thick and feel sturdy. I like that there are 6 of them too, as even though they feel like they&#x27;ll hold up for a while, they can&#x27;t last forever. I likely won&#x27;t be buying more for years.</li>
    <li> a little smaller than I thought - but pretty colors and they have held up well for the last 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I recommend loofas to everyone now. It is definitely a life changer! So much soap in such a small amount!!</li>
    <li> Having somewhat sensitive skin, it&#x27;s difficult to find skin care products that are compatible. In the search for new bath products, I stumbled across a one-time promotional price for these and jumped on it! They are amazingly soft and durable; most shower poofs are scratchy and poorly put together, which means they fall apart quickly and often. This set is absolutely fabulous! I used all six in consecutive showers, in the event that I won the luck of the draw with the first one, and all six held up like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like cutting corners with is skin care products. As such, the better body washes get pricy when they don&#x27;t come from big box discount stores! They produced an astounding amount of lather, which helps to cut down on the amount of body wash used and in turn, that helped to save a little money. The exfoliating and gentle cleansing aspects are perfectly balanced, the colors are soft and pretty, and last but certainly not least, they would be well worth it at twice the full purchase price!</li>
    <li> These are amazing!! Lovely colors and they&#x27;re so soft and it feels great in the skin. I love taking a shower with these, seriously!</li>
    <li> Nice loofas... would buy again</li>
    <li> I previously purchased puffs at big box stores, but never again. These are so soft yet strong enough to exfoliate. They hold up well and are worth the price.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful Bathscrubs. They are soft and come in a variety of colors so the whole family can have their own. I have a large family so this 6 pack of Bathscrubs is a great value.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous and affordable luxuries. The difference between the &amp;agrave; la paix brand and drugstore brand is like night and day plus the price per puff is the same or less the a the horrible drugstores. &amp;agrave; la paix is soft, dense, large and they last. Nothing cheap feeling here and they do a great job exfoliating my body. I wish everything I bought had the price to quality ratio these have.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Larger size.&lt;br /&gt;No unravel so far.&lt;br /&gt;Reduced soap usage since it lathers up more.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> gentle exfoliating string is helpful5 stars</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s softer and feels better on your skin than the ones at the drugstore. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is okay. The quality not quite as good as I had hoped.Not real found of the color pink/blue.</li>
    <li> So nice!  And a multi-pack is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Great value.  These seem like they are high quality and like they will last awhile.</li>
    <li> Wow....got a promotional pack about a week ago and I&#x27;m hooked...great exfoliator...can have a good grip on it, looks fragile but it&#x27;s very strong as texture, feels great on the skin and leaves it feeling refreshed and velvety...And since I got 6 in a pack, I shared with some friends....They could not thank me enough....</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Super soft! Nothing like the cheap drugstore types you can buy for cheap. Buy this product! You will not be disappointed! I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to quality and this product is pure quality when it comes to softness. Lathers up amazing too! Love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality; will buy again!</li>
    <li> I like this product and can recommend it to others. It is a good VALUE and seems to be of excellent construction (I&#x27;ve had many come loose [untied] and become useless).</li>
    <li> Love it. Recieved them on time i use it also for my 1 year old. It is soft and not hard and it lathers up really well. And we love the colors.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely fabulous! I have always bought the expensive pouffs from the big box stores but no more. One of these lasted for over two months and I shower daily. They exfoliate without being scratchy. I will continue to purchase these.</li>
    <li> The quality if these bath puffs far exceeds those that one can purchase at a drug store for 99 cents.  The mesh is very soft, the puff is held together weill, and I i like the colors.  They create a lot of soap foam.  I could not be more pleased.  I do not anticipate that they will unravel like the cheap ones.  Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;Kris Soloman</li>
    <li> Very thick and good quality.</li>
    <li> These are not exfoliating sponges, at least by comparison to all other exfoliating sponges sold at local retailers. They are fine-meshed, soft shower sponges not heavier duty, rougher mesh found on a true exfoliating sponge. For someone needing a sponge to produce a gentle, sudsy wash, these may do the job but they are not at all an exfoliating sponge as sold at retailers like Target. I&#x27;ve only used for a couple days so I cannot comment on how durable the sponges are. If they last longer than others of this type, I may return to add one star to my rating. If they don&#x27;t, the rating will stay and I will return for a refund.</li>
    <li> so far so good used for couple weeks now. soft and sturdy. has not loosen yet.</li>
    <li> Perfectly packaged.  These work great - not rough or irritating.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  No regrets after 4 months.</li>
    <li> The item arrived as promised and the puffs look good.  I haven&#x27;t opened them yet to use them.</li>
    <li> Great bath puffs. Quick ship, good quality and company did follow ups.</li>
    <li> THEY GREAT FOR BATHING AND SHOWERING. WILL COTINUE TO PURCHASE.</li>
