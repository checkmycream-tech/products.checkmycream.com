      <li>This self tanner is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Perfect in every way -- smell, texture, color.</li>
      <li>Because of the semi-lighter tint of this stuff, I also use it on the backs of my hands (after doing the rest of my body and taking the gloves off), and it works great!</li>
      <li>Great find!</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>Great color- not too orange.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>I could not be more happy with this product!</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really good product.</li>
      <li>And good thing I</li>
      <li>This self tanning line is my favorite!</li>
      <li>Healthy color and performs so well!  </li>
      <li>I love this self tanner!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The best part about this stuff is that it works the first time you use it</li>
      <li>I ready a review by another customer who wrote the best review and everything was spot on.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this, it&#x27;s the best sunless face tanner I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>It also washes off hands easily with soap!</li>
      <li>Nice natural color and pleasant smell!</li>
      <li>I love this sunless tanning gel.  </li>
      <li>Love it and will always purchase this face gel and the one hour lotion for the body from Tanwise.  </li>
      <li>Love this face tanner.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This is definitely the best tanning lotion (gel) I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I have used this about 3 times now and it&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s a lightweight foam.</li>
      <li>Plus, there is no fake-tan odor, great since I&#x27;m putting it directly under my nose &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Went on smooth, no streaks, soft, and great color.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it has a strong smell at all.</li>
      <li>The gel goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy.</li>
      <li>The face gel looks more transparent than the body lotion, and goes on much smoother - not to mention it&#x27;s much more forgiving when it comes to any smears that I may have created when applying it.</li>
      <li>has very good color and goes on smooth with no smell or mess.</li>
      <li>Work quickly to prevent streaking.</li>
      <li>Had higher hopes for this coming from my favorite blogger, Maskcara, but it just didn&#x27;t deposit much color.</li>
      <li>So far, this is the best face self-tanner I&#x27;ve found, competing perhaps only with Jergens Natural Glow for face (iterated application, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No orange color at all and looks the most natural on any skin tone</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference between the regular tanner and the face gel was, and since I&#x27;m cheap, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
      <li>and it is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the light texture and the instant bronzing color</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to apply, rubs on smoothly without streaks, doesn&#x27;t stain hands, dries fast, and looks really natural.</li>
      <li>yeah, long story short, this stuff works great, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a perfect natural looking glow within roughly 4 hours.</li>
      <li>Good for application in the morning when you want to look a little bit tanner that day.</li>
      <li>like I did the first time around, haha!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>is so pretty.  </li>
      <li>This is the first one I have found that does not make me break out, and I normally do.  </li>
      <li>It is a very lightweight gel and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts on my face.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak, it&#x27;s not orange but the color first give off much or didn&#x27;t seem to last much on the face!!</li>
      <li>Color is nice, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and</li>
      <li>I have never broken out when using this product, despite having extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This combined with the Tanwise mousse is my new summer staple.</li>
      <li>It gives me an instant bronze, and develops into a nice tan in a few hours.  </li>
      <li>tan does not last as long if I exfoliate my face, but it&#x27;s quick and easy enough to reapply the gel to get the tan back that it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is very dark on my light skin, but still looks natural.</li>
      <li>So lie all you want to your friends and family about how you&#x27;re just a natural sun-kissed</li>
      <li>Natural look.</li>
      <li>Makes you look tan without being orange or looking like a piece of old leather.</li>
      <li>This stuff is seriously fool proof, I love it.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I still get a few good days between applications and a little goes a long way, so the bottle will last you awhile.</li>
      <li>It gives my normally pale and pasty skin, a NORMAL looking tan glow, no orange or day-glow brown, just a natural looking tan without having to sacrifice my skin to the damaging sun.</li>

<li> this bottle is going to last a long time!</li>
<li> Only reason it&#x27;s not perfection is it leaves your skin a little greasy, which is a conundrum because countering grease usually means doing something that will just wash this right off.</li>
<li> It may just be that I&#x27;m not leaving it on long enough, but the back of the bottle has no instructions other than apply to face and neck...</li>
<li> I do put a moisturizer underneath because my skin is dry.  </li>
<li> The little that it did add color, wore off by the time I washed my face the next evening.</li>
<li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
<li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
<li> Average face tanner.</li>
<li> Scroll down to the Tanwise Bronzer</li>
<li> Gel formula, goes on slightly sticky.</li>
<li> If you are looking for something to add just a little color to your face this is the product hands down, it does not streak and its not orange in color.</li>
<li> To me it smells like cough syrup/licorice, however, I can look past that.</li>
<li> So now I don&#x27;t have awkward white hands while the rest of my body is tan anymore, yay!</li>
<li> Would recommend it to anyone looking a subtle but noticeable tan.</li>
<li> I am a redhead with naturally pale skin and it can be difficult to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t turn me into an Oompa Loompa!</li>
<li> (I hate things that don&#x27;t give me instant results), and IT&#x27;S NOT AN ORANGEY FAKE TINT!</li>
<li> Also it really stinks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Really good product. Great color- not too orange. Wish it lasted longer- about two maybe three days. Work quickly to prevent streaking. Love that it&#x27;s a lightweight foam. A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> Love this face tanner.  This is the first one I have found that does not make me break out, and I normally do.  Highly recommend and this bottle is going to last a long time!</li>
    <li> Works well with the mousse.  Natural look.</li>
    <li> I love the light texture and the instant bronzing color is so pretty.  You could use the body version on your face as well, but this feels lighter.  Love it and will always purchase this face gel and the one hour lotion for the body from Tanwise.  Healthy color and performs so well!  Please never stop selling this product.  I do put a moisturizer underneath because my skin is dry.  Love it!</li>
    <li> great product. has very good color and goes on smooth with no smell or mess.</li>
    <li> Scroll down to the Tanwise Bronzer</li>
    <li> I have used this about 3 times now and it&#x27;s okay, but I feel like the color doesn&#x27;t stay. It may just be that I&#x27;m not leaving it on long enough, but the back of the bottle has no instructions other than apply to face and neck... Also it really stinks. To me it smells like cough syrup/licorice, however, I can look past that. I think I may just start using the Tanwise sunless mousse on my face instead. Will update if anything changes</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak, it&#x27;s not orange but the color first give off much or didn&#x27;t seem to last much on the face!!</li>
    <li> This self tanner is the best I&#x27;ve used. It is a very lightweight gel and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts on my face. The color is very dark on my light skin, but still looks natural. I don&#x27;t think it has a strong smell at all. I bought it locally at Sally&#x27;s for like $7. It also washes off hands easily with soap!</li>
    <li> My only face tanner. Perfect in every way -- smell, texture, color. I have never broken out when using this product, despite having extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Had higher hopes for this coming from my favorite blogger, Maskcara, but it just didn&#x27;t deposit much color. The little that it did add color, wore off by the time I washed my face the next evening. I&#x27;ll still give the body lotion a chance!</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner! I have both the face and body mousse and it is by far my favorite. I am a redhead with naturally pale skin and it can be difficult to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t turn me into an Oompa Loompa! The gel goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy. Plus, there is no fake-tan odor, great since I&#x27;m putting it directly under my nose &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best face self-tanner I&#x27;ve found, competing perhaps only with Jergens Natural Glow for face (iterated application, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tinted gel so it&#x27;s easy to apply, rubs on smoothly without streaks, doesn&#x27;t stain hands, dries fast, and looks really natural. Only reason it&#x27;s not perfection is it leaves your skin a little greasy, which is a conundrum because countering grease usually means doing something that will just wash this right off. But so it goes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Makes you look tan without being orange or looking like a piece of old leather. 10/10 would recommend. Never go tanning again</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I ready a review by another customer who wrote the best review and everything was spot on. If you are looking for something to add just a little color to your face this is the product hands down, it does not streak and its not orange in color.

    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference between the regular tanner and the face gel was, and since I&#x27;m cheap, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product. I was just going to use the body tanner on my face too. But out of curiosity of what the difference was, I ordered it… And good thing I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is definitely in the texture and amount of tint that each seems to have. The face gel looks more transparent than the body lotion, and goes on much smoother - not to mention it&#x27;s much more forgiving when it comes to any smears that I may have created when applying it. Because of the semi-lighter tint of this stuff, I also use it on the backs of my hands (after doing the rest of my body and taking the gloves off), and it works great! So now I don&#x27;t have awkward white hands while the rest of my body is tan anymore, yay! :) Oh yeah, and don&#x27;t forget your ears like I did the first time around, haha! The best part about this stuff is that it works the first time you use it (I hate things that don&#x27;t give me instant results), and IT&#x27;S NOT AN ORANGEY FAKE TINT! So lie all you want to your friends and family about how you&#x27;re just a natural sun-kissed goddess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, long story short, this stuff works great, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a perfect natural looking glow within roughly 4 hours.</li>

    <li> Color is nice, but doesn&#x27;t last very long. Good for application in the morning when you want to look a little bit tanner that day. Not very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Average face tanner. Gel formula, goes on slightly sticky. Last about 2 days.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best tanning lotion (gel) I&#x27;ve used. Nice natural color and pleasant smell!</li>
    <li> This product is like a gel paint that you smear on your face and I did not like it at all</li>
