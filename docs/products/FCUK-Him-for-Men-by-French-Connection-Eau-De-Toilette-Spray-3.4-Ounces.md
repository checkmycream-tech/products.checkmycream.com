      <li>On the plus side, I am okay with my boyfriend wearing it...keeps the women away!  </li>
      <li>like the original DKNY UNLEADED get them now because if or when they stop making this very good scent the price is going to be high as hell like a 3.4 bottle of the DKNY UNLEADED is $425.00 at the time of this review so trust me the scent is a beast in performance and longevity the ladies love it a lot!!!!!</li>
      <li>This cologne Smells amazing.</li>

      <li>lasts 2-3 hours and is easy to spray no issues here good price too so all in all 4 stars</li>
      <li>Dont expect anything remotely sexy, or unique, or even attractive.</li>
      <li>Alot of compliments from using it, and perfect for the guy who is sensitive to colognes.</li>
      <li>This is so far the best purchase i have made on the internet.</li>
      <li>, some co-workers dont mind it either makes this guy smell fresh which the ladies like lol</li>
      <li>This cologne was very cheap compared to others I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Pretty good cologne, smells very subtle unless you pour it on.  For the price, this scent is nice!  My only issue is that it has a bit of a soap bar smell, could just be my own nose - but, it&#x27;s not unpleasant by any means. . . overall, it&#x27;s nice fragrance to add to the collection, but not my every-day/go-to scent, at this price - I didn&#x27;t expect it to be either.  Thanks FCUK - I look forward to trying more of your products!</li>
    <li> I like it, nice fragrance,</li>
    <li> Very good product. Will purchase from seller soon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff for over 10 years and it is definitely one of those scents that people will remember you by. I&#x27;ve received alot of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I buy a new jacket/hoodie, I spray it on the inside heavily and let it dry. After a day or so it sets in and smells even better. I also spritz my bedsheets with it from time to time...IF you know what I mean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very clean, pseudo-masculine, and hard to describe scent. Makes you think of that feeling you get at sunset on the beach.</li>
    <li> I will admit, the name grabbed my attention.  The scent, as already described, is light and not overpowering.  You don&#x27;t have to put a lot on, which is a good thing.  I do believe that it&#x27;s not for evening wear (I saw a FCUK Late Night on Amazon that I will check out soon).  All in all it&#x27;s a great cologne for a great price.</li>
    <li> This perfume does not smell like a perfume, it smelt more like bathroom spray. I will have to throw it off I guess!!!! I have used FCUK in the past and I know how it smells, thats why I ordered it. THIS WAS NOT FCUK AT ALL!!!!</li>
    <li> YEAH..... This cologne is better than what I expected. It smells really clean and my woman loves it. I may get me some tonight (smile)  I was really surprised at the size of the bottle. there is a good bit.  Im happy with this purchase and so is my woman. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> It does smell different I give you that.  But it is not as pleasant as say a summer fragrance such as Lacoste or Burberry Summer, nor a fall fragrance such as Armani Mania/Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is stuck somewhere in the spectrum of fragrances with it&#x27;s unique soapy smell.  Not my first choice by a long shot.</li>
    <li> This has a clean scent, but just a warning, it is also very heavy and synthetic at the beginning. It may even give you a headache. But about 1-2 hours in, it&#x27;ll start giving off a very pleasant scent. And the longer you wear it, the better it smells. Make sure to spray it early in the morning so you&#x27;ll get the best of it during the meat of your day. I&#x27;ve gotten the most compliments from wearing this stuff (I also wear Le Male from Jean Paul Gaultier, CK Obsession, and Issey Miyake). I prefer the smell of Issey over fcuk by a long shot, but I don&#x27;t seem to catch as many compliments with Issey, and I wear Issey very often (still my fav).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he&#x27;s been wearing it for a couple of years.  Just smells great.  I bought this for him for Christmas.  When he opened the box, the bottle was much larger than I had expected!!  Great price!!  He usually only puts on one \\&quot;squirt\\&quot; of the fragrance and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I dont know if I should by perfumes online anymore because they dont last.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This cologne was very cheap compared to others I&#x27;ve purchased.  The bottle is plastic and is not one I would leave on my dresser.  To be honest I kindof hide it in my medicine cabinet.  The scent is nice though, very light and clean.  I&#x27;ve been told it smells like I just stepped out of the shower, even hours after I put it on.  I&#x27;d recommend this for younger people, ages 12-25. My little brother would probably like it. For reference, I&#x27;m 26 and would not buy this again for myself.  I gave it 4 stars because it was so cheap and smells decent.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this brief review by saying I own 60+ bottles and growing.  This is without a doubt the worst bottle I&#x27;ve had the displeasure of smelling.  The smell is something out of this world, it&#x27;s difficult to describe.  Imagine sour, cheap, soapy notes that are so synthetic it hurts the nose.  Man I don&#x27;t know what fragrance these other reviewers are smelling but this is aweful.  If you absolutely need an FCUK scent try FCUK Connect it&#x27;s much better scent wise, even if the longevity is poor.  I usually am pretty forgiving on my fragrance reviews since everyones nose is different but...DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.  That&#x27;s my good dead for the year.</li>
    <li> I bought this one as a gift for someone and i liked the smell so much that i kept it for me and bought something for else as a gift.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crazy!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome smell, great product. A lot of compliments from this cologne. Great price</li>
    <li> FCUK Cologne has a very nice clean scent, it&#x27;s not musky. Alot of compliments from using it, and perfect for the guy who is sensitive to colognes. Most Cologne&#x27;s leave a red irritation or rash, this cologne wont.</li>
    <li> Recipients were delighted.  Ideal selection for the season</li>
    <li> This is so far the best purchase i have made on the internet. For the price i paid the quality of the cologne and the amount of it... awesome deal , very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This one worth the money. I wear it everyday. It smells really nice, but i think sometimes it doesn&#x27;t last that long. over all I give it 4 stars because it smells great and cheap.</li>
    <li> Meets and surpasses all expectations, always a good scent. My second bottle and it is the same as my first one that was bought at the department store</li>
    <li> The scent is pretty good -when it&#x27;s first applied. After a couple of hours the scent begins to change. After about five hours the scent has dissipated.</li>
    <li> total rip off knockoff repakgd</li>
    <li> Delivered &amp; described as promised.</li>
    <li> This is a great pafum, and it is really very differente from all the others... but I think it&#x27;s better if you use it at night...</li>
    <li> my bro always use this perfume, it has a nice n attractive fragnance. I would not mind buying this again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product. Most people tell me I smell like soap. I havent smelled a soap that stinks so Im guessing its a good thing. Its my first bottle of cologne and I fell in love with it. If you dont live in new york I recommend this product. If you do live in new york please dont jk hop on the wagon.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne. I own about 10 different kinds right now, and have had probably 25 different kinds, and this is probably my all time favorite cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason is that it smells like nothing else out there. It seems that most cologne that comes out now smells just like something else out there. If there is something that smells like this, I have not smelt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets TONS of compliments every time I wear it. In fact, I get more comments on this than any other cologne, and I have greats ones like Armani Attitude, Le Male, Lacoste, Diesel, etc. Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a light fragrance, but does not seem to be a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; smell. It smells very fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot, for this price it is a steal!</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like an old guy then this is your cologne.  Save your money for something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne on two premises; 1, the name is awesome. 2, it was cheap and reasonably reviewed. First impressions are that its a cool bottle, not a bad smell but reminds me of a bar of soap. Not necessarily a bad thing but not really what im looking for in a cologne. It also doesnt seem to last the longest, I start to lose the smell after a couple hours. Im used to A&amp;F Fierce which lasts for DAYS. Im going to continue my search for reasonably priced colognes (under $30) that have a lasting scent.</li>
    <li> this smells really good. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and my gf and all her friends love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> It is barely smelled water, will not recomand to any one.</li>
    <li> My son was given this spray as a gift over a year ago. When he ran out I offered to help him find more. I looked everywhere. My daughter assured me that if It was available Amazon would have it. Sure enough I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon.  My daughter is an avid shopper of Amazon and she has made me a fan too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband really liked this</li>
    <li> Very nice and cool scent!!!!!!!!! Good for hot weather in Texas!!!! Fast Shipping!!! Totally LOVE IT!!! I would highly recommend to people, who are looking for a cologne with a cool scent!!!!</li>
    <li> love this cologne. great price!</li>
    <li> I like this cologne and so does my son.  Good price and it smells clean and more of a soft subtle smell!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so clean and so very fresh...everytime I wear it people are asking me what it is...I have to spell it though and then they have the look on their face like &amp;#34;what did you say&amp;#34;...lol  anyway...great fragrance.</li>
    <li> Best cologne ever. Great price. Tons of compliments and wanting to know where they can buy it. I tell them it&#x27;s only in England. I don&#x27;t want them stealing my secret :)</li>
    <li> Got this as a friend suggested perfume was good. While I had no issues with the perfume itself, its an okay, everyday-kind-of-perfume, the bottle it came in was quite frustrating, works more like an after shave dispenser. Got more perfume on hand than on clothes. Would&#x27;ve been much happier if the packaging was different.</li>
    <li> Favorite Cologne for men, smells good, but not too overpowering, only ever received compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I first found this cologne at my local TJMAX store. I bought it as a cheap cologne to wear to work, but to my surprise this smelled really well. I get compliments everything I wear it. The cologne has a light non overpowering smell. Although the cologne is cheap it does not smell cheap. If you like the light non overpowering smell of Curve for men or Nautica for men then I think you may like this cologne.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the price and the notes of fragrance, ordered then read the reviews. I would never wear this cologne, It is too subtle and faint smelling. It smells feminine and may smell best on a female. The seller did a great job packaging and shipping but product is inexpensive for a reason.</li>
    <li> It smells great and not over bearing; the girls at work enjoy the fragrance and seems to raise their spirits..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali&lt;br /&gt;New Port Richey, FL</li>
    <li> I enjoy the attention I receive for putting on the right amount.  So long as it&#x27;s made, I&#x27;m buying it!</li>
    <li> I have bought this cologne from local retailers and its always been very similar to CK One. I wore it and it smells awful, like grandma&#x27;s perfume, I will not purchase this again and wasted my money. I would return it, but I&#x27;ve already discarded the package.</li>
    <li> this is very good you get your money worth with this product all pro&#x27;s no cons. I will recommend this to every body.</li>
    <li> This cologne Smells amazing. Such a clean &amp; fresh scent. Very happy with the purchase and what a great price!</li>
    <li> This cologne has a unique smell that is not really like any other. It is a nice smelly cologne, that is lighter and the seller also shipped body was with the cologne. Great deal and smell for the price. Would recommend, have received compliments at the office for smelling nice.</li>
    <li> the package and the name of this product makes for a very nice gift for a guy.  the scent is also very nice.</li>
    <li> The scent actually last longer on clothing but the spraying button doesn&#x27;t work so well.. Overall i&#x27;m happy with how it smells.</li>
    <li> Outstanding customer service.  My cologne arrived, but it seemed to have leaked a bit (bottle not full).  I contacted the seller and they sent a new bottle and had me keep the original as well.</li>
    <li> great price, fast ship, its getting hard to get this scent. I guess its been discontinued</li>
    <li> great price and my wife loves the smell.........hard to beat</li>
    <li> this is what real men smell like.</li>
    <li> Going past the name that first catches our eyes, it pretty mediocre at best. It has this robust, laundry detergent smell that isn&#x27;t very appealing. The only place it was good for was the local pool, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you why.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this for the play on names for my husband. He really like the product. Has a soft smell.</li>
    <li> Not sure this is 100%. I actually have half a bottle of the original FCUK HIM but taught I would purchase another seeing I cant find it anywhere but amazon. The original has FCUK printed in the button used to spray cologne, This did not. I got this cologne from Amazon and the grey shell around the cologne had been previously opened hence not sure if this is original cologne. The shell comes apart. Had to tape it to keep the cologne bottle in place. Smells like the original FCUK but does not last as long as original. Not as strong as the original.  I was ripped off. Will never buy cologne on amazon again.</li>
    <li> A great scent that suits my needs. Its not overwhelming and works for any occasion. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Needed a cheap cologne that I can use daily going to work and didn&#x27;t smell to strong.</li>
    <li> Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Good to wear at work but not on dates</li>
    <li> This colonge smells better than I thought it would considering it only cost $15. It&#x27;s not a scent I would normally buy but it smells good. It smells clean, kind of like soap.</li>
    <li> Was looking for cologne on the cheap and stumbled across this stuff.  I figured I would give it a try for the price, and it ended up being worth the gamble...I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve since recommend it to a few friends who have also really liked it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1UEWG FCUK Him for Men by French Connection, Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was looking for! Great quality merchandise with professional and accurate service!</li>
    <li> The only reason this cologne doesn&#x27;t get a full other star is because I am being quite harsh, but when I think about it for the price, it is pretty good.  To me it smells like a walk in a park, or when you lay down on a blanket while on a picnic.  I like to spray some after getting out of the shower, makes me feel extra clean.  I get a kick out of telling people that the scent they are complimenting me on is called fcuk, too funny.</li>
    <li> FCUK Him was a holiday gift for someone special.  This is his favorite everyday scent. It&#x27;s light, clean, and not at all over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s flowery notes with a masculine core makes French Connection UK the perfect gift choice that I would recommend for any young man on your list.  It&#x27;s an extremely large bottle at 3.4 oz and you simply can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> for those of you who don&#x27;t like heavy collognes that saturate the air...buy this! I bought this for my boyfriend fro Christmas and it is masculine and light and he and I love it. He smells so good! And it&#x27;s not a heavy, overly perfumed smell (yuk). It&#x27;s just right. It&#x27;s light enough to wear during the day (which he does) and that scent stays on him all day. NICE.</li>
    <li> It has a smooth smell but it goes away in 15 mins</li>
    <li> crisp clean and very interesting in a positive way</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my brother in law for Xmas.  He loves the scent and it was a good size for a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but never found a price like this.  Great Scent, Great Price.  Thank you for the good deal.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, soft, mild yet long lasting. Its not a pungent masculine cologne. I would recommend its use for everyday at daytime in the summer.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this years ago. I was just browsing colognes online and came across it. So I bought it and I am wearing it again. I like it</li>
    <li> Clean fresh smell. Lasts decently long on me &amp; goes a long way. I&#x27;d recommend this cologne for a younger guy. Not a masculine cologne for a business man thats for sure. Good price too!</li>
    <li> Did not receive this product... been waiting for this product.  If there is a way to make sure this item arrives within the next 45 days I would appreciate it.</li>
    <li> para resumir  esta opinion , esto es pesimo y lo peor aun falso  , la caja no era la misma y la fragancia huele a detergente  de veras no invierta dinero en este disparate</li>
    <li> Smells nice, husband loved it!</li>
    <li> Ive always liked this one it smells great you just cant spray to much because it will over power you after a while</li>
    <li> i quickly tried it on when it arrived. it smells good.. wish it was stronger though. the smell didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I just love it.. the fragrance is good. I just wish the bottle came with a cap. Also the bottle was bit damaged when i received.</li>
    <li> I love the smell very fresh and sexy only problem is smell doesnt last very long i give it about two hours then someone really needs to get close to you to smell it</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne to add to any collection because it just has a completely different smell to it. However, I think that because this cologne is so different a lot of people wont like it. Personally, I think it smells a little foul. I am going to wear it today, and see if my gf likes it, but I think this cologne is all about personal taste. It doesn&#x27;t smell musky like an old man, and it doesn&#x27;t smell citrusy either. If youre going to purchase this, you are really taking a shot in the dark. I would recommend this cologne to collectors, but not so much people who want to smell nice.</li>
    <li> read the name, fcuk him for me... that&#x27;s what she&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend loves it, i like it and i cant walk somewhere with out hearing omg who is that</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my husband, I never used or smelled FCUK perfumes before, only have some clothes from them, but I am really very happy with the perfume, the price was great and the bottle is BIG!!! It&#x27;s clean and crispy, slightly spicy and sweet - not sugary or candy like sweet, but good fragrance like sweet :) It&#x27;s perfect for casual use, and bold enough for the evening. I would recommend it for men under 35-40. I would not probably buy it for my dad.</li>
    <li> This is a very light but pleasant scented cologne for men that lasts for quite a long time. It is very reasonably priced but it might be a little embarrassing telling some people the name of the cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells scrumptious!&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift and a big hit.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic price for such a reputable brand!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;m</li>
    <li> When you spray this in front of you..it smells like a laundry detergent. However, once its on you it morphs into a very clean smell....not an outdoorsy fresh linen aroma. Lot of cologne for the money too!</li>
    <li> Not too strong as expected</li>
    <li> Really bought it due to the quirky name-but it smells great.</li>
    <li> very strong at first, it&#x27;s ok. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> never smelled this before only orderd cuz  of the name and i am very pleased its a great scent will def buy again thank you .</li>
    <li> I had the problem with the first bottle that I bought. Then I contacted the seller and they arranged me a reshipping. So I got my second bottle. It was good. It smells fresh and last long. I used it just right before I went to bed. Then I waked up in the morning and I still could smell the fragrance. That&#x27;s lovely.</li>
    <li> does not last more than 5 minutes I would not suggest it unless you don&#x27;t plan on hanging out for more than a few minutes</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells</li>
    <li> I like this cologne and always get compliments on it when I wear it to work.  Nice clean, masculine scent with a little bite to it and the bottle is cool also.</li>
    <li> I smell delicious..  like  liquid candy ;)  its sweet and delicious,  if i could drink it  I would do it :P</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I hoped. The scent fades quickly. Will continue to use until it is finished but I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews so i gave it a shot. Its nice i like it and my wife likes it too, some co-workers dont mind it either makes this guy smell fresh which the ladies like lol</li>
    <li> If you have seen him on PBS you will love his book as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so trough what he is writing about,&lt;br /&gt;if we could just all get on this wagon a lot of our trouble with overweight would be gone forever.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a 2 thumps up for me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugs&lt;br /&gt;ON</li>
    <li> SENT HERS NOT HIS NOW TO RETURN IT I GOT TO RUN AROUND PAY MONEY TO FIX THEIR MISTAKE.IM SUE IT WILL SMELL GOOD ,BUT IM REALLY UNHAPPY WITH THE SENDES.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite smell but just like the review I read 2 years ago when I made the purchase it goes good in your collection for an everyday type of smell but not for special occasions etc.</li>
    <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. This has a nice light scent which I enjoy as an every day cologne. I received this as gift a few years ago and had to buy myself another bottle. It&#x27;s almost time to buy another one.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what my DH said when he opened it! Of course he was kidding....very happy with the product! Awesome scent! Sexy!!</li>
    <li> Very Strong when you put in on and last for only about half an hour and its gone would at least thing that it would smell longer but no.</li>
    <li> I liked this cologne alot and it was at a great price. Pleasure doing business with you and thanks for the cologne.</li>
    <li> This brand name cracks me up but I know they have a great style and had to give their cologne a try. I fell in love the scent and the masculine aroma it gives off. I recommend this product for a night time club/lounge event.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. It last all day and smells refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love my new cologne! It came quicker than expected and it is my favorite yet.</li>
    <li> This is a very musky scent, plain and simple. And it lasts for 2-5 hours with equally musky undertones. Not too much else too it, which I like. I was really excited to see a fragrance called FCUK, but was disappointed when the bottle only said &amp;#34;him&amp;#34; in tiny, lowercase letters at the bottom. It would have been way cooler to have FCUK in bold letters on it.</li>
    <li> Deep and Fragrant with clean notes</li>
    <li> love the smell bottle came a little damaged. but nothing to worry about.great job sending it so fast ..thanks a bunch</li>
    <li> This smells awesome on my husband! I want to eat him! lol!</li>
    <li> A little strong, but everyone says they really like it. Got the approval by the girlfriend so that&#x27;s all that matters!!</li>
    <li> Best cologne ever! Smells great</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!! Exactly as described. Highly recommend product and seller. What can I say, I love fcuk, lol. Discovered this cologne while visiting the UK and fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t complain it smells good lasts 2-3 hours and is easy to spray no issues here good price too so all in all 4 stars</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would smell really good but turns out it had a old man smell to it.  On the plus side, I am okay with my boyfriend wearing it...keeps the women away!  ha!!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome but not long lasting.</li>
    <li> It smells like a combination of Raid Roach Killer and I am not certain what but, this is a review of the product itself not the seller-</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the worst colognes ever made. I purchased this on a whim, from a nearby department store, at a very good price, and I must say I&#x27;m not impressed. The scent is reminiscent of industrial grade hand soap and laundry softener. Its a quality cologne, lasting a full work day, but with such a fragrance I&#x27;d call that a curse. Dont expect anything remotely sexy, or unique, or even attractive. For those that were complimented, I&#x27;d guess you were either fed a white lie or complimented by a family member. The scent repelled my body of critics, and they give it to me straight every time. Perfect cologne for the elderly though!</li>
    <li> This Cologne is spectacular! Not everyone may choose it as their favorite, but everyone should love it. Elegant and not overwhelming scent that last. I bought it here 4 times cheaper than when I bought my first,</li>
    <li> Disappointed👈 this is Not the scent I remember.</li>
    <li> Item came in with leakage. Sad!!!</li>
    <li> This is the one my wife love and always using when ever she has the chance.... got her the for women version!!</li>
    <li> I was exited to have FCUK perfume but it was terrible... Smells like soap water even worst. Never buy this product.</li>
    <li> When you first spray it, it might smell sort of strange but give it time and you will enjoy the pleasant odor from this cologne. I enjoyed the aroma that I got from this cologne.</li>
    <li> Must have for collectors just got a bunch of them!!!! like the original DKNY UNLEADED get them now because if or when they stop making this very good scent the price is going to be high as hell like a 3.4 bottle of the DKNY UNLEADED is $425.00 at the time of this review so trust me the scent is a beast in performance and longevity the ladies love it a lot!!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells gr8. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this cologne has such negative reviews on the net on various websites. I used this way back when it was new and quite popular in my high school. I remember telling my dad I wanted it for my birthday. I always got compliments that I smelled nice and girls always seemed to like it. After that first bottle I had moved on to more expensive colognes like armani code, 212 etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have quite a collection of colognes and you can say that I am always wondering what to try next. As I was getting bored of some of the scents in my collection I decided to search on amazon for something new to try and ran across this in my search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price it is being offered I saw no loss in adding this my order along with Bvlgari Avqa Marine. Both arrived today shipped and sold from amazon llc in perfect wrapped condition. Surprisingly FCUK him smells Fcuking great just like I remember. It has a fresh kind of floral yet clean masculine smell. I smell hints of lavender and even a slight sweetness. Yes it smells a little synthetic and &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; at first but the dry down smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts long too, I sprayed my wrists like 5 hours ago and can still smell it on me as I write this review. The bottle design looks cool and my bottle sprays perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall FCUK him is a good clean fresh fragrance. Obviously its no Gucci, Armani, Versace or D&amp;G but its not priced like them either. Its a &amp;#34;good to have in your collection&amp;#34; cologne. I recommend it for casual wear and work or daytime use. It can work as a nighttime fragrance as well although I wouldn&#x27;t use it for special occasions or dates. Great fragrance for a great price. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Whatever you do, don&#x27;t use the standard shipping method for this product.  While I love the product, I am still waiting for the order to arrive and when you look into the route it is taking, most peoples vacations aren&#x27;t this long and wide spread.</li>
    <li> Only one word comes to mind when I smelt this. Ew. My whole family agreed.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is my absolute favorite, but it has a nice light clean scent. My boyfriend enjoyed receiving this as a gift. And the price is right compared to most other related products. When I had received this the trigger appeared broken, and it wouldn&#x27;t dispense anything. I contacted Amazon, and a free replacement came very quickly. Excellent service. I think it was a one-time fluke.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne but I wasn&#x27;t able to find it go a long time. I was pretty excited when I found it for under $15, bought it immediately. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Shipped quick good smell Im good</li>
