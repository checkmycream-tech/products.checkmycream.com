    <li> These tweezers are awesome! I have lots of tweezers, but I rarely find a pair that I love... They are on the smaller size, making them fit securely and easily in your hand. the angled edge grabs the hair securely and makes the removal of the hair easy and almost pain-free...They remind me of the tweezers that my stylist uses at her salon. .I will be buying more for the teens in my house as gifts. I definitely recommend them!!! A+++  discounted for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I really needed a new pair of tweezers! I dont know how but they dull out after a while. So when I got these lord knows I needed to do my eyebrows with some good tweezers so it was time to put these baby&#x27;s to the test! I have the thickest fullest eyebrows any woman would dread! The tip on these is great! It easily gets the little hairs and doesn&#x27;t pinch me while doing so. The edge on them is wonderful and makes a great arch easy to do with the precision I need! They are of great quality and do not bend easy. The grasp is perfect and easy to hold. I really love these tweezers! Disclosure: I received these tweezers for free in exchange for my honest review. As always all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> BEST TWEEZERS I&#x27;ve ever owned. I do not get my eyebrows done in a salon b/c I have a faint scar in my right brow and never fails not matter how many times I tell the people to watch it they always make me have a bald spot... so I started shaping and doing my own brows years ago. These are easy to use, have a nice handle and an easy to grab edge. I will be throwing out all my other tweezers and using these solely. Definitely recommend...I received this item for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I have bought many pair of tweezers in my lifetime, only to get home with them and start on my eyebrows, and find they are very difficult to work with. I received the Expert Brow Shaping Tweezers by &amp;#34;Bella&amp;#34; today and I am in love with them. They are the most precise tweezers and will work in the most difficult places to reach. They are light weight and very easy to manicure my eyebrows. I have owned some that were so cheap that they actually pinch your skin which around your eye is very delicate. And by cheap I&#x27;m not referring to price, rather quality.  I think you will be very pleased with purchasing these tweezers. In my experience, &amp;#34;Bella&amp;#34; offers a great product. Give them a try, you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> Before I could use them both my mom and boss took them to &amp;#34;try out for me &amp;#34;or so they say they both then asked if they could have them as if they weren&#x27;t ordered for me!! Lol these tweezers get every little fine hair even the ones you don&#x27;t see! If your looking for a good pair .... Look no further!</li>
    <li> I have used several types of tweezers from beauty supply houses and never could find some that I actually liked that worked good.&lt;br /&gt;These arrived and I immediately had to try them out!!&lt;br /&gt;They are stainless steel and will never rust,so I was very happy with that. I used them on my eyebrows and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I&#x27;m really impressed with them and the design of them. There perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received these at little to no cost to me to provide my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I love them!!!</li>
    <li> Never used tweezers like these before!  I always bought the cheap ones at local stores but was never happy with them.  Never could quite get a hold on what I was trying to pull out.  Now I have professional quality tweezers and I will never go back to the others!  I threw them all away.  These feel well made and grasp the tiniest hair with no problem.</li>
    <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve found a pair of tweezers I can actually hold onto without them getting lost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard tweezers that are purchased from a store are silver, but this is unique because it&#x27;s black and stands out, making it nearly impossible to lose. Yay!  It also comes in this really neat plastic case that&#x27;s easy to store in your purse, on the bathroom counter, or in the glove compartment of your car. That is a total bonus for me! If you want to have fantastic brow tweezing, and believe me, I&#x27;m no expert, this is excellent because the stainless steel slanted ends are sturdy,very simple to use, and they work.  Once I removed those ugly gray hairs that were hanging around, my brows were in tip top shape with minimum effort.  Also, if you have other facial hairs that have been difficult to remove, these are the tweezers to use.  The price is also very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Bella Eleganze Expert Brow Shaping Tweezers are absolutely FABULOUS!  My favorite tweezers disappeared a few months ago.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement pair ever since.  I do believe I&#x27;ve finally found them.  The tips are nice and sharp, as I expect in a good pair of tweezers.  They don&#x27;t completely meet together all the way across the end, as I would prefer, but they do close most of the way across the end.  Tweezing my eyebrows is fast and easy because of my new Expert Brow Shaping Tweezers.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these tweezers based on the positive reviews and the price.  My Rubis tweezers have dulled and are out of alignment and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $35 for another pair.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The gripping points on these tweezers are just to thick to get underneath finer hairs and grip them.  If you do manage to grip a hair, it slips right out.  Both tweezers are going back.</li>
    <li> I lost the tweezers I had for years on a recent trip. I needed tweezers fast! These tweezers are perfect along with the price. They&#x27;re precise and sharp. They pull out tiny hairs without missing and grabbing skin. They came in a great little plastic tube and have a rubber protector for the tips. I found them easy and comfortable to hold. I would absolutely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Precise and economical</li>
    <li> Easier to take hold of individual hold to pluck.</li>
    <li> I have pesky hairs that are nearly impossible to grab with your regular rite aid brand type tweezers. I finally got some that work perfect! Easy to hold and the cute carrying case keeps them clean so you don&#x27;t end up with a breakout. When I found them offered on sale, I took the offer to grab a few for future use.</li>
    <li> I am kind of a tweezers addict. I have 5 different tweezers for different reasons, but this is my new favorite brow tweezers. First, I loved the angle of the slant. I got a pair a couple of months ago (granted, it was at a random gift shop while I was on vacation-- so I had low expectations), but the angle was all off. I did not even know that some tweezers had a different angle (I assumed it was a pretty standard thing), but apparently they do. This is easy to shape my eyebrows. I have fairly thin eyebrow hair and this can make grabbing the random hairs REALLY hard. This tweezers does the job and my brows look fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have to say as a woman I&#x27;ve owned many many tweezers, I have a collection of them, but I keep looking for that pair that gets everything the pair that you don&#x27;t have to try after the same hair over and over then pinch your skin instead. This pair is undeniably the best pair I&#x27;ve ever owned. Quality made, they don&#x27;t feel like the cheap ones, these are boutique quality. To get what you want, sometimes you have to pay just a little more, not the deal with these. Seriously, I recommend these. I&#x27;m Very happy with these!!</li>
    <li> Received  a day  before said  to deliver. Very  sturdy  heavy duty brand. Not like regular  ones ive bought from beauty  supply stores.  Ive plucked and applied lashes with  them great control n Grip.</li>
    <li> Works as great as tweezer could possibly work!</li>
    <li> This is excellent because the stainless steel slanted ends are sturdy,very simple to use.. Also, if you have other facial hairs that have been difficult to remove, these are the tweezers to use. The price is also very reasonable.They come together perfectly so you are able to grasp with no problems!  I have used a lot of tweezers over the years, from the completely useless to the half way decent. These arrived and they work so much Better than I was expecting. They actually pull the hair out on the first try. They came in a little storage tube, which should make them easier to find. They also came with a cover on the tip. This should keep them in good shape for years to come. These tweezers work great! They are made from high quality material. Try them and you will love them as well.</li>
    <li> Perhaps because it was called &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; I had unrealistic expectations.  They are ok... the tips are a bit clunky so it is more difficult to grab the tiniest hairs.  My last pair was Rubis and I loved them; they quit working.  I think I will send them in for repair/sharpening and see if that will meet my quest for &amp;#34;the best.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Sleek design and worth the money. Awesome grip on fine hairs.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever had!! Easy to use...so happy I purchased an extra one...</li>
    <li> Absolutely impressed with the quality of this tweezers! I never thought I would notice any difference from the ones I already own. I did order this one through a special deal to test it and give my honest opinion. I truly like it and it differs from others , one : it&#x27;s well finished and looks very durable to me, 2: it does grab the hair well at the first try! have you ever had tweezers that you spent hours trying to get the little stubborn hair in your chin? with this one was first try! ergonomic and feels great to the size of my hands. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Feels sturdy and made of good quality! It has a nice grip. I think it&#x27;s a great beauty investment!</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about how well this tweezer would work for me.It looked pretty good but was not sure of how well this would clean up the problem areas I have.So far so good it is very sharp and clean.It comes in a plastic tube to store it in so you do not hurt yourself if you were digging around in your purse.I always carry one with me in whatever bag I end up taking.I tested this on my eyebrow areas which is where I get ingrown hair or short stubby ones that are hard to pluck out.Especially with a dull tweezer that does not grip anymore.This one right away worked great, mh hairs were starting to grow in so I definitely got to try out how well it picks up the short hair.It does a great job and I was impressed with its performance.This is slanted, which is how I like my tweezers to be.It is comfortable to grip and hold for the time frame it takes to clean up my eyebrows.It js very precise and gets the hair I want it to get.Definitely a good quality tweezer to have for your problem areas too.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample was provided to me free or at a discounted promotion in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Slant tip tweezers are my favorite.  My daughter always steals my tweezers she has to have them in her purse, room, bathroom.  These are made durable and will definitely last a long time.  Not cheap made.  Love these.  So glad I got at a reduced price to try and these are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.  Worth the price over drugstore tweezers.  Easily grabs just the wayward hairs - even very fine ones.  The angle makes it easy to tease out just the hair you want out!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a great tweezer for my eyebrows. I like the slanted kind because it works best on my eye brows.  So when I was offered these Expert Brow Shaping Tweezers from Bella Eleganze for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about them, I definitely ordered one.  They arrived in the cutest little tube which is great because I can keep them protected when traveling. I used them today and they worked great!! I am able to tweeze the short hairs and even the longer ones. I love the precision that I get when using these tweezers. I definitely recommend these Tweezers from Bella Eleganze for anyone who uses tweezers.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows definitely look better now that I can finally grab the smaller hairs. Nicely packaged, good deal.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers! So I am a tweezing novice - I would previously get my brows done when I would get my nails done. Now, I have five kids and zero time for any of that nonsense. I was definitely getting to the point of &amp;#34;Do I try to track down my tweezers and deal with this mess myself, or drag the kids with me to a salon, or try to find a sitter?&amp;#34; I was not looking forward to tweezers. The ones I had previously were small, and never seemed to grip right. I would think I had a hair, pull, OUCH, and see that it was still attached to my face. So when I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, I figured &amp;#34;Why not? They can&#x27;t be any worse than those silver things.&amp;#34; Here are all of the things that I love about these tweezers:&lt;br /&gt;1. They are easy to grip! They&#x27;re bigger and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to hold all the way at the very end.&lt;br /&gt;2. They are easy to squeeze and hold tightly.&lt;br /&gt;3. They grip perfectly! They grab onto what they are supposed to grab (with guidance of course...) and when you yank and feel that OUCH, you can be confident that that hair went with the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;4. They come with a carrying case!! They can be tossed into the diaper bag for just in case of splinters. Tossed into the weekend to go bag. In the purse in case you may need to tweeze in the car (please don&#x27;t tweeze and drive though!). Or they can sit safely in your cabinet in their little case.&lt;br /&gt;5. They come with a tip cover thing! So when the kids grab the tweezers to chase a sibling and threaten to pinch them, you have more of a chance to grab them before the cover comes off and anyone gets pinched!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that I will ever get used to tweezing, but I&#x27;m definitely not going to start waxing at home so tweezing it shall be. At least now I have some great tweezers to do it with!</li>
