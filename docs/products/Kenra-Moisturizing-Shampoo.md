      <li>The REAL stuff is great.</li>
      <li>It was packed well and the top was taped and the bottle was in plastic, but it still leaked.</li>
      <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This shampoo is silky and smells great as it lathers gently in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I love my Kenra shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Horsetail, nettle, coltsfoot, other extracts etc, works great, smells great.  </li>
      <li>Great for normal to oily hair</li>
      <li>getting this large size from Amazon means I&#x27;m good for a year.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and love being able to order it on Amazon at a decent price.</li>
      <li>tried most of the new trendy SLS-&amp;#34;free&amp;#34; products and none of them are as irritant-free or work as well as this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Only use light leave in conditioner as this is great shampoo</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and buy it in the large size because it&#x27;s economical.  </li>
      <li>Super stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is the real stuff!!  </li>
      <li>However, I suspect that this Amazon-sold Kenra has been tampered with, because after using most of the bottle of both the shampoo and conditioner - my hair is more dry than it was before use.</li>
      <li>I love the results &#x3D; soft, manageable hair.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I have frizzy and dry curly hair that requires moisture, and this shampoo makes my hair soft and leaves me with beautiful curls.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Gets my hair clean, without weighing it down and love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I can kind of tell a difference with my hair, oddly I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use this shampoo and then straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to take care of your hair as well!</li>
      <li>I used it for years, but found other products that work better on my curly hair.</li>
      <li>I bought new products today, and am throwing this product out!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend ordering your Kenra Moisturizing shampoo from Amazon, this seller in particular.</li>
      <li>I sometimes have trouble finding it when it&#x27;s time to buy more</li>
      <li>For the extra couple bucks a year, I&#x27;m willing to upgrade shampoos to not kill my hair.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair smooth and shiny with no frizz, and does not make it limp.  </li>
      <li>(I live in a rural area), so</li>
      <li>Kenra Moisturizing Shampoo gently cleans my gray hair, leaving it soft but without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>This is a lightweight shampoo and does not dry my hair..</li>
      <li>Someone had posted that this was watered down and not the real thing and that concerned me, but I took a chance and bought it anyway</li>
      <li>Has a very mild scent, a little like the inside skin of a green banana (not the banana itself).</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Now my husband loves it for his hair as well.  Gets my hair clean, without weighing it down and love the smell.  Would highly recommend to take care of your hair as well! Someone had posted that this was watered down and not the real thing and that concerned me, but I took a chance and bought it anyway and I am glad I did.  It is NOT watered down or changed in any way.  This is the real stuff!!  I am glad I bought it AND saved money!!!  :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo is silky and smells great as it lathers gently in your hair.  I have frizzy and dry curly hair that requires moisture, and this shampoo makes my hair soft and leaves me with beautiful curls. Will definitely buy from again!</li>

    <li> Have used this shampoo for 15 years, won&#x27;t use anything else.  Great for normal to oily hair /scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil allergy runs in our familly, all sodium laureth /lauryl sulfates and their derivatives raise awful scalp welts, crack and damage hands.

    <li> I absolutely love Kenra products. My hairstylist actually for me hooked on Kenra. The shampoo and conditioner work great. They do not dry out my scalp like a lot of other products do. I would definately recommend to someone who has a dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I knew what to expect as I use this product regularly.  It was what I expected and I&#x27;m happy with the transaction and product.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and this shampoo keeps it to a minimum. No build up on my scalp. Love it and good to my hair as well. Only use light leave in conditioner as this is great shampoo</li>

    <li> Kenra Moisturizing Shampoo gently cleans my gray hair, leaving it soft but without weighing it down.  And it smells great, too.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the companion conditioner for over a year now. I love the results &#x3D; soft, manageable hair. Worth every penny. Style using the Kenra Curl Defining Cream &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> This makes my hair smooth and shiny with no frizz, and does not make it limp.  Super stuff.  This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> Kenra products are the best for haircare!  Have been using Kenra for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Kenra is a great brand of hair products.  I used it for years, but found other products that work better on my curly hair.</li>

And I didn&#x27;t even realize it until my hairdresser told me! For the extra couple bucks a year, I&#x27;m willing to upgrade shampoos to not kill my hair.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo by itself, without any conditioner. This is a lightweight shampoo and does not dry my hair.. It smells good too!</li>
    <li> I can kind of tell a difference with my hair, oddly I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use this shampoo and then straighten my hair. I have curly and each time I&#x27;ve just styled it curly with Kenra mouse that I&#x27;m not too happy with. The shampoo though seems like a good deal</li>
