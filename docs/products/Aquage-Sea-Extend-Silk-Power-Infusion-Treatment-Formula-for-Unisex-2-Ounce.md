      <li>Spray nozzle constantly gets clogged and haven&#x27;t been able to unclog it for some time now.  </li>
      <li>However, like I said, the spray nozzle clogged up after the first use and has been hit or miss since.  </li>

      <li>Now I use it about once a week or so at home and my hair is finally soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It makes the hair too soft for styling.</li>
      <li>I only need to use it once a week normally unless I&#x27;ve been swimming in the pool.  </li>
      <li>Great product, but pretty expensive for such a small amount.</li>
      <li>After using this product I can go several days without washing my hair &amp; it still stays soft without getting greasy.</li>
      <li>Smells ok, not great, the seller should have listed that the scent of this treatment is strong, especially since I use it on my hair and my hair is long and I am not thrilled with the smell.</li>
      <li>not sure if it&#x27;s optimal to use everyday, but it sure it tempting.&lt;br /&gt;Spray it in while showering, comb through your hair</li>

<li> Especially when it is a little dry from having highlights and color.</li>
<li> no difference only my hair look dry and that is not why i pay 25 dollars for 2oz for!!!!!</li>
<li> so i did , First it is too expensive 25 dollars for 2oz</li>
<li> I had a straightening treatment a few years ago and the ends are still dry and overly frizzy.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> Does not weigh hair down.  </li>
<li> Bottles seems a little small but a little product goes a long way.</li>
<li> It was a new product for her &amp; rather expensive to use on everyone.</li>
<li> I will even use a little on my dog.</li>
<li> let soak into the hair for a few minutes, and wash out.  </li>
<li> Very little comes out.  </li>
<li> So I&#x27;ve been pouring small amounts out in order to use.  </li>
<li> only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works</li>
<li> Hard to apply and see what amount is sufficient.  </li>
<li> /&gt;(I have thin, color-treated hair)</li>
<li> Difficult to use in the shower when this happens.  </li>
<li> I have wavy, frizzy hair that is in bad shape.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought it locally for twice the price, same product, way better price. Totally glad I ordered this. Saved money and time</li>
    <li> I have wavy, frizzy hair that is in bad shape. I had a straightening treatment a few years ago and the ends are still dry and overly frizzy. This stuff helps.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for my hair.  It is great on curly hair.  I use after shampoo and often by itself and leave it on.  I was turned on to this product by my hairdresser.  I simply love it.</li>
    <li> This made my overfried, starchy hair very silky and soft.  However, the entire bottle only lasted about 6 uses and I had short hair at the time.  It is, however, equivalent to many salon treatments that I have had.  I was glad I bought it, but too pricey to be used long-term.  Possibly a good solution for post-dye jobs.</li>
    <li> Boy did I need this stuff. I have extremely dry hair. My hairdresser wanted to use it on my hair and said it only takes a minute. I thought it couldn&#x27;t do much. So I was so surprise to see such a difference after one application. Now I use it about once a week or so at home and my hair is finally soft and shiny. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I got this for half as much at Amazon as they would have charged at my salon, and the shipping was free and fast. Also the product is amazing I really love what it does for my hair. I have very curly frizz to deal with and this conditioner makes it so smooth and easy to style - I love it.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. It does nothing special. I can buy other products out there that does the same thing but cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for color treated hair. It leaves my hair shinny and healthy. I use it on my hair every 3rd shampooing.</li>
    <li> Spray nozzle constantly gets clogged and haven&#x27;t been able to unclog it for some time now.  Difficult to use in the shower when this happens.  Have been using every couple days as recommended and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my hair.  However, like I said, the spray nozzle clogged up after the first use and has been hit or miss since.  So I&#x27;ve been pouring small amounts out in order to use.  Slightly disappointed as I love the Aquage line of products, especially the shine spray.  But this, I definitely will NOT be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair &amp; using this once a week in place of my usual conditioner works really well.  Does not weigh hair down.  After using this product I can go several days without washing my hair &amp; it still stays soft without getting greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is so good!  I&#x27;m not sure how it works but it makes your hair soft and smooth.  The pricing on Amazon is excellent.  I checked it out at salons in my area and the prices were double.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, but pretty expensive for such a small amount.</li>
    <li> Ive always used this product since I started coloring my hair  just that I found it at a better price at Amazon. Its great for color treated hair makes the color last and stays vibrant that much longer</li>
    <li> Saved my sanity and my hair. My hair went from dry crackle to silk!&lt;br /&gt;I would order it by the gallon if I could!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this stuff, and I love it.  It makes my thin, fine hair beautifully manageable and shiny.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you spray it.  Very little comes out.  Hard to apply and see what amount is sufficient.  No noticable results either.</li>
    <li> I use it once a week.  It really makes my hair soft and manageable.  Especially when it is a little dry from having highlights and color.</li>
    <li> The best hair conditioner but you can&#x27;t use it every week.  It makes the hair too soft for styling.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and really has improved my hair.  I use this product in the shower after I wash my hair.  It does not leave it greasy. Love it!</li>
    <li> perfect to help damaged hair!</li>
    <li> this product is a waste of money , i have great hair, full and very easy to manage but im a product junkie if i read about it i need to try it so i did , First it is too expensive 25 dollars for 2oz, ufff then i use it i have a weird reaction in my forehead , all that is ok if the product work but... let me tell you I DIDN&#x27;T no difference only my hair look dry and that is not why i pay 25 dollars for 2oz for!!!!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is awesome.  I only need to use it once a week normally unless I&#x27;ve been swimming in the pool.  After swimming I use it and it makes such a big difference. I have naturally curly hair which is normally frizzy but this tames frizz better than any other product I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> Product is very good. Container is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Had to remove total cap to get product. &amp;#34;Pump does NOT &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> Does nothing for me. Nothing exciting at all. Plus my pump did not work so I have to putz in the shower trying to get some out. Not work the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have decided that I want to grow out my very short and over processed hair.  I am trying not to trim the ends until my hair is long enough to put in a pony tail and I am almost there.  I would not have been able to disguise the dry frizzy ends without this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Makes your hair very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser first introduced me to this stuff last year - we jokingly call it hair crack.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s optimal to use everyday, but it sure it tempting.&lt;br /&gt;Spray it in while showering, comb through your hair let soak into the hair for a few minutes, and wash out.  You hair will feel like pure silk.&lt;br /&gt;(I have thin, color-treated hair)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!  I have fine thin hair that is color treated and this makes my hair so soft, but not weighed down.  I use this whenever I really need to have a &amp;#34;good hair day.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I will even use a little on my dog. It&#x27;s so softening. I have fine hair and its not to oily. Dries smooth as if I used lots of products, but just my secret one. Just use it sparingly. A little of this goes a long way on thin and fine hair!</li>
    <li> I love this hair product. I color my hair so sometimes need a little help keeping it soft and shiney, not any more!!!! I love that you only have to use this once a week. Great buy. Bottles seems a little small but a little product goes a long way. I have shoulder length hair and only use about 5-6 squirts.</li>
    <li> Smells ok, not great, the seller should have listed that the scent of this treatment is strong, especially since I use it on my hair and my hair is long and I am not thrilled with the smell. The product works great however if you are sensitive to smells, do not purchase.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by my beautician and it works. Leaves my hair shiny, silky and not greasy. The only drawback is that it does work better when combed through your hair before rinsing.</li>
    <li> Read about this product in W magazine and tried it. It is everything the mag said it was and more. Wow!</li>
    <li> the salon used this on my hair and it has helped my hair tremendously. very simple to use as well</li>
    <li> This product was 1st used on my hair by my hairdresser. It was a new product for her &amp; rather expensive to use on everyone. The salon was charging an additional $5.00 per application Being a client with very thick, curly &amp; frizzy hair, she decided to  give me a complimentary treatment. All I could say was Thank You, but, afterwards I was amazed! This product is awesome &amp; I immediately did research online to purchase am I happy I found it. Fantastic results with a single use. Shipping was great &amp; will definitely repurchase .</li>
