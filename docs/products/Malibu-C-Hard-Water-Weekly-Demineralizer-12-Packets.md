### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Best iron remover for hair.</li>
      <li>I use it with either purology hydrate, or bumble and bumble mend, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>this works great on buildup on hair from well water and was received promptly from seller.</li>
      <li>We have well water and, although we have a water softener, my hair was still turning bright orange in one spot.</li>
      <li>This is actually fun to apply and leaves my hair looking its best.</li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>This produvt is amazing.  </li>
      <li>was: what kind of water do you have, well or city?</li>
      <li>Now using these once a week or once a month (depending on your water) keeps my hair silkier and styles much better.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>The product has made a huge difference in the brassiness and quality of my hair.</li>
      <li>also the shampoo &amp; conditioner are also fantastic</li>
      <li>I use it about once every two weeks to keep my hair feeling light and clean.</li>
      <li>Noticed a difference in my hair after first use!</li>
      <li>Once a week to clear out all the well deposits from your water &amp; maintain healthy hair.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had to go back to the colorist since, they have stayed so &amp;#34;true!&amp;#34; I am SO HAPPY to have found out what was causing my hair to turn yellow and to have found Malibu Blondes products!</li>
      <li>So, who knew it could do double duty as both a beauty product and a cleaning product :-)</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>But honestly for the price suave daily clairifying shampoo got rid of more buildup for less.</li>
      <li>Great product, removes rust build-up (orange tint) from my hard water, and softens hair!</li>
      <li>Our well water really dries out my hair plus our water</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTE lifesaving stuff.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Three months later I am THRILLED to say that those highlights I paid that expensive colorist tons of money for are still there, still platinum, and still looking super natural exactly like I wanted!</li>
      <li>The FIRST thing she asked me when I told her my hair always turned yellow</li>
      <li>If the choice is buying MB products or spending $200 every two months for highlights that go bad right away, I gladly choose these!!</li>
      <li>Anyway, this product helped the shower door a lot (though didn&#x27;t completely get rid of the water spots.)  </li>
      <li>I use it once a week and after each use my hair is voluminous and soft.</li>

<li> /&gt;This is going to sound crazy</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s your water.&amp;#34; After doing some research, I found out that the water in my city is high in minerals and very hard, so I immediately bought a shower head water filter and purchased this treatment, the blondes treatment, and the shampoo from Malibu Blondes.</li>
<li> I read the other reviews, and so I gave it a try, and it did not disappoint.  </li>
<li> that won&#x27;t come off with lime-a-way or other products.  </li>
<li> Malibu C Hard Water Weekly Demineralizer is a reliable product that really seems to get the residue of hard water and hair products out of my hair.  </li>
<li> Helped to alleviate the green stains</li>
<li> I would recommend this product for anyone who has hard water.</li>
<li> If you have hard water or notice your hair with an orange tint, this is a must.</li>
<li> but you have to leave it on for at least an hour once a week.</li>
<li> I have very hard water</li>
<li> Seriously!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For years I spent boku $$$$ on platinum highlights to my naturally blonde hair every other month, only to have them fade to dingy yellow within 2 weeks. After being told by my stylist for years that my hair &amp;#34;just had too much red in it to stay blonde,&amp;#34; I finally decided it was time to find a professional (aka super expensive) BLONDE colorist. The FIRST thing she asked me when I told her my hair always turned yellow was: what kind of water do you have, well or city? When I told her I had city water, her response was: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not your hair, it&#x27;s your water.&amp;#34; After doing some research, I found out that the water in my city is high in minerals and very hard, so I immediately bought a shower head water filter and purchased this treatment, the blondes treatment, and the shampoo from Malibu Blondes. Three months later I am THRILLED to say that those highlights I paid that expensive colorist tons of money for are still there, still platinum, and still looking super natural exactly like I wanted! I haven&#x27;t had to go back to the colorist since, they have stayed so &amp;#34;true!&amp;#34; I am SO HAPPY to have found out what was causing my hair to turn yellow and to have found Malibu Blondes products! If the choice is buying MB products or spending $200 every two months for highlights that go bad right away, I gladly choose these!!</li>
    <li> Best iron remover for hair. Just follow directions!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get my brassiness out. Felt like it did wash away some of the gunk that builds up . But honestly for the price suave daily clairifying shampoo got rid of more buildup for less. Won&#x27;t be wasting my $ on this</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used. Thank you ! also the shampoo &amp; conditioner are also fantastic</li>
    <li> This is actually fun to apply and leaves my hair looking its best.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims to do but you have to leave it on for at least an hour once a week.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  I read the other reviews, and so I gave it a try, and it did not disappoint.  My hair was transformed in one use.  Seriously!  It went from dry, lifeless, heavy, and straw-like (after a year of the hard water in our new house), back to pretty normal in a single use.  I had been considering buying a whole-house water softener, but after I tried this, I think I don&#x27;t need to now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also sold in combination with a shampoo and conditioner.  Skip the shampoo and conditioner, and just use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to sound crazy but... since it works so well on my hair, I tried using it on my glass shower door, which is covered in water spots now that won&#x27;t come off with lime-a-way or other products.  I don&#x27;t think the problem is lime, maybe magnesium?  Anyway, this product helped the shower door a lot (though didn&#x27;t completely get rid of the water spots.)  So, who knew it could do double duty as both a beauty product and a cleaning product :-)</li>
    <li> Once a week to clear out all the well deposits from your water &amp; maintain healthy hair.</li>
    <li> This produvt is amazing.  I have very hard water and when I apply Malibu it competely removes the coating from my hair</li>
    <li> Our well water really dries out my hair plus our water turns my blonde hair orange.  Now using these once a week or once a month (depending on your water) keeps my hair silkier and styles much better.  If you have hard water or notice your hair with an orange tint, this is a must.</li>
    <li> Great product, removes rust build-up (orange tint) from my hard water, and softens hair! Very fast shipping!! I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> The product has made a huge difference in the brassiness and quality of my hair. I use it once a week and after each use my hair is voluminous and soft. I would recommend this product for anyone who has hard water.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in my hair after first use!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gray hair but once I received it and read instruction it stated not for gray hair.  So, I had to pay for return postage.  If it would had stated that before I purchased, I would not had ordered it.  This product is not for removing yellow from silver/gray hair.</li>
    <li> received in timely manner. exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> this works great on buildup on hair from well water and was received promptly from seller.</li>
    <li> Malibu C Hard Water Weekly Demineralizer is a reliable product that really seems to get the residue of hard water and hair products out of my hair.  I use it about once every two weeks to keep my hair feeling light and clean.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTE lifesaving stuff.  I use it with either purology hydrate, or bumble and bumble mend, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Helped to alleviate the green stains</li>
    <li> This worked wonders! We have well water and, although we have a water softener, my hair was still turning bright orange in one spot. My stylists had to dye it three times to get rid of it. Now, I use this once/wk and no orange! My color didn&#x27;t fade either. Highly recommend.</li>
