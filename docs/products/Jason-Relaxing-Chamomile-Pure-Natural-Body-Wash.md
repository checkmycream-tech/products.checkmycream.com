<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really dry skin and this is the only Body Wash I use. I am so glad Amazon carries this product.</li>
    <li> Best body wash sold. Not generally available in stores. Great price. Mild wash but plenty of suds with just a couple of squirts.&lt;br /&gt;excellent fragrance.</li>
    <li> This body wash is delightful. It lathers up beautifully with my mesh bath puff and has a light and pleasing herbal scent. It lasts a long time, because you only need one squirt of the pump per bath or shower. Extra bonus for me:  it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged well and arrived much sooner than the expected delivery date. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Good product but wish the fragrance was milder. It&#x27;s a pretty strong scent you&#x27;d have to get used to. I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances but I am tolerating it for now because it cleans well and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, un-irritated and moisturized. Works well but I&#x27;ll look for an unscented one next time.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought it would be. It has very strong fragrance. I was looking for a calm and soothing fragrance. Would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I like all Jason products but I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent. I prefer the rosewater. The spout was also damaged on arrival.</li>
    <li> Nice soap that is devoid of most (not all) of the chemicals in many of the name brands, yet still feels great.  I used to use and love Neutrogena Rainbath until someone pointed out all the border-line toxins in it. I have switched to Jason&#x27;s and have been very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The JASON Chamomile Body Wash is an excellent cleanser for in the shower or in the bath!  It lathers, but not too much and it does not dry out my skin like regular soaps and body washes do.  I love it!  It smells great and lasts a LONG, LONG time!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the product itself.. 2 stars because the scent is just way too strong. When I think of chamomile, I think of mild &amp; relaxing. If the makers of Jason can tone down the fragrance it will be more pleasing. There are other options that I do love in this product!! the herbs one is good, citrus, lavender &amp; even the rose water but I do not recommend chamomile unless u want a very strong scent!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell much like chamomile</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it makes a great lather. I&#x27;m a big fan of most things by JASON.</li>
    <li> Natural Product - Love it........Breast Cancer Survivor</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this body wash.  And, you only need one pump with one of those poufs to clean the whole body.  I really like using Jason products and will continue to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to update on this product.  It may seem pricey, but you only need to use one pump to clean the whole body.  Some other products I have used require three.  So, in the long run, this is a better deal.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent bath wash. It does not have harsh ingredients and will not dry your skin. I have used Jason body washes for several years. It does not take much to get a nice lather and the 30 ounce bottle will last a long time. I put some in a smaller pump bottle to save room in the shower and refill it as needed. The fragrance is mild, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Smells strong but good while using it. Fragrance does not cling or stay with you after showering. Floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> In Love with the smell. Excellent for sensitive skin and irritated skin (heat rash).</li>
    <li> I USE MANY JASON&#x27;S NATURAL PRODUCTS.  THE CHAMOMILLE BODY WASH, AND OTHER SCENTS, HAVE A GENTLE, NATURAL SCENT THAT DOES NOT TRIGGER MY AVERSION TO SCENTED PRODUCTS.  DITTO THE MATCHING BODY LOTIONS.  THEY DO NOT DRY MY SKIN, WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN MY DESERT CLIMATE.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive to many different soap manufactures and I will get a skin reaction almost immediately after using them. This is the only product that works for me. It leaves my skin silky soft and with no skin reaction and a leaves a very pleasant smell on your body- love it. Even my son-laws love the pleasant smell and how it feels on their bodies, which was a pleasant surprise to me.</li>
    <li> My luxury bath wash. Like to use it on occasion as a preface to a good nights sleep.</li>
