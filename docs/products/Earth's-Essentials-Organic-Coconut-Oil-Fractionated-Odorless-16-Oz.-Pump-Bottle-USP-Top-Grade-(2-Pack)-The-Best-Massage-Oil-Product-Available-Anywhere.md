      <li>I love the shape of the bottle, but I wish they are tinted.  </li>
      <li>I also mix with essential oils for medicinal use and find it to be just the perfect consistency.</li>
      <li>I use this by itself on my hands as lotion and it feels lovely.</li>
      <li>Love the pumps.  </li>

      <li>The pump made it easy to use</li>
      <li>The packaging makes mixing and using so easy.</li>
      <li>It soaks in well and is light and odorless.</li>

      <li>Even Dr. Adorable coconut oil not real.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ll buy it again along with all my other favorite oils.</li>
      <li>It goes a long way, is smooth but not greasy.</li>
      <li>This is the first massage oil I used that was completely odorless.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone interested in using natural products as opposed to store bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this oil alone but mostly for mixing with my more expensive oils as a carrier.</li>
      <li>Normal coconut oil changes with the season or temperature.  </li>
      <li>The pump bottle makes it easy to use and less wastful.  </li>
      <li>Also, it goes quickly into the skin due to the short chain nature of it.</li>

<li> i typically use fractionated coconut oil to dilute essential oils and extra virgin coconut oil for making body products and cooking.  </li>
<li> I typically use solid coconut oil and thought I would try this one.  </li>
<li> The long chain fatty acids are filtered out and what you are left with is Fractionated coconut oil.</li>
<li> I use them everyday with my essential oils for massaging for my family.  </li>
<li> Been buying carrier oil this one seems to me not real...</li>
<li> The product doesn&#x27;t have ingredients listed , I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s organic fractionated coconut oil, even  the label of this product , it&#x27;s a homemade product not real for me.</li>
<li> but it is just a matter of pushing down while you twist it on.</li>
<li> I am not sure why, but every time I use this oil my skin gets rough and itchy.  </li>
<li> The pump is a bit hard to get on</li>
<li> /&gt;However, packaging i.e. design of bottle cap is very poor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. it mixes well with liquids.</li>
    <li> Brought this twice, love it as a carrier oil for essential oils!</li>
    <li> Use it as a personal lubricant and all body moisturizer. Amazing and all natural. The long chain fatty acids are filtered out and what you are left with is Fractionated coconut oil. It is short chain and so it will NOT STAIN. This has many benefits in the bedroom. Also, it goes quickly into the skin due to the short chain nature of it. Thus, it is an ideal body oil. Finally, if that wasn&#x27;t enough, it has probiotic effects. Thus, it will not upset women&#x27;s vaginal flora and I have read is sperm friend for those wishing to become pregnant. So, as you can see this is all around a versatile product.</li>
    <li> Great price. Good product. I will definitely be ordering again!! I use as a carrier oil with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my massage business. Great carrier oil,,,no slip, Easy glide. Thank you</li>

    <li> i&#x27;m liking this.  i typically use fractionated coconut oil to dilute essential oils and extra virgin coconut oil for making body products and cooking.  however, i have been using this fractionated coconut oil as a body moisturizer all by itself and i really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll buy it again along with all my other favorite oils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist, great oil.  Love the pumps.  😊😊😊</li>
