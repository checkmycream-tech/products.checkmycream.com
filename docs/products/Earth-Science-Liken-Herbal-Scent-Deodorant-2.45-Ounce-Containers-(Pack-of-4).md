### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Love this stuff!!!!</li>
      <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t stain (like deodorants with aluminum), and after you reapply any odor goes away.</li>
      <li>This one smells wonderful and works great too.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>My hunt is over--this is a great product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s working great,</li>
      <li>Works great for me.  </li>
      <li>The toms is ok but this one is BEST.</li>
      <li>I bought this product after reading all the good reviews.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant is good for what it is.</li>
      <li>We use it also because of the good ingredients.  </li>
      <li>is the kind of product you want to purchase a crate of in case</li>
      <li>but then again, let&#x27;s be honest,</li>
      <li>This is the best natural deodorant on the market!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a healthy alternative to the supermarket stocked shelves, this is it.</li>
      <li>But this deodorant does work better than most aluminum-free ones</li>
      <li>I bought two more brands to try, unscented Toms, and this liken deodorant.</li>
      <li>I love my hippie deoderants but they often leave me smelling like a skunk cabbage by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I love the earth science unscented deodorant, but couldn&#x27;t find it in a 4-pack on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Love the fact</li>
      <li>The local co-op stopped carrying this one, so I was happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>And it really works to keep you smelling good all day.</li>
      <li>This underarm deodorant is very mild and it works.  </li>
      <li>(light house work), and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to go Aluminum Free with deodorants</li>
      <li>Luv the product and it came super quick!</li>
      <li>aluminum free deodorants just don&#x27;t work the same as the aluminum ones no matter how good they say they are.  </li>
      <li>Deodorant is working fine at this time, but we will see how it performs during the upcoming hot Texas summer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, so I&#x27;d recommend it to someone who wants a natural product and understands what you&#x27;re giving up by moving away from the chemicals.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it really works.</li>
      <li>My armpits feel relatively dry and best of all, completely odor-free all day.</li>
      <li>It melted in the hot mailbox (Houston in August), but I put it in the freezer, and it solidified just fine.</li>
      <li>By far the best non &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; out there in my humble opinion.</li>
      <li>Also, while the unscented does not sting when I apply it to my freshly shaved underarms, this one does sting.  </li>
      <li>smell fresh.</li>
      <li>With natural deodorant you&#x27;re always going to have to be pretty on top of how often you reapply it during the day in order to keep yourself smelling fresh.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the herbal scent of this particular one.</li>
      <li>Not only does it fight odor better than the rest, it actually fights WETNESS too, which is super important when you&#x27;re living in the South, I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, after having used half the first stick I either became used to my stinky self or it was working, I checked with those most likely to be honest with me, and it was working.  </li>
      <li>The real test was putting it through my weekly routine.  </li>
      <li>Also love the fact it last forever with me with daily use 4 to 5 months.</li>
      <li>So on my last trip to whole foods</li>
      <li>, it really works and actually smells</li>
      <li>If you shower daily, it really shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that there was no funky odor when I checked at night.</li>
      <li>no harsh chemicals, no body rash, no stink -</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s natural and safer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants, and this is the first one where after a long day in 80-degree F heat, I am not smelly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous other brands, but this is the only one that seems to last most of, if not all of, the day.</li>
      <li>There are literally no other deodorants, out of all of them that I have tried, that do all these things.</li>
      <li>OK, at first I was a little unhappy with the deodorant since after having just started using it, I did not seem to be getting the full benefit.  </li>
      <li>After many years of stinky pits and spending $$ on ALL big brands, products that were stong enough for a man but apparently not strong enough for me, and even MEN&#x27;S deodorant, the search is finally over!    </li>
      <li>If you want a natural deodorant that actually works, look no further.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to go natural for all my beauty products but deodorant was the last to go, simply because I don&#x27;t want to stink, and so far no natural deodorant worked for me.</li>

<li> It usually quits the next morning, but this is not an issue for me.</li>
<li> The smell of the stick itself is close to the powdery smell of conventional deodorants.</li>
<li> I have an allergy to the aluminum ingredient in conventional deodorant</li>
<li> I have tried a few others and they just combine with underarm odor and then smell terrrr.  </li>
<li> However, I have to say that the fragrance is from an added fragrance/parfum shown last on the ingredients list, but it&#x27;s powerful and emits a chemically baby powder scent that is terrible.</li>
<li> this product ever gets discontinued, I will seriously cry.</li>
<li> This one works, and the herbal smell is subtle.  </li>
<li> They all start smelling funky and weird after a few hours, not good at all.</li>
<li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
<li> I have tried two Earth Science deodorants and have not been disappointed by either!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After many years of stinky pits and spending $$ on ALL big brands, products that were stong enough for a man but apparently not strong enough for me, and even MEN&#x27;S deodorant, the search is finally over!    I have tried two Earth Science deodorants and have not been disappointed by either! This one smells wonderful and works great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants, and this is the first one where after a long day in 80-degree F heat, I am not smelly. I applied it at 6:30 this morning, and it&#x27;s 10pm, and it is still working.  My hunt is over--this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product has changed and is not the same as it was a few years ago. I was extremely disappointed. I would give it zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I love the earth science unscented deodorant, but couldn&#x27;t find it in a 4-pack on Amazon.  So, I got this one, which supposedly has an herbal fragrance.  With the &#x27;herbal&#x27; description, I was under the impression that some essential oils might have been added.  However, I have to say that the fragrance is from an added fragrance/parfum shown last on the ingredients list, but it&#x27;s powerful and emits a chemically baby powder scent that is terrible. Also, while the unscented does not sting when I apply it to my freshly shaved underarms, this one does sting.  So, if you&#x27;re looking for an all-natural deodorant, this is not the one: try the unscented instead - hopefully some seller will start to carry the fragrance-free in 4-packs.  Two stars only because it does work as a deodorant.</li>
    <li> no chemicals that clog pores, no aluminum. You will sweat, but you will not stink. By far the best non &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; out there in my humble opinion. 5 years and i have never bought anything else. wife loves it too. rosemary mint is her fav.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided to go Aluminum Free with deodorants and I was a bit hesitant because my biggest fear was smelling like I ran 5 miles while not having showered for days.  I put it on Saturday night and I worked around the house all day Sunday (light house work), and I was pleasantly surprised that there was no funky odor when I checked at night. The real test was putting it through my weekly routine.  I work in an office and while I don&#x27;t tend to sweat, my stress level does go up and I do perspire under my arms. I definitely recommend this deodorant for someone like me.  If you&#x27;re someone that rides their bike everywhere, I don&#x27;t know - but then again, let&#x27;s be honest, aluminum free deodorants just don&#x27;t work the same as the aluminum ones no matter how good they say they are.  But this deodorant does work better than most aluminum-free ones so I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant on the market!! The Liken plant scent smells like heaven. And it really works to keep you smelling good all day. I bartend and even on our busiest night it does the trick. I keep one in my purse for any just in case moments, because you will definitely have those every once in a while where you need to reapply, but they are few and far between. If you shower daily, it really shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is good for what it is. With natural deodorant you&#x27;re always going to have to be pretty on top of how often you reapply it during the day in order to keep yourself smelling fresh. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t stain (like deodorants with aluminum), and after you reapply any odor goes away. It&#x27;s one of the best natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, so I&#x27;d recommend it to someone who wants a natural product and understands what you&#x27;re giving up by moving away from the chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant since 2004. Not only does it fight odor better than the rest, it actually fights WETNESS too, which is super important when you&#x27;re living in the South, I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product ever gets discontinued, I will seriously cry. I have tried EVERYTHING out there and nothing compares to this!</li>
    <li> Luv the product and it came super quick! If you are looking for a healthy alternative to the supermarket stocked shelves, this is it.</li>
    <li> This is the only non-aluminum deodorant that has ever actually worked for me. I&#x27;ve tried numerous other brands, but this is the only one that seems to last most of, if not all of, the day. I enjoy the herbal scent of this particular one. It makes me feel/smell fresh. Also, it glides on like a dream after the first few uses; however, initially it is a little rough on the &#x27;pits.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading all the good reviews.  It does not work for me.  I get that smelly under arm odor 3-4 hours after applying this deodorant after a shower.</li>
    <li> I have an allergy to the aluminum ingredient in conventional deodorant so I have worked my way through many types of natural deodorants and spent an unfortunate amount of time smelling worse that I would like to. I had settled on the crystal deodorant before I tried this stuff--it goes on smoothly and easily, just like conventional deodorants but without the irritating chemicals or horrible yellow clothing stains (yes, those are caused by aluminum in deodorant, not your sweat!). Most importantly, it really works. My armpits feel relatively dry and best of all, completely odor-free all day. It usually quits the next morning, but this is not an issue for me. The smell of the stick itself is close to the powdery smell of conventional deodorants. I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;herbal,\\&quot; but this stuff works so I don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! There are literally no other deodorants, out of all of them that I have tried, that do all these things.</li>
    <li> I love my hippie deoderants but they often leave me smelling like a skunk cabbage by the end of the day. This one works, and the herbal smell is subtle.  The local co-op stopped carrying this one, so I was happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  It melted in the hot mailbox (Houston in August), but I put it in the freezer, and it solidified just fine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the fact it&#x27;s organic and made from plants and no aluminum. Also love the fact it last forever with me with daily use 4 to 5 months.</li>
    <li> Deodorant is working fine at this time, but we will see how it performs during the upcoming hot Texas summer!</li>
    <li> Stop looking everybody! If you want a natural deodorant that actually works, look no further. I have been trying to go natural for all my beauty products but deodorant was the last to go, simply because I don&#x27;t want to stink, and so far no natural deodorant worked for me. They all start smelling funky and weird after a few hours, not good at all. So on my last trip to whole foods I bought two more brands to try, unscented Toms, and this liken deodorant. The toms is ok but this one is BEST. NO COMPLAINTS whatsoever, it really works and actually smells GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of product you want to purchase a crate of in case they ever stop making it. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt; Just buy it folks, we gotta keep these people in business!</li>
    <li> the only deoderant I will wear.</li>
    <li> OK, at first I was a little unhappy with the deodorant since after having just started using it, I did not seem to be getting the full benefit.  Read as I was still stinky.  However, after having used half the first stick I either became used to my stinky self or it was working, I checked with those most likely to be honest with me, and it was working.  I am on my 3rd stick of the liken herbal deodorant it&#x27;s working great, no harsh chemicals, no body rash, no stink - no kidding.</li>
    <li> This underarm deodorant is very mild and it works.  My husband and I both use it.  We use it also because of the good ingredients.  Noting harmful to your body.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the only one that works even remotely well for me.  I have tried a few others and they just combine with underarm odor and then smell terrrr.  ibbbb.  leeeeee.  This works well; as a reminder; this is a deodorant and not antiperspirant, so you&#x27;re going to still inevitably have something going on in the pits that you may not enjoy but it&#x27;s natural and safer. For added coverage I often take Chlorofresh tablets, an internal deodorant from plants.</li>
