<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and it totally stopped his hair loss.</li>
    <li> makes my hair look and feel fabulous</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my hair for a couple of years now and is working well for me. The price is very good and I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> My husband has been been using this product for several years.  I think it helps with his thinning hair and leaves a shine.</li>
    <li> I already use this product &amp; like it.</li>
    <li> Love the price for amount received. I pay more that this for more than half the amount at salons. Not a knockoff. Official nioxin brand product.</li>
    <li> Nioxin works GREAT! BUT!!! I&#x27;m unsure as to how well these two HUGE bottles will work seeing as I&#x27;m pretty darn sure they&#x27;re expired!? We&#x27;ll see I guess, but, I&#x27;m unhappy with whoever the &#x27;source&#x27; was for sending me suspicious goods.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I would recommend to all for hair loss.  It helps. Please make these requirements smaller. Use all the time.</li>
    <li> When I first started to use this product my hair had gotten very thin and I was loosing my hair.  After just a few uses I noticed my hair thicken up and my hair loss slowed down significantly.  I used the other treatments products also, but I now just use the shampoo.  In order to stimulate my scalp, I just brush my hair with a bristle brush.  I have been using this product now for a number of years and it still is working. My only regret with this product is I wish I had known about it earlier.  In my experience it is a very easy and a relatively inexpensive solution to slow down hair loss.</li>
    <li> Great product that made me a believer. This shampoo will thicken your hair and make new hair grown. I started growing hair where I had lost it and that&#x27;s why I bought this product a 2nd time. Make sure to massage well into your scalp and every other day is all you need.</li>
    <li> Love this product, been using it for about a decade now.  Best deal around, will be ordering some conditioner soon.[[ASIN:B000XTFP0I Nioxin Cleanser, System 2 (Fine/Untreated/Noticeably Thinning ), 33.8 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Product delivered in a timely manner and am very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and love it. Makes my hair grow and stopped me going gray. Only sucks that if you run out you&#x27;d better get more......if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> My scalp become irritated and caused serious flaking. After 2 months, Nioxin worsens the problem and my hair is thinning even more.   My hair is thinning even more after I started to use Nioxin.The flaking is horrible too.     Now I have two problems. Thinning hair and serious flaking. :(</li>
    <li> Cleans hair better than anything else I have tried, and trust me, I have tried a lot. After washing my hair the first time I could instantly feel the difference in my hair. I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair because it does feel really nice. Just like with the scalp therapy (conditioner), at first I didn&#x27;t like the smell. It took me a few days to get used to it, and now I don&#x27;t mind it. I would love to see a better fragrance to this line of products if at all possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to write a novel, but this product works. I received it about three days after I ordered it which is amazing. I think they should have checked the cap to make sure it&#x27;s tight before putting tape on it, because one of the bottles leaked a minor bit out, not significant. Within the first couple of weeks, my hair started to feel noticably thicker. I have what you call &#x27;Widow&#x27;s Peaks&#x27; and it seems to be filling in. Also strands of hair are starting to sprout out on the top of my forehead, where my hair receaded these last few years. What else is interesting is that there is less hair being shed, which is huge. I used to have super thick hair until this stressful job had me going crazy. I feel that with this product, I&#x27;m able to worry about one less thing in my life, which is always a good thing. I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner or other products do to limited funds.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. Good price for the size.</li>
    <li> Excellant service, product was correct. will order again in the future</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve only used it for a month but the main thing I see is when I get my hair done every week like always, my scalp isn&#x27;t ichy. My scalp used to be itchy before I even left the hair dresser&#x27;s. (weird) Im pleased with it so far and maybe it&#x27;ll even get better, but I have noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product as salon. But much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Been using for years.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  Can&#x27;t tell if it is this or a combination of stuff, but I like how this makes my head and hair feel.....</li>
    <li> My hair keeps falling thinning and falling out. This product might have slowed it down a little but not enough to make a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> This product was used by my hair stylist until she stopped carrying it. I found it here and am happy to be using again. Helps keep hair full and healthy and helps with hair loss.</li>
    <li> ok, I decided to try Nioxin when I started to suffer hair thinning / hairloss and knew that to some women helped, what I can tell about the shampoo is that this is just an expensive regular shampoo, nothing else. If you want to have some considerable bucks spent on an expensive ordinary cleanser this is for you, if you bought this and/or any other Nioxin products hoping for them to help you with a a male hairloss problem, you are just wasting your time and money.</li>
    <li> Been using for years and like it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my husband by a barber.  My husband has cancer and was losing his hair so we thought we would give Nioxin Cleanser and Nioxin Conditioner a shot.  It did actually slow down the loss of his hair.  Although he has lost a lot of his hair, he still has enough where it looks healthier.  He does not seem to be losing hair like he was before Nioxin.  I, on the other hand have thinning hair and by using the Nioxin Cleanser and Conditioner, I believe it has promoted new hair growth.  My hair is fine and it was thinning on the center of my head so I began using Nioxin.  I could tell after a few shampoos that my hair was looking better, it looked healthier.  After shampooing, my scalp always feels stimulated and just plan good.  Now I can see where it made my hair healthier, shinier, and thicker.  So give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and still see no progress at all. I&#x27;m going to go try Bosley now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in it but it seems to be working. Husband loves it and is the only sibling in the family who still has his hair. Can;t guarantee it is only this shampoo but we aren&#x27;t taking chances. We will use it until we can&#x27;t find it on the market any longer. As for me, it has a great consistency and washes out the oils and dirt better than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and this works great.  I highly recommend this product and really would recommend that you get this.  It has helped prevent hair loss.  If it is gone, then expect miracles.  It works for thinning hair.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. Good price.</li>
    <li> I like the product since i first started using it . It is a bit pricy when you buy it in a package but I found this size for much cheaper. I am happy with the product bc my hair feels clean. I&#x27;ve had this products forover 3months already. It will last you a while.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my cosmologist recommended for me for hair loss.  The meds I take and my age causes me to lose too much hair and I am told this helps to restore hormone to the hair folicles.  Anyway it works.  After heart surgery, I almost went bald thereafter.  In fact, I bought a wig but then I started using this and stopped the hair loss and regained enough hair growth I gave up the wig.  However, one has to use it all of the time and it is fairly expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my fiancé... He loves it!!!! Its great because it deep cleans the hair and makes your scalp feel fresh and clean... I use it too once a week to deep clean my hair. Huge bottle for price...</li>
    <li> my husband loves having this back again. he has used it before and it makes his hair softer.</li>
    <li> Feels like it works, I&#x27;d say..&lt;br /&gt;I just believe that it&#x27;s better than just regular 3-5 dollars shampoo from a drug store.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really feel it works for sure, or great but it&#x27;s still alright to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the second bottle.</li>
    <li> made hair feel like straw and &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; and by the next day was limp and oily!</li>
    <li> I have thin, baby fine hair.  I am post pregnancy number 2 and on Coumadin.  My hair never fell out with #1 like it is now.  Handfuls in the shower, filling my wide tooth comb with one use, and my child is constantly complaining he has \\&quot;mommy hair\\&quot; in his mouth.  I have bald spots where a man would start his residing hair line.  I can see to my scalp over the majority of my head.  It&#x27;s awesome.  The second wash, no hair was dripping from my fingers.  My sink is more clear after brushing.  My hair still comes out with washing, but not every wash has gobs of hair in my hands.  Short hairs are growing in my bald spots.  I&#x27;m not cleaning my brush and comb after every use now.  At the very least, it slowed the loss.  At the most, it may have helped regrowth.</li>
    <li> Foams instantly, cleans thoroughly, enlivens scalp, rinses out completely -- an all around great shampoo that is sold for three times the cost in shops</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin shampoo for over a year and have experienced a thickening of my hair. I have added the cream rinse to my routine.</li>
    <li> My hair are very oily, it used to get very itchy and have a lot of hair fall along with the follicles. After using this cleanser for 2 weeks. The hair fall has reduce, the itchiness has stopped and don&#x27;t see any hair follicles falling with the hair. I am a happy man.&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that my hair have become a little thicker in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle gives great value. I have a smaller bottle for travel / gym etc.&lt;br /&gt;Use this product consistently and it will show results. There are no quick fixes in this world, all good things take time...it is the law of nature...</li>
    <li> Excellent vendor.  It is too early to tell but the Nioxin cleanser system2 shampoo alone seems working.  Not sure if I still need to use it with other 2 treatment products or not.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is the same as what I bought at the local store.  It&#x27;s a different color, and smells different.  I&#x27;d have to recommend buying from another source.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, when he was only 16 years old.    Hair loss runs through his dad&#x27;s side of the family and he has the same type.  I noticed his hair line receeding, and said, \\&quot;No, you&#x27;re not loosing your hair!\\&quot;  I had been told about this product from an old lady, who had a beautiful head of hair.  She said it was because she used Nioxin for years!  I took her advise a she was right!  My son is now 20, and while using this shampoo he grew new hair all over his head, his hair feels thicker, and the receeding has stopped! He is currently living in China and asked me to send a new bottle.  He is definitely a lifetime custmer!  As a mom, I&#x27;m thrilled I was able to find the answer!</li>
    <li> My hair still feels dry and brittle after using this product for two months. Waiting for some positive effects.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, but my hair loss increased. No miracle cure for me! It is also full of chemicals. I want to try something more natural.</li>
    <li> The first month I used it, I noticed a tingling on my head.  It has gone away since.  Not sure if that was stimulating the follicles or what . . . either way - it&#x27;s a great shampoo on it&#x27;s own.  Smells really good.  Haven&#x27;t noticed anything with my hair... I guess that&#x27;s good?</li>
    <li> This cleanser makes my scalp feel cool and tingly. Leave my hair clear with out a heavy oily feeling. My husband and I love it for our fine thinning hair. We were so glad we found it after using many other products. It is spendy but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My wifes hair had thinned after some nucleur radiation and my son told us he and his wife use Nioxin and their hair is softer and fuller and I got it for my wife. She likes it quite abit and it is to soon to tell if her hair is coming back.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I have been using this product for the last 4 years and will continue until they stop producing it.</li>
    <li> The cleanser cleans the DHT from your scalp. You have to stay disciplined for it to have any effect. This will not completely stop the male pattern baldness, but it will slow the process. In some cases it will stop it altogether. I have been able to keep hair on the top of my head for almost 13 years. It&#x27;s not like it was at 27, but it isn&#x27;t gone. At the rate it was going I should be bald as a billiard ball by now.    No product is the perfect cure all. And until they find something that is, I&#x27;ll stick to my Nioxin so I will still have hair left to save.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 35 days, however, it seems there is significantly less hair in my brush -- even in this short time. I know hair loss is seasonal, and depends on many factors beyond shampoo and conditioner used. However, I believe this product actually works! Both my wife and I have long hair which has always been very fine. Both of us now use Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner. We do not know if we are both experiencing less hair breakage, or if fewer hairs are being pulled from our scalps when we brush our hair after washing. We awarded four stars because we are seeing a difference in hair loss, if not fullness. We suggest you try the Nioxin System as we have. We will update our review after 90 days using Nioxin. So far, we are realy impressed!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000XTFP0I Nioxin Cleanser, System 2 (Fine/Untreated/Noticeably Thinning ), 33.8 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for years and am completely satisfied with the results.  For maximum benefit, I leave it on for about 2 minutes and massage thoroughly into the scalp.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at good price compared to purchasing it at a local retailer.</li>
    <li> My husband needs something to help with the hair loss.. this is our fourth bottle and he say it has been helping.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, started using Nioxin 10 years ago at age 30 when I noticed hair in my hands after shampooing and noticeable thinning up front. 10 years later I have a full head of hair. Ideally would have started using it at age 20!</li>
    <li> I lost my hair from major weight loss. My husband found this product at the store and talked to the pharmacist, who said it worked real good. Two months later, I had little hairs sticking up everywhere, it grew back thicker than I ever had. I LOVE MY HAIR</li>
    <li> I found out about the Hinoki system that you can purchase through selected salons and I found a website that had a great price on the 3 piece system. Once I stopped Nioxin I really started to notice a big difference in a few weeks. Hinoki has the shampoo, conditioner, and spray neutralizer for your scalp and I just got a bottle of their hair thickener. Just take a very small amount after you shampoo &amp; cond and appply. You will start to notice a big difference. My stylist turned me on to it and is brilliant at re-growing hair especially if it&#x27;s thin. If you are in Dallas, go see Trent at Salon Botique in North Dallas.</li>
    <li> This is the best place I can find this shampoo for my husband!  I get twice the size for half the price of salons.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Came quickly with out any problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for two years and I must say it is well worth the money. A large bottle lasts a long time, it definitely provides you with fuller hair, and there are not a lot of products out there that you can&#x27;t say that for. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It works. Hair looks thicker after 4 - 5 bottles used.</li>
    <li> Does it work - too early to tell, but I  think so.  I was getting a lot of shedding when I ran my fingers through my hair.  It seems to have dropped off a lot after using this for a couple of month.  I plan to stick with it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. We&#x27;ll pleased.</li>
    <li> This has helped slow hair loss for many years. Great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product well priced</li>
    <li> Causes scalp itching to diminish, but does not seem to have the same level of hair restoration as it did previously.  I believe all the rumors of a change in formula are accurate since Nioxin was purchased by some large conglomerate.  Somewhat fraudulent for a company to take such action, but no great surprise.  Lost my business.</li>
    <li> I have always had bald spots and this has helped me alot.  i would encourage anyone to use this system for thinging or balding spots.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair thinning much worse than it was before. I tried using it for about 3-4 months, and every time I used it, I would always notice that a few hairs came off my head when I was rubbing the shampoo in. This never happened before or after using it. Now my hair looks much worse than it did before I started using this stuff. I would not reccommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and though it does not thicken your hair strands,  I have noticed my hair is filling in, and the price is great I had been paying twice what you sell it for.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> A hair dresser told me to get this...my hair was dry and falling out alot. Day 15 and hair has stopped falling out and  not at all dry. Love this. It&#x27;s staying on my wish list so I can reorder fast. I also use the scalp treatment conditioner and booster. You just can&#x27;t beat it. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for hairloss.  Totally worthless, unnatural product.  Makes scalp burn.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for someone else and just heard back from them today. Unfortunately, they stopped using this after 1st attempt since it resulted in bad burns on the scalp and forehead. Not sure if the product had gone bad since the user has tried this before and liked it. Return is not an option since the user is in a different country. Not my own experience but just a fair warning to others since I noticed someone else left a comment about it burning. Bummer since this was not a cheap product :(</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this to me years ago after I had surgery and alot of my hair fell out (she told me this was pretty common). I&#x27;ve been using it ever since, as has my husband. I&#x27;ve always had fine, thin hair and I think this definitely helps. It really seems to work well for my husband. His hair is also fine, but he has alot of it still at 53. He once grumbled about how much I was spending for a bottle of Nioxin, that he would be happy just using bar soap on his hair. The hairdresser that was ringing me up told him he probably still has hair because I buy Nioxin. That was the last time he said anything!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years on the recommendation of the woman who used to cut my hair. I don&#x27;t seem to balding as quickly as I was prior to using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  My hair is still coming out at the same rate.  Not sure if this product has made any difference or even if it could since I think this is a hormone related issue.  I am just concerned that it causes MORE shedding when I use it instead of less....</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair, or very fine hair, this is the product. It is much more reasonable than the high-priced brands, and does every bit as good a job!</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile back, about 6 months ago. The first month or two using it I didn&#x27;t really notice anything. Back then my hair was definitely thinning out, even my hair stylist mentioned it during haircuts. 4-5 months after using it my hair is much thicker, and once again my stylist has noticed without me even bringing it up. Whether it is the Nioxin or not, we&#x27;ll never know, but if anything I think it helped a lot. My hair seems to be thicker (individual strands) and have more weight and volume to it. Take note that I say it \\&quot;seems to be\\&quot;, because I have no proof. Even Nioxin on the bottle advertises that 9/10 people \\&quot;perceive\\&quot; thicker hair after using their product for awhile. All I can say is, this combiend with the scalp therapy works great, at least for me, and after 4 months my bottles ran out and now I&#x27;m buying another round.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does help your hair grow thicker. I noticed a difference within a month, and so did others.</li>
    <li> Read lots of reviews before trying.  Its been six month and no difference between this and any other shampoo.  I think this is really a lot of hype and it&#x27;s not worth trying.  Is there any proof, any study, that proves that this product is working ??  I don&#x27;t believe so, that should prove you something : this is a placebo.  Well it&#x27;s cheap for the quantity you get so all in all ...  But don&#x27;t expect anything.</li>
    <li> nioxin is the best shampoo for people w/thinning hair.  it really does work.    and, this particular seller was very nice and professional.  stephanie</li>
    <li> This cleanser really works,my hair is much thicker and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I receive compliments all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Family and freinds want to know just what have I done to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;They say &amp;#34; it looks great and healthy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp has improved as well and hair loss has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> You cant beat it for the price. Salons in my area try to charge more than this product is worth.</li>
    <li> This product does work.  My son has been using this for over a year with other Nioxin products.  He does show some new growth at the hairline.</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail shampoo.  A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a thyroid condition, which caused me to lose alot of hair. Since then, I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos/conditioners, and I have always returned to the Nioxin set.  I don&#x27;t like their leave in scalp treatment but I do like their cleanser and conditioner alot.  My hair sheds less and is more manageable.  I&#x27;ve tried other hair products to help with hair loss and I feel like this one works better than the rest.  I always buy the big bottles from Amazon, because it is the best value. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this for 3 months, although it volumises, Im yet to notice hair growth. Lemme try another bottle and wait for the result.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommend this to me four years ago when a medication made a lot of my hair fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair feel and look fuller.</li>
    <li> I have been using this system for a couple of years and do not notice a lot (if any) new hair growth. But I do notice the thinning has slowed (almost stopped). Who knows why but it is a big coincidence that it slowed about the same time I started to use Nioxin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 10 years now, and I still have my hair LOL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year.  From what I see, it&#x27;s stopped the recession.  I am not losing my hair anymore, however I am not gaining either.  If you want to keep what you have, then maybe it will work for you as it has worked for me.  I still follow the directions exactly and I only use the Shampoo and the Conditioner.  The foam stuff irritated my head and made it look like I had a rash.  I stopped using that foam application when it did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!  Cheers!</li>
    <li> I have used this along with the scalp treatment and scalp therapy for about seven years. If I use it every other day my have doesn&#x27;t fall out like it did. However, there has been no new growth</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who a receeding hair line and thinning on the top/front of his head. I have mixed feelings on this product. I actually cut my husband&#x27;s hair myself and I noticed that within the first three months his hair did feel much thicker on the back part of his head. It was and still is very full. I am just disappointed that the hair on the top of his head hasn&#x27;t shown the same results. In fact he&#x27;s been using this cleanser with the conditioner for 7 months now and the hair on the top of his head has thinned even more. I don&#x27;t think this is a result of the shampoo/conditioner though. I am sure it is attributed to hereditary genes and stress. I had just hoped it would at least stop the thinning. The nice thing is that this 33.8 ounce size lasts a long time. He is still using the bottle that I bought 7 months ago. Would I purchase it again...? Yes. It is working on the hair on the back of his head and it&#x27;s better than anyting you&#x27;ll find at the grocery store. Just don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> This product works good. It is not going to stop you from losing your hair but it will keep your scalp clean and the hair follicles from plugging up with oil.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the feeling it has on your scalp when applied and the cost..........I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair</li>
    <li> Unlike the earlier reviewer, I have had extremely good luck with this product.  My barber recommended this product to me, and I have been using it for just over a year.  I don&#x27;t have the hair that I did when I was 20, but I do have very noticeably fuller and thicker hair.  It isn&#x27;t just fuller and thicker on the back were most hair products work, but it has even given me more along the my previously receding front hairline.  I just read the earlier review when I was getting ready to place my fourth order and thought the product deserved an opposing view.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but if you use keratine in your hair, cant use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, my husband and I have been using it for 4 or 5 years. The feel of my hair and his has changed texture. My fine hair has gotten thicker. I don&#x27;t feel like mine has thinned any more.</li>
    <li> Positive purchasing experience</li>
    <li> This stuff is now junk.  Used to be great but they changed the ingredients. Maybe bought out by another company. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo exclusively for more than 15 years.  There is nothing else like it.  It has a wonderful minty aroma that wakes me up every morning.  You have to try it and experience it for yourself.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders for my wife&#x27;s hair, very little of it comes out in her brush after using for 2 months.</li>
    <li> I have found that with my bald thining hair, it does help, and add the hair drops to the scalp for Xtra help, I am glad to get this back in my shower. Been using it for 4 years now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for 15 years+.  Now it is manufactured in Mexico, the formula is&lt;br /&gt;not the same, and my hair is like straw. My hairdresser has told us all to never use this&lt;br /&gt;again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD BAD....not Amazon&#x27;s fault, it is the manufacturer...terrible!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works, just don&#x27;t rush it. If men would just give this time and you do not have male-pattern baldness this will work for you. I use this and Rogaine and my frontal hairline has completely grown back.</li>
    <li> Great product. Has helped me not thin anymore. I have been searching for the right product and this helped a lot.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 3 years.  Still have hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for a number of years and seems to do the trick for me. It cleans my hair well and seems to be working well in slowing down hair loss. Plus my hair feels and looks healthy (my hairdresser comments on it often).</li>
    <li> I have been I have been using it for years, it seems to be working and the price  better  then in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for years, although actually I couldn&#x27;t tell you why. It is supposed to reduce hair loss, but in my case I can&#x27;t say that it actually has. Would I have lost more hair had I used to some other kind of shampoo? I really can&#x27;t say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand used to have essentially one shampoo and one rinse. Now it has so many different levels and products that it is impossible to keep track of which is best for you.</li>
    <li> Longtime user of nioxin, but found out (along with a lot of the reviewers here) that nioxin was bought out by proctor &amp; gamble and the ingredients for the shampoo have now changed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really dislike the fact that when a great small product gets bought out (ie. kind bars, honest tea) by a larger parent company, immediately the larger company changes the ingredients to make it more diluted, processed, and ultimately cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;new nioxin formula is not as good as the old and does nothing to remove &amp;#34;DHT,&amp;#34; which was the whole unique marketing angle of the original product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no longer will be using nioxin. 2 good alternatives are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura D’or Organic Argan Oil Anti Hair Loss Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;HairGenesis Anti DHT Shampoo</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products. Strengthens and manages hair so well. Have used it for years. Will order again. Thanks</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does make my hIr appear thicker!</li>
    <li> Used for over 15 years. Works great and really does delay and minimize hair loss. Very effective cleanser. Leaves hair very clean and workable.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it was for thinning hair.  I use it along with the Scalp Therapy 2.  I just started using it and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, but my hair is easier to handle.</li>
    <li> Turns out, if you dye your hair and dye your hair and dye your hair and live life by the motto &amp;#34;Whatever. It&#x27;ll grow back&amp;#34;, your hair WON&#x27;T always grow back. Combine all of that stress on my hair with internal anxiety and stress, and it was pretty obvious why I had a thinning spot on top of my head. You could see my scalp in pictures, which I found to be mortifying, especially in the age of Facebook, when your photos are everywhere. I was getting married in a year; something had to be done before then! Enter my delightfully blunt hairstylist who told me that I needed to use this product. She sold me the shampoo and conditioner and told me to use it &amp;#34;religiously.&amp;#34; I did, and well before my wedding, I could see a difference. My hair is thicker (although it will never be as thick and glamorous as it was before I dyed it to death), the balding spot is mostly gone, and my friends have complimented the product for doing such a great job. It smells great too, which is a bonus. (Conditioner smells like anise; shampoo smells like eucalyptus. They smell good combined, which I wouldn&#x27;t have thought.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note of how good this product is - when I told my aunt, a breast cancer survivor, that I was using it, she exclaimed, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s what the doctors told me to use when I was going through chemo! It made my hair grow back even better than before!&amp;#34; So there you have it. Good for people who willingly abuse their hair, and good for people who unfortunately have to abuse their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Full disclosure: Same review as Nioxin Conditioner)</li>
    <li> We have a family member with thinning hair and the stylist recommended this brand of shampoo.  I had been buying it at the hair dresser&#x27;s, in a MUCH smaller bottle for almost the same price.  Not sure what made me think of Amazon, but I&#x27;m glad I did!  I bought 2 bottles (for an inventory...) and had a pump that fit that size bottle so that it can be dispensed with a squirt.  We&#x27;re happy.</li>
    <li> Same product as purchased at local stylist at a lower price</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo</li>
    <li> I cant believe I got this size for the money. Goood stuff,makes hair fuller for real and let you keep what you have. Great.</li>
    <li> Great scent to the shampoo and it does leave my hair feeling fuller.</li>
    <li> Been using Nioxin for years. I have oily hard to clean hair. This is the only product that cleans well with just a small dab. Leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now.  My hair was thinning pretty quickly and Nioxin has at least slowed it down significantly.  I would recommend this for anyone who is concerned with their hair thinning.</li>
    <li> Made my head really flaky!  I mean Christmas snowing.  Formula has changed or soemthing.  I&#x27;m going to try Bosley instead, hopefully that doesn&#x27;t flake like crazy either.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin products for over ten years.  I would give it ten stars if i could!  I recently ran out and had to use other shampoo because I was traveling and my head just didn&#x27;t feel clean.   As for hair loss, I think it has helped prevent additional loss, but for me the most important part is my head and hair always feel super clean using Nioxin.  I have let friends try it when they are visiting and people always comment on what nice shampoo it is.  Highly recommended, I&#x27;m about to buy more!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by the woman who cuts my hair.  I&#x27;m 64 and have always had thin hair but with aging I lost close to a third of my volume.  This product makes my hair seem fuller without the weight and keeps my scalp feeling stimulated.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than five years and am very pleased with it&#x27;s cleaning and performance results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and the price is great with this Amazon vendor.  We only use the Cleanser, because even my hair dresser says that the conditioner is unnecessary, and just an added expense.  I use regular conditioner and still get great results and it keeps my hair growing back in where it otherwise starts thinning.  Nioxin works better than any of the other products my husband and I have tried!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel soft and shiny and very clean.</li>
    <li> Been using this shampoo for 20 plus years.  I stll have a head full of hair where my dad and all of my uncles didn&#x27;t.  I think this shampoo helps and I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> It is a good shampoo for my son&#x27;s thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 5 years ago.  I was loosing clumps of hair and it dramatically slowed my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have fine hairs. I wish that this shampoo helped my hair at least look good. But, it is not working at all. It makes my hair so dry.</li>
    <li> This shampoo I received was not the actually Nioxin shampoo. It was either watered down or a different product in the bottle. Terrible!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great service.</li>
    <li> This product has helped thicken and make healthy my extremely thinning hair.  Results are not immediate but over the past year the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my scalp feel clean. However, my hairdresser says it strips too much from the hair.</li>
    <li> I have started using this product a few years back. I was happy that it worked very well and I saw little to no hair in my hands in the shower and on the bathroom floor. Even hubby used it. Then I blissfully bought some more through Amazon. I never expected it to be a different product to the original. I used it and my hair started falling out as if I was using regular shampoo. When I went back to read the reviews I was shocked that others found the same issue due to formula changes. How can the seller pass this stuff off as the real original product, I wonder? Well my search was on for a new product and I knew the only way I would find it, is if I read reviews and ingredients list and tried it if it was affordable. My latest purchase was Avalon Organics Shampoo and Conditioner, Thickening, Biotin B-Complex, 14fl for 5 dollars something. I am happy to report my hair is not falling out as much as it did with the fake Nioxin. I do not believe it will make my hair regrow (that would occur naturally), but it helps keep the hair I have. I have just started using it a couple weeks back so I have to see how long the results last. I am not being paid for this review. I am just a happy Avalon user and I want to let other people know about it because I know firsthand how devastating hair loss can be.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for years, I think its the best shampo out there for people with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> While this product did make my hair seem more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;... it also caused my forehead and face to rash via allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up as well as the item I buy at a beauty supply store. Not sure if this is a knock off or why it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gotten in the past at my near by beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle worker or anything, but have been using for about a year and myself and others have noticed a difference. The hair loss has slowed if not stopped completely.</li>
    <li> I finally decide to try a blunt cut on my short hair because I needed the volume.  I use Nioxin regularly and cannot believe the difference it made.  Two weeks after my new cut, I went back to my hairdresser and said &amp;#34;I have too much hair!  Where did it come from?)  Seems she uses Nioxin also and was not surprised at my success.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this because it really dried out my hair. You need some intense conditioner for this stuff, and I was using the conditioner that comes with this system. It was not enough conditioning.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for almost 2 years now.  I was skeptical about whether or not it would actually work but it really does!  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker and it doesn&#x27;t regrow the hair but it does make the hair thicker which gives the pretense of regrowth.  My husband had noticeably thinning hair right on the crown of his head but since using this product, it has improved to the point where I can hardly tell the thinning area from the rest of his head.  It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy this product here on Amazon versus a salon so I definitely recommend this.  He uses this in conjunction with the conditioner and the scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have started noticing my hair appearing thicker.  I use this with the conditioner and the treatment.</li>
    <li> I originally tried this product at about 4x the price at the insistance of my hair stylist at hair cuttery. Much to my dismay, my hair had been falling out since early college and every trip to the hair cuttery ended in me paying $14 plus tip to hear how my hair will continue to fall out and I will be bald and fat (somehow I would gain weight too) if I didn&#x27;t buy this miracle product, Nixoin. That was about two years ago and when I first tried it, it seemed like it may have actually slowed my hair loss a bit. Since Amazon had a great deal on this sized bottle, I bought it. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually stopped me from losing hair, but if anything, it stopped the hair cuttery people from nagging me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;- Certainly makes my hair feel cleaner&lt;br /&gt;- May or may not actually make hair look fuller&lt;br /&gt;- Stops hair cuttery woman from nagging me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a lot more expensive than Pert Plus&lt;br /&gt;- Your friends from high school will mock your choice of buying fancy shampoo</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. This was recommended by our stylist and it really works. He now has hair growing back.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo after an illness caused some hair loss.  Since I began using it, I am losing less hair and enjoy the look and feel of my hair.  The scent of the shampoo can put off some people during application but I find that it doesn&#x27;t last once the shampoo is rinsed out.  I also use the conditioner along with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Just kidding.  You don&#x27;t need to be a farmer or have thinning hair to love this product.  As a teen, I had the privilege of working in agriculture.  I absorbed a good work ethic, but also absorbed some stink into my hair on a daily basis.  Years ago, this was  my favorite shampoo because it absolutely got rid of the farm smell when the days work was done.  When the sun set, my friends couldn&#x27;t tell/smell that I was a farm girl by day!  The shampoo is minty in fragrance, however the shampoo is not just to cover up smell.  The function of the shampoo is basically to cleanse away sebum (sebum is the oily, waxy stuff that is excreted our pores and hair follicles).  By removing built up sebum the scalp is clean and fresh.  With fresh and clean hair follicles your hair grows better!  It&#x27;s been a few(ha!) years since my farm girl days.  Recently when my husband noticed more than the normal stray hairs on his pillow in the morning, I remembered this shampoo.  We started using the Nixon system again in efforts to keep our hairs on our heads and to keep our manes looking thick.  We enjoy the shampoo.  It&#x27;s a subscribe and save item in our house.  It only takes a small amount for a great lather --- this large 33.8 oz bottle of shampoo lasts four plus months with two adults using it daily!  Enjoy being so fresh and so clean clean!  I have a new (june 2014) and old bottle of this shampoo and I really can not tell the difference in function between the \\&quot;New formula\\&quot; and the \\&quot;original\\&quot;  --It&#x27;s the same stuff to me, and I&#x27;ve been around the product for 10 plus years.  I also, do not chemically color my hair- maybe the \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair is part to blame for the success in our use of the product??</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great, it smells a bit like medicine, but it has a tingling feeling when on your scalp.  I feel that it works to clean my scalp of oil etc.  I&#x27;m not so sure about thickening my hair at this point, but I continue to use it due to the tingle and clean scalp feeling.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Deep cleans to remove sebum build up.  Good to use everyday</li>
    <li> Using this along with taking medication. I think I can tell a difference. Jury is still out. I know that I see less hair falling out in my hats and sink.</li>
    <li> I had hoped it would give some volume to my thin hair but it doesn&#x27;t.  In fact it sticks to my head, and seems to make my hair even finer, won&#x27;t hold a curl.  Honestly I would stop using it except suddenly after only about three weeks I have &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34; coming out of my bald spots on my head.  I was shocked.  I have huge bald spot all over my head and have tried everything there is and nothing has worked.  I am going to continue using this shampoo and pray those whiskers grow.  I think the Nioxin cleaned all the follicles out and there was actually hair waiting to come out.  I also was going to give up because it seemed like my bald spots were getting even bigger and my all the hair on my head was thinner.  Then I read some of the blogs of people who said during the first few weeks it is normal to loose some hair, the old dead hair was being cleaned out.  So I am going to continue and hope the new hair that comes in will replace the old and I will finally have hair again.  Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for fifteen years. It works!</li>
    <li> Keep your hair looking full and thick. Plus I also like how clean it makes my hair feel after but be sure to only use it in small amounts especially in areas where its thinning the most like the back etc.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo along with their conditioner (scalp therapy) for more than 12 years.  Prior to use, I was loosing hair at a fairly rapid rate.  Since I have been using it, I no longer seem to have lost any hair and possibly there is a little more on my scalp than when I began with it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does make my hair feel and appear fuller, Am pleased with it.  I didn&#x27;t like the conditioner or scalp treatment that I also tried, but will continue to use the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I not only have very thin hair I also have sensitive skin. If there is any scent in a shampoo I itch and develop excema spots on my scalp. I have not itched or had any issues since using this. It is a little more expensive than some but so effective it will remain my shampoo of choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin shampoo for years now at the advice of my beautician. I love its clean peppermint fragrance and the way it cleans efficiently with just one washing. I always buy it in the 33.8 oz bottle and use that to fill up the smaller bottles and travel bottles. I find other shampoos to be cloying in smell, greasy, or drying, but for me, Nioxin works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin shampoo and hair conditioner for over a year, and although it doesn&#x27;t promote hair growth it definitely cuts down on hair loss. I use Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair 3 and Nioxcin Scalp Therapy for fine hair 3. I believe the 3 is for chemically treated hair, and it definitely works!&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use it the smell might take getting use to as it&#x27;s a peppermint smell, but quite honestly the smell does not stay on your hair and now I find it rather refreshing. My husband used it once and didn&#x27;t like the smell, but he should have stuck with it because I have your normal hair loss that everyone has whereas his hair loss has increased unfortunately for him. I won&#x27;t use anything else and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results! Try it because what do you have to lose - certainly not your hair if you&#x27;re as fortunate as I have been with Nioxin products!&lt;br /&gt;This product is recommended for people who may be losing hair or just want their haor to stay strong and healthy for as long as possible. Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Very good price and love the shampoo</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem the same.</li>
    <li> Pleased with results obtained and with the price.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks it is excellent.</li>
    <li> The product does not thicken my hair and leaves it dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery of the product was disappointing in that it took 7 days when I expected it in 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay</li>
    <li> its expensive, but hey i think its actually pretty good stuff. it doesnt make me look less balding, but i like the way my hair feels with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Just switched from system 1 to system 2 and I love it! My hair looks and feels thicker.  definitely will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Seems not to work as well since they started making it in mexico, no clue what they changed but its different</li>
    <li> While it won&#x27;t thinning of hair, it can slow it down, and I believe help you grow some newer hair in those trouble areas. Also, don&#x27;t let anyone talk you into buying all the additional products. I mean you can if you want to, but all I need is the shampoo once a day. It is the best deep cleansing  shampoo I have ever used. It&#x27;s goes to work on the skin head like getting rid of the ground in sebum, which is what makes your hair oily.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service. Will do business again if necessary. Thanks Jake.</li>
    <li> Nioxin System 2 Shampoo: Great price on a 33.8 oz. bottle of Nioxin Cleanser... way cheaper than retail, &amp; delivered right to the door. Previously, I&#x27;ve never even seen this available locally. I&#x27;ll be looking at Amazon for additional staples from now on.  [Product Details: Nioxin Cleanser System 2 (Fine/Untreated/Noticeably Thinning ), 33.8 Ounce]</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile and have good luck with it.  I don&#x27;t think it works for everyone, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> Use that all the time</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It does what it says it will do. It is not cheap but the bottle is quite large and it takes very little!</li>
    <li> Old age has hit so we both use this product.  It really cleans well and makes your hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for years.  Not cheap but worth the cost.  Helps my thin hair appear fuller. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> I know this product is good, been using it longtime. This is a huge bottle at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> It is a great product, the price was right, and the shipping was free.  Being able to purchase this on my laptop was a great deal.</li>
    <li> I broke out in a rash around hair line</li>
    <li> Hair feels good and clean but the shampoo has not helped with thinning of the hair.</li>
    <li> great product. 100% recommend it.</li>
    <li> Cannot say without a doubt, but feel that I see more hair in sink/shower when not using this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product occasionally and discovered it&#x27;s value when my hair began to thin following surgery.  It worked very well.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It was great to get it in the larger size - I like the product very much and am apt to purchase it another time.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, shiny, and manageable but I don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s had any effect otherwise. Can find the same properties for less expense, so I won&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT REAL.  Go buy store bought regular shampoo and save your money.  OR buy from an authorized dealer.  The color is lighter, no tingling, etc.  Anyone posting this is real is a bought review. PERIOD.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo for my hair, I use it all the time.  Was an easier&lt;br /&gt;buy this way.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend to anyone losing or hair is thinning especially after surgery or lost of hair through medical procedure. Quick to grow back.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this shampoo I got it at Costco.  My hairdresser commented that my hair was so full and thick.  I could not figure out why.  Then I found out this shampoo was for hair loss...and the puzzle pieces came together.  This is amazing shampoo.  I am fortunate to have healthy hair, but it is fine and shampoos weigh it down, this is magic shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I freaked out when I started losing a lot of hair in the shower. Granted, I&#x27;m only in my mid-20s but this was recommended to me by a co-worker. The product, along with the shampoo, severely dried out my hair and caused more to fall out. My hair was weaker and easily broke. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad (it smells minty) but it&#x27;s hard to sleep and work smelling of mint 24/7.</li>
    <li> This product helps my thinning hair, definitely makes my hair look thicker and fuller.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> No complaints, I use it to keep some body in my hair and for that it has worked very well.  I have been using it for a few years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d probably be bald without Nioxin.  Also, it smells good, leaves hair in a better condition than with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used .. and if you have any gray or white hair it removes any yellowing.  Not cheap, but to me is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This purchase was to replace current stock...so usage was consistent with previous experiences, which is excellent.</li>
    <li> Smells the same, but I did not get the same results from this bottle as the stuff my hairdressr gave me, which was the same just a smaller bottle. The stuff at the salon is the real deal and really did work when I used it regularly.</li>
    <li> I have utilized this product for many years and it definitely works. It has helped to stop hair loss when used in conjunction with the Nioxin conditioner. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a shampoo that does more than just cleanse your hair.</li>
    <li> Two containers were sent as ordered, but one a System 1, despite the clearly written order and invoice.  Quality control problem????  #2 is fine.</li>
    <li> feels good, gives my head a nice tingly feeling</li>
    <li> Great, it makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> It gives your scalp a thorough cleansing you can feel.  Great for oily hair!  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shampoos from medicated to Head and Shoulders...this does the job!</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo (and conditioner). It&#x27;s become our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand and see no need to change. The bottle is super big so we use a smaller squeeze bottle for our shower and use the big bottle as refill only.</li>
    <li> Top notch product and great customer care.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this cleanser~~~it was received with minimal wait and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;He has had great sucess with this product. I&#x27;m certain he will order it again !</li>
    <li> Leaves hair brighter, shinier and swingier!  Has a lively fresh scent!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Nioxin has very good products. I ordered this cleanser as it was mentioned that it has DHT blocker. But on the received shampoo there are no signs about DHT...</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, great price here too</li>
    <li> I havent noticed alot of new hair growth, but I am hoping.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Since I started using it the allergy  sores on my head have mostly disappeared.  I am hoping that it will soon take away the itching also.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. Leaves scalp feeling moist and clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great.</li>
    <li> I am using this shampoo for some years and it really cleans the scalp and stopped the hair loss (but the hair isn&#x27;t stronger).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin products for about 2 years.  Won&#x27;t re-grow hair but it helps maintain fullness of what you have.</li>
    <li> Its not the original. Its a complete a knockoff product. It is manufactured in Mexico. I think they put something else in the mid way. After using this my office desk will have at least 50 hair strands every day.&lt;br /&gt;My previous purchase from local store was not like this. This online product is hair falling shampoo. I was wondering why it was so cheap for 33.8 Ounce finally got the answer it is to loose hair not grow hair.</li>
    <li> I like the clean smell.  I do, however, find it dries my hair considerable if I don&#x27;t follow up with the Nixon Scalp treatment.  When using both, my hair has more body and I no long find hair in the drain.  Feels thicker and grows faster.  I tried it on by hair specialists recommendation and will continue to use it.  I was also told it can be used as a body wash as it has no harsh chemicals.  I have used it as a body wash but find the price is prohibative.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year. Great shampoo. Gets your scalp and hair very clean, thus making the way got better hair growth. Smells good.</li>
    <li> The product does nothing for the hair.  There was no regrowth nor was there a reduction in the thinning process.&lt;br /&gt;The only growth was Nioxin whose bottom line increased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after his barber recommended it and he can already telling the new hair is starting to grow.</li>
    <li> I would be bald without this product.... have been using it for like 2 years now... use it atleast twice a week and now my hair does not shed or not atleast that much..... definitely a keeper.... I saw the difference starting 2nd week of use.... its almost instant...</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, arrived even faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Work Great!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean clearly changing the texture of the hair strands. Excellent price, half of retail even with shipping included.</li>
    <li> great shampoo, and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and I do see improvement. I will continue using it. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I could get a FULL thick head of hair, but it&#x27;s never been that way, but it is much better than it was.</li>
    <li> I am a 28-year-old male who is going through the motions with a receding/thinning hairline problem. About two years ago my hair just started falling out extensively till I could start seeing my scalp through my hair. I tried a variety of products (Rogaine included) to no avail. Every shampoo I used started making my hair even more thin and brittle, basically destroying what I had left with harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until I finally took the advice of the woman who cuts my hair and picked up some Nioxin. This is simply the best shampoo out on the market. While it&#x27;s not exactly growing my hair back, it has thickened it up extensively and made it looks so much more healthy and shiny looking. I have also noticed the amount of hairs falling out in the shower have reduced to only a couple (where before I would see 10-15 hairs on my hands everytime I washed my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for month now and even got the conditioner and after shower scalp enhancer which seem to be having an even better effect on my hair when combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am not sure if the supposed, &#x27;follicle enhancers&#x27; within will ever kick-start my dead follicles, but it is definitely tiding the storm of my eventual bald-ness.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a hair stylist.  And at $50 a bottle and with thinning hair in my 20s I went for it .  It didn&#x27;t work.  It cleared the sebum problem up with my hair, but because the detergents were so harsh, it gave my scalp dermatitis.  It did nothing to make my hair look nicer, but certainly stripped all the color out of that I got at the salon.  I also had no visible growth from using this product and did WAY better just using hair vitamins and rogaine together.  For the price, there&#x27;s more NATURAL products that&#x27;ll deliver at least healthy results for your hair.</li>
    <li> ... but, I&#x27;m not 100% sure ... I have maintained my hair more than the rest of my aging friends and relatively, but I don&#x27;t know if it is definitely because of the shampoo ... that said, I don&#x27;t use anything else (like medication or other topical applications) ...</li>
    <li> Good shampoo but I have not noticed any thicker hair feeling.  I will probably go back to normal shampoo for the price.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have been losing it for a number of years.  I use this product along with the conditioner and booster and while my hair is still thin, this helps me keep from losing more hair.</li>
    <li> great procuct. ontime delivery</li>
    <li> On time, as promised. Everything seems perfect. No problems.</li>
    <li> Need it for my thinning hair.  Great price for the amount of shampoo</li>
    <li> This hair cleanser does so much for my fine thin hair.  I have less hair in the sink afterwards and my hair seems and looks thicker.  It was delivered within time frame promised.  I Also use bodifying foam from Nioxin very sparingly and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nioxin Cleanser System for years and it is perfect.  It is even better on Amazon for 25%-50% of the salon price.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging. Item arrived within the expected time. Notice hair is thicker after wash and there is an icy feel.</li>
    <li> It does not smell as strong as the  last one I bought and it is more lathery. However it still leaves hair squeaky clean. Is it atill going to slow the thinning as well? Only time will tell. What is the alternative to suck it and see ...I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo for me after medication caused my hair to begin thinning.  The initial few  days hair felt different but after using for over two months I wouldn&#x27;t change for anything.  The price at amazon is significantly cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years due to allergist to many of the shampoos. It is the only one I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause an itchy irritated scalp.</li>
    <li> I recieved this order the next day, great service. I love this shampoo. I noticed a change in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great smelling shampoo. Maybe it&#x27;s just wishful thinking, but I swear my hair appears thicker. My wife agrees. A but expensive, but you needn&#x27;t use much. The 33.8 oz. bottle will last me most of the year. If your aren&#x27;t sure, spend a little less on a smaller bottle. I have no regrets!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser swears by this product and uses it herself. It is okay, but no better than the organic shampoo (for adding volume) that I buy at the grocery store. It is a large, heavy bottle at a good price. But I would need to put it in a smaller bottle for my small hands to use which seemed like a lot of trouble. So I gave the bottle to my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot.  It definitely makes my hair a bit thicker and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell, I like the way it cleans my scalp, and I like the way it feels, very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.  My hair is not coming back but like I said, it feels thicker and I am not losing any more hair.</li>
    <li> May have slowed hair loss but we have definitely lost hair.</li>
    <li> quick shipping, as shown</li>
    <li> Good for my thin hair. I have been using it for couple years and very help my hair. My hair is thicker now.</li>
    <li> It can stop my hair loss completly when cleaning my hair. I had a lot of hair loss during cleaning or brushing in the past. To grow my hair back as fully as original may be still too early to say, but it can actually keep the hair you have originally. Of course, I don&#x27;t expect miracle could happen suddenly in just one or two months, since my hair loss problems have been last for 8 years. I had already finsihed up the first bottle and will continue to use the second bottle.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than where I was getting it previously. It&#x27;s a bigger bottle as well. I have subscribed and get this every three months automatically.</li>
    <li> Great item, my husband really likes this shampoo since he has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t know how effective it is with controlling thinning hair.  I suppose there&#x27;s no real way to measure because of so many other variables.  I suppose you could use this one one side of your head and another product on the other but... life&#x27;s too short.  In any case, I rated this 5 stars for other reasons.  First of all, the smell and the tingle.  It&#x27;s refreshing, but not annoying.  A little like Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree but not so strong.  I also feel that it suds up just enough and not too much.  There&#x27;s no residual feeling or smell either, like many other shampoos.  It rinses right off.  Guests who use it at my house usually ask me where they can get some (not like they need it, ahhh).  I have very short hair and a 33 ounce bottle lasts me about 2 years.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it is minty and leaves your scalp feeling clean.  It is a little pricy but I do reccomend perchasing it.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Great customer services!</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much better since I started using this product.  It seems fully and a lot healthier. Thanks</li>
    <li> I found it to be quite a bit less expensive on line!!!!  Good product</li>
    <li> I have only been using Nioxin for 10 years. Excellent product line that removes the DHT that causes hair loss. I&#x27;m the only male member of all of my many male cousins that still has a full head of hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product almost every day [may have missed one day] for the past week. Can&#x27;t say anything about other reviews claiming that it stops hair loss. Can say that my immediate impression is that my hair does look fuller/have more body. It seemed that way from the first day of use and I was worried it was a placebo effect but after using for about a week, it definitely seems to me that my hair is looking fuller and has more body than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely find it incredulous the claims it is preventing hair loss or more. I would like to hear more specific details as to how those making claims came to that judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I overall like the shampoo for the body/fullness it appears to be given my hair. I was wary at the price for the body but I am finding that a little - quarter size dab - seems to go a long way, lather up really well. I will see how many days it last before running out and update. Depending on that, I may add or take away a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/9/12:&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. I do see a difference when I lay off it for a few days. Moreover, the bottle lasts. You don&#x27;t need a quarter size dab. I can get by with a dab between a dime and a quarter . . . okay, could be I don&#x27;t have as much hair, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/12/13:&lt;br /&gt;I am still on my first bottle, though for the past 3-4 months I haven&#x27;t been using every day. Nonetheless, still impressed over how long the bottle has lasted.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Not sure if this really works but my husband has been using this shampoo for the last 2 years and thinks that maybe it has slowed down his hair loss....Im not sure....Ill just keep buying it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve uses this product in the past. It seems to help my thinning hair from getting anymore thinner. A good value.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I use now.  It was recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working...too afraid to stop and find out it was.  Still bald up top...a bit...but without it who knows, I may be a Mr. Clean guy by now.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
    <li> This has been our regular shampoo for quite a number of years.  Reasonably better than the other ones that we tried.</li>
    <li> Take this review with a grain of salt because I bought this to use for my Pomeranian who is losing hair. I used it once a week for about six weeks and didn&#x27;t notice much difference other than dry skin, so I&#x27;m discontinuing use of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this 4 months ago and did not give it time to work. I have now used it for about 5 months and it has not regrown hair, but it has made my hair fuller and stopped or slowed the thinning process. I now use Rogaine with this and my receding hair line has regrown hair completely in my frontal hairline. I have seen regrowth with this combination that I decided  to try,(I said what do I have to lose) and the results have been new hairline. Don&#x27;t give up just try different combinations of products and if you don&#x27;t have male-pattern baldness you will see results. I&#x27;m 49 and started to recede a little in the front and crown, now almost all grown in.</li>
    <li> May have worked slightly but not much noticeable difference. Also made my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used to this product for 2 yrs and feel like it&#x27;s finally time to give it a fair review. At first when I started using it I noticed tingling of the scalp. This faded after the first bottle, now I notice no tingling at all. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t notice any decrease in shedding after using this product for 2 years. It also contains sulfate which many say is not good for the hair.</li>
    <li> Nioxin has been a leader with thinning hair.  It does thicken hair,  Some say it grows hair, I have personally never seen new hair.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for fine or thinning hair. Bought this for my husband whose hair is very fine and this product makes his hair appear thicker than it really is and the shine is wonderful. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Cleans well but keep in mind that it strips everything from your hair so you will need to condition afterwards. I have oily hair so it works well for me. My hair is thinning so I&#x27;m switching to Regenepure since it contains Ketoconazole and Nioxin does not. Contains sulfates as well.</li>
    <li> its the worst thing i ever used on my hair, i bought this cleanser with scalp therapy last month and with in a few days of using it i notice that a lot of hair is falling, i continue using it for almost a month then i decide not use it anymore for i might get totally bald in ayear if i continue using it. its a waste of money, don&#x27;t ever buy this product..</li>
    <li> only been using it for a month, but I do think I see a difference. I will continue to use it for a couple more months to see how my final rating will be</li>
    <li> I have been using since an year now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has reduce my hair falls, I can&#x27;t say which one is working as I am using this with Minox 10% foam, but certainly one thing I have noticed about this is it makes you hair look thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can reduce your hair falls and make your hairs dense</li>
    <li> Sad but true, this is not the same product it was a year ago. It was a terrific product until the company was sod. Now it&#x27;s not worth the money. Too expensive for watered down shampoo. Give us back the original formula. I switched to Bosley products. Bosley is much better than the new Nioxin. I&#x27;ll never buy or recommend this product unless they change it back. What a rip off.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. It does what they state it&#x27;s suppose to do. The conditioner works very good as well. As long as they make it, I&#x27;ll be buying it.</li>
    <li> This is a refill.  My wife uses it and she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 7 or 8 years. Im not losing hair anymore and its thicker and fuller. Its not a cure but it can extend your hair life til you are around 60??maybe. Im 52 years old and I still have full hair so for 40.00 for every few months is a good investment.</li>
    <li> Works well, with a nice minty tingle on my scalp when shampooing. Arrived in a timely fashion. Thanks! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a bottle of Nioxin that I bought 6 months ago from a different store. I compared it with Nioxin sold on Amazon. What I found is that Nioxin sold on Amazon looks, smells and feels completely different. This shampoo is nothing like the Nioxin I&#x27;ve been using for years. It produced in Mexico and apparently they now use completely different formula that will make your hair and skin extremely dry for days. Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. No problems&amp;#62; Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> I am using this product for almost 9 months now. I cant tell if its improving but definitely its not getting worst.</li>
    <li> I have gotten the conditioner and shampoo. I guess I noticed stoppage of thinning hair, so I guess the shampoo is working. The price is kinda high for shampoo but it does work I feel, and it feels really good and tingly when using it.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> Not sure how well it really works, but I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I still have some hair!</li>
    <li> I myself have not received it but saw amazing results with a friend, Her hair was very thin and now has thick curly hair,and did not have curly hair before  using Nioxin cleanser</li>
    <li> Great no as heavy as 1</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. Can&#x27;t imagine not having it. It only requires a small amount to lather up and then it is a great volumizer. Have not seen any hair loss since using it.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered the \\&quot;Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 2 (Noticeably Thinning) Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce\\&quot; and received this shampoo instead by accident. I only use their conditioner and clean my hair with any brand of shampoo every other day. But I kept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still only use it every other day, but it does work better than other shampoos and it should, considering the price. But it only takes a very small amount to work up the lather, so I expect this to last almost a year. It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my very thin hair and it keeps it looking clean and almost shiny. It does removes residue and DHT from the hair and scalp. DHT is that nasty natural chemical that causes hair to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should toss out those other cheap shampoos (I mean shampoos that cost less than six bucks). This shampoo is expensive but it lives up to its name as one of the higher quality shampoos.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells like medicine. It works.  I was losing hair so much until I started using this.  It&#x27;s been two years and I still hang in there with it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really cleans my hair and makes my scalp feel good. I like what it does for my hair.</li>
    <li> I am not a scientist and have no idea if this actually works.  My fiancée swears my hair is filling in, has more body and looks great...I suspect she is telling me this because she is my fiancée, however, she may be telling the actual truth too..  What I can say is it appears my hair loss is slowing, possibly stopping since beginning use.  I do not think this is a wonder cure but it may work to slow the process.  I&#x27;ll keep using.</li>
    <li> After 3 months still lose hair like before and I don&#x27;t believe in this product. I lost money for nothing. The shiping was good for this reason I give you 2 stars not 1.</li>
    <li> Have been using Nioxin for a year and see no discernable results.&lt;br /&gt;Am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> my hubby likes the cleanser.  he likes the way it makes his hair feel.  will order again some day soon.</li>
    <li> I have hair loss due to a medical condition. Nioxin may not be the cure but I find it to be a very clean and natural product whether it helps with a hair loss condition due to illness or not, I would recommend this product...</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and several years ago was falling out quite quickly. Started using this shampoo and hair loss decreased. It&#x27;s impossible to say however if it&#x27;s from the shampoo or coincidence but I&#x27;ve decided to continue just in case. I don&#x27;t think anyone can actually tell i it works or not.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this daily for thinning hair but also for very sensitive skin and psoriasis. It has helped all three, almost immediately! He swears by this product and how well his skin/scalp feels after each use. Not sure if it&#x27;s making his hair &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price for how well he feels afterward</li>
    <li> Great product for thinning hair</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin faithfully for three years now.  I started receding when I was 19.  I am now 26.  I have strengthened the hair that I still have but I have not regrown anything I lost.  This product does what it is meant to do...not more.  My advice for you: if you&#x27;re looking at this product, buy it.  If you&#x27;re starting to thin, buy it and give it a try.  It&#x27;s best to try Nioxin while you still have something to hold on to.</li>
    <li> ...And I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years.  Every time I try something else I end up coming back.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...for men or women, it&#x27;s great on thinning hair.  After multiple uses you can really feel a difference in the texture of your hair and the overall amount of hair on your head.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT REAL. I ordered this product and I had to return it right away. The color is lighter, no tingling, etc. Go buy from store or buy from an authorized dealer.</li>
    <li> After using it for a year and plus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I won&#x27;t be getting refill.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year and it has definitely halted my thinning and has even encouraged new growth.  Another big plus is that it has helped my scalp psoriasis (sp?) BIG TIMES!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo ,smells great , gives hair thicker feeling but has sulfates in it ,other than that Its a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love Nioxin I do not like to use anything but. Although I am always skeptical about ordering it online since they claim it is only sold in salons. I trust Amazon. I do not feel or see a diference always satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while and it seems to help protect my thinning hair from shedding! I like it.</li>
    <li> Total garbage.  Made my hair thinner.  Stay away!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s hairdresser recommended this for me since my hair seemed to thin a little due to stress.  I used it &amp; noticed my scalp was itching but I just thought maybe that meant it was working &amp; stimulating hair growth.  So I kept using it twice a week for about 2 &amp; 1/2 months until I noticed actual bumps forming.  Then I had to go to the dermatologist who said it had actually given me pretty bad dandruff (which I&#x27;d never had before) so she gave me some medicated shampoo which seemed to work at first but the welts are still there &amp; still itching 3 weeks later.  I think the Nioxin really burned my scalp.  It has a lot of essential oils but essential oils are often too strong for our skin &amp; need a good neutral carrier oil - &amp; even then it&#x27;s sometimes too strong.  I could really feel the peppermint oil when I used Nioxin.  Anyway, I would not recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Sucks! they changed the formula</li>
    <li> NOT REAL PRODUCT.. The color is lighter, no tingling, etc.  Makes your hair very Dry and Itchy. Better buy from Authorized Retailer.</li>
    <li> Great Product.Purchased and had Shipped to my Grandaughter.I have been using Nioxin for years and I have my whole family using these Products.STIMULATE NEW HAIR GROWTH,CONDITION HAIR AND ARE PERFECT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.ALL NATURAL ,TOXIN FREE.SUPER SMOOTH TRANSACTION.FAST SHIPPING.HIGHLY RECOMMEND.THANKYOU:-)</li>
    <li> noticed some improvement. shouldn&#x27;t have purchased such a large quantity because it became watered down after a while. Might use in the future.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say how good it is by itself since I also use a DHT Blocker pill along with it. However I can tell you that both things have enabled me to have thicker and stronger hair. Right now I am 35 and I have never had thicker hair (I have fine hair) in my life.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin System 2 (Cleanser and Conditioner) for more than 3 years now and it *seems* to have stopped my hairline from receding further. It is a little expensive but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note, I always stick with &amp;#34;Ships from and Sold by Amazon&amp;#34; for such kinds of products, for I don&#x27;t want to destroy my hair for a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You be your own judge.</li>
    <li> I began using Nioxin in conjunction with propecia three months ago, and hair is beginning to grow back in areas that haven&#x27;t seen hair in 2 years.  The propecia could be the source of the regroth, but I feel the combination of the two products has a multiplier effect.</li>
    <li> Nioxin won&#x27;t stop my noggin&#x27; from going all Telly Savalas on my arse, but the hair that I do have, looks awesome. I&#x27;ve reordered to #2 several times and always happy. But it helps I have an awesome personality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a 5 star product hands down however, because it works so much better than the competitors I gave it 4 stars. The big bottle lasts a long time, so long I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I bought one. I actually bought 2 last time and it&#x27;s probably been 6 to 8 months or so. It helps to keep the hair you have from falling out. I do notice a fuller looking hair when I use it as directed and stay on schedule. It seems to work well with Rogaine and the two of them together is the real trick.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel healthy. Not too much of a change otherwise. Hopefully after prolonged use, thinning is less noticeable. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I could get more of this product. I had lost so much hair that I had to wear one of those cancer hats. I starting using Nioxin about 1 1/2 years ago and it did wonders for me. Way to go Nioxin!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for anyone experiencing thinning hair. Seems to help in aiding hair loss, not necessarily hair growth.</li>
    <li> Sadly this product just isn&#x27;t what it used to be. There is no &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; any longer. They must have changed the formula at some point. It cleans your hair fine but it&#x27;s not the magical product I used to buy. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I love Nixion Shampoo. Shipped on time too.</li>
    <li> I have Graves disease, so a side effect of hyperactive thyroid is hair loss. While taking medication, I gave Nioxin a shot in case it could help double team my poor thinning hair. There was virtually no effect, aside from drying out my hair considerably. It felt very brittle and dry -- the dryness went away after I stopped Nioxin. It didn&#x27;t help at all in re-growing hair, and I was still losing at the same rate even after six months of use. So if you&#x27;re looking at Nioxin because you&#x27;re losing hair from your thyroid, don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I still had hair coming out five strands at a time and nothing re-growing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years with excelent results. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  It seemed to dry out my hair. Also, did not find it helping my scalp or thinning hair</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised</li>
    <li> I and my husband have been using Nioxin for about three years.  However, I&#x27;ve just noticed a build-up in my hair so I&#x27;ve taken some time off from Nioxin.  I recommend Nioxin for thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 yo female with an average amount of fine hair prone to be oily. I am concerned about preventing normal thinning with age, especially around the face. I am easy on my hair/scalp, only styling &amp; using styling products 1-2 times a week &amp; do not color. I have been using this shampoo for 6 months now (about 5x a week). I have not noticed any difference yet. I still lose the same amount of hair in the shower &amp; have the same amount of new growth as usual - nothing amazing. Cleans my hair well. My hair &amp; scalp seem healthy &amp; at least not harmed by this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo DOES NOT have the DHT removing ingredient as it says on the product description. Most Nioxin Cleanser that&#x27;s coming out lately had an ingredient changed compared to the old ones. And this shampoo does not say it removes DHT on the back info of the bottle</li>
    <li> Product met expectations. Received product in timely manner.</li>
    <li> This is great for my scalp! It is really nice and smells great. Not sure if it is good for the hair growth but I love it for my scalp . Sometimes when it&#x27;s dry or winter time, I get bad dandruff and this helps it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Great for thinning hair&lt;br /&gt;My hair always feels clean and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this product for anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Great value for good product. The order took little longer than what I thought but it is worth the waiting.</li>
    <li> First time I use this product and as soon as it touch my hair it made it extremely soft!!!! Delivery was fast and easy!!! Hoping to start seeing changes soon!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 18 years now, and although I am not certain that it actually slows down hair thinning or loss (the claim for which I originally tried the product), I have come to like the product; this purchase is less costly that purchasing the same product in a salon.</li>
    <li> Just ordered again - this is great shampoo - and I must say, my hubby has &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; new growth on the top of his head!  My hair also stopped falling out as much.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nioxin Shampoo for many years. It does make my hair fuller and my scalp feel cool, tingly and clean. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps me keep the hair I have.  My hair line was starting to recede, once I started using this product it stopped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and like the result. I was not expecting a miracle but it did slow down my hair loss. On the plus side it smells pretty good, a lot better than the other ones of tried.</li>
    <li> Like this shampoo and used the one for color treat hair and then switched to the one for regular hair when i stopped coloring my hair.  Good product</li>
    <li> Great price, product work ok.  You will not grow a lot of hair but it does make it thicker and quality of clean is good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they have changed the formulation on this, or if this isn&#x27;t the same as the salon formula. The ingredients are not the same as the Product I purchased directly from a Salon. I have found this to be the case on the Non Salon formula of this product I have gotten in Stores as opposed to Salons, where the product is also less expensive. I am not sure that it will work as well. I guess when I run out this time, I will purchase from a Salon, first checking the label for the key ingredients.</li>
    <li> The item received and shipped very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and can really tell a difference. Not a miracle but it helps. My hair seems to feel fuller and thicker and you can barely see my scalp anymore. It wasn&#x27;t bad to begin with but I could tell the hair loss was starting. My hair dresser recommended it to me and so I thought I would give it a try. Will buy again, probably be a while it is a really big bottle.</li>
    <li> I started using this because I have a disease which makes your hair fall out in clumps.  When the medication dosage is correct, you usually quit losing your hair/and it grows back.  However; while waiting for the medication adjustments, losing your hair is just awful.  I started using this line of products on the advise of my stylist, and I have to tell you...it&#x27;s done wonders. in 2 weeks, the loss has basically stopped. It also makes your hair APPEAR thicker. Is it an illusion, but I will take it. This product seems to swell the hair shaft and rough up the cuticle. It is not as shiny as it used to be, due to the product....but I will take the illusion of MORE hair to having 10 strands of SHINY hair:) I have seen comments that the foam in the kit makes the hair sticky.  I have not experienced that, even when using more than the directions state.  I would highly recommend this line of products!</li>
    <li> I dunno if it is working, by my hair is getting thin.  I&#x27;ll write again if stylist notices more hair anytime soon.</li>
    <li> It cleans the scalp and removes itching, dandruff...Its a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it for others.  . . .</li>
    <li> It cleans really well, but must use the Nioxin conditioner otherwise your hair remains really dry.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin arrived, well packed. This is a terrific bargain compared to retail bottles of half the size.</li>
    <li> It helps you keep your hair, doesn&#x27;t make new hair grow.</li>
    <li> great product  since buying this shampoo my hair is regrown more and alot thicker  aim happier and i will buy it again!</li>
    <li> cleans really good but hasn&#x27;t help with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This made my hair very course and brittle...I&#x27;m sure I needed 3 but didn&#x27;t know they had a 3</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and recommend it.</li>
    <li> bought this for my boyfriend. he really enjoys it. has lasted him for a really long time. he uses this without any of the other products though, and I notice a difference. it&#x27;s subtle, but still enough to notice.</li>
    <li> Great Price and Fast Delivery!</li>
    <li> Fast and great product! Good seller!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 years now. It seems to do what it says. I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of money on this and I saw no results.  yes it tingles when I use it but that alone doesn&#x27;t matter if it doesn&#x27;t work.  it doesn&#x27;t work.  Save your money and buy something else on Amazon, but not this</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipment.</li>
    <li> does nothing for my hair... almost makes it feel thinner</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> nioxin used to be such a great product and worked so well! not anymore it was bought by proctor and gamble.  they have changed all the ingredients in it and watered it down. it does not work as well and is not the quality for the price it once was. it is now under the wella brand which is proctor and gamble. called them, but got no where, message passed on period. i guess for a large corporation it is all about money, which equals cheaper ingredients and a poorer quality product, don&#x27;t use it anymore.  back to the drawing board for something that compares to the orginal nioxin product.  it is such a shame for us comsumers, if anyone knows of a comparable product please post for all to switch  good luck!</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it for years as well as the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I Love this product if you have thinning hair!</li>
    <li> Not the Same nioxin i been used before.</li>
