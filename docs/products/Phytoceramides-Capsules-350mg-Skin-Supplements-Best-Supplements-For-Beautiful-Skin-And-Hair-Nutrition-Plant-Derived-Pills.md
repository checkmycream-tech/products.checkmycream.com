<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of phytoceramides since I began using them.  I figured they were all pretty much the same.  Wrong.  I noticed a bigger difference in my skin with the Sano than with any other. Even once  I used the Sano, I still tried another one, and now am back to Sano.  I find the vegetarian capsule ( a must for me) easy to swallow and easy to differentiate from my other supplements (I take a few).  The biggest difference I have noticed in my skin has been the moisture level.  In the New England winters,  my skin flakes, cracks, and itches.  I find body lotion to be a tedious chore, something else I don&#x27;t have time for.  Since using the Sano, my poor itchy legs have healed completely.  They are smooth and soft, no flakes whatsoever.  And my heels, which are always cracked, have healed about 75%. As far as my face goes, my skin seems much firmer, softer,  and slightly more lifted. It&#x27;s amazing, really.  This is probably the easiest step in my beauty routine.  Give this a couple of months and you will want to stay with it.  It&#x27;s noticeable!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for two months and I can honestly say that it works! The fine lines around my eyes and cheeks have all but disappeared. It takes about a month see any results but it did happen as promised. It seems as though it also helped out my dry itchy skin! I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> My personal opinion is that SANO does not make any difference in wrinkle apparence. SANO could be taken as a vitamin supplement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken it for 30 days and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> This product is very good! It was shipped fast and the results are great. I have been using another brand from my local store but it does not come close to the quality of this product. I highly recommend this to anyone. As a matter of fact I need to reorder!</li>
    <li> dont take it!!...HEART IRREGULAR BEATING!!</li>
    <li> I really love your product and how great it is for my skin!! I always look for things to help with health and beauty and this is an optimal product!! I also like that it is a vegetarian capsule. Thanks for such a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I have seen any difference since I have been using this product. I don&#x27;t know that there are any changes. I probably won&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I feel like these are working.  Of course there&#x27;s no way to tell for sure.  Since they are so easy to swallow and have no taste, I expect to keep taking them.  I don&#x27;t see how they could hurt.</li>
    <li> It smelled like flour to me! still took it but no change. Some user are complaining about irregular heart beat, Need some laboratory test information.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like taking a vitamin.  My hair is getting thicker! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!! I am 50 years old and all though I have always taken care of my skin, I have a problem with squinting. In doing so I have a few wrinkles on my forehead. I have noticed with in a few days of taking Phytoceramides 350 mg that the wrinkles have faded and are less defined. I received a complement from my daughter in-law yesterday that I look fantastic and was glowing.  Thank you I will keep using your products.</li>
    <li> Great product! All natural, no chemicals...exactly what I was looking for! Thank you</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t. Work as well as. I thought.</li>
    <li> Havent noticed a difference yet. Been taking for a few weeks now</li>
    <li> Great product. Starting to notice the difference</li>
    <li> I love these supplements!! I had seen an ad by Dr. Oz and he recommended these to have a more healthy , glowing skin. I am pleased with the difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Added Bonus... Sano wrote me after my purchase ... Giving me extra directions for ultimate performance.  Great service!!!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with Sano phytoceramides. I had been using a different, more expensive brand that I was happy with but got tired of paying so much. I started looking at other brands and Sano had great reviews and sounded really good. I wouldn&#x27;t switch back now - no reason to. Love the product and will continue to purchase from Sano. Super happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sano Naturals Phytoceramides for a couple of months. This is the first winter in quite a while that my skin has remained smooth and nice.  I also seem to have a nice glow.  I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> The first 30 days, I&#x27;m not seeing any improvement - may reorder</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product for your skin.I will be reordering again.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference! Smoother complexion 11&#x27;s lines almost gone when using the product.</li>
    <li> Face is changing and time is being rewinded!</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 weeks and I am beginning to notice improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> With so many products on the market it&#x27;s hard to know with ones work.  After reading up on Sano Naturals and other reviews I ordered their phytoceramides 350 mg product.  After using a month I already notice a difference.  The loose skin under my neck is already tighter and my complexion is brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I think these have made a difference in fine lines, particularly around my eyes.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product! I will continue to use it and will be telling my friends about it.</li>
    <li> I believe these work!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product really recommend it</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the transaction &amp; product. Thank you. Does wonders for complexion.</li>
    <li> its ok nothing special</li>
    <li> This product gave me terrible migraine headache.  I threw it away after giving it a 2nd try.</li>
    <li> Noticed a definite difference in my skin, softer and healthier looking.  Ordering another bottle right now.</li>
    <li> My wife has enjoyed and benefited from her use of this product!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Much needed and not always easy to get in everyday diet vitamins! Will continue to use to measure results.</li>
    <li> I will wait to see what the results are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months. I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first 2-3 months, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I would say in the last two months, I started noticing that some of the fine lines around the eyes seemed softer or not as noticeable. The lines are still there but I see a slight difference. I don&#x27;t think a before and after photo would show a super distinct change but I really think the product helped the skin to improve a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing with this product since it&#x27;s a supplement for the skin anyway,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also just starting to try other products by this same manufacturer. They are Vitamin C Serum, Retinol Serum, and their eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I am supposed to apply the Vitamin C Serum or the Retinol over the eye cream area. Instructions were not given about that. I&#x27;d have to write to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent packaging.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, seems to already be working.&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to see results after 1 months use. Will report more later.</li>
    <li> Good seller, good product.</li>
    <li> Product does what it claims to my amazement, about to order more after using them for 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is they need to sort out international shipping as these products become a little costly when having to use a forwarding agent.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle &amp; my skin is smoother &amp; glowing!  Unfortunately I suffer from cellulite on the back of my legs but.... let me just tell you how much smoother my legs look!  I just might be rockin&#x27; shorts this summer!</li>
    <li> I like the product will most likely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used another brand and saw these and liked that they were GMO free so I decided to give a try .&lt;br /&gt;I have notice the lines on my face around eyes my mouth and neck have softend.my experience you have&lt;br /&gt;to be on these for 4 months to notice a difference .I drank  lots of water too .Turning 50 I want to try to look  the best I can&lt;br /&gt;for as long I can. give these a try  and drink your water and you should notice a difference</li>
    <li> great product love it</li>
    <li> i received the product quickly, and have no complaints about the packaging.  i understand that you need to take the capsules for up to six months in order to see results - I&#x27;ve only invested six weeks into it so far so can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness quite yet</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few weeks so I have not seen any improvements.  I still have hope that continued use will improve my dry skin and dark under eye circles.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after the one I was using was no longer available.  I have a severe skin problem and after years of dermatologists, steroids and the like, I finally stopped putting the medical &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; prescriptions on the back shelf.  Mainly because I was dumping unknown chemicals in my body.  I read the reviews on Phytoceramides and was excited to try it.  It was amazing, and like I mentioned in my first line, that product was discontinued.  I tried several other &amp;#34;phytoceramides&amp;#34; that simply did not work.&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I saw this product Dr. Tobias Phytoceramides Plus and because it had biotin etc, I decided to try it.  I LOVE this product and I&#x27;m back in the game.  My skin cleared up almost immediately.  For the first two weeks I took two (2) a day (not the recommended 1 a day) to get the phytoceramides back into my system.  I&#x27;m now using the recommended 1 a day, and my skin is clear.  No breakout or open sores.  All I can say is this is an outstanding productd Thank yoI tried this product after the one I was using was no longer available.

    <li> This one seems to be working better than some others I have tried.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product.  Too soon to tell the results yet. I will update soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great all natural product.  I have been taking it for a month, and have already noticed a positive difference in my skin (clearer and more even toned).  Also noticed stronger, longer nails and hair.  I will continue using this product.  Very high quality and pure ingredients.  I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Of course I bought this for my face, and my face is well hydrated and smooth, but one interesting improvement I&#x27;ve noticed is that the soles of my feet and skin on my lower ankles are more hydrated and need less care. I used to suffer from painful, cracking skin all along the bottoms of my feet and ankles and that has dramatically improved by my 3rd bottle. I expect it will continue to improve over time. Ordering my 4th bottle now.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used the vitamins for a over a year.  Part of my regimen.  This is the first time I used this brand but all of it is the same as far as what they do.  I would not stop taking these vitamins for any reason because the results I have had are remarkable.  I love this product and works.  My skin is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Works as a miracle and I&#x27;ll definitely keep use it.</li>
    <li> After 2 months of taking this, nothing. I guess I didn&#x27;t need it that bad after all. My skin is better without it.</li>
    <li> good price...have to give it time to see if it actually works</li>
    <li> OK, but we see no results. Delivery fast.</li>
    <li> First off, plant based products in general are much more gentle on your skin because they are usually more natural. As someone who has combination sensitive skin, I always look for natural products.  Secondly, oral supplements like this one may reach more cells deep within your face that lotions cannot.  I&#x27;ve used the product for two weeks now and have only seen positive results. I&#x27;ve been on vacation driving in dry California weather in a convertible and my skin has never felt more hydrated.  What&#x27;s different about Sano&#x27;s product is that the supplement includes very low dosages of essential vitamins that are known to improve the quality of your skin without having to worry about getting too many vitamins. Furthermore, they sent me a free vitamin c gel which really improves the tone and evenness of my skin making it look noticeably brighter and silkier In just two weeks use. It has a great cucumber scent and feels cooling and refreshing when I put it on all over my face. It also has peptides in it which my dermatologist recently recommended to look for as an ingredient in anti-aging skin care products. Partnered with 100% money back guarantee, I would definitely buy from Sano again.  It shows they really stand behind their products.</li>
    <li> Love these Phytoceramides+ from Sano Naturals. I&#x27;ve tried other phytoceramide supplements since I watched the segment from Dr. Oz on how to fake a facelift. These have everything I was looking for: 350 mg, plant-derived, and vegan.  That&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> I really feel these are working!~I thank you &amp; God bless!~Penelope</li>
    <li> When I first heard about Ceramides and Phytoceramides on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show, I was skeptical, but decided to try them out for myself.  I came across Sano Naturals&#x27; Phytoceramides on Amazon and placed my order.  I have been taking the capsules for 3 full weeks, and can already see dramatic results.  Small lines that had begun to appear around my eyes and mouth are all but gone.  My skin feels firmer and fuller, and appears more youthful.  If you are looking for an easy, surgery-free way to refresh yourself, you should definitely try this product.  As a side note, the Vitamin C topical gel that they included works great as well.  I dab it on a few key areas of my face--forehead, under-eyes, cheeks, and see instant tightening that lasts all day.  Great products!!</li>
    <li> I developed the most horrible rash on my face and neck while taking this product.</li>
    <li> I like that this product is of natural ingredients and that the capsules are easy to swallow.  I have noticed a more dew like look to my facial skin which took about 12 days to show.  My lines have not disappeared or any other miracle but my skin really does look healthier and better with no make up.  I&#x27;m going to keep going with it in the hope of preventing future aging damage so early on....  I was a sun worshiper and I take lots of strong nasty medication the chemicals in which all add up to lines!!!!</li>
    <li> The only reason I clicked a star was because it is the only way to write a review. This product gave me a horrible rash and I threw it away after using 3 times. I thought it was from mosquitos, but it was from this product. I&#x27;m not allergic to wheat, so there is something in this product that I&#x27;m allergic to.</li>
    <li> I wanted so much to love this product, especially since the woman I talked to at the company was so incredibly nice and helpful.  Unfortunately I did not seeing any results after taking all of it.  And I did not expect anything dramatic.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for someone else, but I&#x27;ve heard great things from them!</li>
    <li> i loved it! made my skin smoother and softer..reduced the bags under my eyes. I&#x27;m 29 and smoke and this really helped</li>
    <li> I started taking them I noticed my joints didn&#x27;t ache anymore.my skin wasn&#x27;t dry and my hair had a lot of volume and shine! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like we&#x27;re they gave me headaches. If it wasn&#x27;t from the headaches I would still be taking them. Other than that I loved them</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my mother (76) and I to try. I had to stop using them because of the wheat content, but she continued through two bottles. By the end of the first bottle she said she definitely saw improvement in her facial skin. She reported that she felt her wrinkles were softening and losing their depth and that her skin was gaining in suppleness. With so many similar products on Amazon, it would be nice if this seller would offer more competitive pricing. I wish that Sano would make a wheat free version. UPDATE: Many months later, my mother continues to use this product and believes in its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have only taken phytoceramides for 30 days and noticed my skin is smoother and less dry. I plan to continue taking them.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because it contains 350mg&lt;br /&gt;Of phytoceramides not like the other products I seen. I&#x27;ve been taking it for 2 monthes and see the difference in my skin. It looks better than it was before. I had deep wrinkles on my forehead and I see them and they are softening. There not as deep as they used to be. I did my daily regime vitamin C, wrinkle cream, eye cream. and moisturizer for monthes and the wrinkles were still there. But when I added this phytoceramides capsules it is making a difference. It does work. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I began trying various anti-aging facial products about 7 years ago when I turned 50.  I&#x27;ve read lots of wonderful reviews of products that don&#x27;t work and so I&#x27;ve become skeptical of these reviews.  I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and already I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks plumper and more hydrated and I have fewer wrinkles.  My husband even told me the other day out of the blue that my skin looked good!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will look like in another few weeks and months.  I should add that I have had no side effects of any kind from this product--in fact I&#x27;ve never felt better--and I do tend to react to any kind of supplement.  Here&#x27;s an update:  after using the product for about a year I decided I would try to get along with out.  Everything was fine for a few months and then I started developing deep lines around my mouth and jowls.  Yikes!  So I&#x27;m back to order more!</li>
    <li> I have been out of my phytoceramides for almost a month and noticed my skin was getting wrinkled again.  I read reviews on Amazon regarding Sano Naturals so decided to give them a try. Also, they are plant derived and have 350mg phytoceramides.  I love the price, the product itself and recommend it highly.  My skin never looked better.  I am 69 years old and people tell me I look like I am in my late 50&#x27;s.  Really worth trying as love price and results!</li>
    <li> geat added skin care vitamin with other skin care vitamins from amazon skin is smooth and beautiful</li>
    <li> I just finished the first jar and am please as I have never been with external formulas. I wish I would see more anti inflammatory due to the red flush of rosacea but am very excited about the texture improvement.  My skin looks plumper and better hydrated. I am on a limited income and the price ma y prove prohibitive. All in all, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> With all that I have read about phytoceramides I decided to give this at least three months to work. I am currently on my third bottle and I see no change at all in texture, plumpness or any visible signs of change whatsoever. Once this bottle is gone I&#x27;m done and this review will remain. If anything should change I will edit this review. I could have spent this money elsewhere and actually been able to SEE what I purchased, however, I wouldn&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t try.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking this a month. Will have to update this review after three months. Will know by then.</li>
    <li> I just started taking phytoceramides about a week ago so its too soon to tell if they work. My hopes are high that I will see a difference in 12 weeks. Delivery was very fast. Will che4ck back in after a month or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a month see a slight difference. I did order another bottle, hoping to see better results</li>
    <li> BEEN ON IT ABOUT A MONTH...ORDERING MORE.  I THINK IT IS HELPING.</li>
    <li> I have been taking sano phytoceramides for approximately 4 months.  I have definitely noticed an increase in skin hydration and some improvement in fine lines.  Husband says that he thinks I look younger than before I started taking the phytoceramides.  I will continue to repurchase the sano phytoceramides for now. A noticeable improvement in the quality of my skin is worth it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It really works!  My face has shown much improvement after using this product.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used.this for two weeks, and because I&#x27;ve been going through a lot of stress, I&#x27;m showing very little diffence.  I blame it on stress and will give it another couple weeks.  I expect, after my stress level lowers and get more than 3 hours of sleep at night, to see more of a change.</li>
    <li> I chose this because of an ad.  Liked the product but a little too pricey  However I will most likely use it again,  Hate those wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Thumbs up -  great product a+ Started to see a difference in my skin  just like they claimed you would !!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these tablets after hearing all the great info regarding phytoceramides !!  When I googled them Sano came up, I read all the great reviews from prior purchasers and I am excited to try these. I will give my feedback after the 30 days...excited to see if I have found the internal fountain of youth !!!!</li>
    <li> The additional moisture in my skin has amazed me after only 2 weeks of taking the capsules.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very dry climate and spend more money on lotion and moisurizers than i do makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait until the wrinkles are all gone.</li>
    <li> Three weeks using it and nothing yet.  I won&#x27;t rate it yet.</li>
    <li> Sorry, haven&#x27;t seen any difference since using this product.  But, I wanted to belie.ve in it, and so far nothing has changed</li>
    <li> while I wasn&#x27;t one of the ones who saw a change instantly, I have been taking now for about 3 weeks and I keep looking in the mirror and thinking, wow, my skin looks really good today...then I realized that it has to be these capsules!  I&#x27;m pretty excited and plan on reordering!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well to keep skin young and healthy,increase moisture.</li>
    <li> Great vitamins in this product for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin supplement product!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome !&lt;br /&gt;Noticed a difference within 2 weeks and it just gets better . Will be purchasing more and  the sano company is very caring .&lt;br /&gt;They do follow ups on the product . A trusted company .</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my first brand of phytoceramides. I&#x27;ve used a couple of different ones and have been exceedingly pleased with the results. This isn&#x27;t a magic pill that you take once and watch as youth ripples up your face and body. It takes time. It was at least a couple of months that I was just popping the pill along with my 25 (exaggeration but not much) other supplements. Then one day I thought -- damn, I look pretty good for 38. Not long after my step daughter literally asked what was up with my face -- she said my skin looked amazing. Saw an ex boyfriend for lunch a few days ago and he said &amp;#34;you look exactly the same as when I met you&amp;#34; which was almost ten years ago. So do they work? Yeah. He** yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific brand I&#x27;ve been using for only a few days. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions and the more youthful appearance I have regained over several months of using ceramides hasn&#x27;t dripped off like candle wax, so I believe they&#x27;re still working. I like that this contains 350 mg of phytoceramides. I am also pleased that the ingredient list is as simple as &amp;#34;phytoceramides, vitamin a, c, d, e&amp;#34;. No fillers or crap listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have gluten in it, so if that&#x27;s an issue for you, check out the potato or rice derived products. However, for me, the gluten isn&#x27;t a huge deal. We do avoid a lot of it, but in this small quantity it isn&#x27;t the end of the world. I&#x27;ve used wheat, rice and potato and honestly, I can&#x27;t tell you that I prefer one over the other. From what I understand, Dr. oz recommended this dosage and type while other types contend that a lower amount of their product is as or more effective. To me, it is still just one pill. If it works, then I&#x27;m down with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the produce for almost over a month.  I see some differences, but like everyone else, you want the magic bullet.  I assume it will improve more with continued usage.  And that’s what I plan to do. Thanks, Sano Naturals.</li>
    <li> In my ongoing efforts to remain young and beautiful forever, well or at least keep my skin smooth and pretty for as long as possible, I&#x27;ve turned my thoughts internally. In the shirt time since I started this blog, I&#x27;ve been offered very imaginable supplement, vitamin, pills for weight loss, muscle gain, gastric distress- the list is endless. Every magic cure that every television doctor ever recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little funny, these people have no way of knowing that I&#x27;m a skeptic at best when it comes to &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; remedies, woo-woo claims of amazing curatives. It reminds me how little real distance there is between our current time and the wild west with its traveling snake oil salesmen, offering hope in a bottle for everything that ails you and most things that don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not immune to the hard facts of science, so I can definitely see how some vitamins and supplements can be beneficial, especially those e lose over time which our bodies have a hard time reproducing. So I was illing to test out this Phytoceramides Skin Supplement from Sano Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t contain any wacky, &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; ingredients. These vegetarian-friendly capsules contain 100% of your needed daily Vitamin A, C, D and E plus Phytoceramides, which are a plant-derived version of the ceramides found naturally in your skin. This supplement helps replenish those ceramides, which leads to better moisture-retention in the skin and helps prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking these capsules for a few weeks, I have started to notice a difference in the overall appearance of my skin. My face seems brighter and less prone to dark circles under the eyes. I had noticed with the summer sun and spending lots of time swimming and gardening- even while wearing SPF moisturizer, my lips were tending to dry out at the corners. Since taking this supplement, that issue has cleared up entirely. I don&#x27;t think two weeks is long enough to judge whether this will be  a long-term help with wrinkles, BUT I can say that I feel it is worth continuing to take to help improve my overall health!. I don&#x27;t think two weeks is long enough to judge whether this will be  a long-term help with wrinkles, BUT I can say that I feel it is worth continuing to take to help improve my overall health!</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference right away. My face seemed more younger. Don&#x27;t let the the price fool you this is better than the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I was wondering if this was one of a lot of those fake advertisings about erasing rinkles. But because of the great supplements facts and although I am not vegetarian I decided to try it. Not even three weeks and I have notice that my rinkles near the eyes and in the mouth area are diminishing. My skin looks brighter and I am delighted with this transformation. With other phytoceramides they caused me headaches but up to date this is working perfect in my body. Will recommend to all my friends. Thank you Sano.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and they really do work...I knew this because my skin got drier after I ran out</li>
    <li> It good for me thank you</li>
    <li> waiting to see a miracle</li>
    <li> My fave part about this is the bottle. It looks like a lotion bottle and feels classier then  big plastic pill bottle on my counter. Plus you know the product working incredibly is always a plus too :P</li>
    <li> I have already seen results after only four weeks and I am almost sixty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for about 4 months now and I am very happy with the way my skin looks so healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that here is something that works from the inside out!!!</li>
    <li> Great supplement!  This a wonder for me.  I used to have 3 chins when I weighed 400 lbs.  I had a gastric bypass, lost quite a&lt;br /&gt;lot of weight but my chin shrank into a small wattle hanging vertically.  Phytoceramides have tightened and lifted that wattle to&lt;br /&gt;the point where it no longer concerns me.  I walked by a mirror about a month after I started treatment and I could not believe&lt;br /&gt;how much better I looked!  Anyone should try your product.  Also my arms are not as jiggly.  I hope this is a product review and&lt;br /&gt;please send any info you have about your other products.  Thank you very much!  My neck and chin are extreme;y grateful!</li>
    <li> I have been using SANO Naturals&#x27; phytoceramides for the past 6 weeks.  I do see a difference and I feel better about how my face looks.  I&#x27;m 59 years old and am seeing all kinds of changes with the aging process.  I&#x27;ve read a lot about phytoceramides and its benefits.  I look at ingredients of the products I buy, and this is the most natural one that I have found which is very important to me.  I plan to continue using the SANO Naturals product, and I would highly recommend it.  I also like the fact that the company asked for my opinion and concerns.  Thank you SANO Naturals.</li>
    <li> Seen noticeable difference</li>
    <li> These are very effective! I have never thought to treat it internally. My skin looks better than ever! I would highly suggest this for anyone with mild to severe acne issues. I am extremely satisfied with it! It may just be one of the best things I have ever reviewed!</li>
    <li> 5.0 out of 5 stars Youth in a capsule!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously received a free bonus of a different brand of phytoceramides with an Amazon purchase at a much lower dosage (I think 50 or 75 mgs (?) of a month supply and saw some change.  After running out of that brand and about 2 weeks later, I found this Sano brand &amp; read their ad &amp; reviews &amp; purchased this one with 350 mgs and with the very fair price of $19.99, I decided to try the Sano brand.  Within a week (or less) I couldn&#x27;t believe the results &amp; I have tried many other types of products &amp; supplements that are &amp;#34;youth enhancing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a female in the over 50 year old category who has been told I have always looked younger than my age until about a year ago when I became ill with an auto-immune condition which has one symptom that affected my skin with ugly pox-like lesions on my arms, legs, &amp; face, even my scalp &amp; soles of my feet! There is no cure, only expensive, toxic dangerous ointments that can cause skin cancer. It can go into remission, but can take a couple of years. It was starting to clear up, but the lesions take very long to heal. After taking about a week&#x27;s worth of Sano 350 mgs,I not only could see healing take place, I could FEEL the healing changes and after completing the month supply, an almost (about 80%) clear face. I plan on continuing this regimen for life. My skin is not only clearer, but it&#x27;s tighter, fine wrinkles are diminishing, and the pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this supplement to women of all skin types. This supplement (which from Sano is really inexpensive) is priceless) &amp; also is so reassuring to know it&#x27;s totally natural &amp; something our own body&#x27;s make anyway--but like most things diminishes with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank Sano for this very affordable excellent product &amp; really hope that your company will continue to keep your price at this very fair price in the future especially for those of us who will be reordering it every 30 days or so.  I plan to spread the word to all my friends, family, &amp; coworkers about your specific name &amp; product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DMC</li>
    <li> Not sure how or why it works, I just know that it has repaired my dehydrated old lady hands😀 lots of vitamins too. Makes me wonder what great things are happening inside.</li>
    <li> Noticing a difference after the first several weeks.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took them, the first difference I noticed was that my skin felt more hydrated, like I had applied a moisturizer even though I wasn&#x27;t.  It was an overall effect, not localized to my face. Since the supplement circulates through the bloodstream, I noticed my legs and back felt smoother, and my skin looked brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it highly!  Shivaun Palmer</li>
    <li> I really like what this product has to offer for ingredients. It is gluten free, vegan friendly, and overall high quality with the other active ingredients. I would feel safe taking this supplement and would recommend it to anyone looking for a product to help improve the quality and appearance of their skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Looking much better. Less lines and wrinkles.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Phytoceramides free in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;“A famous doctor on T.V., as well as many other dermatologists, consider 350 mg of Wheat-Derived Phytoceramides to be a &amp;#34;Facelift in a Bottle.&amp;#34; That T.V. Doctor even named it his #2 Secret to &amp;#34;Drop a Decade From Your Face&amp;#34; (#1 is Topical Vitamin C!) The main ingredient in Plant-Derived Ceramides replenishes the ceramides that your skin loses over time. Studies have shown that Phytoceramides can increase moisture retention which drastically affects the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.”&lt;br /&gt;I use Phytoceramides on a daily basis to skin health. They do an amazing job of minimizing fine lines and wrinkles, help with elasticity and prevent aging and giving your skin an all-around healthy glow. The come in capsule form that is easy to take without any gross after taste. I take it dialy for added benefit. I feel like I am doing good for my body and my by taking this supplement. I recommend to anyone looking to improve their skin health. You won’t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone wanting their skin to be less dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sano Phytoceramides for 3 months and have noticed an improvement in the deep wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t  noticed anything yet.</li>
    <li> This product has far surpassed all my expectations. I think today, is my 9th day taking it. I definitely notice softening of the fine lines around my eyes. The area that has been most shocking , has been my neck area. I am not a big person(5&#x27;2&amp;#34;-118lbs). But, at 53, my neck skin has become loose. This is where I have seen the most improvement . It hasn&#x27;t helped my jowls. I suspect only a knife could fix these things. I can only pray that improvements continue . I will be taking them. I&#x27;m going to stick with the Sano, since that is the brand I ordered. I don&#x27;t want to rock the boat! Very pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> Hoping to get the benefits of plump skin. Too early to tell. Taking a proactive skin care approach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking one every morning, and they really do appear to be smoothing out my fine lines.  I&#x27;m going to keep using them!</li>
    <li> I am not one for taking pills of any kind but I think these did help my complexion. I used these in combination with other SANO facial products and the results together made my face look much clearer, smoother, and even toned.</li>
    <li> one of the best brands of the market for sure but I keep trying other ones</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through this product and didn&#x27;t get the full results I expected. Will continue to shop around.</li>
    <li> cost to much to reorder - guess you could possibly see some noticeable results if you used it for 90 days to 6 months.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t taken this for very long but it seems to be good for my skin so far. I need to use it for a while before I will know for sure.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have extremely bad psoriasis on my hands and feet. After using this product for 30 days my skin began to heal and now I have crazy soft skin with no deep cracks or shedding. I live in the very far north where the air is dry and winters are most hard on folks with dry skin. Give this product a chance. It has the recommended 350 mgs of ceramides.</li>
    <li> After using for 12 weeks, I can see absolutely no difference.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This has been the best product I have purchased in a long time. I get complements on my skin quite a lot. Thank you. I intend to purchase again and again. JR</li>
    <li> I have noticed a marked difference in my skin since beginning Phytoceramides. I use it along with good facial products and have noticed that my 57 year old skin is really much more soft, and fewer lines. Great product!</li>
    <li> Best price (I researched extensively). Bought it for hair/skin help - after a few weeks, can honestly state nails/hair/skin improvement. This is definitely on my &amp;#34;reorder list.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this product because you are getting the right amount of Phytoceramides in each pill and they are really high quality and a lower price than others I have seen . they also come in a really cute jar and ship quickly. I would not be without a Phytoceramide product being 54  I love what they do for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample so I could do a blog post for them and make an informed review but my opinions are my own if you want your skin to look great you should give these a try .</li>
    <li> I have been on a hair journey - a journey to grow my hair out, it&#x27;s been on ongoing thing for a while now. My hair does not grow very fast at all, that is until I was introduced to vitamin supplements with ingredients specifically formulated for hair. While this supplement isn&#x27;t necessarily marketed as a hair supplement, it has key vitamins that aid in hair growth. When I take this supplement along with my biotin supplement my hair grows at a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; pace, you&#x27;re probably thinking \\&quot;what&#x27;s so great about normal growth?\\&quot; if your hair grew as slowly as mine has for the last several years that would be very exciting! Now if you have hair that already grows at a normal rate you might achieve even better results.    Since I have been taking high quality vitamins like Phytoceramides and B vitamins I have noticed that when I go outdoors my skin does not burn - it may turn red after being in the sun but it turns into a lovely sun kissed glow. Tanning is not something I have been able to achieve since I was a teenager (I think pregnancy must have done a number on me several years ago). I don&#x27;t know for sure that the vitamins are what has made the tan possible, but I haven&#x27;t changed anything else that would make it possible.    The Sano Naturals Phytoceramides is a 30 day supply yet the bottle is an excellent size for traveling with!    If you have tried your fair share of vitamin supplements you know they are not all the same. I prefer my vitamins to be in capsule form making it easier for my body to absorb them - the Sano Naturals Phytoceramides is top notch delivering the benefits that I need!    Disclosure: I received this product for free to try and review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and I am excited to continue it and see great results.  I really like that it&#x27;s made with high quality ingredients, such as non-gmo wheat and vegan capsules!  I&#x27;ve had no side-effects at all.  I love the portability of the jar - fits right in my purse.  Great product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have been happy with the product.  I feel my skin has improved and I will continue to use the product.  I have also been pleased with the service you have provided.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> P.S. Writing a review really helps and to make it easier for you, simply use the quote you wrote for us when you responded!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and definitely see a difference.  The lines around my eyes are way less noticeable if not completely gone.  I look rested and more youthful, which is so awesome as I don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep with 2 small babies at home.  I first noticed a difference at the 2 week mark.  I will continue using these and am so happy I finally found something that seems to work!</li>
    <li> I am almost done with my first bottle and feel that while the results are not dramatic (there is no silver bullet that is ever real), I do feel that your phytoceramides are helping to keep my skin plump and looking great. I think as part of healthy living, your product is a great addition. I am always a little nervous trying something new that I put inside my body and your product has proven safe to take and an effective way to supplement my skincare regime so that I look and feel vibrant</li>
    <li> Since receiving these promotionally for review, I have been taking them for a couple of weeks... and I&#x27;m pretty happy with them! These have a big-time anti-aging ingredient -Ceramides. I plan to continue to take these along with using a vitamin C serum on my face. So far so good.    One thing that really stood out for me with this product is that it is produced in an FDA-approved facility  - with this market unregulated, it&#x27;s nice to be able to purchase a product that you know is held to those higher quality standards!</li>
    <li> I think this is working. lol.</li>
    <li> I am now on my second bottle of Sano Phytoceramides 350mg. The only thing I can say is &amp;#34;more please&amp;#34; I now have the same glow to my skin,I thought I lost for good. Use this with their Vitamin C Serum and you now have the dynamic duo for skincare, post cleansing! Customer for life!</li>
    <li> I knew this product was making a difference, but didn&#x27;t realize how much until I ran out! I re-ordered right away.</li>
    <li> I have been taking the product for over a month, no noticeable results yet. will keep you updated.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month.  I&#x27;ve been receiving compliments on my skin, so I am assuming this product is helping the look, and condition of my skin.  I will continue to use Sano Phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> I have taken it for just a little less than a month, no problems, easy to take, possibly my skin is a little more hydrated feeling, will continue to take it and see if notice more improvement.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!! Ive been taking them for a bit less then a month and can already tell a differance in my skin.. it feels more moisturized!! These results are pretty quick, cant wait to see the differance after a few months! Totally worth the price!:)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product, Phytoceramides, for 2 months, everyday, without fail.  I truly like the results -- both inside and out.  I feel good and believe I can start seeing improvements in my complexion.  I plan to continue ordering this product.  Also, in addition to the phytoceramides, it contains 100% of your daily values of Vitamin A, C, D and E so I don&#x27;t bother with the cost of a daily vitamin any longer.  I recommend this product and have found that Amazon and the Sano Naturals company offer the best price for phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> Phytoceramides and the bonus vitamin C cream are a great regimen.</li>
    <li> Can not tell if there any positive changes at this point.</li>
    <li> Phytoceramides help slow the aging process by slowing the reduction of elastin and increasing the fullness of your skin. It prevents your skin from dehydrating and getting that aged leather look. Some people will use a phytoceramide topical cream but it is hard for the skin to absorb the phytoceramides into the deep layers that provide our skin with the fullness and youthful look, so the next best thing is to ingest the phytoceramides so they can get right to work from the inside out. If you are looking a supplement for younger skin and you want to evade the signs of aging and reduce the signs of free radicals on your skin this is a anti aging, wrinkle reducing, hard working supplement.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very good product. I tried another brand, but will likely be purchasing this one again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sano Phytos for about 2.5 months now. I am 31 years old and have begun to see very small lines forming around my eyes. I have also been experiencing dryness under my eyes and an overall dullness to my complexion. The Sano Phytos have made a huge difference! My skin is brighter and my lines have completely disappeared. I look forward to keeping Sano&#x27;s Phytos in my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the company adding extra stuff like Vitamin A, D &amp; E to this but if one is already taking a multi-vitamin or tons of other supplements like me, then he or she needs to be careful about taking too much of Vitamin A.</li>
    <li> I started taking these, using a vitamin C serum, and a daily face peel pad. My skin looks great, but I have since stopped taking these, mostly because I forget and my skin still looks awesome. I attribute it more to the Vitamin C serum and peel pads. I&#x27;m not sure how much these actually did. I am in my mid thirties.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about 6 months...see no difference yet.  Will finish off what I have left, but expections for any improvement are low :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Phytoceramides brands before - off and on for about two years - but honestly feel that the Sano brand has had the most impact on my skin.  I&#x27;m on my 4th month and my skin feels plumper and fine lines are less visible.  I researched the company prior to purchasing and also liked the fact that they only use natural and organically derived ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super happy with the product and am re-ordering another 3 month supply!</li>
    <li> My complexion has a healthier glow since I started taking these about 2-3 months ago</li>
    <li> I took this whole bottle. I cannot say I have noticed extreme skin changes but I did notice that my skin does not need as much moisturizer as before so it is keeping my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been usinf phytoceramides for a year now. I swear by it. My skin is moist and supple</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me but they did refund my money.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a few days.  So far it seems to be working well.</li>
    <li>  I love them. About to order more!!! Would recommend phytoceramides..</li>
    <li> Noticed no change what so ever</li>
    <li> Still awaiting results.</li>
    <li> Was glad to find this product. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the appearance of my skin since starting this supplement. And I must say that Sano&#x27;s customer service is stellar.</li>
    <li> I took this just for a week now and i can notice a great difference in my skin. Though i&#x27;ve used with it as well the other Sano products. I think this is really great and are sold at a much affordable price. I am so happy to have found it and tried it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after viewing the reviews on this product but it really did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Just reordered. Very satisfied with this. As good as the much higher priced products</li>
    <li> Since my fist purchase of Sano Phytoceramides I have reordered every month for 4 months and I have now ordered for the 5th time. I have used both the Sano Naturals Phytoceramides, and the Sano Naturals Vitamin C/HA serum, which comes with a small jar of Vitamin C Eye Cream, with good results from all three products. I plan to continue ordering these monthly as the results from all three have been good: skin seems firmer and smoother. It seems as though the most results came from taking the phytoceramides, but it could be the combination of all three.</li>
    <li> I developed the most horrible rash on my face and neck while taking this product. I was attending a very special event in California and had to cover my face as much as possible with BB cream to tone the redness down. I have never experienced anything like it and would not go near this product again. I only wish I had returned it sooner, during the alloted time. For me, it was a very uncomfortable waste of money.</li>
    <li> The other day someone (another woman) told me I looked 15 years younger!!!  A bit of an exaggeration for sure, but still!!!  I do think my facial lines have smoothed out significantly and I am continuing to use Sano Phytocerimides in the hope that it gets even better.  I am feeling much better about my appearance.  Sano, many thanks for your product!</li>
    <li> I have been taking Phytocersmides (one of two brands used) for about 3 months to help reduce fine lines on face. Product seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I just took it once and developed an allergy, Ive been itching since yesterday, be careful if you&#x27;re sensitive to wheat.&lt;br /&gt;you will itch</li>
    <li> I am 68 years old.  I have been taking Sano for 2 months now and really notice a difference.  My skin is softer and has more moisture.  I have also noticed those little wrinkles have decreased in noticeably.  I&#x27;ve already ordered my next 2 month supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the phyto ceramides supplement.  I love the way it hydrates my skin I can definitely see and feel the difference!</li>
    <li> I am 45 year old in AZ dry hot heat. I have typical liver spots on my face, chest, shoulders and arms. I typically have to put lotion on every single day because of the dry heat. Since I started taking this, about 45 day in it was my husband who first commented on my skin feeling softer than normal...honestly I didn&#x27;t believe him. However I later noticed the skin on my arms feeling significantly softer than I can ever remember! I have been using a vitamin C and A product too on my face so I can&#x27;t say for certain if this has been part of the reduction in the dark spots and the fine lines are lessening for sure! I will certainly be keeping up this regimen I&#x27;m very pleased with the difference over all in my skin.</li>
    <li> THIS CAPSULES ARE REAL GOOD MY SKIN IS MUCH SOFTER&lt;br /&gt;LO RECOMIENDO PARA PIELES MUY SECAS ES MUY BUENO Y PRACTICO</li>
    <li> Although I did receive this product for free, that does not mean that my review is biased. Worth every penny in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing inside and out. The ceramides work from within, and the Vitamin C eye gel is made in hyaluronic acid. It’s so great that I use it all over my face, especially since it’s winter and my skin can use the extra TLC.</li>
    <li> This product is Amazing?  I have tried many different brands but have seen the biggest difference from the Sano Naturals Phytoceramides.  My skin is smoother fine lines have diminished and first time ever my skin glows.</li>
    <li> Best one i found to date. Works extremely well in combo with hyraulonic acid.</li>
    <li> I love the Sano Phytoceramides.  I take them along with the Sano Vitamin C serum and they have improved the tone and texture of my  face.  I would highly recommend these products for anyone wanting to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This was introduced to me by my 44 year old daughter in Fla. she was so impressed with what it has done for her skin, so  I had to try it!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know if it was working because at 73 I didn&#x27;t expect much but I have to tell you it is a miracle product! It has given me smooth skin with great hydration! The lines and wrinkles even at my age are definitely lessened and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the  complete complexion! I definitely will continue to use this product. I had a gray dull look to my skin before I started and that has gone away. My skin all over us healthier than ever. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been taking it for almost a month and I notice a smoother finish to my skin with somewhat less fine lines.</li>
    <li> This SANO product is fairly priced, beautifully packaged and even came with a bonus free eye gel!  I have been taking the capsules for the inside out approach and applying the gel for the outside in :)  Very happy with the product(s) and impressed with this company.</li>
    <li> Even after only a few weeks I can see that my skin looks more clear and radiant. Looking forward to see what long term use will do to my skin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my appearance, but I have noticed a difference in my energy levels.  That tells me to keep using the product, because soon it will show on the outside as well!  Great product and I will definitely be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any major changes so after ordered the second order decided not to reorder at this time</li>
    <li> Would buy again best product out there.</li>
    <li> I am starting to notice a difference already! The lines around my mouth are becoming less deep. With continued use i hope to see more improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can see how my skin looks by using it.</li>
    <li> My skin has improved greatly since I began taking this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference for the skin on my face, but I have cracked feet in the winter, and since i started using this product, I have had no cracks!</li>
    <li> I have been using these phytoceramides for several months and I have noticed that my skin is smoother and brighter and my forehead wrinkles are less pronounced.  I am planning to continue using them as I am pleased with the results. This is the first phytoceramide I have used and I have not noticed any adverse side effects when using this product.</li>
    <li> I received my phytoceramides 350mg two days ago. Hopefully it works and I&#x27;m looking forward in updating my review soon t</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any real results.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite &amp;#34;beauty supplements&amp;#34; as it works from the inside out. I have noticed a significant difference on how my skin looks ever since I started taking this supplement. I look so rejuvenated and my skin looks more plump!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Picutre and the really thing doesn&#x27;t match. Totally ripe off by this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The bottle are super small, not worth the money I paid for it</li>
    <li> Hair and nails are improving, waiting on skin elasticity!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mother to use because she really wanted to try it out and she really likes it. She really started to notice how hydrated and plump her skin began looking. She also noticed the glow she started to have. She was very impressed how these worked so well and so much better than all of the stuff that she is used to putting on her skin. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s an actual product that works from the inside out and is made from only plant based products. So many products are full of artificial and really gross things that is actually really bad for your skin but this is a product that I feel good about my mom using and even me using. Another great thing about this product is when you can&#x27;t drink your eight glasses of water a day this product really helps to keep your skin looking great. It also helps with your nails too which my mom has really seen the results because her nails used to be very brittle and couldn&#x27;t keep a good length without them breaking. However, now she can let them grow out and they look great and they aren&#x27;t brittle and weak like before. She really loves this supplement.</li>
    <li> I am 44 years old and a skin-care fanatic. While I don&#x27;t have visible wrinkles yet, all the positive reviews here encouraged me to give phytoceramides a try, more for prevention than correction. I started taking these each morning with breakfast and after about 3 weeks, just started noticing the my face just looks &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.....smoother, more hydrated.....not like I had a facelift or anything.....just &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.  I even had a friend I haven&#x27;t seen in months tell me I looked different, but in a good way. She couldn&#x27;t put her finger on what it was and said I looked great! I just re-ordered another 2 month supply and am looking forward to even more improvement with continued use. There are no side effects of the pill itself. Other than an improved and more rested look, I can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m taking anything at all. For $20 a month, it is the best money I&#x27;m spending on my appearance!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My skin really looks more youthful!</li>
    <li> Have had no need for Botox so far.</li>
    <li> I was asked by the company to post a review and receive a free bottle but my review here is unbiased. I found the product to be surprisingly effective. Within 4 days the skin dryness disappeared. Close to a month later I was asked for my ID to have a beer (I am 47!) so I knew something had visible changed. I switched to a different brand which had a 2 month supply and additional biotin but noticed within a few days that the benefits from taking Sano naturals were reversing. So I am switching back to Sano! I would recommend the product to anyone looking to reverse the signs of skin aging. You will feel &amp; look different!</li>
    <li> The product works overnight.  I took one capsule before the first night.  The next morning, I felt my face is moisture. The second morning, my face and my hands skin looks younger.  I don&#x27;t think that vitamin in the capsules works out my skin since I take much higher dosage A, C, E and D every day.  It is phytoceramides!  I expected to see result after two to three month since I am 57. Anyway, my wrinkles are still there. It needs more time to kill it. Now I only take it for four days.&lt;br /&gt;But I got rashes on my neck. My face is itching and a little swollen on the fourth day I use it. I think I am allergic to wheat.  So I have to stop. I give 5 stars is to tell you that is a great product if you are not allergic to wheat.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, SANO customer service is great. They replied my email right away even if at night time.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> Needed a supplement that is essential to delivering moisture to the body from the inside out.  This product offered just that.</li>
    <li> Some background information may be helpful here. I turn 35 in a couple of months. Never had ANY type of acne until the last few months. I have tried so many forms of treatments without any success. I have extremely sensitive facial skin which is becoming oilier by the day. A couple of weeks ago, I started DIY facial treatments. Organic coconut oil did not work for me. Raw organic honey which was touted as the best thing since sliced bread actually made my face darker by almost a shade. I was so discouraged. One of my co-workers told me that my face did not look good at all. So I came back to the drawing board ( Amazon ) and started looking for other ways to deal with my skin issues. I buy from Amazon almost weekly and try to scan all reviews before making purchases. I stumbled onto Phytoceramides by SANO after adding their Vitamin C serum in my cart. It was delivered promptly ( thanks Amazon Prime ) and I have been taking it ever since. I know I am not imagining things when I say that I am glowing. Every time I walk by the mirror, I stop and look at myself. My skin is very soft, no new breakouts. Here is my disclaimer: I started working out the same day I started taking these pills. I am drinking insane amounts of water. I am using the Vitamin C serum from SANO and a new moisturizer from Era Organics. I have taken Nature&#x27;s Bounty hair/skin gummies for almost 2 months. Time to throw them out! My new routine seems to be working and I will stick with it.</li>
    <li> Noticed a huge difference in the overall appearance of my skin. Not just my face but all over! Skin tone is softer and smoother!</li>
    <li> I just got done with my first bottle and I am seeing a difference. Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product! Reordering.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of phytoceramides and at 58, I do not have very many wrinkles. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I am 59 years old and never had so many compliments on my skin.  One women I haven&#x27;t seen in years asked if I had a facelift!</li>
    <li> great product you cannot go wrong with it. Perfect for the skin, I will use it again and again.</li>
    <li> I was suprised my daughter was like u have a glow to u whats new? Well I dont know then I was like well... I have been taking this suppliment ..... its working and I do feel younger too!</li>
    <li> Love product! Will get again.</li>
    <li> Good thing I don&#x27;t have to pronounce this product or I would fail. I was the person who always wondered why the movie stars got face lifts. Now I now, they want to make more movies and earn more money. Fans want to see their movie stars at their best. Now, the normal person can take these tablets and make their features look better. My aunt tried this product. She spends a ton of time out in the sun gardening. She has a lot of dried skin on her face and neck. She tried this and noticed changes over a couple of weeks. I mean there was nothing dramatic, but you could see improvements in her face and on her neck. She believes if she continues to take the product, her face and neck will look twenty years younger. I learned from her not to spend so much time in the hot sun.</li>
    <li> A wonderful way to beautiful skin and hair.  I noticed that my eye brows looked fuller and had more color.  My hair looks fuller.  My skin glows.  I haven,t used any face makeup in the last two weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Works very well.  I just bought another bottle and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 days, and I have noticed that the lines on my face do not seem so prominent. I also am eating a healthy diet along with it, but I know I will continue to update you guys on any new results that I obtain! Oh yeah, my skin is so soft also! I am not sure if that is supposed to be one of the benefits or not.</li>
    <li> Good product! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product one month with no results.  I will try a second month and thats it.</li>
    <li> talking about a magic here it is</li>
    <li> I love these I really feel like it helps fill in lines in my face. I am 26 and grew up in the sun with very little to no sunscreen. I believe the key of these is to buy great quality and keep it up. I have worked these into my daily vitamin routine. They also offer a free bottle for a review or five dollars off your next purchase. Amazing service!!</li>
    <li> I have had several people tell me I look great. They say my skin looks fabulous....and they ask what I use. I&#x27;m not shy. I tell them it is the &amp;#34;Sano&amp;#34; phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> These help heal my psoriasis outbreak when a Dr. wrongly prescribed me antibiotics for Mono I broke out in a severe rash that ruined my skin for over a year. These are the only pills that help heal my skinbinside and out. Im on my third month only my arms still have a rash and so far nothing including 3 hospital visits and thousand dollarsbin every skin care you can imagine wouldnt touch it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Seeing some positive results and definitely will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> The bottle is packaged well. The pills look to be high quality. A bit bigger than I like but no problems swallowing. I love how phytoceramides keep my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Almost a month in and noticing some small changes. Skin looks brighter, feels softer and skin looks like it&#x27;s starting to clear up. Too soon to give an in depth review so I&#x27;ll be back in a couple more weeks to give an update!</li>
