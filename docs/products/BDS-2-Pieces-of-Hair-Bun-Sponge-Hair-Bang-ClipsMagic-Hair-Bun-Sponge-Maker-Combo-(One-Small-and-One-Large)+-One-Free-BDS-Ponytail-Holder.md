      <li>Very cheap.</li>
      <li>Get it, use it, love it.</li>
      <li>Bun maker with donut sponge and bobby pins if better buy...</li>
      <li>Cheap product!  </li>
      <li>I think the doughnut they offer in amazon as well works better.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Hairagami for a while and love it.  </li>
      <li>I have super healthy hair, which is nice, except when I try to put it in any sort of bun.</li>
      <li>These peices do make a very clean neat bun, PERFECT FOR MILITARY hair standards!    </li>
      <li>It looks like a cheap wire and cloth on the top of it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>I am able to make great hair buns with this, but still need to use a hair net over it.</li>
      <li>As a hair stylist, it isn&#x27;t easy for me to even use.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>These are easy to use and a great, quick hairdo even up in a high bun.</li>
      <li>I got this primarily to try to achieve beachy waves and avoid blowdrying.</li>
      <li>of cheap foam.</li>
      <li>These hair spounges are made cheaply, it is a metal wire covered in  cheap spounge.</li>
      <li>I had an original one years ago</li>
      <li>If you put hair up damp, and let dry it works great.</li>
      <li>The order came within days of ordering and product looks true to the picture online.</li>
      <li>I can do so much with my hair now, it is like magic.</li>
      <li>I just purchased this recently, and it creates a really good bun.</li>
      <li>These bun makers work great, but my hair is too heavy and they pull out easily</li>
      <li>Shipped super fast!!</li>
      <li>I love these, just wish they were made of a thicker metal so they would last longer like the original.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I think the product is really good</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold the hair right.</li>
      <li>the trick (for me, it&#x27;s easier/better without pulling hair into a ponytail)&lt;br /&gt;-It holds pretty well; morning to afternoon without any clips, pin, or hair product&lt;</li>
      <li>One of them broke at first use.  </li>
      <li>I am a professional hair stylist, I thought this item was pretty cool.</li>
      <li>No issues with seller, shipping was fast</li>
      <li>It looks like a unknown shaped piece of fabric landed on the top of my hair.</li>
      <li>highly recommend</li>
      <li>It is beginning to show wear , but I think it has a few more months of bending to do.</li>
      <li>Worked awesome, stays in thin short hair as well as long think hair.</li>
      <li>Only thing I wish was that this would stay closed better.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length very thin, fine hair and have never been able to fix it myself.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I found Hairagami at my local pharmacy and am going back to it!</li>
      <li>But even they have gone to a thinner metal and don&#x27;t last as long as the original.  </li>
      <li>Nice idea, but didn&#x27;t work on my long, straight, thick Asian hair.</li>

<li> Nice idea, but didn&#x27;t work on my long, straight, thick Asian hair.</li>
<li> Its cheaply made, product is very poor quality, hard to fix in place, sponge tore right away....</li>
<li> It might work, but not for long hair.</li>
<li> I had hoped this might work, but the thick, straight ends of my hair kept sticking out.</li>
<li> My bun had all kids of loose ends and strangling hairs poking out.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t get it to work on dry or wet hair.</li>
<li> The other one I didn&#x27;t even bother with.  </li>
<li> not worth the money.</li>
<li> My hair is very long and very heavy.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have long hair, but it works well for my daughter since her hair is not so thick.</li>
<li> The instructions are very vague and it is hard to roll, there is nothing you can secure it with</li>
<li> get 2 pieces (1 big &amp; 1 small) for the price of 1 Hairagami, though the small is too small for me</li>
<li> will fall out of the bun as you are twisting it up and have to use a few pins.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have layers throughout my ends, but I&#x27;ve given up trying to make it work.</li>
<li> Profile:&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thick hair, past shoulder length.</li>
<li> mine is thick.  </li>
<li> It looks so bad that I couldn&#x27;t go in public with that device on my head.</li>
<li> It is has broken&amp; out of stock.</li>
<li> It is worse.</li>
<li> Not for thin hair.</li>
<li> but my hair is so thin that it would never work, so I ordered this hoping it would help and it did.</li>
<li> Too bad.</li>
<li> Hate it.</li>
<li> Hate this product.</li>
<li> Horrible product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hate this product. I am a professional hair stylist, I thought this item was pretty cool. Horrible product. As a hair stylist, it isn&#x27;t easy for me to even use. Very cheap product. No issues with seller, shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I just purchased this recently, and it creates a really good bun. I like it. It&#x27;s easy to use. Not only that, but it creates perfect buns.</li>
    <li> Great service and nice product. The order came within days of ordering and product looks true to the picture online.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best bun maker I&#x27;ve found and I manage a dance studio with over 900 kids.  Get it, use it, love it.</li>
    <li> Profile:&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thick hair, past shoulder length. I&#x27;ve used Hairagami for a while and love it.  Lost the item and haven&#x27;t found it in local retail, so I decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Does the trick (for me, it&#x27;s easier/better without pulling hair into a ponytail)&lt;br /&gt;-It holds pretty well; morning to afternoon without any clips, pin, or hair product&lt;br /&gt;-You get 2 pieces (1 big &amp; 1 small) for the price of 1 Hairagami, though the small is too small for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Made of cheap foam. I suspect it will rip quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Wiring doesn&#x27;t seem durable at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lukewarm about the product.  Luckily, I found Hairagami at my local pharmacy and am going back to it!</li>
    <li> I am able to make great hair buns with this, but still need to use a hair net over it. This is because my daughter&#x27;s hair is layered, so to keep all the hair in a bun, I need to use a bun net.  Only thing I wish was that this would stay closed better.</li>
    <li> I love these, just wish they were made of a thicker metal so they would last longer like the original.  But even they have gone to a thinner metal and don&#x27;t last as long as the original.  I use these daily and the one I an on now I have been using for about a year now.  It is beginning to show wear , but I think it has a few more months of bending to do.</li>
    <li> Very cheap. I would buy it again not even for 10 cents</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the product several times, and I just can&#x27;t get it to make a bun with my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have layers throughout my ends, but I&#x27;ve given up trying to make it work.</li>
    <li> I got this primarily to try to achieve beachy waves and avoid blowdrying. If you put hair up damp, and let dry it works great. These are easy to use and a great, quick hairdo even up in a high bun. I&#x27;ve found they work the best on longer hair, or hair will fall out of the bun as you are twisting it up and have to use a few pins.</li>
    <li> These hair spounges are made cheaply, it is a metal wire covered in  cheap spounge. I can tell that the spounge with deteriorate soon. They were, however, inexpensive. These peices do make a very clean neat bun, PERFECT FOR MILITARY hair standards!    I will not purchase this brand again, but will purchase this type of item when these ones wear out.   Shipped super fast!!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length very thin, fine hair and have never been able to fix it myself.  These are very simple to use -- I can&#x27;t say that I get a &amp;#34;going out to dance&amp;#34; quality bun but I get my hair up and out of my way and that&#x27;s what I was after.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother.  Doesn&#x27;t hold hair at all and mine is thick.  I can&#x27;t get it to work on dry or wet hair.</li>
    <li> It might work, but not for long hair. Other than that, I think the product is really good and it will be awesome for many customers.</li>
    <li> You will probably find these in the dollar stores in another couple of months.  Save your money till then !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been trying to master the sock bun for ever but my hair is so thin that it would never work, so I ordered this hoping it would help and it did. Worked awesome, stays in thin short hair as well as long think hair. highly recommend</li>
    <li> I just could not use it. The instructions are very vague and it is hard to roll, there is nothing you can secure it with I think the doughnut they offer in amazon as well works better.</li>
    <li> Cheap product!  One of them broke at first use.  The other one I didn&#x27;t even bother with.  Bun maker with donut sponge and bobby pins if better buy...</li>
    <li> Honestly. It looks like a cheap wire and cloth on the top of it. It looks so bad that I couldn&#x27;t go in public with that device on my head. Whoever invented THIS wasn&#x27;t a woman. It doesn&#x27;t hold the hair right. It looks like a unknown shaped piece of fabric landed on the top of my hair. Hate it. It went to the trash bin.</li>
    <li> Excelent price. Wonderful product. I love it I can do so much with my hair now, it is like magic.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t hold my hair no matter what I used to help.  My bun had all kids of loose ends and strangling hairs poking out.</li>
    <li> My hair is very long and very heavy. These bun makers work great, but my hair is too heavy and they pull out easily</li>
    <li> Its cheaply made, product is very poor quality, hard to fix in place, sponge tore right away....not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Nice idea, but didn&#x27;t work on my long, straight, thick Asian hair. I have super healthy hair, which is nice, except when I try to put it in any sort of bun. I had hoped this might work, but the thick, straight ends of my hair kept sticking out. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I had got HairDini. I loved it. It is has broken&amp; out of stock. This one is not the same thing! It is worse. Not for thin hair.</li>
    <li> I had an original one years ago and I loved it. This one is junk!!! It is much thinner and the metal inside feels like if you bend it into a bun a few times it will break.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have long hair, but it works well for my daughter since her hair is not so thick.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly. The problem is, I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it. It is probably going to end up in the trash.</li>
