<ol>
      <li>Perfect! !</li>
      <li>This is the best bleach I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Works beautifully!!</li>
      <li>I was just lightening it to put another dye on it though, so it worked perfectly for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product, great price, arrived promptly and in perfect shape!</li>
      <li>Has great lift though</li>
      <li>Work great on my hair.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the product is great, works great.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I would say if your hair is any longer than shoulder length, you would benefit greatly from just going to a beauty store</li>
      <li>, money wise.</li>
      <li>however the parts that were covered adequately were perfect.</li>
      <li>I love Amplified lighteners!</li>
      <li>The results were amazing.</li>
      <li>But be sure to use if you hair is in good condition otherwise it will fry it.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this is my favorite bleach.</li>
      <li>Very strong.</li>
      <li>Just needs to add more bleach to the packet..</li>
      <li>Your mileage may vary, of course, but my skin was able to handle it okay.</li>
      <li>The top is longer  </li>
      <li>Worked well: )</li>
      <li>more is always better.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>great product, fast delivery</li>
      <li>I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the bleach works great and is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re going to leave it on for awhile, make sure you check it every now and then and get it moist again if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>in mind, since this stuff is so strong it&#x27;s gonna smell and tingle your scalp.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a good product that works if you are careful and buy more than one.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely true</li>
      <li>(Side bar: they really do need to put more product in....</li>
      <li>Still need to use it with a toner of some sort to get that true blond feel -</li>
      <li>Make sure to mix really well or the bleach will crumble and fall off of hair.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping and the product works well, thank you.</li>
      <li>I was really impressed by how effective it was, and it left hardly any orange tint in my hair at all.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery and super easy instructions.</li>
      <li>I learned that 40 volume is super damaging for hair (hahaha!), but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>After using the first box it came out almost perfect but with shades from yellow to white platinum blonde.</li>
      <li>This bleach gave me a medium reddish brown, which is exactly what I wanted to achieve before dying my hair purple.</li>
      <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a problem.</li>
      <li>It was my first time home bleaching my hair to ready it for Manic Panic hair color--and while I didn&#x27;t fry my hair or nothing untoward happened, I think I will probably stick to saving up and getting it done in a salon, as I think a professional would know how to get my hair super pale-blond so that the color I choose will go on evenly.</li>
      <li>I really liked this product because it came with a little container for mixing and brush for application.</li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>
      <li>(I have naturally light brown hair) and the rest of my hair, blonde and a bit orange in some places since I have dyed my hair a lot.</li>
      <li>so I reccomend it highly!</li>
      <li>It got my roots to a really light blonde.</li>
      <li>Thanks for resending the package.</li>
      <li>It lightens it very well.</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars if it were a better value - two boxes only covered about two thirds of my hair, which barely goes to my shoulders.</li>
      <li>My hair wasnt nearly as dry and damaged as bleaches I get at sally&#x27;s as well as how light it got in just one bleaching.</li>
      <li>I have tried other bleaches and this is definitely the most effective for my dark hair.</li>
      <li>I experienced only slight damage as I brought it from very dark brown to a brassy yellow color on top of which I will be dying to a platinum blonde/white color.</li>
      <li>I am quite annoyed because a have been a loyal fan of manic panic for many years and</li>
      <li>Overall this bleach is really really great, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the kits are really small.</li>
      <li>Perfect for rocking platinum or pre lightening for crazy color!</li>
      <li>I had medium brown hair and a hot head--I ended up with almost white roots, but a golden/brassy blond at the roots.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve left bleach on for a long time before, and could never get it to be really light.</li>
      <li>How many boxes would it take for hair halfway down my back</li>
      <li>I would say definitely, if you are doing anything more than a couple of streaks or you have very very short hair, you should need to buy 2 or 3 kits, depending on how long your hair is.</li>
      <li>I will make it clear and say I have not used the product yet, having said that, I will not judge the quality of the bleach.</li>
      <li>Ive been bleaching my hair and doin an array of manic panic colours for around 4 years and this bleach is by far the quickest.</li>
      <li>so if you have thick or longer than chin length hair buy more than one.  </li>
      <li>but then again my hair is normally super dark.</li>
      <li>It works fast so you don&#x27;t need to keep it on as long.</li>
      <li>(My roots ended up wonderfully hot pink, but the ends are almost faded now because the ends were darker.)</li>
      <li>Worked fast and didn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>youd think I was born blonde or had it professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>So, the first time I bleached, being an inexperienced person with bleaching, I didn&#x27;t wait long enough as I freaked out</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally black and this can take it down to a really light yellow which is a great base for colour.</li>

<li> My hair is naturally black and this can take it down to a really light yellow which is a great base for colour.</li>
<li> Mine was super dry because I have thick and curly hair.</li>
<li> I bought splat lightning bleach from Walmart, the boxes were defective and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, bought these with my reimbursement, and didn&#x27;t have to have it in very long for my hair to be the blonde I wanted!</li>
<li> I dyed my hair jet black in february, then let it fade completely until about a week ago.</li>
<li> (was bleaching dark brown roots and stripping blue/ 2 year old pink from hair)</li>
<li> I bought two boxes because I have long hair, but I still ran out.</li>
<li> only complaint is that the product does not go very far.</li>
<li> Got my dark brown curly hair to gold blonde with just one application -</li>
<li> My hair went down to mid-back, and I think maybe 2 boxes might not have been enough...</li>
<li> My hair was black and it made it blonde.</li>
<li> I use it before I dye my hair pink.</li>
<li> My hair was a dyed blue black, and I am going to dye it dark purple.</li>
<li> And by short I mean the sides and back are no more then 3 inches long.</li>
<li> I waited a week to add the other box</li>
<li> Its also not as drying as other brands</li>
<li> However definitely need to buy at least 2,  boxes..</li>
<li> I naturally have dark brown hair, and have tried to bleach it before with poor results.</li>
<li> And I mean completely blonde.</li>
<li> I have really dark brown, almost black hair.</li>
<li> and I would say this stuff is only slightly worse than just dying your hair.</li>
<li> noticed the product dried out while it was sitting on my hair, and seemed to quit working.</li>
<li> There is very little in the pack though</li>
<li> /&gt;I got quite a bit of this stuff on my skin, and while it was uncomfortable, it didn&#x27;t leave any permanent damage.</li>
<li> I read reviews on this product like crazy</li>
<li> Very frustrated with this product.</li>

    <li> My girlfriend: &amp;#34;So I learned that 40 volume is super damaging for hair (hahaha!), but it gets the job done. Just remember: do your roots LAST! I really liked this product because it came with a little container for mixing and brush for application. My hair went down to mid-back, and I think maybe 2 boxes might not have been enough... more is always better.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> One pack had leaked developer when I  received  it. Has great lift though</li>
    <li> Very frustrated with this product. I will make it clear and say I have not used the product yet, having said that, I will not judge the quality of the bleach. However, neither of my boxes contained the mixing tube, hair cap, or cloves. I am quite annoyed because a have been a loyal fan of manic panic for many years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a problem. Do not make a promise that you cannot deliver.</li>
    <li> fried  off my hair. lost lots of hair.  left it on for 90 mins. carrot orange hair</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and the product works well, thank you.</li>
    <li> Will buy again if need to</li>
    <li> I love Amplified lighteners! Perfect for rocking platinum or pre lightening for crazy color!</li>
    <li> Works great. However definitely need to buy at least 2,  boxes.. My hair is fairly short and I bought 2 boxes thinking it&#x27;d be enough. It wasn&#x27;t. And by short I mean the sides and back are no more then 3 inches long. The top is longer  (i had it under cut)  and one box want enough to cover everything. Otherwise the product is great, works great. Just needs to add more bleach to the packet.. (was bleaching dark brown roots and stripping blue/ 2 year old pink from hair)</li>
    <li> Work great on my hair. and covers a lot. But be sure to use if you hair is in good condition otherwise it will fry it.</li>
    <li> It works fast so you don&#x27;t need to keep it on as long. Still need to use it with a toner of some sort to get that true blond feel - but then again my hair is normally super dark.</li>
    <li> How many boxes would it take for hair halfway down my back</li>
    <li> Worked fast and didn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Make sure to mix really well or the bleach will crumble and fall off of hair.</li>
    <li> Ive been bleaching my hair and doin an array of manic panic colours for around 4 years and this bleach is by far the quickest. There is very little in the pack though and you do have to coat hair throughly so if you have thick or longer than chin length hair buy more than one.  My hair is naturally black and this can take it down to a really light yellow which is a great base for colour. Its also not as drying as other brands so I reccomend it highly!</li>
    <li> My hair was black and it made it blonde. Perfect! ! Thank you !! I mixed it with coconut oil so my hair wouldnt break off. Worked well: ) my hair is blue now with highlights</li>
    <li> great product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Thanks for resending the package. I am highly satisfied with this product. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this product like crazy and I read a lot of reviews from people who fried their hair. I was nervous, but wanted to give it a shot anyway. So, the first time I bleached, being an inexperienced person with bleaching, I didn&#x27;t wait long enough as I freaked out I would kill my hair. I ended up looking like a tiger however the parts that were covered adequately were perfect. (Side bar: they really do need to put more product in....it&#x27;s not enough. I thought people were just blowing smoke up their ass but it&#x27;s definitely true my hair is just above my shoulders and it wasn&#x27;t enough.) Anyway, the second bleaching where I did a touch up I covered the rest of my bases and I got it to where I needed it. I would say definitely, if you are doing anything more than a couple of streaks or you have very very short hair, you should need to buy 2 or 3 kits, depending on how long your hair is. I would say if your hair is any longer than shoulder length, you would benefit greatly from just going to a beauty store a buying everything separately, money wise. Otherwise, the bleach works great and is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, since this stuff is so strong it&#x27;s gonna smell and tingle your scalp. IT&#x27;S BLEACH! But, it&#x27;s tolerable. I have been dying my hair for years and I would say this stuff is only slightly worse than just dying your hair. All in all, it&#x27;s a good product that works if you are careful and buy more than one. I experienced only slight damage as I brought it from very dark brown to a brassy yellow color on top of which I will be dying to a platinum blonde/white color.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this is my favorite bleach. I use it before I dye my hair pink. I have really dark brown, almost black hair. It lightens it very well.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully!! And the cap and gloves are in the tub, so don&#x27;t worry when you open the box and don&#x27;t see them. My hair was a dyed blue black, and I am going to dye it dark purple. This bleach gave me a medium reddish brown, which is exactly what I wanted to achieve before dying my hair purple. Great product, great price, arrived promptly and in perfect shape!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and super easy instructions. I had medium brown hair and a hot head--I ended up with almost white roots, but a golden/brassy blond at the roots. It was my first time home bleaching my hair to ready it for Manic Panic hair color--and while I didn&#x27;t fry my hair or nothing untoward happened, I think I will probably stick to saving up and getting it done in a salon, as I think a professional would know how to get my hair super pale-blond so that the color I choose will go on evenly. (My roots ended up wonderfully hot pink, but the ends are almost faded now because the ends were darker.)</li>
    <li> I naturally have dark brown hair, and have tried to bleach it before with poor results. I&#x27;ve left bleach on for a long time before, and could never get it to be really light. I used this and parts of my hair were blonde before I even got all of it covered! I was really impressed by how effective it was, and it left hardly any orange tint in my hair at all. My hair had been dyed multiple times and multiple colors before using this, and it came out a relatively uniform color in the end, despite not having enough product to saturate the ends. I was just lightening it to put another dye on it though, so it worked perfectly for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the product does not go very far. I bought two boxes because I have long hair, but I still ran out. If you have hair to your shoulders, buy two boxes. If it&#x27;s any longer than that, buy three, especially if your hair is thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the product dried out while it was sitting on my hair, and seemed to quit working. I just spritzed a bit of water on it and worked it through, and that seemed to do the trick. So if you&#x27;re going to leave it on for awhile, make sure you check it every now and then and get it moist again if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got quite a bit of this stuff on my skin, and while it was uncomfortable, it didn&#x27;t leave any permanent damage. Your mileage may vary, of course, but my skin was able to handle it okay.</li>
    <li> Very strong. My hair may have been damaged if I didn&#x27;t treat it with coconut oil about an hour before using this. Got my dark brown curly hair to gold blonde with just one application - I want to go lighter but I&#x27;m going to wait a month. I have tried other bleaches and this is definitely the most effective for my dark hair. I would give it 5 stars if it were a better value - two boxes only covered about two thirds of my hair, which barely goes to my shoulders.</li>
    <li> This is the best bleach I have ever used. I dyed my hair jet black in february, then let it fade completely until about a week ago. My hair was at a medium brown when I used manic panic. I left it in for an hour. The results were amazing. It got my roots to a really light blonde. (I have naturally light brown hair) and the rest of my hair, blonde and a bit orange in some places since I have dyed my hair a lot. My hair wasnt nearly as dry and damaged as bleaches I get at sally&#x27;s as well as how light it got in just one bleaching. Overall this bleach is really really great, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the kits are really small. I had to use 2 kits for just one bleaching and my hair is only medium length.</li>
    <li> I bought splat lightning bleach from Walmart, the boxes were defective and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, bought these with my reimbursement, and didn&#x27;t have to have it in very long for my hair to be the blonde I wanted! I used coconut oil as a pretreatment before bleaching and didn&#x27;t have my hair fried afterwards!!</li>
    <li> And I mean completely blonde. After using the first box it came out almost perfect but with shades from yellow to white platinum blonde. I waited a week to add the other box and if it wasn&#x27;t for my roots and eyes borrows youd think I was born blonde or had it professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again, You will need to take time in between dying, it drys out the hair. Mine was super dry because I have thick and curly hair. Will only buy manic panic!</li>
