<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  It came apart after simple use.  This is the first time ever I had a nail clipper faw apart.  It simply is a terrible product.</li>
    <li> Industrial toe nail clippers. gets the job done quickly and easily. The last time I will have to buy toenails clippers unless I am stupid and lose this one.</li>
    <li> We are older and not as limber as we used to be and this  clipper is awesome. The slanted cutting edge makes cutting thick toenails so much easier. Emptying the clippings is not always simple but we don&#x27;t really care about that feature. The difficulty in clipping was our biggest concern and the Mehaz clipper has solved that problem!</li>
    <li> Functions just like it says in the description. Good for those with weaker or problem hand grips. Do keep in mind this clipper can be sharp - found that out the hard way.</li>
    <li> THE BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since toenails are like paper products in an office supply warehouse and come in every thickness imaginable, why not buy a pair that will cut toenails for both Tinker Bell and Big Foot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 pair of professional toenail clippers.  The only one that was suitable for me was the Mehaz Professional Wide Jaw Slant Edge Toenail Clipper which has a jaw opening of 4mm.  It is sharp as a razor and cuts with precision.  The ergonomic design keeps the clipper from slipping in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jaw opening on the other two clippers, including the Seki Edge Toenail Clippers, was only 2mm which is perfect for  FINGERNAIL clippers which is exactly what I use then for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained that these Mehaz Professional Wide Jaw Slant Edge Toenail Clipper clippers fell apart.  They are purposefully designed to easily come apart for cleaning.  Simply hold the jaws together and remove the lever from the pin.  The pin falls free.  To assemble, hold the jaws together, insert the pin and hook the lever in the notch in the end of the pin.  A 6 year old can do it.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you play with it on the beach, you might need a metal detector to find all your parts.</li>
    <li> The Mehaz nail clipper I purchased is sturdily constructed and made of stainless steel. I like the wide jaw feature because it allows me to trim nails that were too thick for a conventional clipper to fit under. The clipper has adequate cutting power and requires only modest pressure to cut through nails. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The only clipper I have found that opens wide enough.</li>
    <li> The Mehaz clipper was purchased from Amazon.  Product looked great and had no obvious defects. However, it would not cut the nails on my big toes due to a design flaw.  Didn&#x27;t provide enough force because of configuration. Men&#x27;s nails become harder with age, and I am a grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The task of packging and delivery was flawless.</li>
    <li> I suggest that the bar that you push to clip your nails be stiffer, (stronger), because if you are cutting through really tough thick nails it bends and sometimes will not allow the clippers to cut all the way through.</li>
    <li> Probably the best toenail trimmer I have owned. I like the feel of it and it trims my nails effortlessly.</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, these clippers don&#x27;t curve at all so it takes some getting used to.  The opening is much larger than the standard skinny opening so you do have the ability to clip slightly thicker than normal nails.  But be careful with that sharp pointy edge, I have already gouged my poor sore ingrown nail twice and man, it hurts like hell when that happens.  I still struggle with trimming even with this product, which as far as I can tell is the best regular-type clipper for the job.  There are not too many alternatives out there for self-care when it comes to badly ingrown, thick toenails... just exercise caution with these!</li>
    <li> I had only used this about 3 times when the whole think fell apart.  I was able to reassemble it only after looking at the picture here on Amazon.  However, I&#x27;m disappointed that it could come apart so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The bottom clipper portion now keeps popping out of the plastic casing so that the whole unit now seems loose and nearly useless. I would now rate this as a single star.</li>
    <li> Rates a 5 in every respect. I already had a clipper similar to this,  but in appearance only. These are easy to use without the Handel flipping around and loosing grip.  The majority of clippings are dispensed into the hollow area behind the blade. Cuts thicker toe nails cleanly, with little effort.  The nail file on the Handel is a real plus. The rubber Handel surfaces are comfortable with  an easy solid grip.  With diabetes, one must keep toe nails groomed without sharp edges to prevent cutting an adjacent toe. These do an admiral job in this and like many others I&#x27;m totally sold.</li>
    <li> Broke after 6 months.</li>
    <li> It was nice to find something to cut my arched toenails.  My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t have a sharp cutting function.  Sometimes leaves the toenail half cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little handicapped and was having a podiatrist clip my toes at 40 bucks a clip (sorry for the pun) and I noticed what he was using, so I investigated them on Amazon and ended up with these (although not what he was using). They came in two days! And they do exactly what they said!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I suggested that Amazon let people know where the store ships from, and now they do. Just right click the store, bam.</li>
    <li> I have several very thick toenails and have had a lot of trouble clipping them.  It&#x27;s gotten worse as I get older.  Most toenail clippers won&#x27;t open wide enough to clip these nails.  I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;wire cutter&amp;#34; type clippers and really hate them.  I found these on line and ordered them.  Now I don&#x27;t have any more trouble with cutting these nails!  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper since the usual ones do not open wide enough to clip my big toe. This one works well. However it does have a straight cut so one must one do several cuts around the toenail.</li>
    <li> BRAVOS to the Mehaz  Professional Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper. The best I&#x27;ve  ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Saved me a hundred dollar visit to the podiatrist  for that big toenail.</li>
    <li> The extra opening does not look like a lot when compared to my old clippers but makes a huge difference in use.  Also the straight angled cutter is good.  Even better would be a pair of these with opposite angles for the jaws.</li>
    <li> It opens as wide as I need it to and is quite sharp. My only complaint is the ange. I need is straight across. Wish I could find one.</li>
    <li> This fine quality  not available locally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for three months, and didn&#x27;t even know that they&#x27;re supposed to catch clippings. Never seen a pair that does. That&#x27;s what a vacuum is for. Anyway, I find these to be great on my left foot since I&#x27;m right handed and the slant is correct for the left side, but they&#x27;re unwieldy for my right foot where you have to twist the clipper awkwardly in order to clip the end of the toenail that would normally be ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp. They don&#x27;t slip (which makes them better than the $24 pair). But, again, they are difficult to use. Maybe I have a clipper disability, but I think someone is missing an opportunity of having a sliding blade so that you don&#x27;t have to turn the darn things upside down for at least one foot.</li>
    <li> Getting older, nails getting thicker, needed something with some oomph, and this thing did the trick.  It replaced a useless product I had recently purchased (for half the price) that looked like wire cutters but wouldn&#x27;t cut anything.    Before that, I was using the scissors on my pocketknife, and that was becoming WAY too hard.  With these new clippers, I can position the blades precisely and with very little pressure, cut all the way through in one go.</li>
    <li> Will agree it does not catch clippings but after buying an expensive  profession type clipper that did not do the job I was so happy with  this that I&#x27;ll gladly pick the clippings up.  It is made to do the job,    stainless steel and hefty, and cuts through the toughest nails.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers!  My elderly Mom can finally clip her hard nails without a lot of force.  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Mehaz Professional Angled Straight Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much better than the &amp;#34;cheapie&amp;#34; style of clipper most of us use. Comfortable to hold &amp; does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, especially if you have arthritis or a hand disability because they are large. Also very sharp. The rubbery grip is easy to grasp. The slanted jaw feature makes cutting toenails a bit easier than regular style clippers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s broken after the first use! Do not buy! such a waste of money! I am so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This will not cut my thick toenails. It simply does not have the power to do so. Also, it began to rust after just one use. This is a grossly overpriced and poorly made clipper. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Works with thick and rounded toenails so much better! All I use now.</li>
    <li> Best clipper ever.  Oversize and well-made.</li>
    <li> Finally.. . for the first time, a nail clipper that does a bang-up job with very little effort, no slipping out of my fingers and no effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these highly.</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY WELL ON THICK NAILS.</li>
    <li> I love these toenail clippers!  They work as described and the wide jaw is definitely WIDE.  The easy grip handle is perfect for troublesome or arthritic hands.  Cut is clean and the job gets done in half the time of regular clippers.  Have ordered a total of 4 pairs of these for myself and other family and friends.</li>
    <li> Cuts thick nails others don&#x27;t work on.  Have had it 3 years with no problems</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  Definitely worth the money spent on it. Can be cleaned/disinfected (after removing the silicone handle and clipper covers) without danger of developing rust.</li>
    <li> I must say this product is GREAT!!!! My boyfriend has very very thick toenails.  This product did what it was suppose to do.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always wondered why nail clippers were curved when you are suppose to cut them straight across to prevent ingrown toe nails.  These are straight and wide and at a slant which makes it easier to cut your nails.  Great product!  Easy to grip too!</li>
    <li> Good clean cuts. Good gripping</li>
    <li> Angled Straight Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper has proven to be an excellent choice.  It is what all the reviews say it is and is very accurate.</li>
    <li> The angle of the clippers means that there is a large hole the clipping-capturing plastic part does not cover, as the plastic is not angled to match (it appears to be the same part as found in Mehaz&#x27;s non-angled clippers). Often the clippings just fly out this gap. Also, the far edges of the blades on the one I received did not meet all the way, resulting incomplete cuts unless only the center part is used. Other areas seemed to be of high quality, but the bad bite of the blades is a pretty fundamental problem.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have known about these clippers about five years ago when I started to have a thickening problem with my toenails. I finally Google&#x27;d wide mouth toe nail clippers and these popped up. Problem solved. These clippers are well made and work great.</li>
    <li> This Toenail Clipper is awesome.  Even if your toenails are thick, this Clipper should do the trick.  It cuts cleanly and is sharp. I was starting to think that on my toes that have thick nails, I would have to go to a professional to have my nails clipped.  Now, this clipper easily clips any of my toenails.</li>
    <li> After trying other toenail clippers that were ineffective for various reasons, this one was a pleasant surprise.  It is worth every penny.  It is sturdy and sharp and just perfect as far as I am concerned.  Wish I&#x27;d found it a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I was actually excited the first time I ever cut my toenails with this set of clippers.  I have had many clippers through the years, but have never cut my toenails with the ease that this set affords.  I liked them so much that I bought a set for my mother and sister, who have the same tough and brittle nails that I do.  We all love them.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother who has trouble with thick nails and she loves it! I&#x27;m not sure how it differs from other clipers (it looks the same to me) but my mom is singing its praises.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase of the Mehaz Professional Angled Clippers.  They work wonderfully on thick nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this one star because the main thing I wanted was the clipping catcher function, and it failed miserably in this respect.  It did a great job of cutting the nails, but didn&#x27;t catch a single piece of nail clipping.  I had to pick it all up off the bathroom floor!  What is the point of having a \\&quot;clipping catcher\\&quot; if you&#x27;re just going to leave the clippers open on the sides?  I find it particularly interesting that the side they do not show you in the main picture has an even bigger open area because the plastic does not follow the slant of the edge, and I have to wonder if they purposefully took the picture from that angle to hide it.  If I had seen that huge open area, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought them, and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not noticing it before I opened the packaging.  Now that I&#x27;ve used them, I can&#x27;t return them!</li>
    <li> It just tore every single toenail when i cut them, just awful. I used them once and never again. These just seem cheap.</li>
    <li> Works great - very well made!</li>
    <li> This looks like it might be the toenail clipper that I&#x27;ve always wanted. But it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grade of metal is wrong for this product. The lever has too much friction and it has a low quality feel to it. But it gets the job done and I won&#x27;t go shopping for another one for now.</li>
    <li> These are beefy cutters. No fuss no mess.    Hard to believe that a cutter can get any better then these.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble using standard toenail clippers with the narrow jaw, as well as squeezing hard enough to complete the cutting action. These clippers solve both problems. The design of the lever, the wide jaw and the sharpness of the cutting surface make clipping toenails effortless.  Since I put my foot on the bathroom vanity to clip, the fact that the clippings fall out isn&#x27;t a issue for me. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Very sharp and takes little pressure to cut toe nails.</li>
    <li> Good, but not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Works very well, even on thick nails. Angle helps in shaping nail</li>
    <li> I was so glad to get this clipper. It was exactly what I had been looking for but could not find in stores. Now I can get my toenail looking a little more normal now. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Very good product it works like I expected!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time trying to find a nail clipper that didn&#x27;t leave nail tags.  I must have bought about a dozen and they all did the same thing.  I searched and searched and finally made a decision to purchase this one.  The price was a bit steep for a nail clipper but this one works great.  I use it on my finger nails and have hid it from my spouse so that he can&#x27;t use it on his toenails!  I get my toenails done!</li>
    <li> These are very good toenail clippers, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The wide jaws make it a snap to cut the nails.  Would recommend these to everyone.  Am going to purchase more of these- one for the bath, the bedroom and the suitcase!</li>
    <li> I usually leave reviews for outstanding products or terrible products to warn others. Fortunately this belongs in the former. The reviews are correct. I am an men&#x27;s grooming nut and demand quality. If there is a better tool out there for this purpose, I have not seen it. And after buying this, I do not feel inclined to continue searching for one. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  As I expected, if you are buying this for the sole purpose of catching clippings(like the one goof ball reviewer complained about), you will be disappointed. It catches about half of them, but who cares.</li>
    <li> These are almost too powerful. I have thick toenails and was used to nibbling off little pieces with repeated use of a normal clipper or cutting at a painful angle and with painful pressure with a pruning-type clipper. But this bit through the entire nail without any pressure, right down to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually cut myself on my third use. No problem, I&#x27;ll be more careful but these are fantastic for toenails. Don&#x27;t let kids use them, or they&#x27;ll lop off a bunch of skin along with the nail!</li>
    <li> It will only let you cut a little bit at a time, because of the casing.  I like my old clipper better.</li>
    <li> This clipper is everything advertised and more. It&#x27;s very rugged and easy to use. The clipper is wonderful for my real tough toe nails. The lever or handle is strong and long enough to give you great leverage. Just another fine product you&#x27;d expect from Amazon.  Oh, the delivery was fast also.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The clipper is sturdy and large (larger than I expected). I don&#x27;t have bear claws to clip, so I can&#x27;t vouch for its super-dooper capabilities, but it snips my toe nails with ease.    The grip and comfort are nice.    My only disappointment is that the straight edge isn&#x27;t as good for contouring as the crescent types. You need more passes (snips) to get everything. It&#x27;s not a huge amount of work, but it&#x27;s more nail bits to gather. So this aspect alone makes me regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> These are the power-clippers of all time.  I have some thick toe nails that with other clippers I have to really squeeze hard and hope they clip.  With these, it&#x27;s just a quick easy \\&quot;snip\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s done.  I run through clipping my nails with no problem.</li>
    <li> These wide-jawed, slant-edged clippers slice through thick toenails as if they were mere fingernails. They are very easy to use thanks to having just the right angle on the blades and just the right weight.&lt;br /&gt;As others mentioned, the catching of cuttings doesn&#x27;t work as promised, but who cares when you have toenail clippers that work so well. As a matter-of-fact, in trying (albeit failing) to give you a means to capture the runaway nail pieces--the substantial plastic \\&quot;catch container\\&quot; actually helps you have a more secure hold on the clippers while clipping.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for seniors and others who may have problems with their hands (such as weakness or arthritis), and those who have trouble bending over for very long because of leg, back or neck problems. These Mehaz Professional Clippers do the job quickly and easily... which has greatly reduced the neck and back strain I experienced while struggling with other brands and styles.&lt;br /&gt;They are the very best clippers I have ever found and I gladly give them a solid 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> All Mehaz products I have bought - high quality - fair price</li>
    <li> Love these. I do have a messed up big toe toenail from dropping a huge stone on my foot and breaking the toe. These clippers work great. The are angled which I thought would not be good but actually makes them perform even better.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mother, who has thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves them, and she found them very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Works great for thick nails.  Strong.  I saw none of the complaints listed in other reviews -- no problems working with it or durability yet (two weeks use).</li>
    <li> I have thick toenails and this has a wide mouth . It is also stronger than an ordinary clipper and worked well. Easy to hold on to. I would have liked it to be a bit longer which would have made it even easier to grip.</li>
    <li> After years of using a standard inexpensive drug store toenail clipper, I figured it was time to upgrade and this clipper looked pretty cool. I failed to consider that a straight cut would require a lot more filing to get the nails smooth. I&#x27;m not one for involved manicures... I want to clip &#x27;em, do a quick file and be on my way again.  That philosophy did not work with this clipper. It requires much more finishing work and since using it I have the worse nails ever.  It is however very sharp and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;clipping catcher\\&quot; however only catches some of them...and then only if you hold the clipper in what is a unnatural position for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with the quality and feel of this clipper and just ordered another Mehaz clipper with a curved cutting blade.  This straight cut version will probably never get used again.</li>
    <li> great clippers. haven&#x27;t dulled yet. like to use these on my fingernails, as well, to create the french tip like you get at salons. they are a little tricky to use because the handle isn&#x27;t straight with the blades, it&#x27;s tilted to side a bit.</li>
    <li> These clippers feel solid and cut well. I hope they last, they are probably the best pair I have bought..most other clippers I have had, were either sharp enough but broke or were just not sharp enough to do the job right. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I went all over town in several towns and no luck for anything even similar.  These work great and am glad I ordered 2 pairs.</li>
    <li> Great value for a small price.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job on tough nails. Angled clipper is very handy for hard to see spots.</li>
    <li> The toe nail clippers cut the nail with no nails flying all over the place.  It took some time to get use to the covering around the clipper.  The toe nail clippers cut better than its cousin finger nail clipper.</li>
    <li> The clippers fell apart on me before I could even use them a second time. The little metal brad that holds it together became a high-speed projectile that shot out so fast, I had trouble finding it in the carpet. Frightening because the force was strong enough to break a window or mirror, or considering how close to the face these are used, could have put out an eye. It was difficult to get it put back together, but when I did, I sent it back. I made the mistake of buying 2 of them and it&#x27;s too late to send back the first one, but I&#x27;m not going to be had twice. I&#x27;m so very disappointed because I don&#x27;t know of any others that cut like a hot knife through butter plus have a jaw as wide as this one to buy in its place.</li>
    <li> The clippers work well, but the size(they&#x27;re fairly large, as nail clippers go) makes them a little hard to handle.</li>
    <li> These are toenail clipper size however i can use them on my fingernails too. nice and sharp! they do a great job!</li>
    <li> Well made, open twice as wide as normal clippers. Just what I needed. They make clipping my thick nails a breeze!</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  I paid more to get better quality, but this has the same style pin as the cheap ones, and it is always falling out.  I will keep looking for a better one.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it negative stars. Didnt even use it once and it broke apart. Save your money..</li>
    <li> This is very sharp, has a very wide opening and, if you are not careful, you will take off more than just your toenail.  The nail catcher is a worthless feature because you have to tilt the clipper to catch the clippings and it is awkward, if not impossible, to do. Easier to do when you are clipping your fingernails.  Holding the clipper tilted downward when I am clipping my toenails is not natural. They worked great on the thicker nails because of the wider opening.  However, I bled twice after catching some skin.  They work, may take some time to adjust to them...just be careful, slow and deliberate.</li>
    <li> These just work!!  They are easy to hold and they cut like a hot knife to butter. Very well made.</li>
    <li> I like the product basically, but disappointed that it kept sliding out of the blue case while I was cutting.</li>
    <li> These seem to be built very nicely. Strong enough for very thick tough toenails. The rubber coating allows for a good grip.</li>
    <li> straight cutting clipper is not useful and I have large toe nails! It is very sharp and the action is good.</li>
    <li> Fell apart really easily. Seller issued a credit.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  The wide opening allows positioning to clip any nail and the cushioned grip is comfortable.  I would never buy a different toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> This was my last resort before seeing a doctor for my thick toenails. True the catcher doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;but I couldn&#x27;t care less. This is a miracle!</li>
    <li> This clipper is the best I have ever used.  Quick, smooth, and very easy pressure is needed. Order several clippers because you will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the slanted/angled edge. It shoudl have a roudned edge to give shape to your nail. Served no purpose to be straight.</li>
    <li> Buy these. they work. I can&#x27;t tell you how many others I purchased that didn&#x27;t. I am buying more for spares.</li>
    <li> This clipper works terrifically on thick toenails.  The wide opening clipped by toenails with ease.  Well worth the money if u have thick toenails.</li>
    <li> Nice wide jaw for easier access to thicker nails and the angle of the straight cutting edges makes lining up and making the cut so much easier than the traditional curved cutters. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for cutting coated garden wire which I use to tie computer cords.  It does a great job and has other unexpected features.  It seems great for thick toenails because the mouth has a full quarter inch wide opening, but it meets this other need too.  I keep a card of rubber coated garden wire in my home office desk and cut pieces off to contain all my equipment cords.  I wanted a unit with a wide opening to accommodate the wire so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep wire cutters in the drawer. Since I have it now I use it for my nails too and it works for regular thickness nails as well although you have to be careful not to get too close to the nail bed or include a bit of skin by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue coating/case on the unit allows you to squeeze hard comfortably when necessary and the fact that it is 4\\&quot; long lets you get a good grip.  The lozenge shaped area on the raised handle is a sturdy file to smooth off rough nail edges and it works well for that.  Also since the blue material surrounds the metal clipper like a case, it keeps nail clippings contained inside so you don&#x27;t make a mess.  When you&#x27;re done, just empty the mouth part over the bin and all the clippings fall in. I didn&#x27;t expect that, but appreciate it.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> A big improvement over the drug store toenail clippers I&#x27;ve always bought.  My toenails are curving and I&#x27;m trying to prevent a bad ingrown situation necessitating surgery.  If you are supposed to trim your nails straight across, why are nearly all toenail clippers curved?  These are straight and sharp and do a great job, easy to handle.</li>
    <li> While the service and speed of delievery was great the wife and I were very unhappy with the product.  Cutting toenails was very painful.  It didn&#x27;t seems to have a cutting edge to it.  Both sides seemed very wide like it was going to \\&quot;crush\\&quot; not cut.  Cannot recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> My toenails have become extremely thick.  The jaws of standard fingernail or toenail clippers would not open wide enough to clip my toenails.  I feared I would have to buy some pliers (diagonal cut Kleins) to trim my toenails.  My podiatrist&#x27;s office suggested a couple of medical supply stores, but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some web searches and luckily found these Mehaz toenail clippers.  From their description I had a sense that they would work well, so I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! For the first time since my toenails got thick, I have been able to easily trim them!  My toenails were getting scary long .... frightening the kids!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper&#x27;s cutting surface (which is very sharp) is straight ... not curved like the smaller fingernail clippers.  I like it straight.  It provides more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting lever is strong/solid, allowing you to apply sufficient pressure to cut through thick nails.  The blue plastic covering makes the clippers comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are a little wider and are longer than standard fingernail or toenail clippers.  This increased size is helpful, because it makes them easier to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  These Mehaz clippers are great!  They easily trim thick toe nails!  They are rugged, and will last!  I&#x27;m glad I bought two!  I would definitely recommend these clippers to anyone with thick toenails!</li>
    <li> First, I want to point out, as other reviewers have, that the item is packaged in a clear plastic bubble which makes it very difficult to remove the nail clippers. Perhaps rough handling by some users caused the clippers to fall apart while the person tried to remove them from their plastic bubble. Having been forewarned by some reviewers, I cut into the package carefully with my huge kitchen shears, and was able to remove the clippers without damaging them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great clippers and cut toenails easily. I have never had a fungus infection, but I stub my toes a lot since I walk around the house in my stocking feet and without shoes. Stubbed toenails hurt if they are not clipped with sharp clippers, so these work just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned the difficulty of dealing with ingrown toenails, and I received excellent advice many years ago for treating such a problem: Let the nail grow out to about 1/8 of an inch, and with these sharp clippers, or similar ones, carefully nick that end at the MID POINT of the nail into a small \\&quot;V\\&quot; shape. As the nail grows with the V shape, it will gradually draw away from the side that had the ingrown nail and get your toenail back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine who recently went to her doctor to get help with her first-ever! ingrown toenail, told me that the doctor cut a small V shape in the nail -- see above paragraph --  and also placed a tiny, soft, cotton ball-shape under the nail, close to where the toenail had ingrown, to gradually lift that part of the nail out from the skin. I hope this advice helps anyone who has such problems.</li>
    <li> Like it. All good. No negative surprises.......</li>
    <li> This works really well, however, you need to be extremely careful when cutting nails, especially on the feet. It&#x27;s very sharp, and can be very painful if you have skin involved. Highly recommend for difficult to trim nails.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this clipper.  It is easy to use and he found it to be very well made.  Loved it.</li>
    <li> Straight blade, better leverage and able to manage thick very curved nails. I am very happy with this excellent tool.</li>
    <li> Read other reviews before buying. It really does open up wide enough to handle thick nails. finally can keep toenails clipped.</li>
    <li> The product was as shown and works well. I would recommend it to anyone in need of this type of product. It is first toenail clipper that could handle my bad nails.</li>
    <li> works as described on my hard toenails. Breezes right through them first time with little pressure. I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> For the money it is pretty good.  But there are two big problems - one is that with the strange angled blades it is very difficult to get a neat cut.  Also there is no little clip sound that assures you the cut is done.  It is also not very sharp.  A while back a friend got me a set of quality professional clipper and other tools, it was more expensive but really &amp; truly it is worth it.  This et has a great grip and really sharp blade - it works right.  Spend the money get the better thing.</li>
    <li> Arrived date promised in excellent condition &amp; works great.  I would definitely not hesitate to recommend to any who has problems with toenails.</li>
    <li> I have a REALLY old grungy toenail clipper that had a wide jaw and I use it for my adult dogs (up to like 17 lb dogs) because it works so much better than a dog toenail clipper and some dogs don&#x27;t like the Dremel.  But my old one had rust on it and I am sure also some dried blood, so I just couldn&#x27;t see using it any longer if I could find something else that had the wide opening.  I have many toenail clippers and my dogs&#x27; nails would not fit in them - those Trim brand trimmers are just not made the way they use to be.  But this one is just what I was looking for!  I bought 3 because I was pretty sure I&#x27;d like it - one for my own toenails and 2 for the dogs.  Very, very happy!  Very sharp and the leverage is great - no slipping.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very nice Clipper. Works great. Sharp.</li>
    <li> These babies are quite sharp and work well.  The blades are no concave or convex, rather they are angled rather than straight a cross.  the rubber handles make them easy to grasp.  A bit more expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> This item is junk.  Broke after five uses.  Rivet/Pin fell out! this is very annoying since it I bought it on its excellent rating.  Send me another and I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
    <li> Apparently i&#x27;ve been using the wrong type of nail clipper for many many years, thats until I found this little nifty tool. The angled grip makes it comfortable to use and doesn&#x27;t strain your wrist (perfect for those with wrist issues). The straight blade helps maintain a clean straight cut to avoid those pesky ingrown nails. The only gripe I have with the clipper is the blue clipper catcher. When clipping, the lever can sometimes catch the edge of the plastic catcher. I have opted to remove it and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> angled cutting edge takes work to  master the technique for clipping, especially the little toe.</li>
    <li> If it talked it wouldn&#x27;t shut up because it has a nice big mouth...haha. Seriously, this toenail clipper is very well made and it has a nice wide jaw which really helps if you have thickened toenails. It also has a handy little trap for toenail clippings that is easy to remove and empty. It also has an angle which allows you to trim your own toenails in a more comfortable manner and a better ability to see what you&#x27;re doing. I would rate this as the best toenail clipper I have owned.</li>
    <li> Will cut thick nails, but unless your nails are smaller than 3/8 of an inch wide, the angled blade leaves sharp edges that have to be trimmed with a smaller clipper.</li>
    <li> i got this for myself and liked it so much, bought one for my sister who needed a wider mouth on cutrters</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick toenails and I discovered this and what a great product!  They not only cut VERY thick nails, but with ease because of the silicone grips on it - I am actually going to order more in case these ever break! Everyone said I need to see a Podiatrist to get mine trimmed because of the thickness so buy this product definitely!</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the reviews, these clippers do not cut well, easily, and leave ragged edges on the nail. Very disappointed with them.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product...I was tired of using those cheap clippers and spent the extra money for these....well worth it!</li>
    <li> Plastic edge and a nail clipper didn&#x27;t work carefully, especially when working with a nail clipper, plastic edge big gap, that is not working properly</li>
    <li> My husband needed a toenail clipper that opened wide and this does the trick.  He&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought broke after only a few uses, hopefully this new one won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great for thick nails but the &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; is a joke. Who on earth cuts their nails from the angle necessary to make the catcher work?</li>
    <li> This is a very good clipper. Sharp and sturdy. A great tool for men or anyone with especially thick nails.</li>
    <li> The producd is exactly as described. Worked perfect on my hubby&#x27;s stubborn, thick toenail! Fast shipping, would recommend product, makes a great gift also.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this clipper.  You do have to be more cautious than with a less heavy duty clipper because they are so much stronger.  I have purchased two of the heavy duty scissors and they either did nothing or crushed and cracked the nail.  Other clippers&#x27; gap was too small to fit over the nail.  I am really pleased, again must exercise caution but they do the  job.</li>
    <li> These may be the best nail clippers of all time.</li>
    <li> Yes the jaw is wider and it is good for those tough toe nails that can&#x27;t be done with standard clipper. Great for tough nails.</li>
    <li> this item was delayed due to increment weather. seller contacted me after I had ( mistakenly ) given a bad review thinking it was their mistake.&lt;br /&gt;The item was delivered and on first use it is what I expected. I wish though that it was slightly stronger as I have really thicj toe nails.</li>
    <li> Sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used ! Sharp and cuts tough , hard nails. I&#x27;m totally impressed with this clipper and wish I would have purchased it long ago!</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers do the trick!  Where other, run-of-the-mill clippers failed, this little gem gets the job done!  I&amp;#34;m happy I found these on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Buy it here! This product is a very good value and a good brand, very sharp!. I think you can’t go wrong if you buy it here!</li>
    <li> Brought these for my family member! They loves it~ I would purchase this item again! That is all! ! !</li>
    <li> These clippers are the best! They are easy to use, and takes no time at all to clip nails, and they are designed for left handed people too.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my toenails have thickened (TMI?) and standard clippers don&#x27;t work very well. These do the job just fine!</li>
    <li> Before getting the Mehaz clippers, I had problems getting a good cut. These angle blade clippers are sharp and do a good job  cutting thick nails.  The lower blue plastic cover is a clever box for clipped nails.  These Japanese made clippers make toe nail cutting easy and so much better.</li>
    <li> This is in fact heavier and stronger than average clippers.  It is sharp so be aware, however, it is very very useful.  I love it!</li>
    <li> WARNING! DO NOT BUY THESE CLIPPERS!!! These nail clippers are junk! The pin that holds the pieces together bent 3rd time using them! This caused the clippers to fall apart. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased by my purchase of my toenail clipper. I does an absolute wonderful job in keeping my nails trim.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper a couple of years ago and I have been generally satisfied with it. The plastic case around the clipper can crack and it is possible to slide it off. I might buy a replacement. It does cut thick nails. I use it on my fingernails too. There are comments about arthritic hands...mine are not seriously impaired. But there are moments when it is hard to handle the clippers.</li>
    <li> The extra large jaw size works great for cutting my thick, curved big toe nails. The angled cutting edge is handy for getting the clippers better oriented for cutting your own nails.</li>
    <li> Who on this blue marvel doesn&#x27;t need them they are a very good product,they do the job well,I appreciate them very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these as they are just the right thing for the right thing to handle those narly toenails.</li>
    <li> I am a senior with arthritis and dreaded clipping my toe nails.  I actually considered going to a podatrist.  The clipper solved the problem with its wide jaws and also saves Medicare money too boot..</li>
    <li> I have very thick toe nails, it cut through them with no problems! I love it and would 100% recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper is almost perfect for me. I do not struggle as much now when cutting my toenails. It is easier to see too; my eyes aren&#x27;t so good anymore. If they could just make the handles a little longer it would be helpful. Then I could easily rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, wide space between the cutting surfaces.  Makes it easy to cut through heavy nails.  The angled cutters are good for getting at the corners of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer complained that the angle made it difficult to get to the corner of his right toenails because the angle was backwards.  But it works fine if you just turn the cutters over.  Then the angle is perfect again.</li>
    <li> The toenail specialist is just what I needed to complete my grooming ensemble.  It makes a once difficult job a snap.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second pair of these nail clippers.  I bought the first clippers about a year ago to manicure my elderly mother&#x27;s nails.  They were thickening with age and these allowed me to clip her nails and not cause her any pain.  I decided to buy myself a pair of my own after liking them so much.  They are very sharp and make the job easy to handle.  They are easy to grip and not hard on your hands.</li>
    <li> This clipper is great!  I have trouble with ingrown toenails and it really helps that it cuts straight across.  Also, it is wide enough to clip thick nails!  It seems really well made and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other clipper I have ever used. Well made and kinda attractive, too. Deserves all five stars.</li>
    <li> The steel blades really do a good job on my thick toe nails.  Also the angled blades make holding the clippers a little easier.</li>
    <li> It was always hard for me to find toe nail clippers large enough to do the job, on my toe nails. These are large enough and they work. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This product is the only nail clipper that worked on my husband&#x27;s toe nails and I tried all kinds previously.  They are very easy to use and are quite strong.</li>
    <li> They work like a charm. I have tried many different clippers and these are by far the best if you have thick nails.</li>
    <li> Nice, great, easy to use look good and very sharp. I like the wide open mouth. Plenty of room for those thick nails. We like them very much. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was an answer to my search for a good clipper especially for thick nails.</li>
    <li> Solid unit, can cut thick nails straight cut reduce ingrown toe nails. Would recommend to friends and family. Good price</li>
    <li> Great product for my husband who toenails became thick and hard after chemo. The only product that worked cutting them.</li>
    <li> I have several other clippers that do not work well, what I needed was a heavy duty clipper with a straight edge, and would do a good job.  This Mehaz clipper is excellent, very well constructed, and sharp enough to cut the heaviest toenail.</li>
    <li> Best toe nail clipper I have ever used. Now I can clip my own toe nails and do not have to go to a beauty salon to get a pedicure. I love this toe nail clipper and the new one I ordered is my second one. I want to have an extra one on hand.</li>
    <li> Best toenail clipper I ever used.  never knew there were better ones than what is offered in drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;as promised.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and cuts even the most stubborn and thick nails.  The cutting edge is angled so you have to work to get a nice clean straight cut.</li>
    <li> The construction and quality of the clipper are very good. However, I was really disappointed that the edges on one end of the clipper don&#x27;t close all the way down. This was a very important feature in order for me to cut small dead skins or nail in hard places. This clipper seems to be badly designed with a gap on one end of the clipper. I checked all my other clippers and the top and bottom close together completely along the edges.</li>
    <li> Finally clippers that open widely enough for thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> For the first time in years I am able to cut my toenails almost effortlessly. I&lt;br /&gt;could not be more satisfied</li>
    <li> Sometimes you&#x27;ve just got to go with the industrial grade product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This product does it...period.</li>
    <li> Perfect like our other pair. This is for our R/V while out and about. Wife even loves the ease of use as they are great on leverage for weak</li>
    <li> These work better than we expected - excellent tool.</li>
    <li> Will not cut tough nails.  POG</li>
    <li> Excellent nail cutter for toes and fingers.</li>
    <li> I had previous disappointment with another nail clipper from Japan that I bought on Amazon. This one is no better, the jaws don;&#x27;t even close evenly, leaving a gap on one side. I returned it. Disappointing especially I expected better products from Japan. And they are expensive!</li>
    <li> These clipper are excellent and I highly recomment them to you for doing your manicure or pedicure. A good buy</li>
    <li> Not good at all .  Thick toe nails  need a foot Dr.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t feign excitement, but I will say I wish I&#x27;d found these a decade or two ago rather than putting up with little curved front clippers barely suitable for a mans fingers let alone a big toenail.</li>
    <li> Great product for thick nails...cuts right through.</li>
    <li> 20 yr old drugstore clipper does a better job. Tried to upscale a simple item that worked fine. Not worth any way near the cost of this tool. Had to file all my nails after cutting.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and cheaply made. Not at all happy. Will go back to Revlon or Tweezerman. Not worth spending the time or energy to return.</li>
    <li> Good quality, easy to use, &amp; very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am so surprised by any positive reviews of this.  It was difficult for me to hold and kept slipping or popping right out of my fingers; the slanted blades made it impossible to cut my nails properly; when I was able to clip, it often did not cut thru my thin nails.  I don&#x27;t know . . . I just thought everything about this clipper was awful.  I went to my local drugstore and bought a $4 clipper by Revlon and it works 1,000% better!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity  to use the clippers since I first tried them. I clipped off the tip of my toe,and had to go to the E.R. Took the tip off.  It was my fault ,more than the clippers . I have limited ability to reach the nail.  Kind of reaching and feeling. Advice: these are very sharp. Be very careful. Don&#x27;t press to cut till you know you only have nail,not meat.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Big cutting area !!</li>
    <li> Love this.  Cuts straight across the first tr y.  I works great.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to spend $12 on toenail clippers, but I was kind of desperate.  It was getting harder and harder to cut the nails on both of my big toes.  Standard toenail clippers were just not cutting it (pun intended),  so I thought I would try these \\&quot;wide jaw\\&quot; clippers.  Not only are they significantly wider, they also have sharp blades that cut easily, and great ergonomics that keep the clippers from slipping.      I would say that if you are reading this review and considering spending $12 on toenail clippers, you probably need these.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> What a tremendous, sharp, and easy to use toenail clipper.  Well worth the price.  I have fatigue and a lot of pain in my hands.  This takes hardly any pressure at all, and I don&#x27;t drop it.  Yeah.</li>
    <li> This clipper has been excellent and I won&#x27;t be going back to cheap drug-store clippers ever again. Like most people (I assume...), I can go through several nail clippers a year, either because they break or because I lose them. I also generally buy larger toenail clippers because my fingernails are thick, and the smaller nail clippers made for hands are wholly inadequate.     They are pricier than normal clippers, but considering the rate at which I lose/break cheap ones, these probably pay for themselves within a year. Additionally, although I never used emery boards before, I&#x27;ve found the nail file on this clipper to be very good (considering that it is metal, and my nails are pretty hard). The clipper feels and is very heavy duty, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to break it like many others. Hopefully gone are the days of the upper piece popping off and falling into the toilet while I clip toenails. Oh, I should mention that they work great on both my fingernails and toenails.    The \\&quot;clipping catcher\\&quot; advertised on this clipper does not really catch many clippings, although finger/toe nails do not go flying about as much as they did with the cheaper ones. Regardless, I say buy these -- you&#x27;ll appreciate spending a little extra on something that will last much longer and do a much better job.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ,cuts the tough thick nails</li>
    <li> solid and works great , is not slipping out of your hands when you use it , little more difficult to cut the nails in a curve , because it is a straight cutter .great product</li>
    <li> This clipper finally allows me to cut my thick toe nails. Works better than I even hoped for. Very sharp blades</li>
    <li> Greatest professional quality Clipper from a German company made with excellent steel. Will recommend this store with a great low price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and appear to be very durable.  It takes much less force to make the cuts.</li>
    <li> One of the &#x27;gifts&#x27; of advancing age are our yellowed, thick, unlovely toenails. This wide mouthed clipper is a most excellent means of disposing of those ugly talons and restoring our toenails to some sense of order and decorum. This is the best clipper I have ever used and I believe that any purchaser will agree with me.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Order takes a while from Hong Kong but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> While this clipper is 3x the cost of drugstore clippers, it is well made and useful.  It does take some getting used to if you&#x27;ve been using standard clippers for years, but after two or three uses you&#x27;ll think the extra bucks well spent.</li>
    <li> This clipper is easy to use and I basically like it.  I was a bit disappointed that the end was not curved but was straight.</li>
    <li> This is SO-O-O different from the cheap drug-store clippers that always struggle with toenails. This clipper has an opening wide enough and is sharp enough to do the job right. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Best Nail Clipper I ever found, Eases Toe Nail clipping for this octogenarian. Replace one received as gift long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have bad knees and hips and can&#x27;t bend very well to do my toes.  This clipper is just barely long enough to reach if I hold it in my fingertips and it&#x27;s still a stretch  - but I can do it.  It is very sturdy so you have to be careful not to cut your toes.  I could not do without this little tool.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize from the picture that the clipping blade is actually angled. It makes it a bit awkward, though I love the plastic handle. It would have been five stars it it were not angled.</li>
    <li> Product performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> These wide jaw cllippers are the best I have ever used.  Very sharp and they clip the thick nails easily.</li>
    <li> After trying three other clippers and still being thwarted by the thickness of my aging toenails, I found these to do the job easily.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re strong and easy to grasp.</li>
    <li> How excited am I supposed to get about nail clippers.  Still can&#x27;t reach my feet but they do the job with a little help from my friends!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice day!</li>
    <li> My fault...I assumed the silicon &#x27;wrapping&#x27; would catch the nail clippings. It does not, though this is my misunderstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the nail file that is on the handle. Very handy.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.  They are strong and work well, even on thick toenails. My toenails just do not conform to the angles on concave cutters, but these work well.</li>
    <li> These toenail clipper are great for cutting thick nails. I suggest you also soak the nails in water to help soften.</li>
    <li> It is really good as a Toenail Clipper. I have been looking for the best Toenail clipper for long time. This is the one I really like it. would like to get another one as a gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> This is a great toenail clipper for slightly thicker to thicker&lt;br /&gt;toe nails.  The jaw opens up to give a perfect pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper works great and it is easy to place around the nail.  The best feature is that it is so easy to hold.and does not slip out of your hand.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are OK.  They were recommended to me by a manicurist and I find the straight edge a bit difficult to use.  They cut pretty well, but be ready to do some filing afterwards.</li>
    <li> The clippers are excellent as many have noted. The clipper is sharp and cuts very cleanly and easily. It has excellent leverage so the cutting is easy. I find that the blue plastic housing (a) does not catch all the clippings and (b) gets in the way. So I removed it and use the clippers without the housing.  The clippers come inside a \\&quot;card\\&quot; consisting of stiff cardboard and a hard plastic bubble. The clippers are inside the plastic. It was difficult to tear or otherwise cut the cardboard to get the bubble open. I cut my finger doing so. So I suggest getting a strong pair of scissors or some other cutting implement to carefully open the package.  I recommend the clippers - just be careful opening the package.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail clipper I have ever owned.  Does a great job even on nails that are thicker.  Cut through them easily.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!!  if you had to cut through a 1/4 inch nail it would do it with ease!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good toe nail clipper. Easy to grasp and packs a pinch in its ability to cut toe nails with ease.</li>
    <li> Prevents ingrown toenails in humans. Perfect for that weird piggy toenail that grows like a Frito. I&#x27;d used human clippers on my Pomeranians but couldn&#x27;t find a good replacement until now-otherwise those dog ones splinter their nails.</li>
    <li> this clipper is for sure the heavy duty clipper of it&#x27;s kind, cuts those big , thick toe nails with no problem, love the big open jaw, one note go carefully.&lt;br /&gt;R.W.</li>
    <li> These are first rate in materials and performance . I have thick hard nails and it cuts them with ease . My wife is my cutter for my feet and Dolores says they are the best she has ever used . the long handles help as well as the very sharp blades Ive seen them at some stores at twice the price</li>
    <li> The angle is good for your right foot if your right handed. Cutting your toenails on your left foot is a shot in the dark. Very hard to see where the blade is.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a year then broke. I am buying another because it worked well when intact.</li>
    <li> Nice heavy duty clipper, one has to really ensure that it is positioned correctly as it is easy to catch skin and cause a cut (hard to heal at lower extremety) Is has plenty of force for these rather tough toenails and cuts perfectly</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Must be careful, I have a couple of sensitive nails, so I must be sure not to cut them too short and this sucker would do it.</li>
    <li> Blades didn&#x27;t line up correctly. Procrastinated and now too late to return. In the trash.</li>
    <li> Thick, fungally misshapen toenails?&lt;br /&gt;Standard clippers not sharp enough&lt;br /&gt;or do not open wide enough?&lt;br /&gt;These work great, so bye-bye podiatrist!&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery. Quality product.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review on nail clippers but these clippers are fantastic. I&#x27;ll never buy a pair from the drugstore ever again. A very sharp and straight cut. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Best toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. They open wide enough for thick toenails and it&#x27;s very sharp. It&#x27;s angled instead of a curved shape so it&#x27;s easier to cut both small and big toes.</li>
    <li> These are the very best clippers I have ever used. They are sharpe and the opening is wide enough to cut the thickest nails</li>
    <li> These are really cheaply made. They broke before I finished my pedicure.</li>
    <li> SUCH an IMPROVEMENT over finger nail clippers</li>
    <li> Perfect. Easy to use, wide jaws very helpful.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this tonail clipper. It has extra capacity for thick toenails and does an excellent job for this purpose. The blade is very sharp and makes clean, accurate cuts. Well made product that will last a long time. Both of my purchases remain in service and are in big demand for my family.</li>
    <li> Works well, light weight, the nail clippier catcher feature is a plus so nails do not fall into the carpet or tile..</li>
    <li> I returned these, they were not that sharp and the slant design is for what? poor design in my opinion. Also the catch feature does not work,when you cut the nails just go flying else where</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get excited about toe nail clippers, but these really work well. The blade is super sharp and it&#x27;s easy to use.The price is right!</li>
    <li> The older I get the thicker my toenails become.  And, of course, I am less agile than I used to be.  With regular clippers I tended to pinch a lot of skin while struggling to insert those thick toenails inside the jaws of the clipper.  Then I decided to look for a clipper designed for toenails like mine.  It works just great every time.  This is my second pair as the first ones got lost on a trip.  I could hardly wait to get home to order another pair.  They are well made, easy to hold onto and that jaw really is wide enough to really chomp down on thick mails and cut them off cleanly.  I like the slant edge style cut best as my motor skills cut down on my agility when trying to get the angle of the cut right.</li>
    <li> These clippers work really well. The edge is wide enough for all size thick nails. Be careful the&#x27;re reallly sharp.</li>
    <li> Very handy item and works great.  Because of back surgery I&#x27;ve been having trouble reaching my toe nails - this solved that problem.  They are sharp enough to cut with little effort.  The blue plastic cover is apparently designed to catch the cuttings.  I don&#x27;t know if any were captured because I haven&#x27;t figured out how to remove it.  I know it didn&#x27;t catch all of them.</li>
    <li> Very nice wide angled clipper, Has a slightly soft padded feeling finish for easy gripping. Cuts very well. Definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> The best buy for patients that have to be careful with their toes.</li>
    <li> Well, this product has a wide enough opening for any size nail, that is for sure! I actually got them so I could cut down my acrylic nails since they were too thick for any of the clippers at the store. They cut great, i love them! I have not used them on toe nails yet but I am sure they will work great.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these clippers.. Having Rheumatoid Arthritis.. my hand have become very weak &amp; crooked..&lt;br /&gt;So I was searching for clippers I could use...&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are easy for even me !</li>
    <li> This clipper will span a really thick nail without problem.  The leverage arrangement doesn&#x27;t seem to require much force to accomplish a successful clip.  Be prepared to do some filing just to smooth the cut surfaces, no problems.  The main body, with the angled head can be reversed: just pop it out of the plastic sheath, pinch the cutter mechanism together with your fingers, remove the lever, take the pin out and insert it from the other side.  Then re-attach the lever to the pin (pinching the cutter halves together) and re-insert it into the plastic housing; the angle will be &amp;#34;the other way.&amp;#34; I plan to just wipe it with alcohol if I feel the need for cleaning or disinfection.  One probably should not share nail clippers or chap sticks ;).</li>
    <li> The nail clippings still fly out from the side and it is so big it&#x27;s hard to cut around corners of your nails.  Poor design</li>
    <li> Very effective straight jawed toenail clipper. Makes a nice complement to curved ones.</li>
    <li> Great great.  I have to get more for the rest of family.  Then I will have my own.</li>
    <li> I got this pair of toe nail clippers for my husband who has very thick nails. They do not clip his nails. Back to the drawing board</li>
    <li> works great got for my 88 yr old fathers toe nails that are the hardest nails ive ever seen! blue cover slips a bit much have to stop and reajust but other then that great product</li>
    <li> In our seventies, my husband and I have struggled with toenail clipping, either helping each other or doing our own.  These clippers have certainly made that task much easier, quicker to accomplish, and the nails look much better.  I highly recommend these clippers to anyone who is having the same problems we had.</li>
    <li> All I have had in the past many years were the cheap stainless steel clipper.  What a difference real quality makes. These clippers are so strong and very sharp.  I&#x27;m a real klutz, but my finger and toe nails look really good using this product.  Highly recommended and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have spent time and money trying to find clippers for my toenails. This is it. Bravo!  My toenails salute you.</li>
    <li> It worked good for a while, but it got over stressed or something and now it does not cut cleanly. Leaves a raised ridge on your nail. I think what happened is the two cutting edges no longer meet evenly. It goes back to the clipper is lightly made. Very sharp, but needs to be more metal in construction. I will not buy another one. If you treat it gently it would probably last, but I am usually in a hurry, and this is supposed to be the heavier toe nail version, but to me it is too light.</li>
    <li> Not so great. Wont buy again.Appears to be very cheap material product poorly designed. It broke on my 2nd use.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a big jaw toe nail clipper, this is it.  would recommend to a friend.  :)</li>
    <li> This clipper didn&#x27;t clip too well on the left side of my toes (of course using the lower part of the slanted edge). I clamped down as hard as possible and this clipper still wouldn&#x27;t clip. I took out my old $2 clipper and it finished the job. Maybe if the top piece was slanted as well to add pressure, but the design seems to work well for most. Also when fully clamped the blades are slightly uneven (for the upper edge, which is strange since I was having trouble with the lower edge). I would have exchanged to try again but the only option presented was return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 1 star because it did catch my clippings it managed to clip, despite the rather large opening as if the blue casing doesn&#x27;t accommodate a slanted edge.</li>
    <li> This really works for hard to cut toe-nails. Great product, try it you can&#x27;t go wrong&lt;br /&gt;with the price and quality.</li>
    <li> So much better than my old drug store product.&lt;br /&gt;View tips and guidelines | 11 more words required. . Close</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper is simply awesome.  Easy to use and does exactly what you would expect - it clips toenails with ease.</li>
    <li> Was almost going to see a podiatrist because my mother could no longer cut her own toenails - but this product works. She can do her nails now, they look great. Highly recommend this for think elderly toenails that regular clippers won&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> The price does not match the quality! Just not worth the price. It broke after i use it for 3 months.</li>
    <li> I received these toenail clippers yesterday and used them today(01/24/13). After years of struggling, using many other scissors and clippers with declining success and increasing contortions, these worked perfectly in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I acted on the other reviews.</li>
    <li> Needs to have beefer cutting frame and beefer downward pressure lever</li>
    <li> the sideway clipping is totally different than I ever use but it is very sharp.  Be careful.  It is good for only toes if you can handle it but otherwise nails is perfect but sharp and clean cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 and my toenails are so thick that a walmart clipper won&#x27;t do more than eat around the edges- this thing chomps my Godzilla nails like a chainsaw.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what my husband needed.  The Wide Jaw Slant Edge works perfect for Men&#x27;s Toenail Clippers. The cheaper ones were not wide enough and he didn&#x27;t need an extra (more expensive) inch wide edge.</li>
    <li> they are really great never had a toenail clipper this easy to use I would keep on buying them when needed</li>
    <li> My big toe nails had grown so thick, they could not be cut by large clippers or shears. I wasted money on several options until I found this. Amazing! Wide, sharp, comfortable to use. I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for my toenails. I use it for my fingers and it gives me a perfect square nail! Ladies, this is the clipper. ;D</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what to say a a a a a  aa a a a a a a a a a</li>
    <li> This clipper is exactly what I needed - a much larger opening - and it works perfectly for thicker toenails.</li>
    <li> These arrived timely and as advertised.  They are noticeably sharper than the others we&#x27;ve tried over&lt;br /&gt;the years, and the casing makes them more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Was quite pleased with the ease and comfort of this clipper the first time I used it.  Then the bolt holding together snapped the second time I tried to use this toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> this clipper works well on clipping nails but it fell apart the first time I used it. This item is junk and I would not recommend it to anyone. an expensive waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got 5 or 6 uses out of these clippers before the connecting pin popped out, making them unusable. This happened outside and I could not locate the pin to replace it. When I called the manufacturer, they were unhelpful since it had been a year since I purchased the item. Really disappointing considering all the good reviews of this product. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I deal for large/TALL people who have proportional nails which smaller clippers do not accommodate.</li>
    <li> Hard to use since it is at an angle.  I returned it after getting cut.</li>
    <li> The handle keeps falling off I used super glue to hold it into place but this should really be done by the manufacturer. Please correct for future! Thanks</li>
    <li> The pictures, etc, make it seem that this item is a fairly large clipper which could be used for toe nails.  Actually, it is just the same as the cheap small ones that you can get in any drug store........with a little plastic&amp;#34; jacket&amp;#34; on it.  It&#x27;s actually worse then the drugstore ones because the &amp;#34;jacket&amp;#34; gets in the way.  Don&#x27;t buy this you can get the same thing in a drug store for a buck.&lt;br /&gt;Jim w</li>
    <li> This is a terrific toenail clipper.  It is angled perfectly and this is a most efficient attribute.  Also the covered lever gives a solid grip when cutting, which is most impressive.  Really recommend this wide jaw toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> It leaves the nail rough after cutting &amp; I thought it would be more convex, not just straight across.&lt;br /&gt;It is sharp, though</li>
    <li> These are great toenail clippers, especially for people who have thick toenails. I bought these for my father.</li>
    <li> It came apart after limited use.</li>
    <li> Bought to cut my Dad&#x27;s toenails.  His big toes&#x27; toenails are very hard and thick and cannot be cut easily by other clippers or scissors, which are dangerous if you slip, so I used to just file them. The Mehaz cut this down so perfectly and effortlessly, that I&#x27;m now able to get the fungus medication to go under the toenails where it can work, and his nails are clearing up and turning normal again. I didn&#x27;t find that it collected the nails, as they seemed to fly everywhere, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, as it&#x27;s just a quick clean up, and the greater benefit outweighs any smaller disadvantages you might find.</li>
    <li> Very Very happy with this product. Lives up to its claim. Wide mouth allows ease for cutting thicker nails. Very sharp cuts without a problem.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper really does have a nice, wide opening.  I have VERY thick toenails and a few of them are impossible to cut, no regular clippers or scissors can do the job.  This one did.  I have one nail that regularly grows so thick on top that it can only be cut by going at it from odd angles to cut away chunks, it is very frustrating and I do not want to have to go to a podiatrist regularly just to have my nails trimmed.  I am very happy with this cutter and will probably buy another one or two to have on hand in case I lose it, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without this one.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both have one .I&#x27;m able to clip the hard to clip toenails without cutting myself.I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> These are the best toenail clippers I have ever used. Excellent leverage so you don&#x27;t have to push down real hard and very sharp. Makes the task much easier!</li>
    <li> I have two &amp;#34;pinky&amp;#34; toes that have nails which grow up instead of out. In order to properly cut and maintain them I must basely remove the whole nail.  These Clipper&#x27;s allow me to do just that</li>
    <li> My toenail&#x27;s are of average thickness, so no need for anything beyond standard clippers. The family indoor cat is polydactyl. On one of the paws several nails are deformed. We leave the nails on the long side (he&#x27;s a mouse assassin and long sharp nails are tools of the trade) and inadvertently, one of the deformed nails grew to touch the opposing pad. The standard cat clipper couldn&#x27;t do the job, and the jaws of a standard &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; nail clipper wasn&#x27;t wide enough. The Mehaz Professional saved the day (and a trip to the vet). The wide jaws allowed me to clip the nail, and all is well.</li>
    <li> Best clipper I have owned for my large toe nails.  Really does the job.  Wish it opened a little wider for ny think nails, but I still can manage to make it work.</li>
    <li> These clippers work very well</li>
    <li> I have very hard think toe nails and after three sets of different ones these were the last ones I bought. These work well and open wide enough to cut in two clips rather than piece work. Even the handle is comfortable. I&#x27;ve had these about three years and they are still sharp.</li>
    <li> I have crazy thick toenails and regular toenail clippers just do not cut it. I found these and they are perfect. I don&#x27;t dread cutting my toenails anymore. Get this item!</li>
    <li> Works well I brought three</li>
    <li> A real work horse - efficient and the end of hard to clip nails! ( even toe nails)</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice.  Neither one of them have arrived</li>
    <li> Having tried several toenail clippers that failed to do the job I purchased the Mehaz Clipper with some trepidation despite rave reviews. I am happy to say those reviews were right on. This clipper is shaarrrpp, well made, and easy to use. It made short work of my very thick nails. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally review products, but this item is such a loser I have to say something. Like others, I was tired of cheap clippers that just didn&#x27;t do the job, so I bought this thing. Now I have an expensive clipper that just doesn&#x27;t do the job. It will just barely cut nails; will not even cut small bits of skin that have torn loose. The edges LOOK sharp, but don&#x27;t cut. While it&#x27;s probably just personal taste, I do not like the straight edge, but since it won&#x27;t cut things, that&#x27;s pretty much a moot point. And it&#x27;s not heavy enough to even use as a paperweight. Pretty much useless -- buyer beware.</li>
    <li> The clipper fell apart after using it only twice.  The \\&quot;connector\\&quot; that held the clipper together flew out, almost hitting me in the eye.  I put the \\&quot;connector\\&quot; back several times, but it was not working properly and kept popping out.  The last time that happened it flew down the drain of my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the manufacturer, Mehaz, at first this guy I spoke to asked me to send him the broken clipper at my own expense so the company could fix it.  Then I asked to speak with a supervisor.  The supervisor, named Marcia, acknowledged that the problem with the connector happens all the time and said that she would send me a couple of replacement after I email her the model and my mailing address.  After I emailed her, she reneged on her promise and lied by saying that she only offered to send me a couple of \\&quot;connectors\\&quot;.  I explained again that I&#x27;d already tried to put back the connector many times but it kept popping out.  She also tried to blame me for the damage, even though she admitted in our first conversation that the problem I&#x27;ve experienced \\&quot;happens all the time\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the product is worthless, and Mehaz&#x27; guarantee a joke.</li>
    <li> GREAT clipper.  The opening is wider than most, which is great for my husbands toenails, and the angle makes it so much easier to clip nails.  Very ergonomic.  I&#x27;ve bought three now and even use it for clipping my cats nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made of metal and it snips. It&#x27;s a nail clipper! Of course you can snip other things, whatever you want, or even everything! It&#x27;s sharp and it works. Point made.</li>
    <li> the best nail clippers I have ever used.  a very good product. sturdy and easy to operate</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know a nail clipper like this existed, so imagine how happy I was to find this.  I have thick toenails on my big toes, and this is just what I was looking for.  Be careful, though, the clipper is very sharp and the blade is angled, so make sure the clipper is positioned the right way before you squeeze down on it.  You wouldn&#x27;t want to take off a piece of your toe instead of the nail!  Love the design and the color too.</li>
    <li> finally-- clippers designed specifically for thicker toenails..love love love it..didnt even know such a product existed until i happened upon these &#x3D;&#x3D;highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have tried that says made in Japan.  They squeak, get stuck/jammed and the handle feel loose.  The cheap made in China are 10 times better than these.  I can&#x27;t not recommend this thing to anyone.</li>
    <li> These clippers took a bit of getting used to, since they are angled, but they work well cutting my thick toenails. The plastic-coated handle also seems to provide better control against slipping and is comfortable to hold. A good purchase at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Be careful these babies are sharp and angle makes them dangerous</li>
    <li> It works way better then expected. Be careful... Very sharp.</li>
    <li> I do like the ergonomics and the sharpness of the cutting edge, however I find it pointless to angle a straight cut. I found myself cutting way too close on one side of the nail because it took too much thought gauging how close to get to the nail. I much prefer my older, less sharp, curved clippers where the cutting result is more predictable. Used them once. Never again.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail clipper I have ever had !&lt;br /&gt;The wide  jaw feature is really great an useful.</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it worked far bettter than I hoped it would. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> m&lt;br /&gt;I have severe toe fungus, these are the ONLY clippers that can cut my thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to any one with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;This is just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, functional, solid built product.</li>
    <li> After years of banging my pinky toes on table legs and other furniture, the nails got extremely thick...  I had trouble trimming them down as they grew and could never get a clean trim... so they&#x27;ve always been trimmed grotesquely.  After I discovered this wide jaw toenail clipper, I decided to buy it.  I am extremely happy that I can trim my entire thickened toenail in one cut!  No more having to struggle with regular nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Total piece of c--p. Broke with the first use. do not buy this product! Also cuts on angle that makes the edge of the nail a sharp weapon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m astonished!!  I just received this toenail clipper and I can&#x27;t believe it.  At this point, I have only used it once and it is amazing.  I didn&#x27;t have to soak my feet to soften my nails.  I just clipped.  It worked astonishingly well and no pain, no discomfort.  I highly recommend this clipper and I have never said that about any product I&#x27;ve purchased anywhere.  Really, it&#x27;s most efficient.</li>
    <li> I tried to clip a nail and this clipper fell apart on the first clip.  Tried to put it back together and couldn&#x27;t.  This is a total piece of junk!  It shouldn&#x27;t even be offered on Amazon!  I am returning it for a refund.</li>
    <li> It seems to be just fine. It works well on thick toenails!</li>
    <li> I have very tough toe nails - this product makes clipping my nails &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> very sharp, be careful or you will draw blood, keep bandages on hand lol</li>
    <li> Works very well, particularly on thick nails.</li>
    <li> The main purpose for buying these clippers is to cut my thick toenails that are like steel unless soaked in water. These clippers are made in japan and because they are so sharp, and have a large opening to accept the nail, they do a great job of cutting those stubborn toe nails. The clippers are angled best for a right hander but I had no trouble using my left hand too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue plastic is designed to catch the clippings. It doesn&#x27;t do a good job of it which is why the 4 stars instead of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the clippers.</li>
    <li> I have extra large toe nais and are hard to cut.  These worked like a charm.  A good buy and very good craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hoped the claimed &amp;#34;wider jaw&amp;#34; might do a better job on my quite gnarly big toes.  In the past I&#x27;ve sometimes used a Dremel-type power tool (just like the one my  podiatrist has) to grind down those nails, which are almost too thick to cut.  On measuring, I found the jaws of this Mehaz opened five millimeters apart.  My other common drugstore type toenail clipper (TRIM brand) opened one silly little millimeter less.  So the Mehaz is slightly better at nipping away, and its non-slip covering is a good feature, but double the price seems a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  At any crafts store you can get 1/8&amp;#34;-thick sheets of self-adhesive foam rubber in many colors.  Ideal for adding do-it-yourself non-slip functionality to any old clipper, or anything else around the house  :^)  On Amazon search for &amp;#34;Fiber Craft 40-Pack Adhesive Foam Sheets, 5 by 7-Inch, Multi Colored&amp;#34;.  The stuff is great for many uses.  It even keeps my bifocals from sliding down  :^)</li>
    <li> My husband has very thick toenails and couldn&#x27;t use regular clippers.  These work great and he has no problem cutting his thick nails now.</li>
    <li> Fantastic clipper for thick stubborn toenails.  This clipper allows you to apply a lot of force easily, which is great for people who have extra thick nails.</li>
    <li> I have big toes and hard toenails...  This is an excellent way to cut &amp; trim them.  I recommend this clipper to everyone and anyone that wants to have nice looking feet and toes.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Just what I needed. Since you are going to dictate what I write, I will not give you my opinion again</li>
    <li> These clippers worked well twice, although they were a bit hard to use. Then they literally fell apart. A great disappointment and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Product itself is good. It&#x27;s bit large but not hard to use. Plastic covers helped to clean the place.Nice item</li>
    <li> I love this toenail clipper because it opens MUCH wider than ordinary ones soo that I&#x27;m able to cut my toenails VERY easily!!! Thanks so much; it&#x27;s a wonderful tool!!!</li>
    <li> The angle took a little getting used to, but happy with the results.  Very little effort needed for the thickest of nails.</li>
    <li> Actually bought this to replace one that we had had for 20 years.  The catcher on this doesn&#x27;t exactly catch the nails, but it&#x27;s good and sharp and so far seems to be holding up to use.</li>
    <li> finally a pair of toenail clippers where your hand doesn&#x27;t slip , the blades are wide enough to go over your toenail and strong enough to clip with ease.</li>
    <li> again another stupid requirement for more than I am prepared tpo spend the time- and yet if I don&#x27;t rate the [product you keep sending nagging reminders</li>
    <li> Works OK on finger nails, but not on toenails.  Not sturdy enough and could be a little larger to make gripping easier. Good straight edge design though.</li>
    <li> Clippers were purchased for my husband.  It is exactly what he wanted.  He likes the way the straight angled clippers works.&lt;br /&gt;And of course the wide angled Jaw is just perfect for a mans foot.</li>
    <li> These are the best Toenail and fingernail clipppers I have ever bought. It is built sturdy and it is angled for easy clipping.</li>
    <li> This is the only clipper I ever found that makes clipping easy  I have thick toenails with one slightly ingrown.  I can&#x27;t ever clip the ingrown corner with standard clippers.  This worked!  Not only does it clip easily with thick nails, but it also enabled me to clip the ingrown corner of the nail (something that is very difficult to do).  Highly recommed these clippers for men or anyone with thick or ingrown toenails.</li>
    <li> these clippers are the absolute best! I take care of my husband and son who are diabetic so you know what kind of toe nails they have (not pretty feet) and these clippers have saved me a ton of time in trimming their toe nails, also i kept my oldest sister who had an overgrown big toe nail and these babies chopped it down and away from under her skin. I was elated and so was she!</li>
    <li> Product does what it was intended for and good quality.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by these clippers. They are difficult to use and don&#x27;t make a clean cut along my toe nails. They are awkward and make my nails look they were cut by a kindergartener, plus require a huge amount of filling to even out all the jagged edges they leave. I&#x27;m surprised at all the high ratings, they&#x27;re some of the worst nail clippers I&#x27;ve owned and I wish I&#x27;d saved the packaging to return them.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a bad or defective unit because mine does not cut cleanly no matter toenail or fingernail. It was driving me nuts not cutting through a nail no matter how many times I tried. I don&#x27;t know how it happened, but it also came apart after a few weeks. What a waste of money, no guarantee.</li>
    <li> An awsome tool for 75 year old toenails, Well designed, wide jaws and good leverage. I am happy I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I especially liked the straight edge cutting surface.</li>
    <li> My poor mom has trouble cutting her nails, because of arthritis and I was in search of nail clippers she could grasp well I found one she loves.  Fast shipping. We are both happy!</li>
    <li> works on thick toe nails.  now i no longer have to use the cat&#x27;s clippers.  just be careful to not chop off the end of your toe.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Bulky, couldn&#x27;t see the nail I was cutting.  Tore my nail.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these - I was hoping to get top-of-the-line out-of-this-world nail clippers, the likes of which I had never seen or used before. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the small luxuries,&amp;#34; I told myself as I made this purchase. I looked forward to lavish toe nail clipping sessions and for summer-time complements from female beach-goers: &amp;#34;How do you cut your toes like that, and what are you doing tonight?!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops. Nope. Didn&#x27;t happen. These clippers totally made me cringe. I wish I returned them. Instead I just threw them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was attracted to the picture of the device, which looks well made and attractive. I also saw a significant number of positive reviews, which further enticed me to make the purchase. Unfortunately, I did not find these to be usable clippers for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them large and awkward. It was difficult to use them for their purpose - to cut toe nails. Using them felt forced and uncomfortable; the blades did not seem sharp enough (cutting toe nails with a dull-feeling clippers &#x3D; cringe-worthy!). It was just an unpleasant experience. I had to apply force to use them, and that was not enjoyable; it did not make my toes happy, and it was not a relaxing -pamper-yourself experience. I&#x27;m a pretty agile person, and I felt I had very little maneuverability with the clippers. My movements felt inexact - definitely not what I wanted to feel when I&#x27;m using sharp objects around my feet and toes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device did feel solid and seemed well made, which is why I am giving it 2-stars instead of 1-star. I have used junk products before, and I don&#x27;t think this is &amp;#34;junk.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s definitely not for me, but I could see why others may have had better experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, as of this review, the current price on Amazon is nearly half of what I paid a few years ago - if you need a clipper and aren&#x27;t sure how to wade through the mix of positive and negative reviews, it might be worth ordering them to give them ashot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to promote a product I didn&#x27;t like, but considering the price and the positive reviews, it might be worth the risk, especially if you haven&#x27;t been able to find clippers that work well for you. There are a lot of great reviews (some people saying they&#x27;re the the best clippers they have ever owned!). Maybe I got a bad one, or maybe these will work well for some and not for others. But yeah, of course I will never purchase them again, and, like I said, found the entire experience to be cringe-worthy.</li>
    <li> These clippers are wide enough to clip even the thickest nails! They are quite smooth and sharp and so far are doing an excellent job with my thick toe nails!</li>
    <li> Nice wide space between jaws, able to fit a thick old crusty toenail into it, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Like the angled clip. It&#x27;s very sharp. I accidentally cut into the skin of one toenail. It makes a nice, clean clip.</li>
    <li> I live in GA and was pleasantly surprised that my order for the Mehaz Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper was received from the vender in CA within four days, this despite being shipped using the USPS.  The product is of high quality, providing the leverage and sharp cutters for thick nails that I would normally not expect for the price.  I especially like the built-in file.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper handles thick toenails. It cuts cleanly and quickly through the thickest toenails.  It&#x27;s an excellent product. It is the only toenail clipper I have used, outside of a podiatrist&#x27;s office, that works. Prior to the Mehaz I had to use scissors and a strong nailfile.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a clippers for my husband who hs very thick toenails.  This is the only one that I have found that he is happy with as it opens wide enough to get the job done!</li>
    <li> Really good if you have any &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; with thick or tough toe nails due to injuries over the years</li>
    <li> Finally! Clippers wide enough to cut my dad&#x27;s THICK nails. Easy to grip, too.</li>
    <li> These are straight edged clippers..not curved, but they are angled. I didn&#x27;t see this in the description of the product and am not accustomed to an angled clipper, so I&#x27;ve cut myself twice, trying to use these. They are light, wide mouthed and very sharp so be careful with them. I&#x27;m a little scared of them now, but will continue to carefully use them. Not sure how sturdy this product is..they are rather light weight and they do have an exceptionally easy grip, but only time will tell if they hold up. If you have good eyesight, and are very careful, then I recommend them..otherwise, beware!</li>
    <li> I love the wide jaw, but I with the blade was straight instead of angled</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but I can&#x27;t avoid cutting toe tips to bits with this. Conventional style clippers work fine for me.</li>
    <li> Love this, best one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  My toenails are hard to cut, but these do the job great.  I am so glad I bought this, I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  I have had several others, but had all kinds of problems getting them to cut my nails.  If you have this problem, try these - they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Best clipper that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I recommend this clipper to anyone that needs a firm grasp when cutting nails.</li>
    <li> I am finally able to cut my thick toenails easily.  The cutter is complete and really zips through the task.  My only complaint is the cutting edge is slanted instead of straight and you can easily cut too close to the nail bed.  The slanted tip also makes pedicures a little more challenging.m if the edge was straight it would be a complete winner.</li>
    <li> Works well. Maybe the slanted handle is an ergonomic thing. Works just like a nailcutter. Arrived in time too. I like it</li>
    <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I&#x27;m using this nail clipper with handicapping arthritis, maybe I&#x27;d go left or right on the 2 stars that I&#x27;ve given it.  I had a La Cross nail clipper that worked well for many years until it developed legs.  So, I&#x27;ve bought numerous brand name replacements because that particular La Cross model is no longer available.  One company was nice enough to send me three free models; all were a disappointment.  The Mehaz Wide Jaw was one of the many that I&#x27;ve purchased in less than a year and nothing comes close to that old La Cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this Mehaz concerns the annoying location of that abrasive file; it would have been better if they hadn&#x27;t glued it to the lever.  The second peev is with the angled edge; it&#x27;s not a straight or curved edge; it&#x27;s an acute angle edge, which I guess would be okay if you hold the clipper at less than ninety degrees to the nail that you&#x27;re cutting, but that design doesn&#x27;t work well with my arthritic hands. Also because of the angled edge, I end up with a jagged nail cut because I have to cut the nail in sections.  My sock got caught on the jagged big toe nail, causing the toe to bend up and making me walk awkwardly and in pain until I managed to pull the shoe off.  Then I had to work the sock loose without knowing exactly how it was caught in the nail.  As the nails grew, they also snagged in the sheets, making me get out of bed to smooth the annoying nail with a file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I believe that these clippers will work better as a straight or curved edge, I&#x27;ve ordered another Mehaz model and hope that I will have better luck.  Of course, I&#x27;ve also managed to find three different La Cross models, which are now manufactured by Sally Hansen and a third company whose name I can&#x27;t recall at this time.</li>
    <li> Good nail clipper. The angled cutting tip takes a little getting used to but once you know the solution to cutting your skin thing get much better.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> The jaws have a large opening and so one is able to get large, curved toenails into cutting position.  The padded handle is nice.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Yes this is the clipper of all clippers I even bought one for a friend ... they arent cheap feeling and have a nice sturdy grip and the Jaws and super sharp!</li>
    <li> This clipper gives a nice, gentle, quiet and smooth cut. I like this clipper. I have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered clippers that promised the world and then delivered an abandoned ghost town. These clippers did everything they promised and more.</li>
    <li> I have these horrible hard thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is kind of expensive it is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts right through my industrial duty toenails.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do a good job of catching the clippings, and the slanted shape is trickier than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Hardly use it due to these facts.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like that these broke before I could finish one foot (5 toes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it just came undone while I was using them bad product&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your time or money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long shipping time</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had expected from online reviews, but still better than any clippers I&#x27;ve previously used.  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Works well on thick nails. It could work a little bit better but it gets the job done. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> What a great clipper!!  Sharp, very powerful, very little effort to get through tough nails.  Makes those store bought ones really look like toys. Very sharp, so you should be extra careful.</li>
    <li> I used this clipper the first time on thick toenails and was disappointed that it  had difficulty cutting the big toe the jaws were wide enough but not enough force to cut the nail, took several cuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old lady with thick yellow old-lady toenails. Trimming my hobbit claws was always such a tricky yet tedious chore with normal toenail clippers. I was done in three minutes with these masterful wide-jawed babies. The leverage is amazing! I must have for us old farts.</li>
    <li> Having purchased this clipper about a year ago, I was happy to see all the glowing reports as to how effective it was for the intended job.  I too liked the action and fit of this device, but ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a handful of uses (6-12) the handle broke off at the stud/connector point.  Alas, only now did I happen to come across an earlier review (October 29, 2012) that detailed the exact same problem, and about being stonewalled by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic parts for load-bearing strees point is a fatal design ...  especially if one no longer has soft, pliable, &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; nails.</li>
    <li> Exceptionally good for thick nails.</li>
    <li> Just as the title says, and the angle will take a few minutes to learn to use this clipper properly. After that, it will take less time to do the job. It&#x27;s sharp, strong and well made.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t capture the clippings.  The metal bends.</li>
    <li> I got these after much research. My husband goes through nail/toenail clippers like crazy.  He really likes these and thinks they do the best job.  I don&#x27;t think he realizes/cares about the catch-all, so we cannot comment on the usefulness of it.</li>
    <li> I have one really gamey toenail. If you&#x27;re still reading, congratulations and I can&#x27;t believe the stuff we put online for everyone to read nowadays. Whatever! This clipper cuts all of my other toenails without issue. My one big toenail definitely gives it a run for its money. I do eventually get it to go, but it takes some effort. Yeah, I know. Sexy, right? Me, hunched over my Quasimodo toe, grunting like an ape, scaring the cats and falling off the bed. But, man! When I get that hunk of nail off. What a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve thought of fashioning some kind of theft-deterrent system out of these scary hunks of demon-toe clippings; however, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some kind of county ordinance preventing it. 4 stars because of the amount of effort it takes. Otherwise, great clippers.</li>
    <li> Sharp, heavy duty with a nice grip and feel. The angle comes in handy for a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in Japan with quality steel, not China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic catcher can be removed and the included emery board on the handle is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality product at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Great for tough toenails. A clean cut and really helps with ingrown toenails. I do not how I lived without this long.  Highly recommend -  lifetime warranty.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to receive such a quality product. But they are very sharp and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. They arrived in no time too -- another really nice surprise!</li>
    <li> I have been annoyed with my flimsy little nail clippers. They are okay on my fingernails, but totally inadequate for toenails. Wide Jaw slant toenail clippers give me control, they clip the thickest claws and don&#x27;t slip. I love them!</li>
    <li> I found the quality to be very good on this toenail clipper, however I should have read the description more carefully for the dimensions of the item. They are much too big for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size toenails.</li>
    <li> These seem to be well built, but though the jaws are wider than regular cheapo toenail clippers, they are nowhere near wide enough to accomodate my extra thick big toe toenails ....... what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does a great job on those toenails</li>
    <li> These are the best toenail scissors as far as I am concerned! They get all of the nail, so you are done much more quickly then thought!</li>
    <li> Purchased these in 2012 &amp; still functioning like new. Both my husband and myself use these clippers on some thick and tough toenails and these continue as sharp and functional as the day we first used. The angled &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; makes for easy clipping toward the sides of the nail while leaving an even clip across the top. Rarely is filing needed. To say we&#x27;re getting our money&#x27;s worth out out of these would be an understatement!</li>
    <li> These work really well on thick toe nails as well as finger nails.  Really sharp and strong, but be careful as the wide &amp;#34;JAWS&amp;#34; can bite  you.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would also work for cutting finger nails. Like how well it cuts the toenails. It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp and cut smooth and clean. The wide jaws fit my thick toenails easily. The a angled shape makes reaching all areas easier. These are much better than the new Trim clippers. I was disappointed in the Trim. Their quality has gone downhill. But these Mahaz are great.</li>
    <li> The unit I received had blades that didn&#x27;t line up, bent when operated (which caused it to pop out of the clippings catcher), and just didn&#x27;t have much cutting power unless the handle was at an EXACT angle. The file is a sticker on the handle, and is positioned such that you can&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;d like to sand your toes, too. I have other clippers stamped \\&quot;KAI,\\&quot; and they&#x27;re great... Not sure what&#x27;s up with these.</li>
    <li> Pretty good nail clipper, but like another reviewer said, for some reason these don&#x27;t cut cleanly and they leave ragged nails.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have one of those foldaway files.  The angle of the clippers takes some getting used to, but they do seem to clip easier than any others I&#x27;ve used, and they&#x27;ve held up for well over a year.  Still....jagged edges?  Not.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cutting thicker toenails; however, it didn&#x27;t stay sharp very long. I assumed it would cut well a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> The very best clippers for thick toenails.  So happy to have found these.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Well made--makes  clipping toenails very easy.</li>
    <li> Total crap. the screw that holds the handle together bent and the clippers fell part. Junk.</li>
    <li> I love this one it has a wide opening so I can cut thick nails with ease. I wish I could find one like it that makes a straight cut.</li>
    <li> File is cumbersome. The cut is off, leaves a bur. Im glad I found my old pair of nippes 557&#x27;s</li>
    <li> great product for those of us who have thick nails.</li>
    <li> Best nail clipper I&#x27;ve owned. Easy to position for use, cuts well.</li>
    <li> These are excellent clippers for people with tough nails, fungus nails, irregular nails, etc. They provide a much wider &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; than normal but are easy to handle and manipulate. I read other reviews stating that they &amp;#34;flew apart with pieces nearly gouging out eyeballs&amp;#34;  --now, I am not saying that these are lies, but I would like to see a video tape of that incident. Seriously? If the manufacturer didn&#x27;t honor their warranty it is likely because they too were totally skeptical of such a fanciful and dramatic story.  Weigh the number of positive reviews vs the foolishness.</li>
    <li> A really good toenail clipper</li>
    <li> Having some toenails that were just too thick to fit into a normal toenail clipper, I decided to give these &amp;#34;Wide Jaw&amp;#34; clippers a try. The extra wide jaw allowed me to cut my thick toenails perfectly! The clippers are very sharp, have a nail file built into the handle and, as you can see in the picture, the rubber coated handles make it very easy to grip and cut. For me, the slanted jaw did not effect the ease of use positively nor negatively. I heartily recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have tough toenails and I&#x27;ll leave it there. When I first opened these, I thought \\&quot;Uh Oh. Seems a little flimsy.\\&quot; But they work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. Careful though. They&#x27;re sharp. I knicked something and it looked like a Dateline style murder house on my bathroom floor for a bit.</li>
    <li> it was broken when i use first time.&lt;br /&gt;poor quality, and bad bite of the blades is a pretty fundamental problem.&lt;br /&gt;I want to get back my money.</li>
    <li> The cutting edge did not line up. I had to bend it a little in order for the blades to line up even.</li>
    <li> It came apart after I clipped the 2nd toe---had to figure out how to put it back together--once together it worked ok---bad machined fitting.</li>
    <li> Bought them by my daughter-in-law who has used them for sometime. Cuts my big toe nails which are really thick with ease.</li>
    <li> Wide, sturdy and no more jagged freshly trimmed nails.  My only regret is that I waited until I was sixty to get a functional toe nail clipper.</li>
    <li> I have had thick toenails and fingernails all my life.  Some people envy my fingernails because they will grow long and look great. However, my toenails have always been tough to clip. With age, even more so.  I have always used professional clippers because regular clippers would not cut them.  Now that I have neuropathy in my hands, it has been even harder to deal with. I clip them after a shower so that they soften some, but it is still painful to my hands, and I just don&#x27;t have the strength.  The Mehaz clippers have better leverage and great grip with the little textured pad on the lever.  They also have wide jaws which other clippers I have tried don&#x27;t have, even though they advertise that they do.  These clippers are razor sharp so they require care because they will cut whatever is put between the blades. So, with great leverage, a really wide jaw and very sharp blades, these are the ones for me.  Best clippers I have found for thick toenails.</li>
    <li> if i didn&#x27;t throw away the packaging i would have returned it asap. this cuts nails horribly. i don&#x27;t understand how it could have good reviews.</li>
    <li> Sharp is good, but being unaccustomed to cutting with a slanted blade has been &amp;#34;challenging.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, these clippers are very, very, very, VERY sharp. The first time I used them, I clipped the top of my toe off and ended up in the emergency room. Because the blades are so sharp, I didn&#x27;t feet it when I clipped and subsequently made quite a mess!</li>
    <li> This clipper did a nice job until it fell apart; it only lasted a short while.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced with the much better Tweezerman clipper.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s toenails became so thick they were impossible to cut with most clippers.  He broke several pairs.  These did the trick!  Super wide opening, and very sturdy.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Strong clippers, very sharp, seem overpriced for the weight, plus the glued on thumb traction piece fell off and had to be reglued.</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper in May 2012 and use it only once a month.  In December, I went to open the clipper up and it fell apart into three pieces.  The bolt fell out and I&#x27;m unable to put it back together.  I attempted to contact seller to just do an even exchange for the product, not return it.  There is no available option after 7 months for contact seller.  They provided an address if I wanted to return product but would only get a partial refund.  No telephone number was given because obviously they don&#x27;t want you to continue with returning it or them having to replace a poorly made product.  Thank goodness I still kept my cheap faithful Revlon Nail clipper that I&#x27;ve had for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just got off the phone with customer service and they were wonderful by refunding me the money and emailing a mailing label.  Although it was difficult to naviage through the site and no way to resolve my issue, I decided to take one last stab at it and call.  I was extremely pleased by the reults.  I will continue to shop on Amazon without hesitation :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying to find clippers that work on difficult toenails.  My husband used his Dremil drill.  It worked but not the best solution.  These clippers make quick work of trimming thick nails.  You do need to take your time so you don&#x27;t catch skin in it.  I haven&#x27;t had the problem but know that it could happen.</li>
    <li> is one of the best clippers I have ever had. Cuts all the way through even thick nails and the handy catcher keeps the nail clippings corraled.</li>
    <li> After searching in several types of stores and not finding what I need, I finally got smart and went online.  I have toenails that have curved and been squeezed smaller due to a bunion.  Standard curved clippers absolutely don&#x27;t work well or at all on some of these toenails.  As soon as I saw the picture of the straight edge on this clipper, I ordered it.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  And it works on my toenail - straight, curved, large, or small.  I&#x27;m getting one to keep at our beach house and one to keep in my travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane Wege</li>
    <li> I have been looking forever for a great set of toe nail clipper&#x27;s and now I have found them.&lt;br /&gt;My large nails are some what thick and these clippers fit the bill for me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for your toe nails (you will not be sorry and the price is right.)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AMAZON.COM for carrying this product.&lt;br /&gt;ps. These are very sharp, please be careful. Do not let children use without being present&lt;br /&gt;by an adult.</li>
    <li> My first high quality clippers and they definitely look like they&#x27;ll last. They are pretty sharp but the cut on the one I got was not as even as it should be.</li>
    <li> My husband keeps taking my toenail clipper so I bought this for myself.  It works really well and am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it gets the job done, quickly, and efficiently. These clippers are ideal for anyone that has thicker than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; nails.</li>
    <li> I bought the Seki edge toenail clipper and liked it very much, but I tend to prefer a straight cutting clipper. So I ordered the Mehaz. I have a 10-year-old dime store clipper that works better. The Mehaz is pretty sharp, but I had to bear down so hard to trim my big toe that I was afraid the clipper would break; it didn&#x27;t, but it sure bent. If you&#x27;re considering a nail cutter, buy the Seki. Much stronger and sharper.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing. They are extremely sharp, I even managed to cut myself pretty good with both blades by cleaning them off with my fingers assuming they wouldn&#x27;t be all that sharp. So be careful haha</li>
    <li> These clippers work great. I have thick toe nails and trouble cutting them. This product cuts right through them with no pain and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This gizmo sure looks like it will do the job of cleanly cutting my thick, tough toe nails.  But, alas, it does not.  The two cutting edges to not meet cleanly and evenly.  They don&#x27;t cut the nail so much as chip it and break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the diagonal cut would work well, but ergonomically, it&#x27;s a loser -- hard to get squarely on the nail.  Then when you do cut, you&#x27;re most likely to see the nail splinter, needing serious cleanup work.  Well, OK, the cutter comes with a nice diamond file on the cutting lever, so at least you don&#x27;t have to go looking for it.  Not much in the way of nail scraps is collected in the pocket where it should go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And based on the catalog entry I had been anticipating giving this 5 stars.  No.</li>
    <li> Among the products online in this category, it is difficult to tell from the photos whether the jaws are wide enough, and how well they would cut. I took a chance on this one, and got lucky. The jaws are indeed wide, and they cut very well.</li>
    <li> My OLD toenail clippers were getting dull, and they were all metal and harder to hold. These clippers are bigger so they require less effort to push through even thick toenails, they are sharp, and the plastic parts make them easier to grip and less likely to slip. The plastic &amp;#34;trap&amp;#34; for clipped nails doesn&#x27;t work at all, so you still need some way to deal with the clippings (I rest my foot on the toilet seat, voila!). Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent design and high quality production values. Very impressed with what they&#x27;re providing. Definitely would recommend if anyone asked me to recommend a nail clipper. LOL!</li>
    <li> They are wide enough to clip thick nails.  It is very hard to find a tool as good as this.</li>
    <li> My sisters and I all have the same type of thick toenails so I ordered us each a pair. These are very sturdy toenail clippers. I take them with me when I go to get a pedicure and I&#x27;m always asked for the name of these. They are great!</li>
    <li> Blue protective cover makes it difficult to get close enough cut on hangnails.  Large size makes it easier to get enough leverage to cut for us senior citizens.</li>
    <li> Everything it said it was.. My husband is very happy with it.. perfect size for nail and for his hand..</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding a nail clipper that has wide enough jaws to cut my husband&#x27;s thick toenails.  These work great!  They fit over the nails easily and are very easy to control.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Terrible! They fell apart in my hand the first time I used them. What a waste of money. I would not buy any of their products again. Very poorly made.</li>
    <li> This seems to do the job and it does catch the clippings. I just wish it was a bit more sturdy. So far so good though.</li>
    <li> These are oversized and easy to handle and maneuver.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Clipper is very sharp&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Clipper is great for only one side of the foot, because of the angle. You have to clip upside down in order to get the opposite foot because of the angle.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper itself is thick, so it&#x27;s hard to get a close cut without cutting your skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I ordered a straight across clipper because this one is too difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I love that the blade is so sharp and that it opens very wide, but the slant edge takes a little time to get used to.  I may order another one without the slant edge.</li>
    <li> Work great  now can finally cut my heavy duty toenails without cutting half of my toe off&lt;br /&gt;Would buy a second set</li>
    <li> We have a few pairs of these.  My husband keeps misplacing them, and they are the only ones he likes.&lt;br /&gt;They seam to be great with his Thick Toe Nails that standard clippers cant cut.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper actually works.</li>
    <li> I bought these to keep my fingernails trimmed.  As a guy, I never worried so much about them until I started playing the fiddle.  This set stays in my fiddle case to keep my nails trimmed.</li>
    <li> Well made and very functional.</li>
    <li> My husband tried these, but didn&#x27;t like them.  I think they work well for a heavier nail, and I like the slanted edge.  I have not tried doing my husbands toenails as yet with them.</li>
    <li> These work great, especially if you have some thickened toenails, or your nails are quite curved.  Nice and sharp, and easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> Every time I got near my little Pekehund with doggie toe nail trimmers he just freaked out...I tried regular toe nail clippers and they were not wide enough for all his nails....this works great and I would have paid twice as much for this solution...he no longer shows me his teeth when I trim his nails.....great product</li>
    <li> These are somewhat awkward to use.</li>
    <li> these are quite large so look at size in case you are looking for something smaller; so far so good for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with thick toe nails for years, and the drug store clippers did no good. This is a superior product, very well made! Fast shipper!</li>
    <li> Absolutely works as advertised. I have thick nails and regular clippers are worthless. This nail clipper took care of the nail with no problem.</li>
    <li> This has been so great.  I could not clip my toenails with regular clippers.  This was a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> A wider opening than any clipper we&#x27;ve ever had and it takes surprisingly little force to make a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;A great value for older folks like us.</li>
    <li> Love the wide jaw but i wish the blade was not on an angle.  A straight blade would make this item a solid 5 star unit.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality at a very good price &#x3D; great value.</li>
    <li> My husband has very thick toenails. He has many types of clippers around and none have been able to do the job. This pair works great. Now he wont need to get a wire cutter for the job, lol! Seriously these are the best. Highly recommended.</li>
