      <li>I&#x27;ve used this hair gel for many years.  </li>
      <li>I think we finally found the perfect combination with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line.</li>
      <li>I like that it has alcohol, whereas many gels advertise</li>
      <li>Pretty good hair gel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best - cheap, strong, doesn&#x27;t leave white residue.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the melting Gel Strong Hold.</li>
      <li>It just works fine for my needs.</li>
      <li>, hair feels great when cleaned with regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>and this last purchase was a great deal</li>
      <li>Not only is it a great price</li>
      <li>Gave it two starts because it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
      <li>I am Sikh and I use it everyday for tying my beard and it works great - now using it over 2 years and works better than anything else I have tried...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several brands of hair-gels and I think this one by far is the best.</li>
      <li>I think this is the best hair product for girls with pixie cuts because it makes you look mature enough to be a movie director</li>
      <li>but it gets delivered right to my door!  </li>
      <li>basic hair gel, good price</li>
      <li>Gel Sets quickly.  </li>
      <li>As advertised and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Pretty stylish + reasonable cost!</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much for it to work.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s a pain to find exactly this type in the store, so I bought it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical about purchasing it, however was very happy with the purchase!</li>
      <li>Really!</li>
      <li>It is good for the price, and it give a firm hold.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you get this kind (the MEGA) - the other kind (invisible) is too thin for me.  </li>
      <li>I use it on wet hair most of the time.</li>
      <li>It works really well for hair that is...uncooperative.</li>
      <li>The strongest gel without too much perfumy scent.</li>
      <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of it for me to gel my hair backwards</li>
      <li>and it really does hold.</li>
      <li>i normally use</li>
      <li>The one thing he can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and stands straight up , and I wear it very short , so I need something to really hold it down -</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake, stays firm all day and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>My advice is to spend a little more money and get a product that actually works.</li>
      <li>but if you really want to keep your hair spiked you might choose a different brand as this wears off after 4-5 hours!</li>
      <li>This brand really does hold and last all day/night.</li>
      <li>This is a product I had not previously used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed with other brands that they won&#x27;t hold very long or hold through strong winds.</li>
      <li>For my son and husband, they can go to bed and will  have  same hair look as when they  put the gel the morning before but is gentle enough that you can put your fingers through the hair and is still soft.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been using this stuff since i was in high school, and now my high school aged daughter swears by it.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you get it when the price is down though; seems to flux up and down.</li>
      <li>only gel that works on my husband&#x27;s super THICK hair</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for years to keep my short wavy in place, My daughter uses it to keep her longer edges in place. It doesn&#x27;t flake, stays firm all day and washes out easily. I use it on wet hair most of the time. It can flake if you use too much on dry hair.</li>

    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this stuff since i was in high school, and now my high school aged daughter swears by it.  gives her great beachy waves in her hair, and keeps all frizz at bay.  love it!</li>

    <li> The strongest gel without too much perfumy scent.</li>
    <li> This get is used daily by my son and husband.  It keeps the hair in place but not looking wet and it doesn&#x27;t flake during the day either.  For my son and husband, they can go to bed and will  have  same hair look as when they  put the gel the morning before but is gentle enough that you can put your fingers through the hair and is still soft.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, Holds my hair in place nicely without being sticky.</li>

    <li> Nice and smells good.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works on my thin/fine hair. Love it !!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair gel, which I&#x27;ve been using for years.  Sometimes it&#x27;s a pain to find exactly this type in the store, so I bought it on Amazon.  I like that it has alcohol, whereas many gels advertise they are &#x27;alcohol-free&#x27; and then the product doesn&#x27;t fully evaporate and you have goo on your hair.  Yes, a hair dryer would help, but sometimes you don&#x27;t dry every spec of your hair or you would like it to air dry.</li>
    <li> Good balance of hold and stiffness. Holds all day and isn&#x27;t heavy.  No residue or buildup, hair feels great when cleaned with regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great hair care product.  Cannot always find in the store and this is priced less.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. He has tried many products and this is THE one. It keeps his hair in place and makes it shiny.</li>
    <li> local drug store stopped selling this. great product.</li>
    <li> good price for item i normally use</li>
    <li> Pretty stylish + reasonable cost!</li>
    <li> The only hair gel I will use.</li>
    <li> I get this hair gel through the subscribe and save program for my husband.  Not only is it a great price but it gets delivered right to my door!  My husband is a bit picky on his hair gel.  He doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot but also doesn&#x27;t want the gel to get flaky.  I think we finally found the perfect combination with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line.</li>
    <li> For my needs, Wally-World sells a gel</li>
    <li> Good product. Same as the one at retail stores but at a lower price. Will definitely purchase  this product again</li>
    <li> This stuff is crap.  It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place, it wears off in a few hours, and it&#x27;s flaky.  Gave it two starts because it&#x27;s cheap.  My advice is to spend a little more money and get a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time</li>
    <li> Gel holds well and doesn&#x27;t flake. It gives good shine too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair gel for many years.  It does what it suppose to do without any greasy residue and it combs out at the end of the day and washes of with the morning shower.  I try to stock it when i find a good price and this last purchase was a great deal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for years. It is simply the best hair gel there is.</li>
    <li> For a 3 dollar value, works just as good as the $12 dollar brand</li>
    <li> I am Sikh and I use it everyday for tying my beard and it works great - now using it over 2 years and works better than anything else I have tried...</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and like it as there is no set look.  The hair stays soft,and slight curl stays.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years. No longer available in the stores, but thanks to Amazon I am able to still buy this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is a product I had not previously used.  It seems to be what I needed.</li>
    <li> I like this hair gel. I use it for my son. Bought this after my son had a bad haircut.I desperately needed something to style his hair &amp; this worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This has been a standard in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s line.  It is good for the price, and it give a firm hold.  I cannot complain.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this gel, no flakes!</li>
    <li> The best to keep your curly style curly.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and good product.</li>
    <li> This product is ok but if you really want to keep your hair spiked you might choose a different brand as this wears off after 4-5 hours!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing it, however was very happy with the purchase! Hair came out just how I wanted it to!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great clean gel to use for control, but doesn&#x27;t make hair stand up on end, unless a lot is used.  Gets sticky in damp, humid weather, but it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel my hubby of 20 years ever use. The one thing he can&#x27;t live without. Really!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best - cheap, strong, doesn&#x27;t leave white residue.  Make sure you get this kind (the MEGA) - the other kind (invisible) is too thin for me.  I always keep several bottles at home so that I never run out. Also cheaper to buy here than at Walgreens</li>
    <li> I love this gel!  You don&#x27;t have to use very much for it to work.  I have very fine hair and this helps me to style my hair!  Lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> basic hair gel, good price</li>
    <li> The only gel that gets my hair the way I want it without my hair getting too sticky.  I used to buy this at Walgreens but they stopped selling it. I am so glad it&#x27;s here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is sometimes hard to find at the drugstore.  It works really well for hair that is...uncooperative.</li>
    <li> I prefer the melting Gel Strong Hold.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and stands straight up , and I wear it very short , so I need something to really hold it down - this stuff does the trick .</li>
    <li> Picked this up as an add on to another order because it is a lot cheaper than at my local store. Make sure you get it when the price is down though; seems to flux up and down.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite hair gel and the price is better than most stores.</li>
    <li> Good price. Gel Works great.  Gel Sets quickly.  No problems with flaking.  Washes off very easily. What else is there?</li>
