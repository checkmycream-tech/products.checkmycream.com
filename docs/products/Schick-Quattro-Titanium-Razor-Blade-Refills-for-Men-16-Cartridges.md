### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Aslo, drying the best you can prolongs the &amp;#34;moisturizing strip?</li>
      <li>Excellent buy.</li>
      <li>Everything arrived perfectly as described and on time.</li>
      <li>very good - thank you.</li>
      <li>Make shaving a joy.</li>
      <li>Great razor replacement and</li>
      <li>great price and free shipping</li>
      <li>For me, the Quattro Titanium blades are better than the Mach 3 but not as good as the Fusion.</li>
      <li>the shave was no where as nice as with the Titanium coated Schick blades.</li>
      <li>These blades were an excellent purchase and a real money saver.</li>
      <li>Great price, quick delivery</li>
      <li>My favorite razor at a better price!</li>
      <li>Shipped very quick too!</li>
      <li>Good buy and original quality</li>
      <li>Great price and very convenient.  </li>
      <li>Better shave &amp; no nicks plus easier to hold.</li>
      <li>And the price was so much better.</li>
      <li>If the shave from a Fusion was that much better I would go with the Fusion.</li>
      <li>Four may even be too many.</li>
      <li>One reviewer has said that the four blades cause more nicks.</li>
      <li>Really got a great deal on the amount of blades.</li>
      <li>I don;t know that you would want to add any more blades scraping across your face though.</li>
      <li>Love the blades.</li>
      <li>They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
      <li>Works great and only brand of razors that do the trick on my beard.  </li>
      <li>When my parents see me clean shaven every time they visit me, or I visit them, they (especially my Mom) will be extremely happy.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this product so I was glad to find it.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re all tiered of paying too much for blades regardless of the fantastic tech advances and performance of the most modern razors.</li>
      <li>They have a very short life and the strips fall off real easy.</li>
      <li>Because I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing most of my life:</li>
      <li>Stocked up with 2 years worth of razors for a fraction of drug store costs - and they came promptly.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It cut me the first time I used it and</li>
      <li>I have used this brand for many years and actually bought enough for many months.  </li>
      <li>these last for a week easily.</li>
      <li>These blades hold their sharpness very well.</li>
      <li>Item as described with fast shipping.....</li>
      <li>These blades look like the real thing.</li>
      <li>I have used for over ten years with full satisfaction.</li>
      <li>I can shave more often, and the blades last longer than the blades I used when I shaved every third day.    </li>
      <li>The original handle and blade lasted a long time.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used these titanium coated blades, you are missing out on a very comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Half the delivery was old style razors that don&#x27;t have the trimming blade on top of the razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and after trying the Gillette, went right back to them.</li>
      <li>But with Schick&#x27;s new Titanium razors, I can shave *</li>
      <li>These feel like an imitation of the original.</li>
      <li>Was not as described and they seemed like they were an old design in a trial pack.</li>
      <li>I am now looking at trying the new Schick hidroblades which should definitely be an improvement.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These blades last much longer that a Gillette counterpart for only $2 per, online.</li>
      <li>Blades are not sharp at all.  </li>
      <li>Dry the razor as thorough as possible when you finish shaving as this proongs the balde life a few more days.</li>
      <li>However, I can barely tell a difference.</li>
      <li>Finally, the blades last for a very long time; much longer than any blade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno for Sensitive Skin for several years now - that switch was a definite plus.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great price and free shipping</li>
    <li> very good - thank you.</li>
    <li> Blades are not sharp at all.  The original handle and blade lasted a long time.  Not sure why this didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Stocked up with 2 years worth of razors for a fraction of drug store costs - and they came promptly.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like Titanium blades</li>
    <li> The product picture is incorrect (I saw their disclaimer after.) These blades do not have the edging blade. And they came in 8 2-packs.</li>
    <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard - it&#x27;s about average. I can get away without shaving for three days and still have the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; scruffy look. On the fourth day, it becomes the \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; scruffy look, and so I shave.    Because I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing most of my life: shaving every third day, sometimes every fourth day. Anything less has always caused razor burn and bumps, regardless of the shaving cream or the razor. (I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno for Sensitive Skin for several years now - that switch was a definite plus. Anytime I use anything different, the shaving suffers.)    But with Schick&#x27;s new Titanium razors, I can shave *every* day and not cause razor burn or bumps. When my parents see me clean shaven every time they visit me, or I visit them, they (especially my Mom) will be extremely happy. Never mind that I&#x27;m 40...you know how parents are.    One reviewer has said that the four blades cause more nicks. I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case. I&#x27;ve yet to nick myself once, although having said that, I&#x27;ll probably nick myself when I shave today. &lt;grin&gt; Knock on wood.    Finally, the blades last for a very long time; much longer than any blade I&#x27;ve ever used. Although they&#x27;re very expensive now, I think they&#x27;re well worth the extra expenditure. I can shave more often, and the blades last longer than the blades I used when I shaved every third day.    This is definitely a win-win.</li>
    <li> Love the blades. Make shaving a joy. Really got a great deal on the amount of blades. Will do this again.</li>
    <li> Half the delivery was old style razors that don&#x27;t have the trimming blade on top of the razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor replacement and I get a week out of EACH balde, a month per box (4 razors per).  Tip:  Dry the razor as thorough as possible when you finish shaving as this proongs the balde life a few more days. Just tap the shaft of the actuall razor on your arm to get the moisture of the baldes.  Aslo, drying the best you can prolongs the &amp;#34;moisturizing strip? and keeps it &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. I have used this brand for many years and actually bought enough for many months.  They usually last almost two weeks per cartridge for me.</li>
    <li> I have used for over ten years with full satisfaction. I am now looking at trying the new Schick hidroblades which should definitely be an improvement.</li>
    <li> Item as described with fast shipping.....</li>
    <li> These blades look like the real thing. I tried the newest Gillette razor with the flex ball. It cut me the first time I used it and the shave was no where as nice as with the Titanium coated Schick blades. If you&#x27;ve never used these titanium coated blades, you are missing out on a very comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve used it for years and after trying the Gillette, went right back to them.</li>
    <li> They are the same quality that you have been getting with these but with quantity pricing. I don;t know that you would want to add any more blades scraping across your face though. Four may even be too many. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Great price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for years.  These feel like an imitation of the original.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived perfectly as described and on time.</li>
    <li> These blades were an excellent purchase and a real money saver.</li>
    <li> Works great and only brand of razors that do the trick on my beard.  Great price and very convenient.  Shipped very quick too!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re all tiered of paying too much for blades regardless of the fantastic tech advances and performance of the most modern razors. I get three shaves out of a Gillette blade, these last for a week easily. I&#x27;ve tried other Schick razors but was not impressed. Just the titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades last much longer that a Gillette counterpart for only $2 per, online. I&#x27;ve used them for years. they have a single blade on the back for small areas such as a pencil mustache.</li>
    <li> I got tired of trying to find these in stock at my local store (they always managed to be out of this particular brand). And the price was so much better. So I stocked up. woohoo</li>
    <li> These blades hold their sharpness very well.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this product so I was glad to find it. Was just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Good buy and original quality</li>
    <li> Was not as described and they seemed like they were an old design in a trial pack. They have a very short life and the strips fall off real easy. Not cool.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor at a better price!</li>
    <li> The easiest way for me to rate the Quattro Titanium is to compare them to their competition - Gillette. For me, the Quattro Titanium blades are better than the Mach 3 but not as good as the Fusion. If the shave from a Fusion was that much better I would go with the Fusion. However, I can barely tell a difference. So for the money you save on blades, I pick the Quattro every time.</li>
    <li> Have switched to rolling razor which is sold on amazon &amp; on line. Search rolling razor.com Better shave &amp; no nicks plus easier to hold. The future of razor&#x27;s.</li>
