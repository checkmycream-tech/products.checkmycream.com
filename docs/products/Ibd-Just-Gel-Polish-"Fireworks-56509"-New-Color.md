      <li>I really love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this IBD gel polish!</li>
      <li>The sparkles are amazing, a ton of depth, they almost seem layered.</li>
      <li>Wears well and removes nicely.</li>
      <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t sure once I received Fireworks if it was a good color selection.</li>
      <li>I get great wear time and smooth easy to apply applications.</li>
      <li>and I love this gel polish.</li>
      <li>Love this over darker colors</li>
      <li>more than three weeks and not get up in the edges&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>WHAT&#x27;S NOT TO LOVE?</li>
      <li>It takes a lovely, yet lackluster polish, and turns it into something more.</li>
      <li>So excited to try this color!</li>
      <li>This is a Must have Beautiful fine Holographic glitter in a clear gel.  </li>
      <li>Arrive before the expected time which is great for me!!!</li>
      <li>I especially love it over pale shades, my favorite pairing being Fireworks over IBD Seashell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a very pretty glitter top coat basically.</li>
      <li>it is glittery, but not TOO glittery as to look cheap.  </li>
      <li>Applies smoothly without excess pooling.</li>
      <li>This color in particular is so popular.</li>
      <li>bcuz its pretty not lil girls chunky over the top glitter.  </li>
      <li>This sparkles are nice and tiny; however, you can feel them through the top</li>
      <li>Super fun!</li>
      <li>Great for layering over other polishes to give them a punch of sparkle.</li>
      <li>I love it, but it does require more than 2 coats if you DO NOT want it truly sheer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy glitter polish, but it is a very fine glitter that adds to the color you&#x27;re wearing without overpowering it.  </li>
      <li>It is just clear and very fine sparkle in it.</li>
      <li>Happily, I was proven wrong because it&#x27;s beautiful and wildly versatile.</li>
      <li>Really gives the nails a fantastic shine.</li>
      <li>I buy all my stuff on Amazon now its way cheaper &amp; worth the wait.</li>
      <li>polish does not look so good with dark colors, but it does with pinks or all by itself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like this polish -</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is exactly the same as Harmony&#x27;s gelish; thus the price is totally worth</li>
      <li>I like them even better than the Gellish ones and these are half the price!</li>
      <li>Spangles are very small and it looks wonderful on every color you want to give a subtle sparkle.</li>
      <li>this color is very special, to be used alone or to brighten other coloresy with only two layers is sufficient</li>
      <li>I was afraid to buy these bc of their great price</li>
      <li>Clear with silver sparkles.</li>
      <li>Clear gel polish that&#x27;s loaded with microfine holographic glitter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really like seasoning for your nails, giving it extra flavor.</li>
      <li>This is not a solid color but more like a subtle tint and sparkles like an iridescent.</li>
      <li>The only thing is, the clear seems to be yellowing.</li>
      <li>I like that IBD offers coordinating regular polishes too.</li>
      <li>It gives a smooth, subtle rainbow sprinkling that you just can&#x27;t help but admire.</li>

    <li> This glitter is the same as Harmony Gelish Vegas Nights. It is very nice multi color glitter. Spangles are very small and it looks wonderful on every color you want to give a subtle sparkle.</li>
    <li> This is a Must have Beautiful fine Holographic glitter in a clear gel.  Just like Vegas nights in Gelish.  Goes awesome over everything.  My Mom who&#x27;s 58 loves it too.  bcuz its pretty not lil girls chunky over the top glitter.  My Fav glitter gel polish! Great price.  Wholesale shops Are double the price too!  I buy all my stuff on Amazon now its way cheaper &amp; worth the wait.</li>
    <li> It is just clear and very fine sparkle in it.Too little sparkle so it is not pretty on your nail.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite ibd color!  It&#x27;s so versatile!  You can wear it over ANY other color for that extra little sparkle.  It&#x27;s not a heavy glitter polish, but it is a very fine glitter that adds to the color you&#x27;re wearing without overpowering it.  Super fun!</li>
    <li> I really like this polish - it is glittery, but not TOO glittery as to look cheap.  Really gives the nails a fantastic shine.</li>
    <li> MORE OF A TOPCOAT OVER OTHER COLORS, BUT TAKES ANY BORING COLOR AND GIVES IT SUBTLE 3D SPARKLE. WHAT&#x27;S NOT TO LOVE?</li>
    <li> The sparkles are amazing, a ton of depth, they almost seem layered. The only thing is, the clear seems to be yellowing.</li>
    <li> Clear gel polish that&#x27;s loaded with microfine holographic glitter. Great for layering over other polishes to give them a punch of sparkle. Applies smoothly without excess pooling. Wears well and removes nicely. I like that IBD offers coordinating regular polishes too.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This works just as well for me as the more expensive gel polishes.  I cannot tell any difference in wear when applied properly.</li>
    <li> this color is very special, to be used alone or to brighten other coloresy with only two layers is sufficient&lt;br /&gt;lasts more than three weeks and not get up in the edges&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to all</li>
    <li> Stays on as well a Gelish brands. I will save money by buying this brand from now on.  Actually soaked off easier.</li>
    <li> This sparkles are nice and tiny; however, you can feel them through the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;This polish does not look so good with dark colors, but it does with pinks or all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly the same as Harmony&#x27;s gelish; thus the price is totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Clear with silver sparkles. I like to call it grown up sparkles. Sparkles are not big. Even distribution. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love this product! Arrive before the expected time which is great for me!!! The only complain is that i&#x27;m interested in other products from the same seller ( other gel polish colors) and for some reason don&#x27;t ship to Puerto Rico, and the polish i just buy did.</li>
    <li> I am actually a licensed nail tech and I love this gel polish. It is inexpensive and works fantastic and has the best colors. This color in particular is so popular. It&#x27;s just a very pretty glitter top coat basically. Clients are always wanting it on their nails. It arrived a day earlier than the estimated delivery date</li>
    <li> I was afraid to buy these bc of their great price but I&#x27;m thrilled that I did! I like them even better than the Gellish ones and these are half the price! You can get all the colors you actually want at these prices. I think I paid around $5.00 a bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this IBD gel polish! The price, the quality, the color choices, all excellent. I get great wear time and smooth easy to apply applications. However, I wasn&#x27;t sure once I received Fireworks if it was a good color selection. Happily, I was proven wrong because it&#x27;s beautiful and wildly versatile.

I especially love it over pale shades, my favorite pairing being Fireworks over IBD Seashell. It gives a smooth, subtle rainbow sprinkling that you just can&#x27;t help but admire.</li>
    <li> This is not a solid color but more like a subtle tint and sparkles like an iridescent. The Bottle is a lot larger than expected.  When I purchased it there was a drop of the color on the page and it is not like that.  But I am very happy with it any what.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using IBD gel polish and I am very impressed with the glitter! I will post again after I have used it to let you know how it wears. So excited to try this color!</li>
    <li> Love this over darker colors</li>
    <li> I love it, but it does require more than 2 coats if you DO NOT want it truly sheer. Otherwise it goes on smooth and shine&#x27;s beautifully.</li>
