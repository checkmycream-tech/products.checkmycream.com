      <li>Right size.</li>
      <li>Love them,perfect size,and perfect price for how many you get.better than the small cups,when you need that little extra ink.</li>

      <li>Perfect Size Cups ~ not too big, not too small.</li>
      <li>Exactly what the artist wanted.  </li>
      <li>I got my ink cups fast,and they are nice and the right thickness and size for almost any tattoo job, I got large and small, but this size are nice for about any job, except small tat&#x27;s where you don&#x27;t want to waste ink,because if you use high end ink and you just need a  little ink you don&#x27;t want to hit the bittom of the cup and screw you neddle up,but they come in handy more than most size cup.</li>
      <li>Just as described good quality arrived fast the size is very useful not to small not to big.</li>
      <li>No broken pieces.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy something of quality .............................</li>
      <li>, I know things happen, but I really need those caps and now I have to order from someone else.</li>
      <li>only problem is they arent smooth on the bottom</li>
      <li>I really like that</li>
      <li>Received it in a reasonable time, no problems at all.</li>
      <li>I am stuck with 500 caps that I really could have used 100 of.</li>
      <li>there is some sort of stains on them.. not clean or suitable for sterile tattooing.</li>
      <li>Lives up to recent reviews was very impressed came in blind of n eye n</li>
      <li>came in a big bag, with multiple smaller bags full inside which makes it nice to keep the bulk in the storage closet and a smaller bag in the work area.</li>
      <li>exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>But other than that it was exactly what i ordered</li>
      <li>Will order again as in in near future.</li>
      <li>Not to small, but not to big where i waste more ink than i used.</li>
