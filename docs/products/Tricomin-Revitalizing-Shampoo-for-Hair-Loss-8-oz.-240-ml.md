      <li>okay</li>
      <li>This revitalizing shampoo is great when I really haven&#x27;t washed my hair</li>
      <li>Have used this product many times.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced it does help me to have a healthy head of hair.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t take much of either to cover your hair.  </li>
      <li>leaves my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
      <li>The new hair is sprouting nicely as well.</li>
      <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry the hair or scalp</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks noticed some new growth, it&#x27;s like longer peach fuzz, but my hair has always been really fine.  </li>
      <li>I see a huge difference in new hair growth.</li>
      <li>Since July, the OLD hair has thickened up so much that the hot rollers don&#x27;t burn the top of my head anymore.  </li>
      <li>first time using this product.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work with more advanced stages of hair loss.</li>
      <li>It costs too much for 8 oz.</li>
      <li>This shampoo cleans very well.</li>
      <li>The shampoo definitely strips you of moisture (and oil) and leaves your hair \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean.</li>
      <li>My hair condition isn&#x27;t severe and I&#x27;m mainly using the product as a preventive measure</li>
      <li>It is so clean that my hair feel dry after I washed my hair each time.</li>
      <li>I have so much new hair in the front of my hairline now.  </li>
      <li>I have been using for past 3years and it has kept my hair healthy.</li>
      <li>A decent product, i think it might help some more than others, but a little bit goes a long way and over all its a decent shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am a 46 year old woman with very thining hair, especially in the front and the two front corners.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a bit too intense for daily use leaving my hair a bit poofy and synthetic feeling.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair look thicker without coating it and weighing it down like so many other products.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any major improvement.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is very good.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look thicker without coating it and weighing it down like so many other products.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the dermatology clinic where I had a hair graft.  I use it and the scalp spray everyday.  Since July, the OLD hair has thickened up so much that the hot rollers don&#x27;t burn the top of my head anymore.  The new hair is sprouting nicely as well.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, but it&#x27;s not the best for my thinning hair. This revitalizing shampoo is great when I really haven&#x27;t washed my hair and it&#x27;s little dirtier/a bit greasier. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a bit too intense for daily use leaving my hair a bit poofy and synthetic feeling. I definitely recommend the Tricomin Conditioning Shampoo instead. I also alternate their conditioning shampoo with Nioxin to keep my hair and scalp stimulated and I&#x27;ve found both products work well together.</li>
    <li> Bought the replace my wife&#x27;s hard to find CU-Gen Korean shampoo. She likes this product much better. Smells better too.</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  I couldn&#x27;t even comb through my hair after shampooing with it.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> A decent product, i think it might help some more than others, but a little bit goes a long way and over all its a decent shampoo.</li>
    <li> first time using this product. leaves my hair soft and smelling good. Not medicinal at all. will continue to use in hopes of aiding hair regrowth</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this stuff and it works for him! I like the smell of this shampoo and the conditioner!</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks noticed some new growth, it&#x27;s like longer peach fuzz, but my hair has always been really fine.  After 50 days, my hair is noticably thicker, shinier, and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair from falling.👀</li>
    <li> Great product, line to aid thinning hair,</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans very well. It is so clean that my hair feel dry after I washed my hair each time. I try this shampoo because Dr. Oz show says to use copper shampoo.I am not sure if I will buyit again. It costs too much for 8 oz.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months.  I am a 46 year old woman with very thining hair, especially in the front and the two front corners.  I have so much new hair in the front of my hairline now.  Some of it is actually coming in dark brown, instead of my usual grey.  When I bought the conditioner with it, it actually speeded up the process.  The conditioner is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t take much of either to cover your hair.  I recommend this to all men and women.  [[ASIN:B0000Y3FS0 Tricomin Revitalizing Shampoo - 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> Has not helped my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> thanks it worked great</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly as advertised</li>
    <li> I have used many shampoo but this one is the best. Perfect for very fine and oily hair, I use it once daily!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner set. The shampoo definitely strips you of moisture (and oil) and leaves your hair \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean. I can see how if the shampoo is used by itself, it can make your hair too dry. However, the conditioner makes up for the dryness and balances out the moisture in the end. In short, I recommend using them together than just the shampoo. I think it is working okay but I haven&#x27;t seen any major improvement. My hair condition isn&#x27;t severe and I&#x27;m mainly using the product as a preventive measure so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work with more advanced stages of hair loss.</li>
    <li> I see a huge difference in new hair growth.</li>
    <li> Product recommended by a Plastic Surgeon whom my daughter works for. I have been using for past 3years and it has kept my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Treats my thinning air wonderfully.  Feels great on my scalp when shampooing.  Love it!  Have used this product many times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced it does help me to have a healthy head of hair.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE PRODUCT HAVEN&#x27;T this is my second round with it and I like it more as I use it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry the hair or scalp</li>
