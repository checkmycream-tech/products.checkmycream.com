<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came sooner then expected, this brush is great because so so big it wraps around your head. I have to buy more!</li>
    <li> Brush worked as described, waves in days. All you got to do us brush for acouple of times and you will see results, remember you got to put in the work.</li>
    <li> I got waves in no time thanks to this brush!!! I really recommend this to anyone trying to get waves!!</li>
    <li> Great brush looking to buy another. Love the way it fits in the palm of my hands. Really great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the larger brush for my husband a year ago and he loves it. He will use no other now. He like it so much he insisted we get his father one for his birthday. His dad loves the brush too.</li>
    <li> I use this brush on a daily basis. This brush or one like it are always either in my home or in my vehicle. If you like to maintain your image, this brush will do the trick.</li>
    <li> The brush is a beast especially if you like ya waves thick and deep. The brush stretches out the curls and lays them down to give u that deep wave look</li>
    <li> My friend came over my house with the brush he told my to try it been hook on it ever since got three of them now my son always taken one of them</li>
    <li> Great item lived up to it&#x27;s billing. It has a contour all it&#x27;s own which makes brushing a pleasure rather than a chore.</li>
    <li> This brush should be in every Black man&#x27;s personal hair grooming kit. This is THE best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I love the feel and curve shape of brush. The high quality bristles are the right texture and firmness. Very well made, smooth, solid wood base. Love the glossy black lacquer finish. I thought the sale price was a bit steep until after I got it. It was money well spent.</li>
    <li> If you have coarse hair and you start going into your 3rd week + to make your waves deeper, this is the brush. Well worth 21. Shiiiiiid im about to buy another one !</li>
    <li> 360 Wave brush helped me to get deeper waves and with the shape brushing is even more fun and convenient</li>
    <li> My waves banging even better now and your can&#x27;t find them in your local beauty supply or hair shop unless you go far</li>
    <li> It was given as a gift and the person really enjoyed the feel of the brush. The only issue was on the first day of use, the Crown logo on the brush began to rub off.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best 360 wave brush ever created. It not only make your waves deeper but it will help you develop new waves in those stubborn areas that you thought were impossible. It might be a little expensive but if you&#x27;re dedicated to getting your waves spinning it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> It came in promptly as posted. However, straight out of the box I was disappointed. The logo on the brush was badly off center, a mustard yellow, and began to smear as soon as I touched it. 10 minutes into brushing, there was no logo. There was also no little carrying bag as the picture depicts. Beware, it sheds when you first start using it, but stops soon after. If this is Crown Quality, I&#x27;m disappointed. On the other hand, it does feel better than the brush I was originally using. Then again I had it for years.</li>
    <li> Nice grip.  Dual bristles (soft and hard).  Durable.  It was a replacment brush for the one i have had for the last three years.  This one may last even longer than that</li>
    <li> Amazing brush, could surely see the difference between this and a Diane or Annie brush. Met all expectations, super comfortable brush so it&#x27;s easy to brush all day if needed .waves seem more deeper defined and uniformed now..I pair this brush with curl enhancing smoothie and a leave in conditioner. Works like a charm</li>
    <li> Great product great price!!!</li>
    <li> excellent will purchase another brush shortly. In just one week of use I saw a dramatic change in my hair and the waves</li>
    <li> THIS BRUSH IS HEAVEN SENT. It feels so good on your head, it completely cups your head and the bristles are just perfect as you can feel them all the way down to your scalp. Great Look, The black and gold goes HELLA HARD. Big and Wide brush, wider than any other brush I have held. Between this brush and the Diane&#x27;s. I would DEF go with this one. IT FEELS so good on your head and in your hand. The brush comes with &amp;#34; SECRET TO GETTING WAVES&amp;#34; certificate and to be honest I feel that alot of what it says is very true. A lot of things in this guide I did not know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STAR BRUSH FOR SURE. WORTH THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Really stretches the hair and its comfortable in your hand.  It is a little hard, so use it when your hair is grown out to help produce your 360 waves.  Very nice product</li>
    <li> Have no complaints, love my brush. Waves up my hair, saw results in two days. Only thing is you have to brush daily two three times day and you&#x27;;ll surely see results. Has a nice bristle texture to it, (not too hard or soft) and is perfect for my hair type. Also has very nice curve, perfect for when you brush your hair. Also arrived on time. Comes with instructions too, if first time training waves.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend freaking loves this brush</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews only if I&#x27;m satisfied and I can give a 5 or if the product outright sucks and I&#x27;m on a mission to tarnish a persons business o haven&#x27;t been down that road yet but I will if I have to...this brush is the TRUTH!!! In the muthaf*ckin booth ...straight up I don&#x27;t feel like I need to say more...grab u one b4all of a sudden God forbids they stop making em</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush whether u got some hair or no hair on your head it gives u results.</li>
    <li> It adds variety to my brush collection, great feel and it covers more head while brushing. If that makes sense. I def recommend it to the wavers in the world!</li>
    <li> Its great i got waves in a few days</li>
    <li> My son loves this brush says it fits his scalp and crown for good brushing.  he is getting nice waves</li>
    <li> They brush is amazing! Works right away &amp; gives me the results I&#x27;ve been trying to get for months. This product is the best out there.</li>
    <li> Hands down the BEST brush I&#x27;ve ever bought.  To me, this brush is worth every penny.  Get it, use it correctly and see the results faster.</li>
    <li> I received my brush in the mail after four days. At a young age I was taught that you get what you pay for and man this was money well spent. The claim of needing to brush less is true. The brush covers the entire side of my head and I have a big head. I already brushed all day long, but now it&#x27;s enjoyable. If you want waves and have coarse hair like me, moisturize and brush with the crown. No product will guarantee waves. If you dont brush you will fail. Moisten the dry, coarse hair you have with natural hair moisturizers and brush. You have to get this brush. Trust me!!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush there is no other brush I know right now that conforms to a persons head like this brush does. It allows the brush to stay on a person head from top to side side to side. I use a medium brush because I get my hair cut low as 1 or one and a half .That means my barber uses a 1 or one and a half guard on my head. This so far is the best brush for wave for me. I&#x27;m not just saying that it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m a regular customer like many people out there I&#x27;m not getting paid to say what I&#x27;m saying either. If you want a brush with some curve appeal that brings out your waves than this is the brush for you. This brush comes in many different colors also hard,medium,soft bristles. I have bought two and in the process of buying me a soft bristle since I have two medium. I hope this review was helpfull to anyone who is thinking of getting this brush.</li>
    <li> Bought the brush and its a must have for anyone who is a wavier or just want to get its a total different feel than any other buy that i have since the purchase i haven&#x27;t even touch my diane</li>
    <li> This brush is made for the wave head. The shape and design are great. I brought one for myself and son.</li>
    <li> This brush has worked wonders for my waves that were slowly coming in. I will definately be buying the soft and hard to take my waves to that next level.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about this brush, I have read all the reviews on amazon and listed to them on youtube. Nothing but excellent things about the product, So I had to try it out for myself, It finally came in the mail. Once I touched the brush I knew it was different. I ran the brush through my head 2 times and I was sold. My other brushes do not compare, I like the brush alot. I quickly realized that I cant have just one. So I ordered another medium for work use. You gotta get these brushes because any other brush just aint ballin. My only gripe is that amazon only offers standard shipping options, but other then that the brush is aweaome.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s grooved sides and bigger size feel lovely in your hand.  So your hands don&#x27;t cramp or stiffen up on you after prolong use.  It even came with a guide on how to use brush your hair to get that 360 wave pattern.  So it&#x27;s great for people who are new to wave brushing.  I&#x27;d wanted to give it a 4 star because the only down fall was trying to figure out if was a hard, medium or soft brush (It&#x27;s a stiff medium or medium/hard).  But like I&#x27;d said at the beginning I really do love this brush.  I going to order another one as soon as they get more hard bristle brushes in stock.</li>
    <li> The only brush you will ever need to buy for 360 waves my waves came in only after a few weeks of brushing</li>
    <li> Tried contacting cqp for almost a week now no response ....&lt;br /&gt;I guess this is what happens when you buy from a black owned business&lt;br /&gt;ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!! The size of it is great. It&#x27;s large and brushes more of my hair in one stroke then my original brush. The curve does absolutely help the bristles have more contact with you head. Definitely a more effective brush.</li>
    <li> Good product the bristles were a little hard at first but soften with use.  It is also easy to handle for my 7 year old.</li>
    <li> This brush has a great feel to it &amp; the curve that it has makes it stand out from the others. Once you get used to this brush, you will not go back to any other brush w/o a curve. it just feels right!!!  I honestly plan on ordering a soft &amp; hard brush as well!!</li>
    <li> Great brush love using it. the only thing that sucks is I didn&#x27;t get a bag with my 2 brushes</li>
    <li> I thought the price was steep for a brush but I bought for my husband anyways based on the awesome reviews. I would definitely purchase more items from this line based on the performance of this brush! I saw little waves forming in my sons hair after 10 minutes of brushing!! The brush we got does shed more than I anticipated and the gold crown on the back of the brush rubbed off in mere days but I can look past those things b/c the brush still produces great results! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> These brush really brought out my waves.  The bristles are hard, but after you break them in, they feel more comfortable over time, it just takes a while.  I used to have an Annie brush, but this is soo much better.  I know the price is a little high for a hair brush, but trust me it&#x27;s worth it.  Just visit their website and look at all of the reviews.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever owned. I have brushes that cost much more than this one that I use far less. Whether you are looking to perfect your wave game or just brush your hair- get this one. I got 3 of them all in different bristle configurations. Large wood handle, contoured bristle shape and it comes with a bag to keep it clean. I couldn&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush. It lays down my course hair and makes it soft. It has made my right side, which is my weak side,  wave up. It is comfortable and nice. Only has two cons in my opinion...It was kinda hard in my opinion and I didn&#x27;t really like how long it took to get to me.. Otherwise it is the best 20 dollars i have ever spent. Planning on getting a softy and a premium soon.</li>
    <li> Crappy packaging, for the amount I paid I should have received the brush bag for free .</li>
    <li> Got the product on time, but no bag. Out of stock. Email, to see if I still could get a bag. Nothing. Now, my brush as crack. No  answer. Sad.</li>
    <li> Product is on point and does exactly what it says. I purchased the med and hard and will be back for the soft and premium.</li>
    <li> This brush really did surprise me upon opening it. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as angled as it was. Feels lil it was shaped to my head its self. Great brush great idea.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! I&#x27;ve had my brush about a month and my hair just looks insane!! I literally can brush my hair anyway with this brush and waves just keep coming!! I barely use many strokes to accomplish my tight, defining, wave patterns!!!</li>
