      <li>:) The bottle works great and is s decent size too!</li>
      <li>I used to love scented soaps from Bath and Body Works until now.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an even better price.</li>
      <li>On top of that, at home, the Dial Antibacterial Foam soap was adding insult to injury...</li>
      <li>Have already recommended to many friends.</li>
      <li>I cleanse with this and around my eyes, touching my cheekbones and around the jaw, just use a minute amount of coconut oil to moisturize.  </li>
      <li>Will buy more.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this soap on many occasions.  </li>

      <li>The item may be fine for most people, but the listing on the site is inaccurate.  </li>
      <li>Great hand soap, I am chemically sensitive</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive hands.</li>

      <li>Rinses easily.</li>

      <li>overall, pretty darn perfect.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done this several times and am always happy with the results.</li>
      <li>We had to switch to scent free hand soap in our office because a lady in the office is allergic to scented soaps.  </li>
      <li>It is truly gentle and effective, and the Amazon price difference is offset by the gas I save from running across town.</li>
      <li>Easy to get hands clean and all residual soap washed off as well.</li>
      <li>The soap itself is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>And it rinses more cleanly and quickly than any soap I have ever</li>

      <li>I really like this soap, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and feels really good on my skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather, but it leaves my hands clean and there is no odor at all to the soap.</li>
      <li>Finally a true unscented soap.</li>
      <li>Still a good value, and very possibly the one liquid soap I&#x27;ll use for the rest of my life!</li>
      <li>Great texture and feels like any other liquid soap.</li>
      <li>His hands cleared up quickly.  </li>
      <li>so I love that it is truly fragrance free, and the glycerine keeps hands soft.</li>
      <li>I have been able to sleep better and feel better knowing that I can hold my little one without worrying that he may also be allergic to scents.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and enjoy a gentle, non drying soap, without all the scents, just clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This soap feels good, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands, has no scent and cleans your hands.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied and I highly recommended it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Great go to everyday hand soap.</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>I buy the unscented and mix in my own essential oils.</li>
      <li>Leaves hands clean, soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I normally buy this soap locally, but the one store that carries it is often out, so I was delighted to find it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>We have very sensitive skin and need fragrance free product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to purchase lotions, which I like very much.</li>
      <li>The soap is very gentle.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t suds up very much, but it works well.</li>
      <li>However, it does leave my skin pretty dry...which is a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>It is gentle yet powerful.</li>
      <li>I really like this hand soap!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances and ingredients.  The product description calls this \\&quot;100% natural glycerin formula\\&quot; and unscented.  It has a very strong scent.  It also has twice as many ingredients as listed in the product description including aloe.  This may be a welcome addition to some but for me it makes the two bottles unusable.  Other reviews indicate formula has changed so if you are looking for Unscented as advertised, this product is not for you.  I&#x27;ve purchased the Clearly Natural bar soap and they featured unscented and aloe versions.  This one doesn&#x27;t even smell like the aloe bar.  It is stronger and more flowery.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, it is very gentle and gives a clean feeling. I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and enjoy a gentle, non drying soap, without all the scents, just clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because there is NO odor at all, it makes me feel clean, a little goes a long way, and it does not dry my skin.  I do use some aloe vera gel afterwards (which I purchase in gallon jugs for around $20 and keep in the frig), and never have the winter itchies.  I don&#x27;t have to purchase lotions, which I like very much.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;m super sensitive to smells so I tried this unscented soap and it works very well.  Keep one in each bathroom.  Unscented hand soap is very hard to find so when I found this, I was delighted.</li>
    <li> Great go to everyday hand soap. nothing nasty of me or the universe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too thick; I had to water it down just to make it usable.</li>
    <li> We only received 1 bottle out of 2 (but received a refund for 1 from Amazon).  The soap itself is fantastic.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.  May take a chance on ordering another 2 and hopefully will receive 2.  The 3 stars is for not receiving 2 bottles as stated.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product. The soap is unscented, which I like. Also, a little bit goes a long way. However, it does leave my skin pretty dry...which is a deal breaker. I purchased the 2 pack - I wish I had only bought one to try.</li>
    <li> The information provided didn&#x27;t state it was hand soap that&#x27;s the only disappointment.  I was hoping for body wash. I will go look for what I really wanted.</li>
    <li> Finally a true unscented soap. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> This is good soap, no perfume, in fact just about no smell at all. It does cloud after a while, but that does not impact the cleaning ability or clog the pump.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for years, then one day a new batch came and it smelled awful. Like a mix of cheap perfume and rotting flowers (no, that&#x27;s not overdoing it, the smell really is that bad). Clearly, they&#x27;ve changed their supplier or their formula, but it doesn&#x27;t matter what happened, this soap should be avoided. I had two separate batches that both smelled bad, so it was not a one-off manufacturing error.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily face soap. It cleans very well, but I do need moisturizer afterwards because my face feels tight. I am thrilled to have found a glycerin soap that is derived from vegetables, not petroleum. I have been using a Neutrogena product for 20 years because I couldn&#x27;t find a substitute. Some of the reviews mentioned strange smells and little lather. My batch has no smell and lathers very well.</li>
    <li> It made my hand feel slick, almost water repellant.  I bought 2 bottles but will probably use it in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Great hand soap, I am chemically sensitive so I love that it is truly fragrance free, and the glycerine keeps hands soft.</li>
    <li> Great texture and feels like any other liquid soap. Very gentle on my skin which is important as I am allergic to anything with scent or other additives. Most of these soaps are very costly and don&#x27;t last long. This was an excellent price and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this soap on many occasions.  The last shipment, as others have commented, had a strong scent which was new.  Previous shipments had no scent that I noticed.  Contacted the manufacturer and got this response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;We made a temporary change to the natural preservative we were using, unfortunately,  it was not until later that we realized it had a fragrance of its own,  although we did not add any fragrance,  it became a soap that had a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are no longer using Phenyl ethyl Alcohol and Ethylhexylglycerin as the preservative,  and the issue has been resolved.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offered to replace what I have at no charge.  I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a great response.</li>
    <li> It is utterly laughable that this company calls this unscented. Not only is it scented- no, not only does it smell sickly and disgusting- it lingers worse than cheap public bathroom hand soap. There is no exaggeration in what I say. I washed my hands hours ago with it and I have since washed my hands no less than six times with dish soap as well as different hand soap, and I can still smell this soap even when my hands are nowhere near my face. Unscented? UNSCENTED?! WHAT?! How can they call this unscented? Maybe it&#x27;s technically \\&quot;perfume free\\&quot; or something, but- wow I&#x27;m getting way too worked up over this soap. It sucks. Don&#x27;t buy it. Unless you want ultra scented soap that is....</li>
    <li> Despite what other people have claimed... I HAD to use this soap because my skin was irritated, chapped, swollen... my hands looked like war zone survivors... I am someone who fervently washes his hands for at least 20 seconds when needed (after using the bathroom, after cooking, before cooking, after and before eating, etc). At work and at school, the foam anti-bacterial soap rendered my hands ... terribly dry... On top of that, at home, the Dial Antibacterial Foam soap was adding insult to injury... Desperate.. I turned to Whole Foods as I read online that antibacterial soaps can be very drying... I found this one... un-everything soap. I started washing my hands solely with this soap... I did not change my hand washing frequency neither used lotion.. I wanted to see how much my hands could improve by simply changing soaps... they did! In a matter of days my hands were back to being soft, supple, healthy! I will continue to use this soap . I am happy I was able to find it on Amazon and now have subscribed to its regular delivery. :)  Pros: (1) Lathers really well. (2) No scent. (3) Very hypoallergenic. (4) No dry hands. (5) One push of the pump is well enough to wash your hands. (6) Doesn&#x27;t stain porcelain or counters.  (7) Cleans very easily.   Update: I have used this soap continuously for over 3 years now and I have not had any hand rashes or reactions at all. I am very satisfied and I highly recommended it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> great product! i have on subscribe and save along with the hand cream.  it&#x27;s in all the baths and kitchen.  no more scratchy hands!</li>
    <li> This is good soap.  Not filled with scent or dyes.  Leaves hands clean, soft and smooth.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect for home liquid soap making</li>
    <li> This is a great no-perfume soap. Rinses easily. Plan to keep this soap in stock.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of trouble finding liquid glycerin soap.  I really prefer the liquid to the bars.  I like how this has no scent.</li>
    <li> very moisturing, but takes a long time to rinse, and it has an odd odor. Also the way it shoots horizontally out of the bottle is annoying it often goes right over my hand instead of down into it. I much prefer the liquid soap from Vanicream, though that product is much more expensive.</li>
    <li> however came leaking.bought 2; 1 top was loose and the pump was up on the other.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing it was wrapped in plastic.</li>
    <li> Unscented apparently now means no attempt to mask or dispel a floral odor that wreaks havoc with my respiratory system.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is not the best place to buy this kind of product. The window of return was too short, and I didn&#x27;t discover they changed the product or had a bad batch in time, so I&#x27;m out the cost of two bottles. From now on I&#x27;ll stick to buying local where I can check the product.</li>
    <li> This must be the most eco-unfriendly soap for its water-sucking abilities! It takes for-EVER for me to wash off. I thought the Trader Joe&#x27;s liquid soap was tough to wash off, but this stuff is ridiculous. I tried diluting it with 25% water, then 50%+ water, and it still was frustrating to wash off. Discarding 1-1/2 bottles of the stuff because it&#x27;s just not worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> The soap is very gentle. I buy the unscented and mix in my own essential oils. I&#x27;ve done this several times and am always happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have to wash my hands a lot since I have extreme mold sensitivity. This is one of the only natural brands of soap that doesn&#x27;t strip my hands too much of moisture. You only need a little so it lasts a long time. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product! And the price was too good to pass up. Have already recommended to many friends.</li>
    <li> product is scentless and washes off nicely, no soap residue.  my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out like conventional soaps.  the pump keeps things tidy.  a really good product.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. It is gentle yet powerful. It degreases well with out over drying. I actually use it on my face occasionally.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of contact allergies and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I also use the refill one from time to time. It&#x27;s gentle and cheap enough to keep up with family life.</li>
    <li> This soap rinses cleanly and does not dry out the skin. It doesn&#x27;t suds up very much, but it works well. I actually use it as a shower gel, and it&#x27;s fantastic for that purpose as well; one bottle lasts a long time even when used that way.</li>
    <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR AN UNSENTED GLYCERINE SOAP SIMILAR TO TJ&#x27;S; TJ&#x27;S WAS VERY GOOD CLEANING OILY OR GREASY HANDS OR DISHES. &amp;#34;CLEARLY NATURAL&amp;#34; IS VERY GOOD AND NO FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> I hate scented soaps and don&#x27;t want soap with tricosan--this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Product is good but was not packaged properly.&lt;br /&gt;They leaked in the box. Bottle was not broke but pump on top was not in locked position.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Unscented, mild, doesn&#x27;t dry out the hands...overall, pretty darn perfect.  It&#x27;s hard to find a truly fragrance-free handsoap that doesn&#x27;t make the hands dry out, crack or strip the moisture...this seems to be the best I&#x27;ve found thus far.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and feels really good on my skin. I hate fragrance in products so this soap is great for people like me :) The bottle works great and is s decent size too!</li>
    <li> This inexpensive liquid soap is everything I was looking for. It cleanses my hands and body effectively. Not only is no scent added, it lacks even the scent I have always associated with glycerin soaps; it has no aroma whatsoever. And it rinses more cleanly and quickly than any soap I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding other buyers&#x27; comments: I don&#x27;t find that it dries my skin more than any other liquid soap; a little hand or body lotion may be needed in the winter. I too received a package with the pumps unlocked; the little leakage was contained in a plastic bag and quickly rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more note: This product is less concentrated than most liquid soaps. You may find that you use a bit more of it than other products. You might want to consider the 12-ounce bottles equivalent to 8-9 ounces of other products. Still a good value, and very possibly the one liquid soap I&#x27;ll use for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This soap feels good, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands, has no scent and cleans your hands.  Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Really recommend this product.  I was getting chapped red dry hands using anti-bacterial soap.  This stuff really cleans and really protects your hands.  No more red dry chapped hands thanks to Clearly Natural Glycerine  hand soap.  I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly a year now.</li>
    <li> I used to use Clearly Natural Unscented liquid glycerin soap in the large refill bottle till they  added Aloe, to which I&#x27;m sensitive.  ALOE WAS NOT LISTED IN THE INGREDIENTS LIST HERE, so I ordered it.  However, when I got it and opened the twin pack and read the label, I saw that it DOES, indeed, CONTAIN ALOE.  The item may be fine for most people, but the listing on the site is inaccurate.  Obviously, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I&#x27;d known.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. We have very sensitive skin and need fragrance free product. This soap is gentle and cleans well.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this natural soap a try.  I love the fact that it is natural and not full of nasty ingredients, that it is unscented and that it is economical.  It is  very thick which is awesome, so a little goes a long way.  Very happy with this purchase and plan on continuing purchasing this through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product that contains a lot of natural ingredients with the benefit of \\&quot;no added fragrances.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that last part is the only problem I have with this product. It is not \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; it just does not have any added fragrances. As soon as the soap hits my hand, I can smell a strong (good smelling) scent to it that stays with me for 5-10 minutes. It is a good \\&quot;scent,\\&quot; but I did not want to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products before and know that there is usually some kind of scent to them all, but I have to literally stick my nose to the substance just to smell it. On the other hand, with this product, I can smell its scent even if my hands are down to my knees. I have a sensitive noes/sinuses, so even though it smells good it does slightly bother me.</li>
    <li> We got this because we are sensitive to fragrances and unscented soap is very hard to find at the store. This soap smells very strongly like cheap rose perfume. The odor also sticks to you, no matter how well you rinse your hands.</li>
    <li> I really like this hand soap!</li>
    <li> Very good soap, except contains aloe, which was not listed on the product description and its ingredients. I&#x27;m allergic to aloe so I read descriptions closely. Gave it to my daughter whose husband uses it. So not a total loss.</li>
    <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t make a great lather, but it does get your hands clean without a lot of harsh chemicals and terrible smells. I also used this soap to clean out pump parts when I was breastfeeding, because I didn&#x27;t want to get chemical smells in there!</li>
    <li> Works really well and leaves my hands soft and not dried out.</li>
    <li> It has no odor to it at all, but it sticks to your skin so have to wash it off longer in the sink.  Fits my needs though for fragrance-free product.</li>
    <li> Have you ever gotten a product that promised to be unscented .... but wasn&#x27;t? I hate that. This is great soap, not drying and ---- unscented! Excellent product.</li>
    <li> We had to switch to scent free hand soap in our office because a lady in the office is allergic to scented soaps.  Everyone seems to be very pleased with this soap.</li>
    <li> This is the one I bought for myself and my grandson who also has skin allergies.  After his last outbreak I purchased this for him.  His hands cleared up quickly.  He knows how destructive other products are for his skin and he is 6 years old</li>
    <li> No scent and works very well. Easy to get hands clean and all residual soap washed off as well. The scented version is terrible but like this glycerine soap very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to have a soap that does not contain extra added chemicals that are going to increase cancer risk and are add no real value. Hospital testing has found that it is how long one washes there hands under the tap that determines how effectively any bacteria or viruses are removed and that all the anti-bacterial soaps are no more effective than regular soap.</li>
    <li> I normally buy this soap locally, but the one store that carries it is often out, so I was delighted to find it through Amazon. It is truly gentle and effective, and the Amazon price difference is offset by the gas I save from running across town.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap for a while and it&#x27;s been great, but now but it&#x27;s changed. As soon as I opened the box I could smell some fragrance. The formula has changed when comparing it to my older bottle this has 2 new ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce. So I&#x27;m very sensitive to anything scented, and won&#x27;t be buying this again. If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> This refill is the same as the one with the pumps. Do not buy this product. It states unscented. It smells like Musty smelly feet! THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and it&#x27;s an even better price. Great for sensitive hands.</li>
    <li> The soap has a very strong glycerin/chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to smells, try something else.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap because I have migraines and can&#x27;t deal with the scented hand soaps. I am very happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t lather, but it leaves my hands clean and there is no odor at all to the soap.</li>
    <li> Does not lather up at all.  Not worth the price I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for a long time, but the quality has steadily gone downhill. The pumps have changed, and are now on the third version. This time, both the pump and the bottle changed. With the new bottle, the sealing surface at the top of the opening was cut off too short. The threaded collar tightens, but the pump is spinning loosely in the bottle. I tried the old pump on the new bottle, and it is still loose. IT IS THE BOTTLE. Guess what happens when the pump is loose? The soap gets on everything. I ordered 6 bottles, and they came in two different boxes by two different carriers. All were a sticky mess inside the plastic wrap. Didn&#x27;t anyone notice that THE PUMPS ARE LOOSE? It is really difficult to extend the pump because the base rotates while trying to unscrew the thread on the top piece. Just pull really hard and twist, and soap flies everywhere when it finally pops up. So much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy the large refill bottles, but the caps were always broken and leaking because the packers refused to cushion the ends of the bottles inside box. The bottle of soap weighs the same as a large hammer, and has the same striking force when the end of the box lands on the floor. I wrote that up twice before switching back to the pump bottles. Now I have to find a different soap that I like, all because of crappy quality at the manufacturer and the poor packing job. Learn physics, people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned everything up, and it would be too hard to return the leaky bottles, so I&#x27;ll keep these, but I&#x27;ve had it. I gave is two stars because I really do like the soap. Too bad you can&#x27;t figure out how to package it.</li>
    <li> I had really bad morning sickness for the first 4 months of my pregnancy and woke up many times during the night to use the restroom.  I used to love scented soaps from Bath and Body Works until now.  The smells of anything too strong would send me back to the restroom.  I knew if I wanted to get some rest, I would need unscented hand soap.  I read reviews for this and was hesitant to buy it but I&#x27;m really glad I did.  It cleans well and does not dry out my hands during the winter months.  I have been able to sleep better and feel better knowing that I can hold my little one without worrying that he may also be allergic to scents.  Great buy for a great price.  I just wish there was a better price/value for the refills for this.</li>
    <li> Since I reserve claiming love for people instead of things I will say that I highly recommend this excellent product. It soaps up well and if you have trouble with stinky shampoos, soaps and the like this is an excellent choice. Good value.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to fragrances.  This soap is excellent.</li>
    <li> I will keep purchasing this. I only would like to know why I can&#x27;t find cruelty free glycerin Body soap. I avoid Palm oil. I just want Glycerin.</li>
    <li> I had read about this in a search on the internet about basic, simple facial cleansing and mositurizing.  I honestly thought I&#x27;ll try this and I&#x27;ll get this tight, dry skin feeling.  Now, Origins will hate me but I&#x27;m a long time user of their products, cleanser, etc.  And make no mistake, their products are very good.  But economic times cause one to look for alternatives that are equally superior.  Look no further.  I was AMAZED at how soft my skin feels, smooth and soft, not at all dry.  It rinses clean, no residue left behind.  I am floored by the results.  I cleanse with this and around my eyes, touching my cheekbones and around the jaw, just use a minute amount of coconut oil to moisturize.  It&#x27;s incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cleanser highly.</li>
