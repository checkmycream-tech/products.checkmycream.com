      <li>this was awesome while it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>but, when I read the warnings about it burning my face, I thought this&#x27;ll be great...</li>

      <li>It was just luke warm.  </li>
      <li>When you get out, the shaving cream is nicely heated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having said that, this product does warm the gel as it leaves the can.  </li>
      <li>The product came packaged nicely as I received it as a Christmas gift...</li>
      <li>Heats up the gel to just warm.</li>
      <li>It was wrapped nicely for Christmas</li>
      <li>I was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>Try at your own risk.</li>
      <li>Warm foam....</li>
      <li>this is the trick for ~$10  if its more than $10  get a bucket of warm water and soak your can first  Happy shaving!</li>
      <li>This is a great product for a clean shave.</li>
      <li>and I think he loved it more than most things that he received...</li>
      <li>but it is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Yes, he does wish it was a bit warmer, but understands why and got a good laugh over all the warnings.  </li>
      <li>It seems that they were more concerned about the energy rating as well...</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d love to know about it.</li>
      <li>na have to spend a lot more then 20 dollars</li>
      <li>and it was much better.</li>
      <li>I purchased this heater because I have never been able to get a truly close shave.  </li>
      <li>Certainly better than the can.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a better quality product to get that barber-shop feel.</li>
      <li>The adjustments were he had to put it on correctly :)</li>
      <li>but otherwise for the money i think its a pretty damn good product</li>
      <li>for 20 bucks it works pretty good ,but if your expecting a \\&quot;spa-like\\&quot; heat your gon</li>
      <li>The best it can do is warm it up a little.</li>
      <li>Awesome just like Barber shop (detailed and specific.</li>
      <li>shower with warm to hot water then shave, it seems to works a lot better than this product.</li>
      <li>Easy for travel.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I tried every setting and the gel would not get hot or even warm.  </li>
      <li>Everything was fine.</li>
      <li>and they seem to enjoy it.</li>
      <li>and i only use it for myself and it is perfect for that but definitely for commercial use.it can make the cream/gel the perfect temp.for you.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t want to pay for this device, the cheapest way to warm you shaving gel it to let the can float in a sink full of boiling hot water while you shower.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product in order to get a close comfortable shave every time any time.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to give him something I knew he was looking for.  </li>
      <li>This Hot Gel Dispenser by Conair at $19.99 may give \\&quot;A Better Shave\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Not expensive, better than nothing.</li>
      <li>I live in an apartment that has luke warm water and had to boil some water to make my shaving jel useable.</li>
      <li>but it was because i was using it full time at the barbershop as a temporary solution to my lather machine breaking on me.</li>
      <li>Works quickly and heavenly</li>
      <li>I received it quickly....</li>
      <li>I realized this product was cheap and did not do the one thing it was created for: get the shaving gel hot.  </li>
      <li>HOT!</li>
      <li>whatever you use to a temperature thats comfortable and warm enough to soften hairs on your face and to give you a pretty relaxing shave ,im a barber and use this on my clients</li>
      <li>Definitly worth the price.</li>
      <li>kept falling over, wasnt really hot enough, I say just invest in the latherking brand for a good hot shave.</li>
      <li>Only gets luke warm and just the initial &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; is warm</li>
      <li>I do wish it came out hotter,BUT IT IS STILL WORTH</li>
      <li>It works, but just makes the gel not cold.  </li>
      <li>For $10 it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>The price is certainly right, if not a bargain.</li>
      <li>It does not get hot enough to even warm the gel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m firmly convinced that I bought him the best present of the year!  </li>
      <li>I turn the unit on prior to getting into the shower and the lather is more than warm enough to meet my needs by the time I get ready to shave.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for real heat fill up your sink with hot water and just use soap!  </li>
      <li>Does Not Get Hot.  </li>
      <li>hot, almost too hot to handle.</li>
      <li>No, it&#x27;s not blazing hot, maybe 90 degrees.  </li>
      <li>This really wasnt worth it.</li>
      <li>Even though the description says \\&quot;hot\\&quot;, you have to expect that in today&#x27;s litigious society, there is NO way that the gel coming out of this heater is going to be hot.  </li>
      <li>Yes it is not steaming hot</li>
      <li>Its a  lot better than the last one he had.  </li>
      <li>The gel never gets hot.</li>
      <li>This should have been a better hot lather machine then the last Conair I had</li>
      <li>and I anticipated my first holiday shave with the bliss of a hot gel/lather from its foamy exit port.  </li>
      <li>I have owned two of these Hot Gel Dispensers.</li>
      <li>The first one lasted me 8 years.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for anything like barber hot, this is not close.</li>
      <li>The Conair Hot Gel Cap doesn&#x27;t work to well.</li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviews stating that this machine puts out barely warm gel on its hotest setting.  </li>
      <li>(I have preheated for long periods of time, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t shut off until 20-30 minutes)    </li>
      <li>However, if you turn the unit on and wait for the blinking light to stop, which is a relatively short time, then the lather will not be at its optium warmth.  </li>
      <li>THE MONEY.$ 10.00 does not buy much of anything these days.</li>
      <li>so now we have the dumbed-down version (as everything is in modern America).</li>
      <li>I understand why the manufacturer does not make the unit depense too hot as we live in a law-suit craze society.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my dad, and after a few minor adjustments, it works great.</li>
      <li>I am better off keeping the saving gel in hot water for a few minutes and warming it that way.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a steaming hot one, unless the company is looking to get lawsuits left and right.</li>
      <li>There is an adjustment on this dispenser, but \\&quot;wide open\\&quot; is only warm.</li>
      <li>This is a sub-standard product that is more novel than practical and is definitely not even remotely salon/barber-shop friendly to a daily user at home.</li>
      <li>(really it&#x27;s a con depending on how classy you care your bathroom to be)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not HOT, but I&#x27;d say comfortably upper-warm/toasty.</li>
      <li>Evidently he uses it daily and loves it...</li>
      <li>Apparently this was a liability problem (as everything is in modern America)</li>
      <li>Your perception on the product ultimately depends on your expectations, and of what you consider hot.</li>
      <li>Temperature has gone from piping hot (close to hot water temps) to slightly warmer than body temperature.</li>
      <li>This machine heats up gel shave lather but does not heat as well as the one that fits completely over the can.  </li>
      <li>It worked marginally for only a few weeks, warming the most of the dispensed gel.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband says it doesn&#x27;t heat well enough and is too slow at heating to desired temp.  He chose it online for his birthday but has only used it twice because it isn&#x27;t as efficient as one he remembers having years ago...????brand.</li>
    <li> Bough this after a cheaper model failed.  Not much better.  Only gets luke warm and just the initial &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; is warm</li>
    <li> If your looking for a steaming cream this isnt your product ,but it heats the cream or gel or whatever you use to a temperature thats comfortable and warm enough to soften hairs on your face and to give you a pretty relaxing shave ,im a barber and use this on my clients and they seem to enjoy it. for 20 bucks it works pretty good ,but if your expecting a \\&quot;spa-like\\&quot; heat your gonna have to spend a lot more then 20 dollars but otherwise for the money i think its a pretty damn good product</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband to replace a diffrent model he had but after 7 years stopped warming.  This model only slightly warms and he doesnt like it very much</li>
    <li> I live in an apartment that has luke warm water and had to boil some water to make my shaving jel useable. the Conair does heat the jel so that I don&#x27;t have to put in boiling water to shave, so for me it&#x27;s fine.but I do wish it came out hotter,BUT IT IS STILL WORTH THE MONEY.$ 10.00 does not buy much of anything these days.</li>
    <li> The product came packaged nicely as I received it as a Christmas gift... one that I had asked for for ten years. It was wrapped nicely for Christmas and I anticipated my first holiday shave with the bliss of a hot gel/lather from its foamy exit port.  It plugged in and even attached to the can with out incident but, when I read the warnings about it burning my face, I thought this&#x27;ll be great... just like at the barber shop. HOT! Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed by this product. It seems that they were more concerned about the energy rating as well... the thing just turns off after a few minutes. It wasn&#x27;t hot at the beginning after I plugged it in or if I waited a few minutes. It was just luke warm.  I thought enough of the negative experience to write this review and let others know that this doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. This is a sub-standard product that is more novel than practical and is definitely not even remotely salon/barber-shop friendly to a daily user at home. Don&#x27;t buy this item. I&#x27;m still looking for a better quality product to get that barber-shop feel.</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving my head.  By the time you dry off from the shower and get ready to shave your head and face, your hair and skin has cooled off and gets harder to shave.  This product has help a lot with that.  It takes less than a minute to heat up.  The only thing you&#x27;d want to watch out for is there is normally some pressure built up.  If you don&#x27;t hold a hand in front of it a glob of gel will shoot across your bathroom.</li>
    <li> This Hot Gel Dispenser by Conair at $19.99 may give \\&quot;A Better Shave\\&quot; as advertised, IF one could actually get it on the can! We&#x27;ve had several dispensers before, but this one is impossible. I&#x27;m not wasting my money to even send it back, it&#x27;s going in the trash.  Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it as shaving gel gets so cold in the bathroom cabinet!  Works quickly and heavenly warm gel softens the shaving experience on cold mornings!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I decided to take a chance and get it. I always hate shaving with cool shaving cream and living in Chicago during the winter, that is always a challenge. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Yes it is not steaming hot but it is very comfortable. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a steaming hot one, unless the company is looking to get lawsuits left and right. For $10 it&#x27;s worth the price. I even bought some for a few of my guy friends for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Your perception on the product ultimately depends on your expectations, and of what you consider hot. As one reviewer noted, it&#x27;s really not as as bad as the negative reviews suggest.     It&#x27;s not HOT, but I&#x27;d say comfortably upper-warm/toasty. I hated cold gel in the winters, and now every time I use this I get that \\&quot;barbershop/spa feeling\\&quot;     Someone noted that it turns off automatically. (I have preheated for long periods of time, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t shut off until 20-30 minutes)    Overall I say it completely fulfilled my expectations, the only big con I can think of is that it&#x27;s not really attractive on a counter-top. (really it&#x27;s a con depending on how classy you care your bathroom to be) The price is certainly right, if not a bargain.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad, and after a few minor adjustments, it works great. The adjustments were he had to put it on correctly :) Nothing to do with the actual product though. Gel Dispenser Works GREAT!</li>
    <li> This machine heats up gel shave lather but does not heat as well as the one that fits completely over the can.  For the price difference this is a good machine.</li>
    <li> For those of you who remember the Hot Lather Machines and Caps they had in the late 70&#x27;s (as I do), this will be a tremendous disappointment. The old ones actually got the lather (no gel back then) hot, almost too hot to handle. Apparently this was a liability problem (as everything is in modern America) so now we have the dumbed-down version (as everything is in modern America). Temperature has gone from piping hot (close to hot water temps) to slightly warmer than body temperature. There is an adjustment on this dispenser, but \\&quot;wide open\\&quot; is only warm. Turn the dial and it goes down to useless. If there is any way to \\&quot;hotwire\\&quot; this thing to 70&#x27;s level, I&#x27;d love to know about it. Until then, I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t recommend it unless you regularly shave in a cold bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these Hot Gel Dispensers. The first one lasted me 8 years. This is a great product for a clean shave. Ladies this makes a great gift. Definitly worth the price.</li>
    <li> if you dont like cold shaving creme  this is the trick for ~$10  if its more than $10  get a bucket of warm water and soak your can first  Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> Pros: Great idea. Easy to use. Easy for travel.Inexpensive.  Cons: Does Not Get Hot.  Got tired of putting cold lather on my face in the morning (especially in the winter). Thought this would solve that problem.  Instructions warn of steam escaping from the unit.  Instructions say it heats up in minutes.  It gets to it&#x27;s maximum temp in 12 seconds.  It heats up to just above room temp.  I thought I bought a bad unit, so I had it exchanged.  Same result with new unit.If you are looking for a Hot lather shave, then I suggest you pay for a more expensive product.</li>
    <li> My step-father loves this product! I&#x27;m firmly convinced that I bought him the best present of the year!  It was shipped to my home in the time frame I was given upon purchase and it works splendidly!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son-in-law for Christmas and I think he loved it more than most things that he received...I was thrilled.  Evidently he uses it daily and loves it...yay!!!!!!  I received it quickly....it was boxed very nicely, and I&#x27;d do this all over again...LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was fine. It is a shaving thing. It is what it is. No problems with anything. I would not hesitate to order again from this company.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews stating that this machine puts out barely warm gel on its hotest setting.  It replaced a Conair cream/gel dispenser that had develped a leak.  The temp of the gel with this machine doesn&#x27;t even approach that which it replaced.  Not only that, but the \\&quot;oriface\\&quot; is very narrow requiring me to stand with my finger camped on the button for several mintues to get enough gel to be useful.  Overall a relatively poor design.</li>
    <li> Even though the description says \\&quot;hot\\&quot;, you have to expect that in today&#x27;s litigious society, there is NO way that the gel coming out of this heater is going to be hot.  The sheer number of warnings that come with this product attest to that. Anyone expecting otherwise is going to be disappointed.  Don&#x27;t blame the product or manufacturer - blame the sue happy idiots for which these warnings and modifications had to be put in place for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this product does warm the gel as it leaves the can.  No, it&#x27;s not blazing hot, maybe 90 degrees.  Even so, my husband loves this increase in warmth. Yes, he does wish it was a bit warmer, but understands why and got a good laugh over all the warnings.  The long cord is a bit of pain in the rear.  A cord about half the size would have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid does make the saving cream can a bit top heavy, but this comes with an ingenious base that the can snaps into to take care of this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to pay for this device, the cheapest way to warm you shaving gel it to let the can float in a sink full of boiling hot water while you shower.  When you get out, the shaving cream is nicely heated.</li>
    <li> kept falling over, wasnt really hot enough, I say just invest in the latherking brand for a good hot shave. This really wasnt worth it.</li>
    <li> Warm foam.... that&#x27;s about it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just shower with warm to hot water then shave, it seems to works a lot better than this product.</li>
    <li> Terrible performer.  It worked marginally for only a few weeks, warming the most of the dispensed gel.  It barely warms now on highest heat setting.</li>
    <li> The Conair Hot Gel Cap doesn&#x27;t work to well. The gel never gets hot. The best it can do is warm it up a little.</li>
    <li> This shave gel heater was given as a gift this past Christmas.  The receiver had mentioned a similar product used in past, then lost.  I was excited to give him something I knew he was looking for.  The only negative comment on his part was that he would like it to have a base to set the can in, to help stabilize it.</li>
    <li> This is my second unit and I have been using this unit for years.  I understand why the manufacturer does not make the unit depense too hot as we live in a law-suit craze society.  However, if you turn the unit on and wait for the blinking light to stop, which is a relatively short time, then the lather will not be at its optium warmth.  I turn the unit on prior to getting into the shower and the lather is more than warm enough to meet my needs by the time I get ready to shave.  In any case, it beats using cold lather.</li>
    <li> Does not heat up well at all  Should be called a \\&quot;cold gel\\&quot; dispenser  If you are looking for real heat fill up your sink with hot water and just use soap!  Pretty lame.</li>
    <li> A cool little item. Heats up the gel to just warm. Certainly better than the can. But if you&#x27;re looking for anything like barber hot, this is not close. So, just a heads up. Not expensive, better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this heater because I have never been able to get a truly close shave.  I usually get skin irritation regardless of the type of shaver I use or the type of gel I use.  So during a beer conversation with a few of my friends, the topic of heating the shaving gel in order to get a closer and smoother shave was talked about and this particular product was mentioned and dissected.  I was excited to try this product in order to get a close comfortable shave every time any time.  But alas, that was not the case.  From the get go I realized this product was cheap and did not do the one thing it was created for: get the shaving gel hot.  I tried every setting and the gel would not get hot or even warm.  This was a waste of time and money.  I am better off keeping the saving gel in hot water for a few minutes and warming it that way.  I do not think I will buy another gel warmer, and if I do, I  will buy in store so that way I can return it when it doesn&#x27;t work.  Try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> This should have been a better hot lather machine then the last Conair I had but this one sucks.  It does not get hot enough to even warm the gel.  Would not recommend this one at all.</li>
    <li> this was awesome while it lasted.unfortunately it broke on me but it was because i was using it full time at the barbershop as a temporary solution to my lather machine breaking on me. i have another stored away at home and i only use it for myself and it is perfect for that but definitely for commercial use.it can make the cream/gel the perfect temp.for you.</li>
    <li> loved it  while it lasted</li>
    <li> Awesome just like Barber shop (detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?  Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words)did not want to write  words</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  Its a  lot better than the last one he had.  Which was another brand.  You bet he will be a return purchaser.</li>
    <li> It works, but just makes the gel not cold.  I had one of these for foam and it was much better.</li>
