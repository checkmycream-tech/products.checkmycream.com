    <li> Wonderful product, super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I first used this product on a cruise and loved it. The fragrance is beautiful, clean, and fresh. The lotion is not too thin or too thick and rubs in well. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is my standard lotion.  I&#x27;ve been hooked for years.  I typically buy the large bottle but it was not available.  I bought the package of smaller bottles.  As it turns out, this is much better for travel.  I can just pack one away and it is much easier that transferring smaller amounts to a travel bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.  Always get compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> this scent has long been a favorite  in our family, and finding these made us really happy.  the scent is getting hard to find, so  these sets of 6 for an amazingly low  price are a  wonderful  surprise!  the scent is  light, clean  and clear -- an all day, all night kind  of flavor.</li>
    <li> I love the odor.  It&#x27;s fresh and light.  Often I&#x27;m asked what smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;Wish there were a way to buy it in a larger container and pay less.</li>
    <li> This was not the actual product that we usually use.  This order was fraudulent and we will be requesting a full refund.  The bottles were the same but we have no idea what was in them.</li>
    <li> Just like the original. Clean smell. loved it.</li>
    <li> My indispensable hand cream.</li>
    <li> I use this lovely lotion every day. It&#x27;s light scent is so much better than most perfumes that are too heavy and sometimes overpowering. The scent smells clean and fresh and leaves a hint when you walk by. I bought some for a friend after she complimented me on the light fragrance. Spread the word!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.  Clean scent</li>
    <li> almost bought the large bottle for the same price, but i think you technically get less and i like having my &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; in my purse.</li>
    <li> Received order in a timely fashion. Product was as advertised. Price was right.Love this scent.</li>
    <li> I, too, bought this after using it at a hotel...that was in Venice. It is non-greasy , thick and lovely. Slight fragrance that is entirely pleasant. Feels so good!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion after swiping one of the bottles from  our hotel in Spain. Though I&#x27;m a man, I live in a dry climate and use lotion on my hands and face two- to three times a day. Finding a good lotion has been a consumer&#x27;s nightmare, as most are too greasy; they leave a sticky residue; or they smell like apples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is not greasy at all. I can put it on and drive without my hands sliding around the steering wheel. It also does&#x27;t burn my eyes like some lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall for me is that this lotion is a bit high on the perfume smell. Since I really like the lotion, I&#x27;ll try to live with this.  Otherwise, this a great product. It is a bit pricey, but you&#x27;re paying for a quality product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It is a light fragrant citrus smell.  It is not a thick creamy lotion.  I really love this lotion and would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion mainly for the scent, which I love. I&#x27;m sure there are better lotions out there in terms of effectiveness. The reason I subtracted one star is because of the packaging. The screw top is not the most secure if you are going to put this in your purse -- it&#x27;s not really possible to screw it on very tight.</li>
    <li> I ordered it because I&#x27;ve been using it for several years. The fact that it came in 6 individual small bottles, rather than one bottle, makes it easy to take when traveling.</li>
