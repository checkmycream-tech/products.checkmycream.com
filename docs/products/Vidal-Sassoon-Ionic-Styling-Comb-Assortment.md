<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice little cheap set and the brushes are pretty sturdy so it won&#x27;t bend easily which is good if you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for my hair</li>
    <li> Perfect high quality comb set, not the cheap hard plastic that breaks off in your hair, these combs are flexible and strong. Great to use when highlighting hair with foils, the metal tipped comb hold the foils tightly, and is also great for weaving in color or braiding.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent comb set to keep in your supplies</li>
    <li> I only needed a particular piece of the set but it probably cost the same amount if I got it separately so why not get the whole set! I ended up giving the other 2 away to friends. The comb feels quite durable and has yet to break on me, least other combs come with a million bucks what else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> High quality combs.  I especially like the white comb.</li>
    <li> Good quality, durable, in love with the wide toothed white comb! Well worth it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s freakin comb it does it&#x27;s job then it&#x27;ll get 5 stars</li>
    <li> I bought these as an add on.  They are great.  Combs my hair great and teasing it is so easy.  Yes buy this.</li>
    <li> Well, really, what can I say about a package of plastic combs? They arrived quickly, in great shape, and are a nice low price. They are exactly as described. Combs. This wasn&#x27;t very helpful was it? OK, since using these combs, my locks have become nice and manageable and all long and flowy and pretty. Seriously. Combs.</li>
    <li> I use the rat tail comb everyday to section my hair and that is what I was looking for. The other two combs are not of much use to me as of now...gave them to my frnd and she liked them.</li>
    <li> Pretty satisfied with the combs overall, but found the teeth on the detangler to be a bit narrow. If you&#x27;re buying this set with the sole purpose of obtaining a good detangler, look elsewhere because for my medium-thick, curly hair, this detangler is no good.</li>
    <li> I recomend this to everyone</li>
    <li> These combs work really well...they really part hair well and that helps especially when trying to part ponytails on children&#x27;s hair...great product for the price...</li>
    <li> My husband is a licensed stylist, retired, so i get free hair cuts at home. But After having my scalp scraped up from the cheap combs from wal Mart, I knew we needed better combs. These are high quality and the teeth are smooth and rounded. Great item.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> I love these combs.  not flimsy like most.  didn&#x27;t break like most.  Use them daily</li>
    <li> This is a great comb set.  I bought it mainly for the black pick/comb but ended up using all of the frequently.  I would repurchase as needed.</li>
    <li> This two-pc. set killer makes me fix my hair easily and with style. I could have given this 5-stars if there&#x27;s a mirror included in the set.</li>
    <li> Buenos peines,lo unico que lamento es que no eran mas serrados los dientes del mas fino,pues eso era lo que andaba buscando,algo que agarramas mas mis cabellos pues queria usarlos para cuando me pasara la plancha para el cabello.No estoy diciendo que es un mal producto son muy buenos.Solo que no era lo que andaba buscando.  Para un sepillado dormal exselentes.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for! The set comes with the 3 combs pictured, in its original packaging. Great product/quality/price!</li>
    <li> not much to say here other than i thought this was kinda cheap... not really worth the money i put in it.  however still useful as a comb, hence the 3 stars</li>
    <li> Great set at great price!</li>
    <li> Copying from the Description:  \\&quot;Includes tail comb, detangling/styling comb and volumizing comb pick\\&quot;.      I received THREE COMBS:  The two pictured AND a dual-purpose White Comb.     The White Comb is a sort of Detangler comb, it&#x27;s a total seven (7) inches in length.  There are twelve(12) large teeth and then twenty-eight (28) tightly spaced narrowed &#x27;&#x27;teeth&#x27;&#x27;.  Very sturdy and yet gentle on the hair.  I kinda got the impression this particular comb would be great for longer-length hair.    Each comb defintely gives a definite, different enhancement to my hair.  Never experienced that before now...    The Black (pictured) Detangler/Pick Comb is eight (8) inches long, fourteen &#x27;&#x27;teeth&#x27;&#x27; on the top-end with twelve (12) inter-spersed &#x27;&#x27;jagged&#x27;&#x27; mini-teeth.  Definitely could be used as a teaser comb.  The pick has five (5) two-inch long teeth, in my opinion the pick portion could be used on anyone&#x27;s hair for lifting while spraying, esp. for bangs.    The Black &#x27;&#x27;pick\\&quot; comb is about 7-3/4 inches long with the metal pick about 3-inches in length, the upper portion actually has around fifty-six (56!!!) give-or-take a few very tightly-spaced teeth.  I noticed the teeth durablility on this one wasn&#x27;t quite as sturdy as the other two, but maybe because it&#x27;s designed for specific teasing results is my best guess.  I&#x27;ve used all three and like them all.    Surprised at the value/quality and detail.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> gud the tail comb serves the purpose though its not edgy</li>
    <li> I do not like to run a brush through my hair because I feel like they cause a lot of breakage.  I had a comb for forever that just recently broke (even more than it already was), so I decided to find a suitable replacement.  The white comb is amazing for getting the knots out while not pulling the curl out of my hair.  The black comb on the right is great for a bit of teasing to add some body when my hair seems kinda heavy.  I haven&#x27;t used &amp; doubt I will need the black comb on the left...well, it might be good for putting my hair in a pony tail, which I rarely do.  I like to leave the house with salon quality hair.</li>
    <li> Good price good quality!</li>
    <li> These are very good quality combs.  Very pleased with my purchase and would buy again.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> NICE ASSORTMENT FOR HAIRDRESSER GRANDDAUGHTER&#x27;S STOCKING.  MUCH BETTER THAN HAIRDRESSER WATER BOTTLES.</li>
    <li> I should says products because you get the three combs. The combs are very stong and I think they style any type of hair. I used the rat tail comb to start my daughters locks. So YES, it&#x27;s strong. LOL. The price is a plus too. :-)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo310V2YRKOBAP9]]Very nice product- Quick review to show what you get in your package.</li>
    <li> These suited all my needs for parting and detangling. I don&#x27;t tease my hair but the comb for that is great for parting as well. These combs are all very nice and not cheap feeling like some that scratch your head. Glad I found these! Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Customer satisfactio is at it&#x27;s best when the purchase is exact!</li>
    <li> Great combs, I needed something to help me reach a certain amount to get free shipping. Add on item. I use the rat tail comb the most. It&#x27;s great for parting and scratching the scalp!</li>
    <li> good quality for good price.</li>
    <li> Nice, sturdy, well made combs.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Love that it&#x27;s an assortment and get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> just ot for a stocking stuffer for Christmas,  Just a comb set so what more can you really say,  Its a nice set</li>
    <li> Two perfect sized combs for hair styling.  Tailed comb is good for heating iron and the large toothed comb is good for using when just out of the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a really good value for these three combs together.  Seriously, the teasing comb (the one with the long metal tail) is worth $6+ at Sally&#x27;s.  Decent quality, thick plastic.  I think I&#x27;ll get a lot of good use out of them.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is ridiculously thick and trying to detangle it after the bath is a nightmare. These seem to make it a little less dreadful than the typical cheap combs you pick up at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Very nice set, I was surprised.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Perfect for adding volume to your hair. Good quality. No complaints! Great price from amazon! :)</li>
    <li> They work pretty good for any type of hair.</li>
    <li> Love these combs, got rid of my brushes since the combs were much better and did not pull my hair out!</li>
    <li> These combs are great and very useful. They do the job and are inexpensive. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I really like these this pack of combs.  They are very useful.  I purchased a second set for my mom.</li>
    <li> Love these combs. I use the detangling comb (white one) every day - I have very long fine hair. Works like a charm and the price is great.</li>
    <li> They are Sturdy and of nice quality. Hasn&#x27;t broken or bent at all. Great for styling my thick hair. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Everything you need for styling ...</li>
    <li> These combs are great.  They do not build up any static electricity at all.  The combs are a good selection for their uses.  I bought four sets and gave three away (they loved them too) and kept one set for myself.  You would not think that combs are a big deal, but these are better than the generic combs I have bought in the past. They are good at detangling without harming your hair, as well as styling. They are a good size to fit in your purse, or throw in that handy utility compartment in your car.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality combs. :)</li>
    <li> For anyone with long thick hair, these are all the combs one will ever need.  They are thick and strong and do all they are supposed to do.  I also like that on the package, it tells what each combs purpose is and how to use it.  For the price, one can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Combs were purchased as gifts but they seem to be just the right kind especially the comb with the pick attached.</li>
    <li> Great styling combs!  Can use for all different ways of preparing your hair.</li>
    <li> The tip is perfect for separating your hair, and you know..they&#x27;re combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good, cheap product that works very well.</li>
    <li> Good variety of combs.  I the smallest one for teasing my hair and the pick is nice to add a bit of fluff.  Great with wet hair and dry hair.  Affordable too!</li>
    <li> Bought two sets, one for me and one for my daughter. Good combs for the price. Great add-on item.</li>
    <li> before going dread i could not use this stuff but my moms loves it with her now relaxed hair. non the less its a great set if u you know how to use it. but you tube can help too.</li>
    <li> Just as described! You can&#x27;t really see it in the picture, but there are THREE combs. My husband uses the two black combs and I use the third white one.</li>
    <li> Not much to say except they are solid, sturdy plastic and does the job! I would recommend this product. Yep.</li>
    <li> Great set with options of styling your hair. Material is durable as well</li>
    <li> I use the combs and love the price and quality. They both have their purpose the rat tail for teasing and lift, the larger toothed for combing out wet hair and tangles, with the pick for lifting and smoothing. Really good prices for great combs.</li>
    <li> Used them for someone else&#x27;s hair.  Worked fine</li>
    <li> but, now that I look closely I see it lol like a ghost!&lt;br /&gt;anyway I bought this for the rat tail so I can straighten my hair seamlessly. I didn&#x27;t straighten my hair just yet but when I do I will update my review&lt;br /&gt;anyway 5 stars because the combs are useful.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like that they are not seamless which is&#x27;nt safe for anyone&#x27;s hair. but still, doable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the rat tail comb; it is good quality and I like the metal tail.  The other combs are nice to have; they would be helpful for long, thick hair.  A good value for a set of three different combs.</li>
    <li> I will be using this product when bleaching my hair! Perfect for itching!! It is a great price! Super Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> Product delivered as advertised so I am satisfied.  I have thick, fine hair and usually have hard time teasing my hair.  The small toothed comb is awesome and I was able to easily manage my hair (w/help of hairspray).  Price is reasonable too.  Overall, good buy.</li>
    <li> The combs are fine, but shipping took SO LONG. I purchased them for a certain event and everything I needed came in but them. I made do but wasn&#x27;t pleased about it.</li>
    <li> Needed combs for my hair, and these fit the bill. They&#x27;re basic but why would you need anything more to  simply untangle your hair?</li>
    <li> This combs are perfect. They are excellent to use and really great for hairstyling. Amazon is really fast in delivering this item to me. I recommend this item, you will love it too.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of combs.</li>
    <li> Great quality, easy to use with applying WEN product with white comb.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quick and on time&lt;br /&gt;No damages, packed great for shipment.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love these I got them a few days ago. The first time I saw them I loved that they were such a great quality especially for their price.</li>
    <li> Smaller and more flimsy than expected. But u do get three combs as stated</li>
    <li> Low price combs at high quality.  Just because there is a female on the cover, and the majority of the reviews come from women, does not mean men can&#x27;t use it hahaha.  Pompadours and slick backs are my choice of style.  I mostly use the small comb with the rat tail to achieve said styles.</li>
    <li> These combs were packed well and arrived in a timely manner.  The potential for good quality is there, but one of the combs was severely deformed.  The other two are sturdy and meet expectations, but the third looks as though it did not receive the proper amount of plastic in the mold in which it was created.  Not worth sending back.  Poor quality control.</li>
    <li> they are functional and not feel cheap at all. I didn&#x27;t use it for styling my hair but I think it will work well!</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected.  This is a great comb set.</li>
    <li> These were worth the price!  I&#x27;ve used all three and so far, so good.  I thought these combs would be flimsy, but they work great on my long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> Good set of combs. Nothing spectacular about them, but decent quality.</li>
    <li> These combs are wonderful! I was able to get the volume I wanted, without frizz. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the third set of these I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s not that they aren&#x27;t durable: After I bought a set for myself, my eldest daughter took them over! I bought another set for myself... and sure enough my younger daughter stole them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third times the charm, right? Let&#x27;s just hope my son doesn&#x27;t find them!</li>
    <li> I bought these to comb out my beard, it gets the job done! no complaints here, they seem like a steal</li>
    <li> Nice combs . . good value.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Cheaply made, and to small.</li>
    <li> Good set of combs for the price</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decently made, and a good price.</li>
    <li> I got this set of combos mainly for the white one. This is my second time getting them, the first one I got it from a local beauty store. The comb with the metal part is great too.</li>
    <li> Love these combs! They do everything you want and good quality. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the best comb set that I&#x27;ve ever purchased and it was only $3! It also got shipped super fast with Amazon Prime! I believe this styling comb set would be great for any hair type. It has a lot of different functions that not everyone will use, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different and this set took everyone into consideration when modeling this product. For example, my hair is super curly and combs usually break in my hair, because it gets tangled up pretty bad and I often wake up with knots in my hair. These combs have been used in styling my hair nearly everyday since I purchased them and are all still in tact and work exactly the same as they did the day I received them, which was a bit over a year and a half ago. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that I misplaced the smaller black styling comb. This one was awesome for parting hair! I miss it, but misplacing it was obviously completely my fault. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and even purchase it again myself. I would thinking about buying them again anyway to get the one I misplaced back. I think I could just give the other two away to a friend or family member and she would be very happy with them and I&#x27;d be happy with mine.</li>
    <li> Purchase was as expected no complaints</li>
    <li> Poor quality, flimsy materials. Snapped very quickly. Metal prong on teasing comb is too sharp and rough on scalp. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that these would be durable and nice- they are flimsy &amp; crappy.  I would not waste money people.</li>
    <li> This three styling combs are just what I need. I&#x27;m not good at styling my hair, but these are just easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have always been somewhat to very satisfied with my purchases here. This time when ordering this item the deal was to get a rat tail comb so I could take my braids out. The order came fast, but the POINT of the rat tail comb was missing. This particular comb had been broken; the metal part was broken at the tip leaving a jagged short spike,  and shipped that way, meaning the point was not in the package and the package was sealed. Maybe a little quality control is warranted here. It was too much of a bother to send the order back, so I just went to my local Duane Reade and bought a new set of combs. But the general idea of internet shopping for me, is to avoid the crowds in stores. Purpose defeated this time around. Funny tho, each time I look at the rat tail comb I laugh. Instead of detangling, this baby would rip your hair right out!!</li>
    <li> Have no use for the comb with metal pick.  But the other comb helps me reduce static in my hair.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice set of comes at a good price. The teasing comb works well. These arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Very handy combs.  I even use the parting spike to clean out the hairbrush.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t solve my hair problem</li>
    <li> Love these teasing combs!!  Especially the big one, it&#x27;s great for quickly teasing a lot of hair (like if you&#x27;re doing a bouffant vs. poofing your bangs a little) I would definitely recommend! Great price too!</li>
    <li> my girlfriend said we needed a comb so i said ill order something from trusty amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im glad i did. got a nice assortment that we can both use for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont know what to really say other than they are not cheap, they&#x27;re durable, yet cheap. the assortment is good for a household or someone who does lots of different styling</li>
    <li> Great value. The things you need/ nothing you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These combs are a little more lightweight than I imagined they would be.  I figure they will probably not last a real long time; however, they do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> the value of this purchase is awesome. each comb is independently great - lightweight, sturdy, effective. but the combo pack makes me feel like i really hit a small jackpot since I really only needed the one metal pick comb.</li>
    <li> Awesome combs for the price</li>
    <li> For the price this is a nice set of combs that covers all your needs.</li>
    <li> For the price, I thought what the heck? It&#x27;s worth a try! And I&#x27;m glad I did. I absolutely love these combs for detangling my natural hair! They are tough and have yet to break on me! I will order another set of these !</li>
    <li> Very durable , and don&#x27;t burn when put near heat, like a flat iron !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the fine tooth black serrated comb! Before I bought this comb I never realized that fine as oppose to broad/ thick tooth combs were too aggressive on my natural textured 4 b/4c type hair. Thank you Vidal Sassoon!!!</li>
    <li> These are good value for money combs. I dont think you&#x27;ll find anything better in this price range. The assortment is helpful and good to have.</li>
    <li> Rattail Comb is good for piecing hair. The larger comb is great for combing out wet thick hair without breaking the hair.</li>
    <li> These are a great quality and my go-to brushes every time I do my hair! If you&#x27;re having any doubts, don&#x27;t! They come in a nice packaging and even have instructions on the best way to use them and on what kind of hair types/textures.</li>
    <li> Great comb assortment.  Just what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> These combs do what they are supposed to do, no problem. They seem a tiny bit scratchy on the scalp though.</li>
    <li> I bought the combs to help when I am styling my hair (updos and whatnot). Combs are what you would expect for the price. Love them and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this comb set mostly for the white comb in the picture, but since the price was right I went for the set. Good quality and works well.</li>
    <li> For the price it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Enough said!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter is learning how to manage her thick, curly hair and these combs have been great tools for her! I really like them, too, especially when I&#x27;m french braiding her hair.  Great quality, too!</li>
    <li> Great product for not too much money. Came within 2 weeks and it works great! couldnt be happier and Im going to buy another one!</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly for the hair separator tool and once I got it realized that it was very sharp to have around with small children.  There is nothing wrong with this set, I just should have thought about it before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Great combs! I use the rat tail one everyday in my daughters hair. It&#x27;s great for parting the hair as well as smoothing it up into a pony tail.</li>
    <li> I really like the combs. Wish they were available in the stores still. But will keep getting them from your site.</li>
    <li> Should you buy this: Nah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It combs hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It statically charges hair and causes frizzing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a cheap comb to avoid burning my fingers when I straighten my hair, and these fit the bill. However, I can&#x27;t use them to actually comb my hair because the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; effect causes my hair to become statically charged and frizz, which is kind of the opposite of what I want to happen when I comb my hair. They work well for my purposes (something between my fingers and my straightener), but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone looking to actually comb their hair buy these.</li>
    <li> I only NEEDED the comb with the metal handle but when this three pack is the same price or cheaper then buying the comb alone. A great buy, they seem to be very sturdy and it never hurts to have an extra comb or two laying around.</li>
    <li> After a life-time of wishing for long hair, I have finally been able to grow my hair long. The problem was the combs/brushes I had been using until now either were poorly made or intended for medium to coarse hair structure - they were breaking and tearing out my treasured locks every time I styled. As a youngster (about 50 years ago), I remember how everyone who was anyone had Vidal Sassoon hair care products (which were priced out of my reach back then) and decided to see if Vidal Sassoon products were available on-line. To my great surprise, they are! The comb assortment I bought does everything I was looking for admirably! Maybe I&#x27;ll never be a twenty-something again, but I sure will finally have the glorious mane of long and silky hair I always wanted.</li>
    <li> Worked as described... helped me comb my wet hair without damaging to detangle. Also helped with separating hair to blow dry.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. One of the bristles on the smallest brush has already broken though. So be careful if you purchase these</li>
    <li> These are all good combs.  Three in the pack and they are all nice and sturdy combs at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great set for combing little girls tangled hair without hurting her. I also use the metal ended comb to rat my hair. Great set. A great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Not taking off stars because work as expected. Not really sure what else to say... used the sharp-pointed one to part hair when installing hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Great basics, great quality for the price.  Shipment was fast and products fit their descriptions.  I use the teasing comb to cut hair and it&#x27;s nice to hold.  I&#x27;m please with them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, then she shaved her head. Not sure if it was because of this product.</li>
    <li> This is good for people that like to stye their hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good selection of product. There are enough choices here that I hardly ever use my brush anymore.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE COMBS--THERE NOT CHEAP PLASTIC LIKE SOME OF THEM SOLD AT THE STORE--AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FOR HAIR.</li>
    <li> Real nice, worth the price, good quality and works perfectly. Durable , so I carry it with me anywhere I go.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great, brand new, do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, shipped promptly. Nothing that changed my life, but maybe they&#x27;ll change yours?</li>
    <li> Amazon Prime shipped this instantly!  It came in perfect condition.  I bought this item for the rat tail comb, and got the other 2 items as bonuses.  Everything works lovely and are very durable.  If you style hair, these items are a must.</li>
    <li> This a cute little set for my hair, its perfect for sectioning and combing while straightening or curling your hair. I&#x27;ve found these three useful and will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Who would think it would take you three different combs to do your hair- well it does- these combs are great!</li>
    <li> They are just as described</li>
    <li> A useful set of combs at a good price. I don&#x27;t tease my hair so I only use two of the three. I like the white one with the large teeth to start working the tangles out and then I switch to the other end with the smaller teeth. The fine black comb with the metal end is great for finishing touches. The metal bar slips under the hair to lift it on top after I have pulled my hair back. I have noticed that these combs do not leave any static in my hair which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> I love these combs! Each one of them is fantastic, and the assortment is better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had fun using these different brushes. I use the white one to untangle my hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush with the stick because it makes parting hair easy.</li>
    <li> The white comb in this set is the reason we buy it.  Works on curly hair when wet.  Good for detangling.</li>
    <li> I use these to groom my dogs. I use the fine comb on my Yorkie (which she hates); My boxer loves to be scratched with the comb/pic. He says it&#x27;s better than fingernails!!</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed, decent price</li>
    <li> NICE BRUSH! LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I love Vidal Sassoon products and although he is now gone, the quality he demanded in his products carries on by whomever has taken over the line.  These combs serve specific purposes by their design and are extremely tough and well made.</li>
    <li> These combs have far exceeded our expectations. My daughter&#x27;s hair is so fine and so hard to braid with her curls. The black brush with the pointy end has literally saved my life.</li>
    <li> What I really loved about this set of combs is how it is meant for both adult and children&#x27;s hair. Different combs are obviously going to have different functions, but they seriously do well for my hair (very thick and long) and my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair (not nearly as thick yet and medium length). I especially liked the small tooth comb with the long end sticking out for styling. Parting a little girl&#x27;s hair is difficult- unless you are using this comb. Now, if only I could get my little one to stop taking them (she likes to do her doll&#x27;s hair)!</li>
    <li> This pack of combs have everything I need to style and detangle my hair. I have natural 4c hair and the detangling comb is a godsend foe getting the knots of my kinky hair. I love that each comb is actually two combs, it really save som espace in my drawer and when I have to throw it in my purse. All of them serve their own purpose and are very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these combs and will check your site for more hair accessories.  I will also tell my friends to check your site.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sad world indeed when you need more than one comb to fix your hair.  But it is, in fact, true and since you need them you might as well get these.  They will do the job nicely.</li>
    <li> Great design. Various lengths and spacing of comb teeth that allow different looks. Good value for the price. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted some combs, so I purchased this pack thinking there would be one for every situation.  He used the white one, but I confiscated them soon after.  I love the white one, with the thick to thin bristles.  It&#x27;s great for tangles.  The two black combs, I cannot live without.  My mom had a comb with a metal pick while growing up, she still has it, and I always wanted an identical one.  Both are great for parting and styling hair.</li>
    <li> I love this set of combs.  This is the second time I have ordered the exact same set of combs.  My first set is still fully functional, I just wanted another set to take with me when I go on trips.  They are so useful and very durable.  I would buy these combs again and again.</li>
    <li> Great price for all three! Love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the old comb I&#x27;ve had for years and I am very happy with this choice. They are good quality and you cant beat the price for the set. I love the pointed end so help with parts and braiding, and the voluming comb works amazingly on my hair! Very happy I bought this set and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comb set.</li>
    <li> These are a very nice set of combs for the price.  Use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I love all of these! They shipped quickly and they were exactly what I needed! After I got them I saw the same package in Walgreens and it cost way more, glad I bought them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> No complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for 3 standard hair combs.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helped me cut my hair better than what I was using before!&lt;br /&gt;These would break if you are rough with them but standard use will leave them in good shape!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price; I really only wanted the rat tail comb, but it was cheaper to buy all three than just the one. I&#x27;m glad I did though, because the pick comb has come in handy! Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These combs are great!! Such a good deal (:</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair and I need a variety of combs depending on how I&#x27;m styling my hair on a given day. I love that this includes everything I could possibly need for detangling, teasing, and styling at a great price. They also seem durable, a big plus for me because my hair is fine and gets massive tangles and I have snapped many a comb in my day.</li>
    <li> these are great, they are combs, they do what they are supposed to do, but they are well made, good quality, and a great price! glad I got these!</li>
    <li> Enjoying my combs. I have long hair and I&#x27;m usually doing something to it, braiding or curling and sometimes I need an extra comb.</li>
    <li> Although I can not find this set because my daughter took off with it and I have NO idea where it is in her room i love this set, very good pack to have.</li>
    <li> Nice quality and nice assortment in one pkg. I like them for styling my hair.</li>
    <li> This a good little set of combs that come at a great price. I don&#x27;t know anywhere else that you would get them cheaper.</li>
    <li> good quality. love the metal end to help separate hair!</li>
    <li> I keep one in my purse, one in the shower and one with my make up box.  It&#x27;s a great variety of combs for every use you could need and a great price.</li>
    <li> This set of 3 is so great, but I mean so great that I ordered a second set.&lt;br /&gt;Out here in Cali, just the rat tail colm is over $3 and I got all 3 for $2 it was definitely a steal. That&#x27;s why I just hat to order a second set because 1. The price,&lt;br /&gt;2. They are so well made.&lt;br /&gt;3. Just in case I misplace it.&lt;br /&gt;4. My brother loved the white one, he decided to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I detangle my fine straight hair with the white one.&lt;br /&gt;I style with the rat tail one.&lt;br /&gt;If I ever need to give it volume I tease with the black/ wide one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me this is such a great set. I would definitely buy again, and again!!!!</li>

    <li> I HAD NO IDEA THAT COMBS COULD BE SO VERSATILE.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but they are indeed antistatic combs.My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz that much (still a little bit, but way better than ordinary plastic combs) after I comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;considering the price, they are not bad combs. I like them.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb set for at home styling.  Has everything you need for most updo and regular styling.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)  I really like to use these combs when I get out of the shower.  They are made very well</li>
    <li> These combs are great for the price!  They provide a wide variety of styling options. Overall, I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I love these combs!  The white one is my best friend.  I have long straight baby fine hair that is always tangled and really tangled after washing.  This white combs goes right through and doesn&#x27;t hurt pull out or damage my hair!  The other combs work wonders too.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a dad who has to do his daughter&#x27;s hair everyday. Very strong combs and the different teeth sizes allow you to have the right comb for the job all the time.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the money! Using it everyday to detangle and style little one&#x27;s long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I needed some styling tools I love doing different things with my hair so these are a necessity. It comes with 3 combs. One for styling/teasing, one is for brushing out tangles, and the other for parting and stuff. The packaging tells you what to do with and how to use each one. they are plastic except the teasing brush which has a metal tail. the teasing comb also appears to be more of the brush style but mine wasnt it was just a regular comb with a metal tail which I didn&#x27;t like but it does get the job done! I would recommend to all!</li>
    <li> Good buy for the Asst. styling combs.</li>
    <li> These are good quality. Only complaint I have is that the white comb makes my hair staticky...but I live in Utah- so that&#x27;s likely due to the dry air and my hair, not the comb its self. I love the tail comb- it works GREAT for parting my daughters fine fine hair to make cute styles before school every morning.</li>
    <li> Nice seem sturdy white comb is perfect for in the shower</li>
    <li> Great little assortment &amp; great price!</li>
    <li> I definitely love the white comb. I have black natural hair (nappy) and it detangles my haire by section very well after my shampoo. I use the black comb when i apply my treatment. Love them all</li>
    <li> The reviews were right on with this product.  Nice assortment of combs, good&lt;br /&gt;quality and great price.</li>
    <li> I love the rat tail comb but I feel like the other 2 combs make a lot of extra hairs fall out though. Great value for the combs though.</li>
    <li> all useful tools and great add-on.  especially if you like to style your own hair instead of spending hundreds of dollars over years to have it done in a salon.</li>
