      <li>Believe the bottle when it tells you have much to use, though!</li>
      <li>i am a first time user of this product.</li>
      <li>I have long been a fan of Argan Oil, I love it because you can literally use it on just about everything</li>
      <li>First of all, I have really oily skin</li>
      <li>Because of its thickness, I always have my hair stylist use thinning shears when I get my hair cut {which leads to it looking even more frizzy because I have single strands of hair ending in all sorts of spots}.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My cuticles are also very thankful for the added moisture.</li>
      <li>I love how this product does the same thing as my high-end Josie Maran Argan Oil except it comes in a larger size for the the cheaper price tag.</li>
      <li>Argan Oil is a great natural source of beneficial lipids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidant compounds!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, for second and third day hair I spray dry shampoo into my roots and then if my hair is looking a little frizzy again, I will smooth it down with a bit more of this argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to top it all off, I also used this oil on my cuticles and it was just as fabulous a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is also naturally wavy and prone to being very frizzy.  </li>

      <li>Since using ULTIMATE ARGAN on my nails/cuticles, I have noticed my nails are much stronger!</li>
      <li>I was surprised to learn that it takes three days to make just one liter!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have long been a fan of Argan Oil, I love it because you can literally use it on just about everything and it delivers great results.  I am also a big fan of Azure Naturals so when they sent me their 100% Virgin Argan Oil to review for them I was super happy.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I love Argan Oil?  First of all, I have really oily skin but this is one oil that is great for all skin types, even acne-prone.  It&#x27;s ultra-lightweight, non-greasy, and it absorbs really quickly.  My favorite way to use Argan Oil is to apply it to my face as a sleep mask and I also apply it to my neck, decollete and shoulders as part of my nighttime skincare routine.  When I wake up in the morning my skin feels really hydrated and has a nice dewy glow to it.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer and provides good shine without being too greasy.</li>
    <li> Great for just about anything skin related anywhere on your body.</li>
    <li> I really love argan oil. I have used argan oil on my hair for about 2 years now.  I had the opportunity to review this argan oil from Azure Naturals and I love it. It makes your hair feel wonderful and get rid of the frizz. Make your hair smooth and manageable. I would recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair. I have yet to try it on my face or nails but I would almost bet that it would work for them too.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I love it for my hair. The best on the market.</li>
    <li> i am a first time user of this product. i wanted something natural for my nails. After using on my cuticles i can see and feel a difference.  my hands are in water a lot, so i need to be proactive if i am going to continue to see improvement.  i am going to keep this product by sink to use each time while pores are open, then i can prevent and protect cuticles from getting dried out again.</li>
    <li> I bought 100% Pure Moroccan Organic Virgin Argan Oil because I have some ugly frown wrinkles.  I have been applying the oil on the lines twice every twenty four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been about two weeks of oil applications, and the lines look great!!!  I never thought I would be saying that about frown lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will be in my PERMENANT ARSENOL to fight again age lines, dry skin, and dry skin.  I want to look younger than I actually am, and this oil is working wonders!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil for face &amp; neck.</li>
    <li> Great price!!!!  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> This argan oil leaves your hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it to moisturize your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Works best on damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also leaves your hair with a lot of sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received complimentary in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;All opinions expressed here are my own.</li>

Because of its thickness, I always have my hair stylist use thinning shears when I get my hair cut {which leads to it looking even more frizzy because I have single strands of hair ending in all sorts of spots}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept my hair care routine the same for the most part and just added in using the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every two or three days.  After washing, I will apply a BB cream or some sort of creamy, moisturizing, leave-in protectant.  I twist my hair up into a bun and let that cream sit and mingle with my hair.  I also let it sit to cut down on the amount of drying time with my hair dryer.  Right before blow drying, I will spritz in a leave-in conditioner, focusing it on my ends, and then blow dry my hair {this is after it is has dried about halfway on its own}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the step of blow drying my hair is where I decided to incorporate this argan oil.  I smoothed it onto my hair after drying, focusing on the ends, and it immediately smoothed out my frizz and left my hair looking soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my hair is pretty dry overall, my roots and scalp get oily over the course of the three days that I do not wash it.

    <li> This is a great product!! I love how this product does the same thing as my high-end Josie Maran Argan Oil except it comes in a larger size for the the cheaper price tag. What a score in my opinion! I love using it on my cuticles, drier areas of my body like my feet, knees and elbows. Also since I have combo skin (dry cheeks and oily T-zone) I use this on my cheeks as well and I have seen great improvement. This product is a must have for the winter months! I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
    <li> I have been using Azure Naturals Argan oil on my hair the last few weeks. I love their oils!  My hair is shiny and silky.  It looks amazing after using the Argan oil on my split ends.  I appreciate that the smell is very light.  I enjoy that it has a pump, instead of a dropper or pouring it out.  It&#x27;s one of my new favorite oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals ULTIMATE ARGAN 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil is found in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. I was surprised to learn that it takes three days to make just one liter! Their formula is lightweight and non-greasy. Argan Oil is a great natural source of beneficial lipids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidant compounds! It also has a lot of uses for your hair, skin and nails! I have really enjoyed trying this Argan Oil! I used it on my hair, skin and even to moisturize my cuticles. For my hair, I applied 3 drops of this product onto my scalp from root to ends, and left it on overnight. When I washed it out in the morning, my hair had a lovely sheen to it and felt much healthier! For my skin, I just applied 2 or 3 drops wherever I needed a little moisture. It definitely helped calm and soothe my eczema, and gave my skin a natural glow as an added bonus! For my cuticles, I applied 2 drops and massaged it into my cuticles and nails. Since using ULTIMATE ARGAN on my nails/cuticles, I have noticed my nails are much stronger! My cuticles are also very thankful for the added moisture. I definitely recommend trying it out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> I thought that smell was fine not too strong. I used it on hair to help with my split ends, hair is almost to my waist.  I love using it on my cuticles, drier areas of my body like my feet, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil on my hair instead of the expensive products I usually use. This Argan oil has metamorphosed my hair to soft, silky, frizz-free locks. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Have not used it very long but am happy so far with the positive effect it has on the skin and nails.</li>
    <li> Since I was already trying out the Emu Oil on my skin by the time I cracked open this bottle of Argan oil, I decided to focus my testing of it on my hair and all I can say is….O.M.G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot remember a time that my hair has looked or felt better since I started using this oil.  I have very thick, very coarse, always dry hair.  It is also naturally wavy and prone to being very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my hair is almost dry {I let it air dry} I smoothed it onto my hair, focusing on the ends, and it immediately smoothed out my frizz and left my hair looking soft and shiny. Even though my hair is pretty dry overall, my roots and scalp get oily over the course of the three days that I do not wash it.  So, for second and third day hair I spray dry shampoo into my roots and then if my hair is looking a little frizzy again, I will smooth it down with a bit more of this argan oil. This stuff is liquid gold.</li>
