      <li>very good delivery</li>
      <li>Love these!!</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair straightener!!!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>It is more a dimmed baby blue but really nice, has a nice ruberish feel to it like the backing of a smartphone.</li>
      <li>This company is awesome hands down, I think this is like the sixth one I&#x27;ve gotten now as a gift for my relatives.</li>
      <li>For me, when i recieved it, the color is not as vivid and bright like in this pic.</li>
      <li>Trust me, just get it, it&#x27;ll be worth it :)</li>
      <li>You buy these in the mall for a lot more, but the prices on line are very reasonable.</li>
      <li>A digital heat dial would make it flawless but overall its bomb af.</li>
      <li>Works great - exact one as at the mall kiosk, but way less money.</li>
      <li>Chi never worked for my natural hair but did fine on my sew-ins</li>
      <li>Works exactly like the one in the mall and at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>But I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE these flat irons.  </li>
      <li>My hair comes out so silky and very straightened, or curled depending on what I want</li>
      <li>My hair is so shiny and straight.</li>
      <li>Iron works very well just like my mothers.</li>
      <li>But other than that it heats up very fast and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>They get really hot and they are able to properly straighten my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>but this did wonders on my natural hair</li>
      <li>I am an African American female with type 4b/4c hair and nothing has ever gotten my hair so straight.</li>

<li> But other than that, awsome!</li>
<li> I purchased mine from this seller on Amazon and was afraid at first because of reviews and suggestions not to.</li>
<li> Delivery was fast, it seemed like the straightener itself was a little dirty..</li>
<li> The flat iron is on but the plates stay competely cold.</li>
<li> I mean OMG.  </li>
<li> Won&#x27;t buy from this buyer again :(</li>

    <li> I loooove it! Recommended to everyone!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these flat irons.  They get really hot and they are able to properly straighten my thick hair.  They also work well on my daughter&#x27;s mixed hair.  You buy these in the mall for a lot more, but the prices on line are very reasonable.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made! My hair is so shiny and straight. I love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair straightener!!! BEST hair straightener I EVER had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAST SHIPPING!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great - exact one as at the mall kiosk, but way less money.</li>
    <li> As advertised and on time.</li>
    <li> The straightener arrived as pictured.  I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine from this seller on Amazon and was afraid at first because of reviews and suggestions not to. But I love this flat iron. I am an African American female with type 4b/4c hair and nothing has ever gotten my hair so straight. I mean OMG.  What I did was order and buy multiple flat irons and this one won even over the suggested fhi from sallys. Chi never worked for my natural hair but did fine on my sew-ins but this did wonders on my natural hair and I usually only have to do one pass every 7-10 days  to blend my hair. In combination with heat  protectors and other products like TMS, heat damage is minimal. A digital heat dial would make it flawless but overall its bomb af.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast, it seemed like the straightener itself was a little dirty.. But other than that it heats up very fast and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love these!! My hair comes out so silky and very straightened, or curled depending on what I want</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron and 3 weeks later I received something totally different the only thing the product I order and the one i got is the blue color. Won&#x27;t buy from this buyer again :(</li>
    <li> I recieved my iron just yesturday! I am very pleased. Iron works very well just like my mothers. Although, flipside. For me, when i recieved it, the color is not as vivid and bright like in this pic. It is more a dimmed baby blue but really nice, has a nice ruberish feel to it like the backing of a smartphone. But other than that, awsome!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received a defective one. After just one use, it now doesn&#x27;t want to heat up. The flat iron is on but the plates stay competely cold.</li>
    <li> This company is awesome hands down, I think this is like the sixth one I&#x27;ve gotten now as a gift for my relatives. Trust me, just get it, it&#x27;ll be worth it :)</li>
    <li> very good delivery no issues</li>
    <li> Works exactly like the one in the mall and at a fraction of the price. Wife loves it!</li>
