      <li>Love all the JR Liggett products.</li>
      <li>One of the reasons that I was trying so many products to relieve the dryness is because of the damage I was doing.</li>
      <li>It reduced my fly away hair problem, but seems to be too much moisturizing now that spring has arrived.  </li>
      <li>I used the damaged formula on my color treated hair (not really damaged though) and it worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>And it is so easy to pack when I fly.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
      <li>I was so happy and relieved when my hair felt so good - even after it dried.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t use it on your face, I find it&#x27;s easy to get in the eyes</li>
      <li>but I needed something easy to use while traveling.</li>

      <li>This is the very first of so many products that has solved my most major hair concerns: stripping and drying.</li>
      <li>However, the soap lathers a LOT and quickly (probably the chemical agent added)...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve cut all \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; products from my home, so I&#x27;m more sensitive to the smell; I can smell these chemicals from a mile away....</li>
      <li>This soap bar foams up nicely, makes my hair clean and smooth, and seems to be breaking less.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would do on straighter/finer or more Caucasian type hair because of the retention of natural oils.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say any better than my old shampoo and conditioner (nature&#x27;s gate) but it is nice to only have to &amp;#34;wash and rinse&amp;#34; once vs twice.</li>
      <li>for the price, it is worth a try.  </li>
      <li>it is economical</li>

      <li>does not dry out most hair types</li>
      <li>I tested this on my face and it was super gentle.</li>
      <li>Very nice - not sure about any hair-rejuvenation properties, but it&#x27;s sudsy and lasts a long-ass time.</li>
      <li>It just feels healthy and like hair should the next day.</li>
      <li>All of them made my hair brittle and prone to breaking (and I gave each of them a month to &amp;#34;transition&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize at first because it doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
      <li>When you make the switch your hair freaks out at first because it&#x27;s forgotten to do</li>
      <li>When I used the bar the first time, my hair was softest while still damp.</li>
      <li>I use it first, rinse, then use my shampoo I like.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a shampoo bar to cut down on packaging, to be more environmentally friendly.  </li>
      <li>As my hair was so dry, I think i need to use few more times to understand the good result.</li>

      <li>(By the way, I plan to alternate this one with the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; once I feel my hair is back in good</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>The bar has a  lot of lather which is unusual in a lot of shampoo bars.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t melt away too fast.  </li>
      <li>I always had the type of hair that looked very oily after a day of not washing.</li>

      <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
      <li>My hair instantly felt healthier and more natural.</li>
      <li>Out of probably 20 products, I found a maybe 4 that worked under certain conditions (depending on how I applied, used, re-applied, or added something with the main product).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m yet to try the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; that I also bought, but I can say that using the &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; version alone makes my hair feel better than it ever did with a co-wash or with any of the other so-called &#x27;non-stripping&#x27; shampoos.</li>

      <li>In the future I will be buying more, it will be a while since these last 3 months give or take a month or 2.</li>
      <li>With my hair being so dried out (and its being naturally very kinky/curly), I was losing  a lot just from the dryness, then losing more whenever I tried to comb/detangle or style it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I still do need to apply some leave-in spray conditioner, but my hair is so much improved after just 2 washes that I might not even have to use the leave-ins after a few more uses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty much in love with this. I always had the type of hair that looked very oily after a day of not washing. I use this now about every 3rd day and my hair never looks greasy. It just feels healthy and like hair should the next day.</li>
    <li> Jr. Liggets is pretty much the only shampoo I can use that doesn&#x27;t allow my hair to get greaseballed by the end of the day. It definitely gives a very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling, but it does feel like it dries out my hair, even the damaged formula. I would like them to create a conditioner for those of us that don&#x27;t feel the bar conditions well enough on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> I wanted a shampoo bar to cut down on packaging, to be more environmentally friendly.  I&#x27;ve cut all \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; products from my home, so I&#x27;m more sensitive to the smell; I can smell these chemicals from a mile away....this soap definitely overwhelmed me with that chemical smell, which surprised me as it&#x27;s advertised as natural....I&#x27;m using it, however, but will not buy it again.  I use it first, rinse, then use my shampoo I like.  After using this &amp; rinsing, my wet hair feels like a strong buildup is on it from this soap.  However, the soap lathers a LOT and quickly (probably the chemical agent added)...the soap also \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; quickly--not an ultra long lasting bar at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and I am surprised to...it cleanses well and my hair seems to be in better condition. I only use it for travel and it really is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo bar. I had been using chagrin valley but decided to try this and they are both good choices. The bar has a  lot of lather which is unusual in a lot of shampoo bars. Cleaned my hair well.</li>
    <li> Bets natural shampoo bar that I have found. I have been searching for a year and have gone through countless of brands. This leaves my thick, wavy hair frizz free and shiny. It has been slowly but surely undoing the damage done to my hair over the years. I will not be using another brand. I also love to use it on my skin. I have never found a natural bar soap that does not strip the oils off of my skin and leave it dry; this brand does the trick.</li>
    <li> Good experience and good product. 5 stars thank you.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 5 stars even though they sent me the wrong bar. I would just like to say to anyone thinking about switching to shampoo bars to DO IT. It is so much better for your hair. IGNORE the bad reviews, from what I saw they were USER error NOT product error. When you make the switch your hair freaks out at first because it&#x27;s forgotten to do it&#x27;s natural job. This is called &amp;#34;the purge&amp;#34; it takes 1-6 weeks depending on how hard your water is. It only took me 2-3 washes to get through the purge here in the South. Before anyone attempts to leave crap reviews on a product they need to educate themselves on it and properly use it. Obviously if it&#x27;s working for SO many people and not you, you most likely did something wrong. I am sad they sent me the peppermint oil bar instead of the damaged hair bar but my hair already feels and looks extremely healthy from the peppermint one. In the future I will be buying more, it will be a while since these last 3 months give or take a month or 2.</li>
    <li> I was really VERY skeptical of this because I have been having the worst experiences with the last few hair products I&#x27;ve ordered but, if I could, I&#x27;d give this 20 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am now hooked. I have extremely, nappy, kinky, DRY hair that I opt to wear in a natural (non-relaxed) style. In trying to moisturize and soften my hair, I had  been concentrating on style sprays, oils, curl custards, curl &amp;#34;quenchers&amp;#34;  and every kind of conditioner. Out of probably 20 products, I found a maybe 4 that worked under certain conditions (depending on how I applied, used, re-applied, or added something with the main product). In the 1 or 2 cases where a product worked as advertised, the price was too much for regular ongoing use. This is the very first of so many products that has solved my most major hair concerns: stripping and drying. When I used the bar the first time, my hair was softest while still damp. I purposely did not use a conditioner &amp; once my hair dried out, it still wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; as before. In many online reviews, I had read that this works better with every use. I washed my hair with it again this morning. Since I usually only co-wash (&amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; with a conditioner) my hair every other week (or once a week if I&#x27;m worried about sweat, etc.), this much washing with a shampoo is kind of a real test with a shampoo to see if it is nourishing my hair or stripping it. I was so happy and relieved when my hair felt so good - even after it dried. It&#x27;s true about not needing to use a conditioner. Not only was my hair softer than ever, but I didn&#x27;t have to use a ton of products to retain the softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than using leave-in sprays and oils because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the oil residue and buildup. When I say that my hair is &#x27;soft&#x27;, I don&#x27;t just mean it feels that way, but that it feels like it&#x27;s being healed. One of the reasons that I was trying so many products to relieve the dryness is because of the damage I was doing. With my hair being so dried out (and its being naturally very kinky/curly), I was losing  a lot just from the dryness, then losing more whenever I tried to comb/detangle or style it. Even worse, I wasn&#x27;t retaining any growth because of all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still do need to apply some leave-in spray conditioner, but my hair is so much improved after just 2 washes that I might not even have to use the leave-ins after a few more uses. It&#x27;s so true that my shampoos were stripping my hair. I can tell a huge difference in this shampoo. I&#x27;m yet to try the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; that I also bought, but I can say that using the &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; version alone makes my hair feel better than it ever did with a co-wash or with any of the other so-called &#x27;non-stripping&#x27; shampoos. I&#x27;m going to be taking photos for the next few weeks just to track the improvement in the appearance of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. If you have 4B/4C hair. I rarely recommend hair stuff this strongly, but I would be very surprised if someone with severely dry and damaged African-American type hair ended up disappointed with this. I don&#x27;t know how it would do on straighter/finer or more Caucasian type hair because of the retention of natural oils. It might be good as a off-and-on type treatment though. I can&#x27;t say yet how the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; is, but I sure can&#x27;t wait to try it now. (By the way, I plan to alternate this one with the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; once I feel my hair is back in good balance.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about this shampoo bar! I also used it on my face and loved it. Usually, I clean my face only with oils but, every now and then, I do a soap wash just to maintain blackheads. I tested this on my face and it was super gentle. It didn&#x27;t leave me with the tight, dried out feeling of regular cleansers. I think it&#x27;s going to be a really good body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barring something drastic, I will be using this shampoo bar permanently.e I was doing. With my hair being so dried out (and its being naturally very kinky/curly), I was losing  a lot just from the dryness, then losing more whenever I tried to comb/detangle or style it. Even worse, I wasn&#x27;t retaining any growth because of all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still do need to apply some leave-in spray conditioner, but my hair is so much improved after just 2 washes that I might not even have to use the leave-ins after a few more uses. It&#x27;s so true that my shampoos were stripping my hair. I can tell a huge difference in this shampoo. I&#x27;m yet to try the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; that I also bought, but I can say that using the &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; version alone makes my hair feel better than it ever did with a co-wash or with any of the other so-called &#x27;non-stripping&#x27; shampoos. I&#x27;m going to be taking photos for the next few weeks just to track the improvement in the appearance of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. If you have 4B/4C hair.

    <li> Here are the pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) no problems with airline travel because it is not a liquid&lt;br /&gt;2) it is economical&lt;br /&gt;3) has a nice scent that is not chemical based, but is derived from nature.&lt;br /&gt;4) cleans well&lt;br /&gt;5) does not dry out most hair types&lt;br /&gt;6) for the price, it is worth a try.  If you don&#x27;t like the way it cleans your hair, you can place it somewhere in the room as an air freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons, that I can think of, so try it!</li>
    <li> I will never go back to commercial shampoo again. This shampoo bar gets your hair squeaky clean without drying it out which I didn&#x27;t realize at first because it doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
    <li> Very nice - not sure about any hair-rejuvenation properties, but it&#x27;s sudsy and lasts a long-ass time.</li>
    <li> A quality product! *: )</li>
    <li> I love the J.R. Ligget bar shampoo soaps. They take up less space in the shower and lather up quite well even in rock hard water we have in New Mexico. I&#x27;ve tried the Herbal, Regular and the Damaged Hair formula. I switched to the Damaged Hair formula for the winter months when I noticed that I had more fly-away hair and I didn&#x27;t want to use a conditioner. It reduced my fly away hair problem, but seems to be too much moisturizing now that spring has arrived.  I didn&#x27;t noticed a chemical smell that another reviewer reported, but it didn&#x27;t have the pleasant smell that I enjoyed from the Herbal bar.</li>
    <li> This was better than I expected but left a residue in my hair. It was so bad after a few days that I had to go back to regular shampoo. Hopefully I can try one that is less moisturizing</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My hair has never been healthier!</li>
    <li> since using this shampoo my hair has become much less damaged and i dont have to wash it as often.  very happy with this product</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome.  My hair has really never been nicer.  Normally after 6 weeks my hair is brittle and in need of an unwanted haircut.  My last haircut was 3 months ago and it still looks great!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for years to get soft, lightweight curls, and I finally found it with this shampoo bar.  I recommend getting hair very wet (it won&#x27;t lather well if not) and then working the bar completely through the hair.  Leave on for a minute or two, then rinse with cold water and finish with diluted apple cider vinegar.  Leave the vinegar rinse on for a few minutes, then rinse again with cold water.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and fast delivery. Makes my hair feel fuller and cleaner..I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love all the JR Liggett products. When I&#x27;m traveling or at the gym I use this instead of shampoo and conditioner, normally use it instead of body wash. Works particularly well for shaving. Just don&#x27;t use it on your face, I find it&#x27;s easy to get in the eyes and it can really sting.</li>
    <li> This is very good, almost too good, it cleans too good.  Would be perfect if I still worked outside on the farm, but I don&#x27;t get that dirty anymore, I work in a office.  The firemen &amp; construction workers love it.</li>
    <li> After using a smaller shampoo bar from a boutique store, I thought I&#x27;d try this one. I love it! It is almost twice the size of the $11 bar I previously used and does not seem to be shrinking in size as quickly as the other bar. My hair feels clean and it leaves no residue behind. I&#x27;m anxious to try their other products in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo bar. I will never go back to using regular shampoo again. My hair instantly felt healthier and more natural.</li>
    <li> I have tried &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and honey shampoo and various other natural ways to keep your hair clean.  All of them made my hair brittle and prone to breaking (and I gave each of them a month to &amp;#34;transition&amp;#34;).  This soap bar foams up nicely, makes my hair clean and smooth, and seems to be breaking less.  I use a homemade conditioner with aloe vera gel, glycerin, vitamin E and distilled water.  So far my hair is improving!!  I keep this bar in a plastic soap box in the shower so it doesn&#x27;t melt away too fast.  I highly recommend this product (btw you can carry it on an airplane because it isn&#x27;t a liquid!).</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo on a daily basis. It works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; (no shampoo) but I needed something easy to use while traveling. I absolutely love this! I used the damaged formula on my color treated hair (not really damaged though) and it worked wonderfully. For those that say it makes their hair tangled and doesn&#x27;t work well, try using apple cider vinegar or something afterwards as a conditioner. The PH of the shampoo bar is too high, so an acidic rinse will balance it out. 1 tbsp in a cup of water poured over your head usually does the trick. Anything acidic will work (any vinegar, lemon, aloe vera, etc.)</li>
    <li> Rinsed my hair for almost 20 mines after and my hair still ended up oily and filmy</li>
    <li> Till now I used 3 times. Looks good. As my hair was so dry, I think i need to use few more times to understand the good result.</li>
    <li> Do not get this in your eyes! Within just a few seconds of beginning to wash my hair, the smallest amount got into my eye and it was a pain like I have never felt before. Needless to say my shower was cut short and now my eye is very swollen, red, and feels like there is sand in it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. And it is so easy to pack when I fly.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It works nicely.  I wouldn&#x27;t say any better than my old shampoo and conditioner (nature&#x27;s gate) but it is nice to only have to &amp;#34;wash and rinse&amp;#34; once vs twice.</li>
    <li> seller is great, but not a fan of this product. i saw it on a you tube from a person who uses it on their hair and recommended it but i did not like how it did not produce any lather and to me it was itchy on my head after rinsing out.</li>
