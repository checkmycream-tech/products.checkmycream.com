      <li>I am seeing a huge difference in just a week...</li>
      <li>thank you for this fantastic product.</li>
      <li>I can truly say 180 Cosmetics products are outstanding and very reasonably priced for the content of ingredients they contain.  </li>
      <li>180 Cosmetics has been a significant contributor to the condition and appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>This product has significantly softened the appearance and has made my skin glow.</li>
      <li>I am over 65 years old and this product did amazing things for my skin.  </li>
      <li>You might consider a new bottle or be sure the bottle is full.</li>
      <li>Many people think I&#x27;m in my forties or early fifties.</li>
      <li>This takes effect immediately on day one, and you can see the difference right away.</li>
      <li>People who have known me for years, as well as people who I meet, cannot believe my age as they constantly remark how beautiful my skin looks and that they believed me to be possibly 40,</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a month, twice a day religiously and have really seen a huge difference in fine lines and Sun discoloration.</li>
      <li>Well, I received this hyaluronic acid cream exactly two days ago, and OH MY GOODNESS</li>
      <li>Thanks very much to the seller.</li>
      <li>The 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss cream works well, yet</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like, and when I turn my neck certain ways.</li>
      <li>Try this pure swiss hyaluronic cream.  </li>
      <li>Overnight I can see a lessening of fine lines, and a big wrinkle appears to be diminished.  </li>
      <li>Disappointing for the VERY BEST PURE moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I broke out in a huge red rash all over my neck and decolletage.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say this product is extremely gentle</li>
      <li>just used it a couple of times but seems very moist, do you have any mor products?</li>
      <li>to  obtain the real effect.  </li>
      <li>I threw the whole thing out.  </li>
      <li>This product is one of the few I can honestly say I have noticed a decrease in my wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
      <li>It really does make my skin smooth and soft, especially with continued application.</li>
      <li>It is so highly scented, I can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>and the skin on my neck and bust is not only less saggy, but I can feel that it&#x27;s firmed up and more toned!</li>
      <li>It goes on soft and dries fast.</li>
      <li>After only several applications I began to see my skin becoming firmer.  </li>
      <li>I love it and suppose I have to buy  a few bottles  </li>
      <li>The cream dries quickly and is easy to apply using only a small amount.</li>
      <li>The first time it finally came out in a spurt, but not this time.  </li>
      <li>This product came defective when it arrived, but the Pure Swiss cream itself is smoothing the facial skin.</li>
      <li>Initially and ordered serum from Esthederm french, very good, but is was quite expensive and I have changed for this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 62 years old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective neck cream for over a decade, and have spent a small fortune on creams that did NOTHING for my neckline.</li>
      <li>It is a high quality product, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>This is the second time it has happened and the bottle is over half full.  </li>
      <li>if that old, but definitely not over 40!  </li>
      <li>old and have tried numerous skin care lines.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was nice on skin . Used it under foundation and it worked well. Skin feels hydrated and toned.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels &amp; looks.  Too soon to tell if this should be a part of my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Thank you it&#x27;s amazing item +AAAAAAAAAAA</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel hydrated without a lot of product weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Like it.</li>
    <li> People with sensitivities and allergies beware.  It is so highly scented, I can&#x27;t use it.  Disappointing for the VERY BEST PURE moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The bottle was broke when it arrived . I like the product however I am not sure if I should order again&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the serum as well and that bottle was broke also.&lt;br /&gt;Loretta</li>
    <li> Very good product. Can tell a change in 3 days. Will order again!</li>
    <li> This product came defective when it arrived, but the Pure Swiss cream itself is smoothing the facial skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> the bottle inside the box was broken and the ingredients dried out.  flass in bottom of the box.  I threw the whole thing out.  A very disappointing waste!</li>
    <li> I have been using 180 Cosmetics products for over one year now.  I am 63&lt;br /&gt;years old and have tried numerous skin care lines.  I can truly say 180 Cosmetics products are outstanding and very reasonably priced for the content of ingredients they contain.  People who have known me for years, as well as people who I meet, cannot believe my age as they constantly remark how beautiful my skin looks and that they believed me to be possibly 40, if that old, but definitely not over 40!  180 Cosmetics has been a significant contributor to the condition and appearance of my skin.  This particular moisturizer is excellent and I recommend it highly and without reservation!  Try it... you will love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> After using for 2 months - I can&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement in my face</li>
    <li> What should I do when nothing will come out when I pump it?  This is the second time it has happened and the bottle is over half full.  The first time it finally came out in a spurt, but not this time.  HELP!!!  I can&#x27;t use it now.  I think it is helping with my skin problem but not when it is still in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Careful when using this product!!  Very strong....I broke out in a huge red rash all over my neck and decolletage.  Similar to small hives, I definitely had a terrible reaction.  I had not problems with the C serum for my face...loved it.  If you have sensitive skin use a small amount to see if you get a reaction.  I was disappointed that I could not use it.</li>
    <li> Try this pure swiss hyaluronic cream.  Overnight I can see a lessening of fine lines, and a big wrinkle appears to be diminished.  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big bonus that may be making the difference are the peptides included in the product.  The hyaluronic acid plumps the skin and helps the wrinkles disappear, but the peptides, according to recent scientific studies, may work at a deeper level in the skin to improve firmness and quality of the skin itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it works, the fact is it does work – beautifully.  Give this one a try.  You’ll be a big fan, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for unbiased review.</li>
    <li> love it. smooth, good fragrance, seems to be working</li>
    <li> just used it a couple of times but seems very moist, do you have any mor products?</li>
    <li> This is an excellent serum.  Especially for gals over 40 PLUS!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Still enjoying arrived on time</li>
    <li> Just an  excellence product!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have used many products, some of which are very expensive. This takes effect immediately on day one, and you can see the difference right away. It is a high quality product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Love it, can see a change already</li>
    <li> I love it and suppose I have to buy  a few bottles  to  obtain the real effect.  Thanks very much to the seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have spent hundreds of dollars on products and have also underwent  laser resurfacing. Nothing has worked as well as this one product. I am 59 and have some sun damaged skin with small lines around my lips and eyes. This product has significantly softened the appearance and has made my skin glow. The color is more even and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This really is a fantastic product that smoothes my skin and gives it a youthful appearance!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month, twice a day religiously and have really seen a huge difference in fine lines and Sun discoloration. It goes on soft and dries fast. I will def continue buying this.</li>
    <li> It does hydrates skin. I actually switched to Amara  product to compare it with 180 and regret it a lot.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this cream, just wish the dispenser didn&#x27;t restrict the dose (probably so you only use what you need~~  I tend to over glob all face creams because I like the feel). The 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss cream works well, yet I haven&#x27;t tried it independently of the serum so, it&#x27;s been hard for me to differentiate this product from others I used prior to trying the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum</li>
    <li> It really does make my skin smooth and soft, especially with continued application.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I have very sensitive skin and I have to say this product is extremely gentle and it is the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin... I love it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, very lightweight but provides a good amount of moisture to my skin.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the pump did not work so I have to get it out with a Starbucks coffee stir.</li>
    <li> Not impressed as I have seen no visible change or difference since using this product so I will not be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old. Many people think I&#x27;m in my forties or early fifties. So with that said, I can&#x27;t tell any difference. I have some wrinkles between my eyes I don&#x27;t like, and when I turn my neck certain ways. Not seeing any difference. But not any worse either; so it&#x27;s a hard call. I&#x27;ve only used it a month and half.</li>
    <li> I noticed the difference in my skin after 3-4 days. Less wrinkles around my mouth and eyes</li>
    <li> I am over 65 years old and this product did amazing things for my skin.  I love how the find wrinkles have almost disappeared and my skin feels and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it morning and night under my tinted mosturizing sunscreen.  The cream dries quickly and is easy to apply using only a small amount.</li>
    <li> I love the way this helps leave my skin feeling so silky.  I even put it on my arms &amp; shoulders.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the few I can honestly say I have noticed a decrease in my wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective neck cream for over a decade, and have spent a small fortune on creams that did NOTHING for my neckline. Well, I received this hyaluronic acid cream exactly two days ago, and OH MY GOODNESS I can&#x27;t believe it. Two days! and the skin on my neck and bust is not only less saggy, but I can feel that it&#x27;s firmed up and more toned! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month. Talk about anti aging... thank you for this fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Good product with good price. I use it for more than 2 years and I recommend it to family and friends. Initially and ordered serum from Esthederm french, very good, but is was quite expensive and I have changed for this. I have a nice skin for my 68 years and everybody ask me for advices. The 1ª think for me is to drink lots of liquids and use at nigth hyaluronic acid serum and cream and Vitamine C serum for the morning with cream of vitamine E. I have also more tricks but not for here.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month and it has not given me a softer look.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful.  Product as described.  Can be used day or night and under makeup.  I will recommend to my daughter and daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> After only several applications I began to see my skin becoming firmer.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the product itself yet. I think I will like it the problem there is so little product in the bottle the pump won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;pump it up. I am disappointed in the amount of product. You might consider a new bottle or be sure the bottle is full.</li>
    <li> Pore clogging, so probably can&#x27;t use enough to get the results without clogging and breaking out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cream- I am seeing a huge difference in just a week...my neck is firmer...acne scares diminishing...and over all my face is firmer.I am using with the 180 Serum that also is doing great under my eyes- I will be ordering more of this product. Best product I have ever used!</li>
