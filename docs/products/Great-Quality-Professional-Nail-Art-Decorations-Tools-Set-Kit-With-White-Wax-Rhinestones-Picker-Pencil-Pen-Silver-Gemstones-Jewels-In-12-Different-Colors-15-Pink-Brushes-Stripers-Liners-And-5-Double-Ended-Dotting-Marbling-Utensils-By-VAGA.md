      <li>the dotting tools are very good</li>
      <li>So all in it is a great buy.</li>

      <li>The gems are a great addition too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>

      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>its good for the price if your a person like me that loves nail art give it a try! :)</li>
      <li>Once I opened the package, though, I was very satisfied.</li>
      <li>i am so happy that i am going to be able to use this on my nails</li>
      <li>The gems and dotting tools are especially useful to a beginner.</li>
      <li>Everything is there, and the quality of the products looked really nice and reliable.</li>
      <li>I had to warm the tip at my lamp to get anything to stick.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Everything you need but paint and polish to do some really nice nail art.</li>
      <li>Some brush heads need more glue</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>Love MOST of the items.  </li>
      <li>The dotting tools are my favorite.</li>
      <li>I got everything in the package i love it</li>
      <li>I got really excited!</li>
      <li>This set is amazing and I am happy with every single product in this set.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s an easy fix and for the price</li>
      <li>Some of the brushes had some ratty looking bristles but they were easily trimmed off.</li>
      <li>I was just reading some of the issues of being cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Im very into doing my own nail designs</li>
      <li>It may take  a long time before you get it, but everything was in good condition.. :)</li>
      <li>Cool stuff ...</li>
      <li>Overall this is a nice starter kit, and it allows me to easily make lots of fun designs when I paint my nails.</li>
      <li>This is a present for one of my fiance&#x27;s friends, so I am sure she will love, but it took quite some time to get here, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>The brushes seem well made for the price and many of them are tiny for fine detail.</li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t really care about organization and don&#x27;t mind picking the colored gems you want from a colorful pile of all the gems, you&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
      <li>The response back wasn&#x27;t too nice.</li>
      <li>The ones I use most is the two fan brushes and the natural fiber one.    </li>
      <li>and this set is amazing professional and came a week early</li>
      <li>so my issue, the brush are more cheaply made than I expected.</li>
      <li>exactly like images.</li>
      <li>but the sparkles, pencil, etc. were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I like that this kit has so many brushes and dot tools to try different nail designs.</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I would most definitely purchase this again, and I would certainly recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>its very professional everything is exactly as the picture except the silver stones which I didn&#x27;t expect to come in different shapes which is even better well worth the money</li>
      <li>Love this kit.. and worth every dollar spent on this product..</li>
      <li>Great product &amp; delivered earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>More than I expected.</li>
      <li>This set came with everything you could possibly need to create a unique nail look.</li>
      <li>Sometime last week I emailed the seller to see if I could get a better idea of exactly WHEN it was going to come since it is part of a Christmas present.</li>
      <li>I purchased this set for myself, and my seven year old who is interested in experimenting with nail art.  </li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t believe how many items that come in this set - I have had it for a few weeks</li>
      <li>I do nail art as a hobby and got this to give to a beginner nail artist (9 years old) who I know will get a bunch of use out of it.</li>
      <li>I love it so much only that i did expected the brushes to be bigger but</li>

    <li> Awesome. Everything you need but paint and polish to do some really nice nail art.</li>
    <li> When I saw this set I got really excited! I was actually looking for all of these things separately when I saw this. I can&#x27;t wait for it to get here!!!! Will update.    Update    I waited about a week and a half before I got it, but i was expecting that since it came from China. I got everything advertised.     Okay so my issue, the brush are more cheaply made than I expected. There was some of the glue showing from where the metal piece was placed over the wooden handles. Some of the brushes had some ratty looking bristles but they were easily trimmed off. Also the paint on the handles isn&#x27;t acetone resistant and will come off some. Some of them actually made their way to my make-up brush cup because I don&#x27;t use them enough. The ones I use most is the two fan brushes and the natural fiber one.    The dotting tools are my favorite. They are so versatile. I use them so often. The printed name isn&#x27;t acetone resistant so i just cleaned it off.     The stones are small, 1mm. There are quite a few of them. I like them.    The picker pencil... I&#x27;m not a fan. I had to warm the tip at my lamp to get anything to stick. It wasn&#x27;t sharpened so I had to go to the store to buy a sharpener. I honestly don&#x27;t use it. I prefer to use a dotter with a little topcoat one it to pick up the stones.    So all in it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; delivered earlier than expected. My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I wish that I had known that this was coming from China BEFORE I had bought it. I bought it on November 30th. After I had bought it I seen that it was going to be here sometime between the 23rd of December &amp; the 13th of January. I Bought this as part of a Christmas present. Sometime last week I emailed the seller to see if I could get a better idea of exactly WHEN it was going to come since it is part of a Christmas present. The response back wasn&#x27;t too nice. I felt the person was kinda rude. Anyways....I got it before Christmas. Let&#x27;s see how it will work when I give it to the person as a gift in a couple of days. I was just reading some of the issues of being cheaply made. I hope that I don&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item.  Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love MOST of the items.  The white pencil does not do what it does though but i repurposed it though.</li>
    <li> This set is amazing and I am happy with every single product in this set. I just can&#x27;t believe how many items that come in this set - I have had it for a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t even come close to utilizing them all. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase - I feel I don&#x27;t have to bother getting anything else!</li>
    <li> This is a present for one of my fiance&#x27;s friends, so I am sure she will love, but it took quite some time to get here, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> i am so happy that i am going to be able to use this on my nails&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Some brush heads need more glue but it&#x27;s an easy fix and for the price I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I like that this kit has so many brushes and dot tools to try different nail designs. There are plenty of gems in the packages for several applications, too. Unfortunately I accidentally spilled nail polish remover on one brush and ruined the paint, but I guess it was bound to happen. Overall this is a nice starter kit, and it allows me to easily make lots of fun designs when I paint my nails. I would most definitely purchase this again, and I would certainly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Good quality. good product. exactly like images.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the items in this set but I have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed. I&#x27;ve ordered brushes in the past and they sucked. They were too large and useless for nail art. Not this set! The brushes seem well made for the price and many of them are tiny for fine detail. The dotting tools have just about every tip you could need. I&#x27;ve never used a pencil for picking up gems before but this works. The gems are a great addition too. There are multicolored round in one wheel, the other is all clear but different shapes - hearts, flowers, moons... Really happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I got everything in the package i love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas. It came all together as shown in the photo, though it took a freakin hella long time to get to my doorstep (it actually didn&#x27;t get here before Christmas, so I ended up giving my sister a late Xmas present). Once I opened the package, though, I was very satisfied. Everything is there, and the quality of the products looked really nice and reliable. My only problem was the gems. If you open the package, they will get all messy and organizing them will be a pain. But if you don&#x27;t really care about organization and don&#x27;t mind picking the colored gems you want from a colorful pile of all the gems, you&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
    <li> Everything came as pictured. This is a really great deal, since the dotting tools alone are around $5 or $6 at Sally&#x27;s. I do nail art as a hobby and got this to give to a beginner nail artist (9 years old) who I know will get a bunch of use out of it. The gems and dotting tools are especially useful to a beginner.</li>
    <li> Cool stuff ...it took a while but I got it</li>

    <li> Very nice. Haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet but the sparkles, pencil, etc. were exactly what I was looking for. Good quality.</li>
