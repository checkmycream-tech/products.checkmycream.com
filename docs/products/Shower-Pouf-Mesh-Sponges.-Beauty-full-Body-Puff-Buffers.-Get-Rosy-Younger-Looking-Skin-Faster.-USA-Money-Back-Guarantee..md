      <li>received this item at a discounted cost, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>These are compact, full, soft/firm mesh pouf sponges.  </li>
      <li>The pouf is very luxurious during use, but still works well to exfoliate dead skin and clean wonderfully.</li>
      <li>They are large, full and really work up a nice lather.</li>
      <li>The product is nicely made and is tightly woven together to create a study, but effective sponge.</li>
      <li>These sponges are super plush.</li>
      <li>At a price competitive with most scrunchies at drugstores, these shower mesh poufs are really well made and are great for everyday use and exfoliation without feeling scratchy.</li>
      <li>I was concerned that I&#x27;d need more soap to make it work, but was happy to find that if anything, maybe I didn&#x27;t even need as much soap as usual.</li>
      <li>It is tightly packed to give great exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>These three large poufs are fantastic for showers and baths.</li>
      <li>Nice shower poofs, sturdy and look like they&#x27;re built to last, but not too scratchy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just going to say right away that I am someone who enjoys using a pouf in the shower to wash with.</li>
      <li>I am talking bright, hot pink</li>
      <li>I know, that you can purchase similar items for a lower price, but this an extremely nice, plush pouf and I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>On the FIRST use in the shower it started to unravel.  </li>
      <li>Just wish there was more than just pink as we are a big family and would have liked to share with my boys.</li>
      <li>These poufs are different in that they hold the soap so much better.</li>
      <li>I came across this triple pack from Ecoluxuries and thought it was exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>The color is really vibrant and pretty!</li>
      <li>When I saw this three pack for just a little more per loofah and free prime shipping I figured I&#x27;d give them a shot</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and clean, never irritated.</li>
      <li>First time I used one, I used too much soap.</li>
      <li>Large and Luxurious is a bit misleading.</li>
      <li>I read the description and the reviews before ordering, so I was expecting a luxurious large item.</li>
      <li>I bought these sponges because they were listed as large mesh shower sponges.  </li>
      <li>This set comes with 3 large shower mesh pouf sponges.</li>
      <li>Extra large is a joke the are the tiniest sponges ever!!!</li>
      <li>The actual poufs are not &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and fit in the palm of your hand.  </li>
      <li>after using this puff I find it to be very abrasive.</li>
      <li>my skin is getting a gently exfoliation every time I shower.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need to put that much body soap on the sponges.  </li>
      <li>With these specific poufs, they totally fit the bill.</li>
      <li>My biggest problem with poufs is the rope breaks off almost immediately, but the rope on these seems really sturdy.  </li>
      <li>do love that instead of using a wipe rope string thing, they used a pink ribbon type thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to putting on a lot more when I use other poufs.</li>
      <li>It was easy to rinse and hang to dry, with the study, attached loop.</li>
      <li>Not as tight as some of the better loofa&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>For the price I was expecting something a little better than what the dollar store sells for a buck.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt softer than usual after my shower using my first of these, and once I use these three up, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>I like that it came in a 3-pack and so far appear very durable.</li>
      <li>These are thick and larger with a nice ribbon loop!</li>
      <li>This will allow me to have two backups and prolong the time before I need to buy new ones.</li>
      <li>I am not sure that my husband would like this hot pink pouf, but I love it!  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described - quality made and soft enough to not be abrasive.</li>
      <li>The are soft, yet durable and don&#x27;t fall part whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Not too soft not too scratchy.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>First of all, it is so pink.  </li>
      <li>Second, these are really large poufs and much larger than I was anticipating.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> First time I used one, I used too much soap. Lol. I&#x27;m used to putting on a lot more when I use other poufs. These poufs are different in that they hold the soap so much better. They lather up real nice, so you use less soap. But you don&#x27;t lose any of the advantages of using a pouf. My boyfriend used one too (he just wish they didn&#x27;t come in just pink, but he&#x27;s only washing with them so no big deal).&lt;br /&gt;I do love that instead of using a wipe rope string thing, they used a pink ribbon type thing. I looks better hanging up in your shower. But it&#x27;s a small thing.</li>
    <li> My pouf sponges arrived, nicely sealed in the package. There are 3 good sized poufs,with a bright pink color. I was in desperate need of a replacement and thought I tried this product. The product is nicely made and is tightly woven together to create a study, but effective sponge. It produced a nice lather with my body wash and created a nice exfoliating feel,while cleaning. It was easy to rinse and hang to dry, with the study, attached loop. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good deal on pouf sponges for bathing.</li>
    <li> This set comes with 3 large shower mesh pouf sponges. These poufs aren&#x27;t your typical dollar store poufs. They are large, full and really work up a nice lather. The are soft, yet durable and don&#x27;t fall part whatsoever. I feel lie my skin is getting a gently exfoliation every time I shower. My skin feels soft and clean, never irritated. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> These sponges were not that great took one out of the package and it fell apart in the shower. These are your typical dollar store shower poofs. I definitely would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> So bright! Wow. These sponges are super plush. They hold a later like a rock star. They are pinker than pink. I love them. I also love the fact that you get three in a pack. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Photo is deceptive.  The actual poufs are not &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and fit in the palm of your hand.  Started unraveling after only the third use.  Certainly not worth $10.  NOT a USA-made product, as the ad tries to suggest.</li>
    <li> These are compact, full, soft/firm mesh pouf sponges.  Make an ample amount of bubbles and are comfortable while scrubbing skin.  They are a little more compact than expected but look like they will last and last.  The loop perfectly hangs on the shower faucet handle!</li>
    <li> I love mesh sponges, they provide a much better lather than a wash cloth and it makes me feel cleaner.  I try to replace my sponge every couple of months due to build up and germs, it can be expensive so I began looking for packs of multiples.  I came across this triple pack from Ecoluxuries and thought it was exactly what I needed.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  The sponges are well made, durable and affordable.  I love the bright pink color, it adds a nice pop of color to my bathroom and its a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted cost, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> These three large poufs are fantastic for showers and baths. The material scrubs nicely but feels great. They are easy to soap up and rinse clean. They hang neatly from shower hooks and you can shake them dry. They are easy to compress to take on trips, and the three pack means you can have them anywhere you need them.</li>
    <li> Nice shower poofs, sturdy and look like they&#x27;re built to last, but not too scratchy.  Provide lots of suds, wish there were other colors available, but this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used loofahs like these for as long as I can remember, but I&#x27;ve always stuck with ones that cost a dollar or two because I always figured that a loofah is a loofah and paying extra was just a waste. When I saw this three pack for just a little more per loofah and free prime shipping I figured I&#x27;d give them a shot and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these are a bit bigger than any pouf I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s also softer... almost silky. I was concerned that I&#x27;d need more soap to make it work, but was happy to find that if anything, maybe I didn&#x27;t even need as much soap as usual. The pouf is very luxurious during use, but still works well to exfoliate dead skin and clean wonderfully. My skin felt softer than usual after my shower using my first of these, and once I use these three up, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more! I received a discount in exchange for my honest review; my review is my own and unaffected by the discount.</li>
    <li> Terrible poufs. NOT large at all. Poor quality, rough, loose mesh. A total waste of $10, as there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to torture myself with these every night.</li>
    <li> At a price competitive with most scrunchies at drugstores, these shower mesh poufs are really well made and are great for everyday use and exfoliation without feeling scratchy. They create a lot of bubbles with a small bit of soap and because they&#x27;re tightly packed the soap doesn&#x27;t wash out immediately as you&#x27;re washing.</li>
    <li> Very small and much more rough than it should be.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described - quality made and soft enough to not be abrasive.</li>
    <li> I bought these sponges because they were listed as large mesh shower sponges.  I like the color as they are just as bright in person as they are online.  The size is nice too.  They are not small, but what I feel is the average size of a normal shower &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34;.  They work the same as all the other ones out there as well.  I like that it came in a 3-pack and so far appear very durable.</li>
    <li> I love these shower poufs because they make taking a bath or shower much more enjoyable! First of all, I love the color because it is so vibrant and bright. Second, these are really large poufs and much larger than I was anticipating. This helps ensure there will be a good lather that builds up and allows you to clean your body more quickly and effectively. It also feels great on your skin as it actually feels quite silky. Finally, I love that they come with three of the poufs because you should replace your pouf after awhile so bacteria doesn&#x27;t grow. This will allow me to have two backups and prolong the time before I need to buy new ones. I am so happy with this purchase and will be using these every time I take a shower or bath! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just going to say right away that I am someone who enjoys using a pouf in the shower to wash with. To me, it gets me way cleaner than what a washcloth ever would. I even convinced my husband to start buying his own and he feels the difference too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I buy a pouf, I want it to be soft but rough enough to get the dirt and grime off of my body. With these specific poufs, they totally fit the bill. They are a beautiful shade of pink and do everything I expect them to. It&#x27;s great that they come in a pack like this because you can easily throw your old one out and grab a new one from the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a major pouf lover, I will keep this company in mind for future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for review purposes. All opinions expressed here are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Very nice Quality! These are thick and larger with a nice ribbon loop! Not too soft not too scratchy. Just wish there was more than just pink as we are a big family and would have liked to share with my boys. I received a large discount on this item to give my unbiased honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Extra large is a joke the are the tiniest sponges ever!!!</li>
    <li> Used these for a few weeks an they havnt fallen apart like other bath poofs. Nice and big and excellent for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely, exfoliates, and lathers really nice so you don&#x27;t need to put that much body soap on the sponges.  I like that three comes in a pack.</li>
    <li> Lathers soap well.  Not as tight as some of the better loofa&#x27;s.  For the price I was expecting something a little better than what the dollar store sells for a buck.  I gave 3 stars since it does have the ribbon handle rather than the rope, I feel rope holds more germs as the cotton saturates with water time after time, it can start to smell.</li>
    <li> Large and Luxurious is a bit misleading. Smaller than ones found at other stores.</li>
    <li> I bought these to stock up.  They are much smaller than they look in the photo.  I took one on vacation with me this week.  On the FIRST use in the shower it started to unravel.  I kid you not.  Skip these.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars for the durable &#x27;feel&#x27; otherwise small pouff. I read the description and the reviews before ordering, so I was expecting a luxurious large item. Save your money....they are small!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to unravel, however these are small. So if you are actually looking for &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; this is not it. I included a picture, my hand isn&#x27;t very big. UPDATE: after using this puff I find it to be very abrasive. If it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle I would definitely return.</li>
    <li> I love how this is a 3 pack.  I also love how there is a ribbon holding the pouf versus a rope.  It is tightly packed to give great exfoliation.  I will purchases these again!</li>
    <li> These are not large,  perhaps large for a microscopic being. Fail.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that my husband would like this hot pink pouf, but I love it!  First of all, it is so pink.  I am talking bright, hot pink so it&#x27;s great in my pink retro bathroom.  More importantly, it is exfoliating and really helps the body wash lather.  The hanging loop is handy for drying after use.  I typically run mine through the wash. . .just be sure to catch it before it makes it to the dryer.  This pack includes three poufs, so you could easily wash one and use one of the others while it is drying.  I know, that you can purchase similar items for a lower price, but this an extremely nice, plush pouf and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice shower sponges.</li>
    <li> I love these bath poufs! My biggest problem with poufs is the rope breaks off almost immediately, but the rope on these seems really sturdy.  The color is really vibrant and pretty! It is also bound really tightly so it creates lots of suds and does a great job getting dirt off your body.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how these are different from the ones that cost $1.99? They are not even &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; as described.</li>
