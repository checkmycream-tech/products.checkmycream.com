      <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product, that I panic if I&#x27;m running low and haven&#x27;t ordered a new Juveker!  </li>
      <li>While most do work to an extent, many have cons that far out way their usefulness.</li>
      <li>I really encourage people to try this product for themselves, I am sure you will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>and I can say they are not only priced better the product is better than the others out there.</li>
      <li>I found Juveker a much better and more economical product than it&#x27;s bigger and well-known competitor...</li>
      <li>I love how this product is the only one with fibbers shaped in fine stems.</li>
      <li>Reallu useful..</li>
      <li>answered right way.</li>
      <li>It has a \\&quot;velvety\\&quot; consistency and appears more soft, like real hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
      <li>Takes a little time to get good at applying.</li>
      <li>Am unfortnuate enough to need this product and started with TOPPIK, this in my estimation, works better, is easier and stays put.    </li>
      <li>A+ Packed very well too!</li>
      <li>Balding people will love it as it does make you look younger.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a number of similar products, but I have stuck with this one for more than a year because of the price and quality of the product.</li>
      <li>and I first started using Juveker about 6 months ago.</li>
      <li>The first day I applied it, as I always have with Toppik.  </li>
      <li>I have used other hair fibers before, but for some reason the Juveker dark brown matches my hair the best.</li>
      <li>It is super soft and velvety, as another reviewer put it, and when I touch the top of my head, I can&#x27;t even feel that I put anything on (the same cannot be said of Toppik).  </li>
      <li>Covers the scalp well without clumping and is more economical than other products.</li>
      <li>I had hair transplants about 3 years ago and went from having very little hair on the top of my head to having a lot more but still nowhere near what I thought my $12,000.00 should get for me.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This product is Fantasic because it costs so much less than toppik, it works really good and looks exactly the same in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Well...let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve tried most of the other products on the market for thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I sent off a quick email to the seller and they corrected my order immediately prior to shipment.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with thinning hair like myself.</li>
      <li>by far!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I ever saw keratin fibers actually stick to my hair was with this product.</li>
      <li>At first you may use a lot, so watch for falling hair particles on your back or shoulders.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the problem with my hairline is solved because I can actually use my old toppik spray applicator and get this stuff to stick to my hair instead of it falling and clumping on my scalp so much.</li>
      <li>Makes you stop being self conscious.</li>
      <li>and this really gives you your life back.</li>
      <li>I was too young to have  a bald spot</li>
      <li>It sticks to your natural hair as opposed to just covering your scalp with powder.</li>
      <li>This is a natural fiber product that enhances the look of thinning hair.</li>
      <li>But I think I would rather deal with higher prices and harsher textures than buy something with this much excess mess.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other similar hair enhancement products in the past but finally found a hair enhancement product that I am happy</li>
      <li>But if you place the fibers carefully and tap them down to the scalp, and you avoid putting them on the edges of your hairline (they fall onto your forehead and checks), then you&#x27;ll be satisfied with Juveker.</li>
      <li>The only part I don&#x27;t like is that near the hairline it doesn&#x27;t look as natural.</li>
      <li>After going into the Dr&#x27;s office at month 9 it was very apparent that they had done a lot</li>
      <li>All told, it takes me an extra 5-10 minutes just to clean up the mess.    </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to other women.</li>
      <li>Makes the countertop alittle dusty but wipes off easily</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I found Juveker a much better and more economical product than it&#x27;s bigger and well-known competitor...by far!  It really does an excellent job for women&#x27;s thinning hair esp. on top of head.  It has a \\&quot;velvety\\&quot; consistency and appears more soft, like real hair.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  I&#x27;d pay any price to cover my thinning scalp so I don&#x27;t recommend this just because it&#x27;s cheaper that others, but because it&#x27;s a GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I will reorder this item.</li>
    <li> This product is Fantasic because it costs so much less than toppik, it works really good and looks exactly the same in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Good for what it does. Takes a little time to get good at applying. At first you may use a lot, so watch for falling hair particles on your back or shoulders. This could lead to embarrassing consequences.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, I order it all the time and people do not know that I even use it, it works so well.  I really encourage people to try this product for themselves, I am sure you will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I had hair transplants about 3 years ago and went from having very little hair on the top of my head to having a lot more but still nowhere near what I thought my $12,000.00 should get for me.  After going into the Dr&#x27;s office at month 9 it was very apparent that they had done a lot but I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied. That&#x27;s when they pulled out the Toppik and I had the head of hair that I always wanted. The only problem that I found was that I tend to sweat alot on my forhead and I was having issues with toppik clumping and having a distinctive line in my hairline so I started looking at different products. I bought juveker afer trying xfusion which is basically cheaper toppik from the same manufacturer but distributed under a different label. I was happy from day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ever saw keratin fibers actually stick to my hair was with this product. I keep my hair very short. Right now it&#x27;s about 3/4 of an inch on top. Even though a lot of this product is sitting on my scalp in the thinner areas it is still invisible to the naked eye because the hair fibers are sticking to my hair so well. I don&#x27;t think there is any product that I would ever call perfect, but this stuff has done a great job for about a third of the price of toppik...Oh, and the problem with my hairline is solved because I can actually use my old toppik spray applicator and get this stuff to stick to my hair instead of it falling and clumping on my scalp so much. I love this product and you will too.</li>
    <li> I have tried other similar hair enhancement products in the past but finally found a hair enhancement product that I am happy with.&lt;br /&gt;I have been ordering Juveker Karatin for the last two years.  It is so easy to order and customer service is the best.  I can always call and get questions answered right way. I would highly recommend this product! Don&#x27;t leave home without it, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I am a woman with a bald patch and I first started using Juveker about 6 months ago. It&#x27;s a total transformation. I would highly recommend it to other women. I have used other hair fibers before, but for some reason the Juveker dark brown matches my hair the best.</li>
    <li> Well...let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve tried most of the other products on the market for thinning hair. While most do work to an extent, many have cons that far out way their usefulness. Some itch like crazy, while other clump up, and then there are those that simply don&#x27;t match the hair color they are made for. Juveker has changed my mind about using a concealer...it actually does what it says it will do!! It&#x27;s definitely a breath of fresh air in the world of hair loss concealers and have made me a very happy customer. Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> Covers the scalp well without clumping and is more economical than other products. Makes the countertop alittle dusty but wipes off easily</li>
    <li> Am unfortnuate enough to need this product and started with TOPPIK, this in my estimation, works better, is easier and stays put.    LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Super hairdresser&#x27;s secret for thinning hair! Makes a big difference in appearance if you suffer from thin hair- you must give it a try!</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with the product. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it especially if  there are no shipping charges..</li>
    <li> The price is the best of the static hair fibers.  However, I find the fibers don&#x27;t have quite as much static as Topik and the fibers are sometimes a little clumpy.  But if you place the fibers carefully and tap them down to the scalp, and you avoid putting them on the edges of your hairline (they fall onto your forehead and checks), then you&#x27;ll be satisfied with Juveker.</li>
    <li> The plus side to this stuff is the texture.  It is super soft and velvety, as another reviewer put it, and when I touch the top of my head, I can&#x27;t even feel that I put anything on (the same cannot be said of Toppik).  Also, unlike Toppik, when the water hits this stuff it stays black, not green.    But my goodwill toward this product ends there.  The first day I applied it, as I always have with Toppik.  Then I combed through my hair, and watched in horror as clumps of the stuff began falling off my comb onto my shoulders and the floor.  I almost ran to my computer right then to write a scathing review, but decided I must have done something wrong and held off.    The next day, I tried patting my hair afterward, as the instructions say.  It still clumped afterward.  The following day I patted harder and only succeeded in wiping the stuff off my scalp entirely.  All told, it takes me an extra 5-10 minutes just to clean up the mess.    Before anyone comes back with \\&quot;You&#x27;re using too much!\\&quot; let it be known that I use no more than I ever have with Toppik, and have NEVER had such a problem with that product.  And I&#x27;m not fully happy with that product, either, or else I wouldn&#x27;t be trying so many alternatives.  But I think I would rather deal with higher prices and harsher textures than buy something with this much excess mess.  Every time I look in the sink, I see my money swirling down the drain with all that wasted product!</li>

    <li> I have been using there product for the last 6 months and I can say they are not only priced better the product is better than the others out there. A customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;Mark M.</li>
    <li> Good product- covers very well.  The only part I don&#x27;t like is that near the hairline it doesn&#x27;t look as natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past three years.  My hair is thinning especially if I make a part in my hair.  This covers the bald area very nicely.  I am very happy with this product, that I panic if I&#x27;m running low and haven&#x27;t ordered a new Juveker!  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with thinning hair like myself. My hairdresser applies it after the curling of my hair but before the teasing and it does a wonderful job of making my hair look thicker and keeps my scalp from showing through my hairdo. Only con is being careful not to get any on my face or ears but it does easliy come off with a damp cloth. The seller on this product was great as well. The order was prompt and I even made a mistake on my oder by purchasing the wrong shade. I sent off a quick email to the seller and they corrected my order immediately prior to shipment.</li>
    <li> Reallu useful.. My husband loves it</li>
    <li> Hello, just wanted to say i love this product. Price is great highly recommend. I tried another brand but this is way better.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair building fibers. I have been using for a long time now and this really gives you your life back. What do I mean by that, well it just makes you feel young again. Makes you stop being self conscious. I was too young to have  a bald spot and now I don&#x27;t. Thanks</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!!!! Fast shipping great communication, is as advertised.... A+ Packed very well too! I keep getting it because its not only the best its the best price!</li>
    <li> This is a natural fiber product that enhances the look of thinning hair. It literally disguises &amp; camouflages the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;An amazing product!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great value.  Balding people will love it as it does make you look younger.  Better than competitors too.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> I love how this product is the only one with fibbers shaped in fine stems. It sticks to your natural hair as opposed to just covering your scalp with powder. A MUST TRY!</li>
