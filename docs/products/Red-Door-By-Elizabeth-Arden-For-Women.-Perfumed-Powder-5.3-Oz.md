      <li>Love perfumed talc!</li>
      <li>Now they have their own and</li>
      <li>However, the fragrance was very nice and the powder felt pleasant and soothing in my neck and shoulders and arms when used very sparingly.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of the powder.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>She was extremely pleased witht he powder.</li>
      <li>It smells  good at first and then goes to a chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>Amazon has the best prices &amp; the delivery is faster than any other in my opinion:)</li>
      <li>The powder helps you keep that wonderful aroma going all day long!!!  </li>
      <li>Light and fragrant.</li>
      <li>Guess mothers can be right on many an occasion.</li>
      <li>If anyone wants a powder that smells good,  layers nicely and leaves a light shimmer on their skin, Red Door is it!  </li>
      <li>This Xmas I decided to orders the powder and lotion to layer the fragrance after a shower for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>It makes you smell fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I have loved this scent for a very long time.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!  </li>
      <li>It not only has a pleasant and subtle scent, but it brings back very wonderful memories of how much my mother had enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>Perfect for layering with your other Red Door products.</li>
      <li>They always loved the way it smelled on their mother and would sometimes borrow a little bit of it when they were growing up.</li>
      <li>While it definitely was unlike my daughter&#x27;s favorite, she thought it would be something I would like</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve worn red door for many years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased both sizes but prefer the 5.3 larger just out of greed for more.  </li>
      <li>and she told me that it isn&#x27;t always easy to find locally....</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance I remember but then, to be fair, it has been a long time since I had the cologne (as in years).</li>
      <li>When I saw this larger size available I jumped on it.  </li>
      <li>My daughter, in another part of the country, noticed a particular scent on a women in a store.</li>
      <li>At family get togethers, the fragrance of Red Door is a little prominent because now the grand daughters are into that same borrowing tradition.</li>
      <li>just doesn&#x27;t seem like what I normally buy.</li>
      <li>I bought one of these for each of my three adult daughters for Christmas.</li>
      <li>Item exactly what I expected, delivered in timely, pristine manner.</li>

    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been buying this for years.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for a very long time. I like to use powders during the warmer months - this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love perfumed talc! Item exactly what I expected, delivered in timely, pristine manner.</li>
    <li> I keep this bath powder on hand at all times. It is not as overpowering as perfume. The wonderful rosey smell stays for hours.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how this powder works or feels, because I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t use such things. I can say, however, that it made a wonderful gift, and the lady I purchased it for loves it. That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Red Door dusting powder is very hard to find at the stores.  When I saw this larger size available I jumped on it.  It&#x27;s a gift for my daughter (which she requested) for christmas and of course, had to purchase one for myself.  Very happy....</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the powder. The one thing I can&#x27;t figure out is: how do you open/use it?? are you supposed to cut into the box? or peel off the bottom?</li>
    <li> When you dust your body with this fragrance after your shower...the fragrance lingers with you the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> not the same smell from what I&#x27;ve used for years and I&#x27;ve worn red door for many years just doesn&#x27;t seem like what I normally buy.</li>
    <li> This perfumed body powder smells very nice!! I love it. I&#x27;ll recommend this product and this seller. Excellent transaction, quick shippment. Thanks!!  Isabel  Naples, Fl</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance I remember but then, to be fair, it has been a long time since I had the cologne (as in years).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chanel #5 for years, and I still prefer it to Red Door.</li>
    <li> This all came about in an uncanny way. My daughter, in another part of the country, noticed a particular scent on a women in a store. She complimented her and asked what it was. While it definitely was unlike my daughter&#x27;s favorite, she thought it would be something I would like so she told me about it. To her surprise I reminded her that my Mom used to laud Elizabeth Arden products and particularly Red Door, years ago when I was a child. I thought it was silly then but when my daughter called it to my attention I ordered it and I am so glad I did. It not only has a pleasant and subtle scent, but it brings back very wonderful memories of how much my mother had enjoyed it. She always told me Elizabeth Arden products were excellent. Guess mothers can be right on many an occasion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my BFF - She ONLY wears Red Door Perfumed Power and she told me that it isn&#x27;t always easy to find locally....She was extremely pleased witht he powder.</li>
    <li> The powder helps you keep that wonderful aroma going all day long!!!  Give it a try, you will love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for layering with your other Red Door products. Light and fragrant.</li>

I&#x27;ve purchased both sizes but prefer the 5.3 larger just out of greed for more.  Amazon has the best prices &amp; the delivery is faster than any other in my opinion:)</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my Mom for Christmas.  She really loves using perfumed bath powder, and this one smells very good.</li>
    <li> i love everything elizabeth arden. this was no exception. i would reccomend this product to all i know. just great</li>
    <li> Red Door is my choice for all occasions I decide to wear s fragrance.  This Xmas I decided to orders the powder and lotion to layer the fragrance after a shower for special occasions.  I found it difficult to open the lid of the container and not waste too much of the powder spilling out.  However, the fragrance was very nice and the powder felt pleasant and soothing in my neck and shoulders and arms when used very sparingly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!! It makes you smell fresh and clean. It came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> The fragrance  fades and even smells bad. Not the same product i got in the department  store . It smells  good at first and then goes to a chemical smell.  Wont buy it again online</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for each of my three adult daughters for Christmas. They always loved the way it smelled on their mother and would sometimes borrow a little bit of it when they were growing up. Now they have their own and my wife&#x27;s powder lasts a little longer. At family get togethers, the fragrance of Red Door is a little prominent because now the grand daughters are into that same borrowing tradition. It&#x27;s all a good thing, though.</li>
