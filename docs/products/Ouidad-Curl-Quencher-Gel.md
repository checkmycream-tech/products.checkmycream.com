      <li>Ouidad had a great deal on a set of Curl Quencher products that included an 8.5 oz bottle of the gel.  </li>

      <li>A great gel for curly hair.</li>

      <li>: I also re-purchased the Climate Control Gel and that one really is great for my hair type.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>but when I know my hair needs to look good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a good product</li>
      <li>Some days it works better than others, but it also smells great.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>I decided to give Ouidad another try as I always liked her Climate Control Gel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, consistent and looks great.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good deal you will get your money worth.</li>
      <li>It is nice and light on your hair.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite gel for my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried everything out there, this product is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I have used many, many products throughout my 35 years.</li>
      <li>which is what most gels out there will do.</li>
      <li>, that had been in pretty good shape with the products I was using before.</li>
      <li>I love how light it is</li>
      <li>I find that shampoo + conditioner makes a huge difference, too.</li>
      <li>After 2 years going the suflate/silicone free route, I started using silicones again.  </li>
      <li>I mix it with a drop or two of hair oil to keep my hair frizz free.</li>
      <li>Smells great but seems to leave my hair dry.  </li>
      <li>and I use a special shampoo &amp; conditioner for curly hair specifically</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly too</li>
      <li>I am currently let my hair grow, and the curl quencher is excellent for taming my big hair and frizziness.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind a mild crunch factor, so I like this product.</li>
      <li>I was spectacle at first, but this gel is a miracle!</li>
      <li>If you want something that really works, use Khiel&#x27;s cream with Silk Groom and a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>My favorite product thus far.</li>
      <li>I get far better results with my $3.50 bottle of LA Looks Sports Gel.  </li>
      <li>It has great hold with out leaving my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>Although I like Ouidad, the moisture factor will mostly likely lead me to Jane&#x27;s product more often.</li>
      <li>I have really curly hair and have tried everything under the sun!</li>
      <li>I like it more than Oidad&#x27;s humidity and moisture control similar product</li>
      <li>The downside is that your hair will be more dry than with the Jane Carter Curl cream, which I tried after Ouidad.</li>
      <li>but it seems to dry out my hair more than I remember.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic on super curly dry hair!!!  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>Holds curls VERY WELL.</li>
      <li>I really like their gel, it does work and hold curls</li>
      <li>I have really curly hair</li>
      <li>It really holds too.  </li>
      <li>because I find that my curls look really defined that way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also had pretty good success just simply spraying a mix of water, salt, almond or jojoba oil and scented essential oils in my hair after showering and letting it air dry.</li>
      <li>I love it and plan on trying other products by Ouidad.</li>
      <li>As a newbie to the natural approach, this product was the first one I tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve lately been using DevaCare for washing/conditioning (which rock!), but was lacking a good get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product comes highly recommended.</li>
      <li>but the price is so high.</li>
      <li>I went to a new salon where they used it</li>
      <li>Maybe because its 2 main ingredients are water and alcohol, this gel leaves my naturally wavy hair helplessly frizzy.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a light gel with hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard this is the right product.  </li>
      <li>and it was the first time in 30 years my hair wasn&#x27;t a total disaster.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to any one that has natural, curly, or kinky hair that&#x27;s trying to control the curl and puffiness.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>gel keeps your curls together and soft.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curl hair.</li>
      <li>It stays styled and soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>While it leaves hair very soft, it does not have enough hold.  </li>
      <li>Works okay but hate the strong smell - way too perfumed for me.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of this product but found this last purchase to be a little different and disappointing.  It&#x27;s still a good product but it seems to dry out my hair more than I remember.</li>
    <li> As a newbie to the natural approach, this product was the first one I tried. I don&#x27;t mind a mild crunch factor, so I like this product. The curls come forth, and my hair has a defined wet-look. The downside is that your hair will be more dry than with the Jane Carter Curl cream, which I tried after Ouidad. Although I like Ouidad, the moisture factor will mostly likely lead me to Jane&#x27;s product more often.</li>
    <li> Maybe because its 2 main ingredients are water and alcohol, this gel leaves my naturally wavy hair helplessly frizzy.  In the beginning I thought I was not using enough product so I slathered up on my hair section by section.  It left my hair stiff like any other hair gel would. If I have to pay $22, I expect the product to work much better than my $3 Herbal Essence Totally Twisted Gel.  This Ouidad gel is a disappointment.  It doesn&#x27;t do any \\&quot;quenching\\&quot; thing and it doesn&#x27;t even define curls as well as a drugstore product. I get much better result with the Totally Twisted Gel with less amount of gel.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair any worse.  It just doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have out of control unpredictable curly hair. I went to a new salon where they used it and it was the first time in 30 years my hair wasn&#x27;t a total disaster. I have to say I hate spending a lot of money on hair products, but this is 100% worth it. It&#x27;s lightweight, consistent and looks great. The price is a bit of a challenge so I intersperse my days with mousse and gels, etc but when I know my hair needs to look good I know I can rely on ouidad!</li>
    <li> Works fantastic on super curly dry hair!!!  Awesome</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for years. It is the only curly-hair product that does not create that crunchy, stiff curl. It allows my curls to move and bounce. This product comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year &amp; like it. I wrap my hair in a towel for a few minutes after the shower. Then I wet my hands thoroughly and put a dime-sized dollop in one hand, rub it in my wet hands to dilute, then apply to the underside and then outside of my hair, scunching it up. Then I just let my hair air dry.   My hair is thin but wavy with some ringlet action. I haven&#x27;t had much success with other curl products, but I may try the Herbal Essences one mentioned in the reviews here, because this Ouidad stuff is expensive.  I find that shampoo + conditioner makes a huge difference, too. I use Giovanni tea tree shampoo + conditioner. And lately I&#x27;ve been applying, in rotation, 3 deeper conditioning products just to the ends of my hair for a couple of minutes: Chi Organics Olive Nutrient Therapy Conditioner, Chi Organics Olive Treatment Paste, and Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Masque (the first 2 I bought as they were far less expensive than the third and smelled and felt the same). All 3 work well.  Lately, I&#x27;ve also been applying a bit of essential oil mix to my hair just after the Ouidad stuff. It increases the curls but does leave me with a greasier look. Or a wet look, I guess.     I&#x27;ve also had pretty good success just simply spraying a mix of water, salt, almond or jojoba oil and scented essential oils in my hair after showering and letting it air dry. Some days it works better than others, but it also smells great. And it&#x27;s inexpensive. When I travel abroad, I put all except the water into a spritzer and then fill it when I land. Then empty before I leave. No hassles.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for my curly hair! The only time is doesn&#x27;t work is when I don&#x27;t use enough of it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and I will be buying again. I have really curly hair and it tames my frizz amazingly!!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair. I have used many, many products throughout my 35 years. This product is wonderful for keeping the frizz under control and defining curls. I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gel for my curly hair.  I mix it with a drop or two of hair oil to keep my hair frizz free.</li>
    <li> The only gel I use on my coarse, curly hair!</li>
    <li> I was spectacle at first, but this gel is a miracle! I have really curly hair and have tried everything under the sun! I&#x27;ve lately been using DevaCare for washing/conditioning (which rock!), but was lacking a good get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel keeps your curls together and soft. I&#x27;m sold; this will be my gel for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This gel keeps my hair from getting too unruly.</li>
    <li> Smells great but seems to leave my hair dry.  Holds curls VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really like their gel, it does work and hold curls but the price is so high. I&#x27;m going to give Frizz Ease another chance. If you can constantly afford to pay the price it&#x27;s a good deal you will get your money worth.</li>
    <li> this hair product works well for curly/wavy hair. I like it more than Oidad&#x27;s humidity and moisture control similar product</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I have tried everything out there, this product is fantastic! I do combine it with one other item and I use a special shampoo &amp; conditioner for curly hair specifically but this product finishes off my look. It has great hold with out leaving my hair stiff or sticky. It&#x27;s not your typical gel because it keeps my curls soft and bouncy not still or crunchy which is what most gels out there will do. There is no frizz and my hair has never looked so good!!!</li>
    <li> Love! Love!  Love! This product. I have naturally curl hair. I am currently let my hair grow, and the curl quencher is excellent for taming my big hair and frizziness. I would recommend this product to any one that has natural, curly, or kinky hair that&#x27;s trying to control the curl and puffiness.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a light gel with hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard this is the right product.  I have curly hair and this gel keeps my hair from being frizzy without weighing my hair down.  I love it and plan on trying other products by Ouidad.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only product that controls my hair without making it hard. My favorite product thus far. Shipped quickly too</li>
    <li> This is the softest gel for my hair out there.  It really holds too.  Even my husband uses this as regular gel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or crunchy when it dries.  I found it to hold well and could be refreshed the next day with a little water.  Pleasant smell.  A great gel for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been a Ouidad user off and on for about 14 years.  After 2 years going the suflate/silicone free route, I started using silicones again.  I decided to give Ouidad another try as I always liked her Climate Control Gel.  Ouidad had a great deal on a set of Curl Quencher products that included an 8.5 oz bottle of the gel.  The gel is not great for me.  While it leaves hair very soft, it does not have enough hold.  My hair gets fluffy and poofy with it.  I get far better results with my $3.50 bottle of LA Looks Sports Gel.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Note: I also re-purchased the Climate Control Gel and that one really is great for my hair type.  I like it best when I add a touch of LA Looks Sports Gel (2 parts Climate Control to 1 part LA Looks Sports Gel) because I find that my curls look really defined that way.  Climate Control Gel by itself leaves me with stringlets.  For tightly coiled hair, Climate Control is the way to go.]</li>
    <li> Works okay but hate the strong smell - way too perfumed for me.</li>
    <li> I love how light it is</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago. I have curly hair, that had been in pretty good shape with the products I was using before. Someone gave me this product as a gift, and I have to say my hair has never been in worse condition. It&#x27;s so dry. It looks great, but if you touch it it feels like straw. You should not put alcohol-based products in curly hair, ever.  If you want something that really works, use Khiel&#x27;s cream with Silk Groom and a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Results look great on my hair. But I always break out in a fungus on my fingers whenever I use it. So sad cuz it is difficult to find the perfect product for your hair. Ah, well. I have to discontinue using it. and I cannot recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. what&#x27;s in that stuff that causes fungus?</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is nice and light on your hair. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Love it! Hair does not feel stiff. It stays styled and soft to the touch. Would buy again.</li>
