      <li>Not as soft and squishy as i&#x27;d like, but still good!</li>
      <li>they do not cover make up smoothly.</li>

      <li>Def worth the investment to try these!</li>
      <li>So if you want to use the sponge for both foundation and blush, I would recommend buying more than one sponge and dedicating each to a specific color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Blend so much better than traditional sponges.</li>
      <li>So if you want to use the sponge for both foundation and blush, I would recommend buying more than one sponge and dedicating each to a specific color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suspected it might be just a gimmick and likely not to work any better than a finger.</li>
      <li>One end of it rounded and is used on large areas and one end is pointy to reach into corners (around the hose or eyes).</li>
      <li>This came in right on time, they aren&#x27;t stiff and they&#x27;re very easy to use on the face.</li>
      <li>These bode very well with my cream foundation.</li>
      <li>it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do as far as beauty blender go.</li>
      <li>use it you need to wet the sponge in warm water until totally saturated.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>the ones that she had were worn out and needed new one that did not cost a arm and a leg</li>
      <li>The first photo is the sponge in its container when I just purchased it, the second photo is the same sponge on top of the container (as it no longer fits into the previous shape).</li>
      <li>The sponge take several days to go back to its original size (when it is totally dry, so if you use it every day it does not go back to the original size).</li>
      <li>These are really soft.</li>
      <li>am attaching a couple of photos of the sponge before and after use as the sponge surprised me by growing.</li>
      <li>However using a sponge blender the foundation is totally smooth even if my skin has an uneven surface.</li>
      <li>Before purchasing I was using my fingers to apply...this way is far easier and cleaner.</li>
      <li>But I was surprised by how well this thing worked.</li>
      <li>These are not the same material as the normal blenders.</li>
      <li>(not sure if it is true or not).</li>

<ol>
    <li> Works better than my mac brushes!</li>
    <li> These are really soft. Great buy</li>
    <li> I ordered these because a friend had given me a similar sponge to use with my makeup. I like the durability of these sponges. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This came in right on time, they aren&#x27;t stiff and they&#x27;re very easy to use on the face.</li>
    <li> the ones that she had were worn out and needed new one that did not cost a arm and a leg</li>
    <li> These are not the same material as the normal blenders. They are not porous and instead are a sleeker synthetic material, almost like a bean bag chair/toy. They do increase in size and blend makeup but definitely not as well as the gold standard of blenders. I use these now to fix my makeup mistakes - keep it dry and swipe off any excess blush, bronzer, or foundation!</li>
    <li> Not as soft and squishy as i&#x27;d like, but still good!</li>
    <li> Love these. Blend so much better than traditional sponges. Yay,  no more lines!!! Def worth the investment to try these!</li>
    <li> Love love love! ! Great finish and perfected tone!little blessing in a package. I&#x27;m VERY happy with this purchase! Great</li>
    <li> Before I&#x27;ve got this, I&#x27;ve used brushes to put my foundation/concealer on. Now that I have these, I don&#x27;t ever want to go back! It feels so nice when they&#x27;re cold and damp when you apply your make up. It leaves a dewy finish, which is what I want. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks like brushes do either. It gives more of an even finish which is a plus.</li>
    <li> The sponges are just O.K. they do not cover make up smoothly. I will not order these sponges again goodby.</li>
    <li> waste to much makeup for me.</li>
    <li> They are a great substitute for the $20 sponges!</li>
    <li> works perfectly! its reallyyy good and blends well. it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do as far as beauty blender go.</li>
    <li> Works well but is falling apart and shedding on my face after 4 months of use</li>
    <li> Awesome. Love these sponges!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3K8TPYY4AG1TG]]I used to use my finger to apply foundation or concealer. About a year ago I bought this sponge in a local store because it was on sale and I decided to try it. I suspected it might be just a gimmick and likely not to work any better than a finger. But I was surprised by how well this thing worked. When I apply make up with my finger it often leaves a somewhat uneven finish especially if what I am trying to conceal has an uneven surface, like a pimple. I can see this unevenness in my make-up magnifying mirror, and I used to tell myself that no one else can see it without a magnifying glass (not sure if it is true or not). However using a sponge blender the foundation is totally smooth even if my skin has an uneven surface. Even in my magnifying mirror I cannot see anything but a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a couple of photos of the sponge before and after use as the sponge surprised me by growing. The first photo is the sponge in its container when I just purchased it, the second photo is the same sponge on top of the container (as it no longer fits into the previous shape). The sponge take several days to go back to its original size (when it is totally dry, so if you use it every day it does not go back to the original size). The third photo is the sponge in my hand for relative size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge can be used on cosmetics that are wet or dry. One end of it rounded and is used on large areas and one end is pointy to reach into corners (around the hose or eyes). It is made out of non-latex polymer, it feel spongy and resilient, and the finish reminded me of suede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it you need to wet the sponge in warm water until totally saturated. Then squeeze excess water until it is just slightly damp. The sponge expanded as it became wet. The instructions said to put makeup on the sponge and then apply. I also tried putting on the face first and then using the sponge. Both approaches work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge picks up the color of your make up. The color does not come off even after I washed it. So if you want to use the sponge for both foundation and blush, I would recommend buying more than one sponge and dedicating each to a specific color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge exceeded my expectations.  A year later I am still using the same sponge, it is quite durable. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewonge picks up the color of your make up.

    <li> These bode very well with my cream foundation. Before purchasing I was using my fingers to apply...this way is far easier and cleaner. These sponges apply well and blend well. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Great dupe for the beauty blender at a fraction of the price! Great for putting on make up for a flawless nude skin look also less product</li>
