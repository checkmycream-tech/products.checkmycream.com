<li> not many products are made for the whole eye area.</li>
<li> and I use it on my orbital bone and completely under the eyes, including sweeping down onto the tops of my cheekbones.</li>

<li> I find that this trades puffy, wrinkly eyes for irritated, dry flakey-skined eyes.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
<li> The reason I keep using it is because it makes my eyes look a lot younger and seemed to even reduce dark circles.</li>
<li> While the product is pricey, I think it will last a while as I only have to use a small amount.  </li>
<li> but this one did not perform as expected.  </li>
<li> use it also on my lips, when they&#x27;re feeling a little rough.</li>
<li> This product did help to lighten my dark circles but it made my eyes puffy underneath.</li>
<li> It did nothing for dark circles, I cannot find a product that will help my dark circles.</li>
<li> and I found my skin (under eye)burned slightly after two days of using.</li>
<li> It is a little pricey</li>
<li> Product is not better than any other product were is cheaper</li>
<li> , not sure yet if it is working on my under eyes.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is very expensive &amp; only get .5 oz</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement unfortunately.</li>
<li> Buy it you will not be sorry!</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t help those either :(</li>
<li> Causses horrible irritation and swelling under the eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I actually love this product. After using for a few weeks I have some light peeling around my eyes which I had wanted using a retinol product. After all the top skin needs to come off to reveal better skin. Not harsh. It is not very strong or else the light peeling would have started sooner.</li>
    <li> Causses horrible irritation and swelling under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I use this every day under my eye moisturizer. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This is a serum NOT a moisturiser! Use it in tandem under eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have consistently re-purchased this product, along with Alpha-Beta Peels (I HIGHLY recommend the peels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it also on my lips, when they&#x27;re feeling a little rough. It smoothes skin -- please again note: it&#x27;s not adding emollience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, it&#x27;s meant for eyes and I use it on my orbital bone and completely under the eyes, including sweeping down onto the tops of my cheekbones. My skin shines, it&#x27;s so smooth and lessens fine lines. Use it as it&#x27;s intended as a serum, not for moisture.</li>
    <li> Beware, I read all of the reviews before purchasing this product and thought I would give it a try.  I take really good care of my skin but had not tried any of Dr. D. Gross&#x27;s products.  After using this under the eyes for two weeks I have now noticed an unusual strange discoloration under both eyes.  I also agree with the reviewer who said the product does cause dryness.  I&#x27;m going to see my aesthetician to see if anything can be done about the discoloration.  In the trash it goes.</li>
    <li> This has helped the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Simply the best.. If you are concerned about your eye area aging, especially the lids please try this product. not many products are made for the whole eye area. This one is. tremendous improvement. I also use the Dr. Dennis gross Alpha Beta wipes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous product goes on so easily and gives amazing results. I will definitely be buying more</li>
    <li> I have used other products by Dr Gross but this one did not perform as expected.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Excellent primer for the eye area. I follow with an eye cream and the combination works well for my dark circles and fine lines.</li>
    <li> Did the company change the formula? This is my third bottle and I found my skin (under eye)burned slightly after two days of using. I&#x27;m returning this.</li>
    <li> Smell and feel are great, not sure yet if it is working on my under eyes.</li>
    <li> way too drying, i had to return it after one use!</li>
    <li> Product is not better than any other product were is cheaper</li>
    <li> I wish Dennis Gross would price it&#x27;s products more reasonable. I wish they sold this formula in a bigger container/pump, because there is no reason this would only be good for the eye area, it is good for your whole face.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, I have been using it for over two weeks now. No results at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about 2  years.  I am almost 69 yrs &amp; Do Not have any lines or wrinkles, thank God.&lt;br /&gt;It is very expensive &amp; only get .5 oz....however, I only use it once a day &amp; it lasts for about 5 mos.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Strivectin HD cream on my face &amp; have no lines or wrinkles plus a clairsonic ....</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement unfortunately.</li>
    <li> My face looks amazing with only two weeks of use.  I&#x27;ll use this product for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
    <li> Excellent results.  Non-irritating.</li>
    <li> This product is OK. Made skin around my eyes tight and eliminating any fine lines. It did nothing for dark circles, I cannot find a product that will help my dark circles. If anyone know a any products, please let me know!</li>
    <li> Excellent serum for delicate eye area, especially for more mature skin. Smooths and gently firms.</li>
    <li> This really works great!  I will purchase again.  Great product, very pleased!  Lease do not change it!  Buy it you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> This product works for me! I am 65 yrs old &amp; it does help the crepiness under my eyes &amp; makes it easy to put on concealer.i use it as directed.</li>
    <li> I find that this trades puffy, wrinkly eyes for irritated, dry flakey-skined eyes. Product did not help much around eyes. I tried using it on my smile lines as well and it didn&#x27;t help those either :(</li>
    <li> 38 years old.  Have been struggling with aging lines and eye bags.  Really saw a huge improvement with this product.  Definately recommend.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months.  Saw improvements the first week, and it has continued to work even after a late night of partying.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> The eye serum is the first product that really works. I found that it takes a couple of months to smooth out  lines under my eyes. Won\\&quot;t go a day  with out it.</li>
    <li> Good texture and abosorbed easily.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is easy to travel with around.&lt;br /&gt;Tighten the skin around the eyes so i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and so far I&#x27;m VERY happy with it.  I generally use it twice a day, and I have noticed a significant difference in the lines under my eyes.  I have not had any problems with peeling or irritation at all.  I had previously purchased this product at Sephora...and paid about $20 more for it there.  While the product is pricey, I think it will last a while as I only have to use a small amount.  But, if it works, it&#x27;s well worth the price.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product rocks! It works right away. I do seem to get a bit puffy under one eye-I think it irritates my skin. The reason I keep using it is because it makes my eyes look a lot younger and seemed to even reduce dark circles. Definitely helped crows feet too. It is a little pricey but I will keep ordering it. I wish they had a subscription through subscribe &amp; save. Dennis Gross products, frownies, Roc and Sub D are my favorites. It&#x27;s cheaper than botox...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to under eyes milia  and wanted something with retinol to combat it, this product got rid of it within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Once again, I purchased a product for the puffiness under my eyes. This didn&#x27;t work either. My puffiness is not extreme, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any product that works.  I just purchased a DHS product, and after one use it seems to be working.  I will keep using it for now.</li>
    <li> This product just burned the delicate skin under my eyes, even with light use.  Maybe it works for some, but not me.</li>
    <li> This product did help to lighten my dark circles but it made my eyes puffy underneath.</li>
    <li> Great delivery time. Great product. Would definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Puffiness is gone!!!  doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> I love most all dr. Dennis Gross products, especially the alpha beta face peel.  I have sensitive skin and am allergic to most brands but not these!</li>
