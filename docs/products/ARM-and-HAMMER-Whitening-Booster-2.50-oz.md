<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice a change</li>
    <li> A very good an effective way to brighten up ones smile. Simply apply an amount approximately equal to the amount of toothpaste on your brush and brush away. It does not cause any extra sensitivity to teeth and gums, it allows you to whiten up all of your teeth rather than only the front teeth like the trays and strips, and it&#x27;s relatively flavorless. I usually use it in conjunction with a whitening rinse (supersmile, rembrandt, crest or colgate) twice a day and it produces the same results as a standard 14 day whitening kit without the hassle of tooth sensitivity or having to have something stuck in your mouth for an hour a day. The only drawback is that after a couple of days not using it, your teeth do gradually return to their original shade. But if you can incorporate it into daily use it&#x27;s a complication free tooth whitener. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth and whitening is usually a painful process.  I have been using this stuff daily for months and have no sensitivity at all and I get compliments on my teeth all the time.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink tea or coffee, so this had no effect on my teeth. I want them whiter, I don&#x27;t need stains removed. If your teeth are stained, this might work for you to get to get your teeth back to their natural state. But if your teeth are at their natural state, and you want them whiter, try something else.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff.  It works wonders on my coffee stained teeth, but be careful and don&#x27;t use it too long at a time.  I would recommend this to anyone.  And the Amazon service to ship it every so often is great.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I use it with A&amp;H toothpaste.  Even my hygenist comments on how white my teeth are &amp; the good condition of the enamel.  I&#x27;m over 60 so that&#x27;s really a compliment.  Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I love using this in combination with my regular toothpaste, as instructed. Noticeable improvement without making a significant change in your routine. Simple and doesn&#x27;t hurt your teeth.</li>
    <li> This is much cheaper and simpler to use than white strips.  Just add to toothpaste 2 times a day.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. My husband noticed my teeth being a lot whiter after 3 days of use. I think this works better than Crest Whitestrips and they&#x27;re definitely cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is easy to use -- just put it right on top of your toothpaste.  I find that it really keeps my teeth white and is so much better and more convenient than using those messy strips.  This was recommended to me by a friend, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  So it&#x27;s great that amazon.com carries this product.  I have reordered it several times.</li>
    <li> The pack I bought had two inside. The first one worked OK, I guess. I didn&#x27;t see my teeth turn exceptionally white and glisten. The second one, when I opened it, was complete liquid and unusable. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This does not taste very good at all. I honestly expected to get something a little less packed full of stuff. I will most likely just be tossing this stuff out. It tingles my gums and teeth too. Don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for something more natural and less gross tasting.</li>
    <li> if you have sensitive, and want whiter teeth, this is for you. I&#x27;ve been using for several years, but only at night. glad to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I used for a couple months and maybe noticed the slightest difference... Nothing noticeable</li>
    <li> Cant find this in the stores anymore, I love this.  Works quickly, just add a little to your toothpaste once a day.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> Was so glad to see you could order this on-line. It is so difficult to find in stores. Order enough to last a while and also for my sister who uses it too!</li>
    <li> My teeth were noticeably whiter within a week as advertised. I get compliments all the time. Now I only use the product once a week or every 2 weeks to maintain the whiteness.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it. I had stains on my teeth from the love of drinking black tea but this has taken ALL OF THEM OUT!!! I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I brush every morning with a wet toothbrush dipped in a box of baking soda and this gel squeezed on top.  Fresh and clean and helps keep my smile white.</li>
    <li> Use this once a day by putting a thin line on top of my toothpaste. Using it daily it prevents coffee stained teeth. The old packaging was a hard bottle that you had to rap on the counter to get the thick gel to flow. They redid the packaging and it is now in a toothpaste like tube but if you flip open the cap it tends to dispense a thick bead. What I found works better is to unscrew the cap each time and it comes out in a thin bead.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on the date of expected delivery in perfect condition.  So far the product appears to do exactly what it says it would do. I like the fact you use it with your toothpaste. You don&#x27;t have to mess with strips you wear for a prolonged period of time. Also, costs a fraction of what those strips costs. Arm &amp; Hammer has always made quality products and this one is no exception to that. I like the subsription method of delivery. It saves me shipping costs and reduces the price a little. Also, I know I will get a new supply at a set period of time.</li>
    <li> Has definitely helped minimize stains.</li>
    <li> This was the best whitening product I have used and even better, the least expensive. I have used whitening strips periodically, but only twice per week due to sensitivity issues. This was not leading to good results, so I decided to give this product a try. I use it twice per day and my teeth were at least four shades lighter in about a month. I have been using it for about three months now and I have achieved the results I want---a white smile with no white splotches that the white strips were leaving. Normally, I give my teeth a break for a few days from it every now and then and have had no sensitivity issues at all. I use it in combination with a popular whitening toothpaste, that was working well, but this gave it the extra pick-me-up it needed. This product was my last resort before trying professional whitening and I am glad I gave it chance. Since I can maintain the results without any pain, it a better option in my opinion. Everyone that I have recommended it to has reported back good results with continued and regular use. The ones that used it periodically or gave up after a week or so did not like it.</li>
    <li> Goot  product have seen some improvement to the whitening of the teeth</li>
    <li> Everytime you brush just ad some with the toothpaste and brush, thats it after about 2 wweks you will begin to notice the brightening and then I put a little on my finger and rub on spots that need more brightening near the gum line and let it stai my mouth for a few minutes rinse and done.&lt;br /&gt;Second order of this product will keep buying quality.</li>
    <li> Brightens my teeth per each use. I use it on and off. Seems to be working very well :)</li>
    <li> A great addition to my brushing regime. I use the Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste along with this and have noticed a big improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> It works really nicely. Squeeze your usual toothpaste on your brush, and then squeeze some of this on top of that, and brush away. It gets pretty foamy in your mouth, so if you don&#x27;t like that, lessen the amount of it you use. Other than that, the overall taste is great, my teeth feel clean and healthy, and looked noticeably whiter in the week that the label claims. Plus, mine came in a pack of two, so its definitely a bonus! It&#x27;s such a cheaper and simpler alternative to whitening strips and paste. All you have to do it squeeze it over your tooth paste and brush! Now the results may not be as strong and immediate, but with continued use, you&#x27;ll get them.</li>
    <li> I started using this product right away. I works just like it says. I knew it would not get my teeth white as fast as the strips do, but it does the job, and of course, it&#x27;s much cheaper!!!!</li>
    <li> i LOVE this whitening booster. i use it every day with my toothpaste and it makes a huge difference.  it also does not make my teeth too sensitive or hurt my gums. the taste isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as a lot of the other types.  my husband cannot usually use whitening products, but he can use this sometimes.  it is especially great if i had a long day of eating, drinking, snacking, and candy- it really cleans your teeth and feel like it really does remove the stains from daily life. people compliment my teeth all the time.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical of this stuff at first since I rarely have success with DIY whitening, but I&#x27;m happy to announce that it truly does work. It&#x27;s NOT toothpaste but a booster meant to be used with your regular toothpaste. Just add a small amount of this to your toothbrush along with your usual toothpaste and brush as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to this stuff is consistent use. I do think it started making a very subtle difference right away, but it was at least a week or two of consistent (2X a day) use before I started to notice a real difference. I&#x27;ve now been using it (off and on) for over a year and while I may have reached my set point as far as how white my teeth will get without professional whitening, I&#x27;m very happy with results I&#x27;ve gotten from this and will continue to use it since it definitely helps keep new stains at bay. I doubt it will do much for deep discoloration (esp. stains due to things like decay), but it works great for mild to moderate staining from things like coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually worry about whitening products because I know they can cause enamel deterioration and the like, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any increased sensitivity or deterioration that I can attribute to this stuff. So while you should watch out for those signs just in case, I highly recommend giving this stuff a try!</li>
    <li> My teeth are sensitive so I am leery of some whiteners.  this didn&#x27;t cause any problems and I can definitely see improvement . Only took a couple of weeks just as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. There was a discernible difference in the color of my teeth after 3 days of use (2x per day). Another huge plus is that it is not too harsh or cause sensitivity as other products have done. I have tried other products and could not continue using them because my mouth felt as if I had been gargling acid after I tried them (my teeth and gums hurt). So the reasons to buy this are: (1) it works, and (2) it doesn&#x27;t feel like its destroying your mouth.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to use and makes a difference. Leaves your mouth feeling clean, not with flavor of mint or other artificial taste.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for whitening and I didn&#x27;t experience the sensitivity that other products cause.  It&#x27;s an easy product to use because you just add a dab of it to your regular paste when you brush.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy whitening product.</li>
    <li> If there is result, I am not seeing it. I&#x27;ve finished the first bottle and have been using it twice a day on top of my toothpaste as instructed and cannot notice any difference. Just so you know, I don&#x27;t have heavily stained teeth and is 24 yrs young. This has no reason to not work. Even though it was inexpensive, it was still a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the booster. It&#x27;s a great compliment to the toothpaste, especially after using Crest white strips. Adds an extra umps to your smile!</li>
    <li> Works awesome. Saw a huge difference in about a week. It&#x27;s been two weeks and I&#x27;m about were I want to be.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Really Great Product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told that I have white teeth, so perhaps I didn&#x27;t see results as expected since I don&#x27;t have severely yellow teeth. I still use this today just because my teeth feel cleaner after mixing in this whitening booster with my toothpaste. I would recommend using it if you&#x27;re not expecting to see drastic results like whitening strips and/or if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This product works as described.  It can however make your gums/teeth sensitive after using the product for a while.  If you don&#x27;t plan on using long term then it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Works really well and has a nice clean feel after I use it.</li>
    <li> This product if far better than any other product that I have tried. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Arm and Hammer.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job. If I use it twice a day, every day, my teeth get a bit sensitive. But, not as bad as with the strips. Does make my smile slightly whiter!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and the results keep me coming back for more.  I have received several compliments on how white my teeth are and as a daily tea drinker it is impressive how well this works. Plus it is easy to use...like a toothpaste booster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to make my teeth whiter for months but was not having much luck through whitening strips and other advertised methods. I stumbled upon this product when I was at walgreens for an unrelated matter and ended up wanting to get some floss. It caught my eye and I was skeptical. Having used it for a few weeks I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the color of my teeth and I can&#x27;t go back to brushing my teeth without it. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much on teeth whitening and is already brushing multiple times a day.</li>
    <li> Works great when used as directed. Teeth feel smother and just after few uses, teeth really look whiter. No allergic reaction, no after taste - I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> amazing!!!! best teeth whiter!</li>
    <li> The toothpaste works great to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that I am even using the 1/2 &amp; 1/2 ratio &amp; I still saw quick results.  This is sooo much better than using the white strips.  No gross strip that tastes horrible &amp; makes you drool uncontrollable the whole time it&#x27;s on.  It is NOT instant gratification, but it still works relatively quick.  It&#x27;s a nice, natural looking white.  I would recommend to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any diff with this paste. Really disappointed me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product works for me. I have been using plain baking soda instead and it works greats</li>
    <li> I use with Crest Teeth whitening..... I love it. I use twice a day. Works very well. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this whitener for several years now.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate your gums and enamel.  Just put a little on your toothpaste, and you&#x27;re set to go.  No nasty aftertaste or residue.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This has done nothing to help whiten or brighten my teeth and I will be going back to the expensive strips now because of it. I knew it was too good to be true! I am sure it isn&#x27;t harming my teeth, but it sure isn&#x27;t making a difference. Oh well. I had to give it a try! I couldn&#x27;t give it 1 star because I don&#x27;t hate it. There is nothing to hate or like about it since it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me at all, either way.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference after using for 2 + months.  It did cause me some tooth discomfort- would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is definitely easier than those messy white strips.  Just add a dab to your toothpaste and voila...So glad Amazon offers this product because I am unable to get it from the big box store anymore.</li>
    <li> I am not convinced that this works, I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks. I am going to keep with it and hope it will work!</li>
    <li> Using this gel before or after you brush makes a shade or two difference--great whitening results in five minutes--then rinse out.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I bought it because I do see the result.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product like two weeks ago, but my husband didn&#x27;t. Our teeth were about the same at that time. Now, mine is much brighter and whiter than my husband&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;So, he started using it today. :)</li>
    <li> More like a polish than a brightener. I didn&#x27;t get any whitening benefits, but my teeth feel as if i got them cleaned from the dentist and have a shiny look to them. So, I do the whitening strips when I need to, then after brushing I put some of this on the toothbrush to make my teeth gleam.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product but after reading all the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am so glad I did!! It really works. My teeth were starting to get really yellow mostly at the base of my teeth. Now my teeth are whiter, but more importantly even in color. Thank you Arm &amp; Hammer for an easy and quick teeth whitening product!!... and one that I can afford!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a blog review.  Wanted to like it, but after using it about a dozen times, (and not noticing any whitening happening), it made my teeth so sensitive!!  It&#x27;s now been more than 2 1/2 months since I quit using it and my teeth are still over sensitive.  My dentist gave me some Sensodyne toothpaste which has helped relieve that.  So I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this booster for a year (once a day), and as far as I can tell, it delivers very good results.</li>
    <li> One tube lasts me about 3 months, i saw results within a week. Still have another tube sitting by to be use. Coming from a cigarette smoker, this product works very well. My teeth has never been whiter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I used this product at least 1x a day and it whitened my teeth a good amount after a few weeks. But I applied it to my toothbrush AFTER brushing my teeth, then waited 5 minuted while keeping it on my teeth, then rinsed. When I used it twice a day, I noticed my teeth being sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have very low tooth enamel, and when I got my braces off a few years back I was very concerned about the state of my teeth. To the day I die, my teeth will probably still be very yellow. This product however, works exactly as advertised and I was seeing almost immediate results within the week. My teeth and gums are both very sensitive, but I did not experience any pain or discoloration. Very good product and I will be buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference in 2 brushings and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;Product has peroxide. Recommend trying to keep the paste on teeth only.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my teeth white and they feel clean. I would recommend this to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> This product barely did any significant whitening for my teeth.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m always really skeptical about products, so I won&#x27;t buy them unless I know they&#x27;re effective. My dad has Hollywood white teeth, never even had a cavity. So when I went to see him last, I noticed this stuff, and he encouraged me to try it. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, this stuff works GREAT! It gives instant results, my teeth were whiter after my first time brushing with this stuff. I have definitely become a buyer of this stuff, and I encourage you to try it, trust me it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! In a matter of weeks it will leave your teeth noticeably whiter. If you are looking for that extra boost of white, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> This product really helps whiten teeth and keep them white. I use it every day with my tooth paste. Reasonably priced!!</li>
    <li> Received on time. Great product! very satisfied with the services and I recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does what is meant to do.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to keeps the pearly whites up to date.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I really noticed a difference in my teeth- they were noticeably whiter in a week.</li>
    <li> The combination of AdvanceWhite and Whitening Booster has given me much to smile about</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. Then our very rural local shops stopped carrying it. Now that I have found it on Amazon, I will continue to purchase it here. It gives an added boost to help keep your teeth white. There is no burning and the flavor is fine. You just squeeze some out on top of the toothpaste on your toothbrush. This is a keeper, for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular coffee drinker, and I have definitely noticed that my teeth are whiter after using this product as directed (i.e., with a fluoride toothpaste) for the past two weeks. (Because of my concerns about the whitening agentis, I am taking the extra precaution of also using a fluoride rinse once a day.)</li>
    <li> I am a loyal purchaser of this product. It actually works and it much less daunting or messy than other choices for whitening.</li>
    <li> I have used this consistently for a month. Hydrogen peroxide is the main ingredient here. I have notice a slight whitening but not anything dramatic. I&#x27;m also careful not to swallow this product.</li>
    <li> Hey, it works, in a week my teeth are up to &amp;#34;stained&amp;#34;. Seriously, didn&#x27;t expect miracles, didn&#x27;t want the strips, and this works pretty well. Just add it to your tooth paste and brush.</li>
    <li> Besides going to the dentist and getting professional whitening done, i couldn&#x27;t find a miracle product you buy and will make your teeth white...this is however is a good addition to your teeth care regimen...it gave me maybe one to two shades of whitening....but in my case it is easy to do that because i smoke and drink black coffee all day so whenever i make any attempts at whitening i can see a difference...If your teeth are already close to pearly white and you want to push for that one last shade, this will not do ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this, it is easy to use, you just put it with your tooth paste and brush...no hassle like strips or other whitening systems/products...no bad taste...it is clear taste and color...so for me this is a plus since its just part of brushing your teeth and not an extra step of whitening work...</li>
    <li> My teeth have whitened up a lot as promised but it took about two weeks o really notice a difference but I do highly recommend. Much more cost effective then whitening strips.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothcare product I&#x27;ve used!  My dentist recommended it to me,  All I do is put a small amount of regular toothpaste on my brush, then an equal amount of this over the regular and brush, twice daily.  I finish up by using my waterpik.  After just a couple days, I began to see a difference.  It has been about a month now, and sometimes I just do it once daily, but the results are amazing.  Although I see my hygienist every 6 months, I&#x27;m 64 years old and my teeth were pretty dark.  After a month using this product with my regular paste, I would have to say they have lightened a lot - about four or five stages.  I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to smile!  Because I only need a small dollop each time, the small tube lasts pretty long also.  This is so much more affordable than getting my teeth professionally whitened and much easier on my tooth enamel than the whitening strips!</li>
    <li> - I&#x27;ve had yellow teeth (kind of a light coffee-induced yellow, not meth-mouth yellow) since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve tried Rembrandt and most of the grocery store &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;- After I started using the Colgate Optic White collection (toothpaste and rinse) as instructed with my A&amp;H Spinbrush, I noticed results.&lt;br /&gt;- Then, after I found this in a certain store (no longer carried there which is why I ordered it from Amazon) and started using it with the Optic White line, I started getting even BETTER results!&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t think that the results continue to improve with prolonged use, but you should definitely keep using it. If you stop, the results will go away BUT, each time, I&#x27;ve gotten the pearly white smile back within a matter of days.</li>
    <li> My teeth were yellow and had stains from drinking tea.  Both my dental hygienist and I love this product, it makes your teeth look better and prevents the tea stains reducing her work.</li>
    <li> Greetings,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product anticipating great results (especially after reading the reviews on Amazon).  After two months of usage, my wife and I feel that my teeth are no whiter than when I started using the product.  It&#x27;s not an expensive product, but if it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not a good deal at any price.</li>
    <li> White strips make my teeth sensitive so using this daily is effective, gentle and an  inexpensive alternative. Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This product does work, but you have to be consistent with it. Use it everyday on top of your regular toothpaste. I can see a difference. No it is not as strong as whitening strips but it is noticeable.</li>
    <li> I dunno, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is working or not. It can&#x27;t hurt to keep using it, but I don&#x27;t see much of a change.</li>
    <li> less time and effort to use than a whitening tray. covers all teeth unlike a whitening strip. cheaper than most of the whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;i use it everyday and can absolutely tell the difference. Walmart tends to run out, so glad i can get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I definitely notice a difference in the shade of my teeth, but not to the extreme some other people have reported. It&#x27;s worth purchasing but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> It taste great! As far as a change in the color of my teeth \\&quot; I really don&#x27;t see much of a change\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see results in about two weeks. I think this product has the potential of working very well and very quickly if a person is not a coffee drinker.</li>
    <li> this does work, im a smoker and coffee drinker. coffee and sodas stain teeth more than cigs. however, i use this every morning. i put it on and leave it for as long as i can, which is about five minutes...because i have things to do, not because it hurts my gums. there is no pain or burning whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;the longer you leave it on, the better it works. one tube lasts me one month. if i use this twice a day i get faster results and whiter teeth. people notice!&lt;br /&gt;but i cant give up the coffee so im back to replenish my supply. this is the best whitener ive found, and ive tried everything short of big bucks at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;leave it on as long as you can, like 5-7 minutes if you want to see a huge difference. my husband puts it on his toothbrush and just brushes, he doesnt get the results i get. and i drink way more coffee than he does. he just doesnt want to bother with it. you get out of it what you put into it. its so easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many whitening products out there and this is one of the best. I think it works better than whitening strips and is much cheaper. It does make your teeth sensitive, which is pretty much the case with any whitening product. Will continue buying this!</li>
    <li> I purchased three packages of this mainly to get the shipping discount. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, twice a day, and can&#x27;t really tell if its made a difference. If anything, perhaps its whitened my teeth a shade or two...not enough to tell unless I took before and after pics. With the low cost of the product, I&#x27;ll keep using it until its gone. Can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference besides the increased sensitivity to my teeth.  I used it twice a day for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, this product actually works!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a great difference in the whitening of my teeth, and i have been a smoker and coffee drinker for many years. I even get asked how my teeth can be so white!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m not that impressed with it. I see some whitening effect, but it isn&#x27;t much and it doesn&#x27;t last even between brushings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping this helps, I use it with Crest D and a whitening pre-rinse.  I drink a lot of cofee and I think my teeth are at least a shade whiter.</li>
    <li> The old formula was more effective</li>
    <li> I have been using this almost a month and I do not see any difference in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth get bright white if I go to the dentist to get a whitening treatment so I know&lt;br /&gt;my teeth can easily be whitened.  Disappointed :-(</li>
    <li> I like because I can add to a natural toothpast that has xylitol without getting all the mainstream garbage in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change. Others may have a different experience.</li>
    <li> My teeth were not white anymore due to medication and this booster has whitened them several shades whiter.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works but it doesn&#x27;t do anything negative</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now and I really like the results. Teeth don&#x27;t get whiter in a day but use it for a week or so and you will surely see a difference. It does work and well. My wife saw me smiling the other day and she told me that my teeth go whiter and now she is using it too.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product reading other reviews. I have been using this now three weeks and see very little result. I think it takes off daily stains, but not years of yellowing that have taken place. I am in my fifties so perhaps a 20 year old will have better results. I am going to Crest whitestripes as they work from within rather than just topical.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! My teeth are whiter, shinier, and stronger! So far, the larger stains on my teeth are still there, but they are slowly lightening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every time brushing my teeth.  Coupled with a whitening rinse, my teeth are very white.  I get compliments all the time.  Been using for years with great results.</li>
    <li> Good item it works, my teeth are noticeably whiter and it isn&#x27;t that much of a hassle to just put it on your regular toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Very good product, does what is says !!</li>
    <li> Worked great, i have received many compliments already!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, so I&#x27;m giving a 2 because it gave a little hope.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Really works!</li>
    <li> I am the type of person who focuses on teeth - no matter what. This product will do the job, and then some. I have never had any type of problem with the sensitivity of my teeth while using it, and that&#x27;s on top of my favorite teeth whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used in unison with a gentle teeth whitening toothpaste, you can see a noticeable difference in a little as 3 days.</li>
    <li> Another great arm and hammer product. I use it with my arm and hammer toothpaste and they work great together! This product is clear and not gritty. Love it!</li>
    <li> Without question, having used this product for several months, my teeth are noticeably whiter. I continue to use it, and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its wasn&#x27;t dramatic because my teeth are already reasonably white, but one day I just looked up and noticed that my teeth we actually getting whiter after about 8-10 days of use. Maybe its just me but I&#x27;m kind of paranoid that my teeth will get yellow if I stop using it.</li>
    <li> I tried this every time I brushed for a few weeks but it did nothing for my teeth. I gave the second tube to my daughter and she said she did notice a difference. So I guess it just depends on your teeth and what the stains are from.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for six weeks and my teeth don&#x27;t look any whiter to me.</li>
    <li> this is not the first time buying this product, i drink alot of coffee and a bunch of other teeth staining products. this does a good jobs of lessening the effects of those drinks. i know if i drink coffee with a straw, this would def whiten my teeth even more. it does work.</li>
    <li> You can see a difference after the first brush. Just like the strips at a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff works but just nominally. I bought the crest white strips after using this for a month and they really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this item if I had known how well the strips really work.&lt;br /&gt;I have a condition on my gums that can make contact with any harsh foods or chemicals very painful so I was steered away from the strips originally. Since this product didn&#x27;t have much impact I decided to try the strips anyway and the gum pain is not an issue.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It works on top of your toothpaste and makes a different.  You do not feel the sensitivity issues that you would if you used crest whitening strips, etc.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and can&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; hardcore whiteners. This one works very well. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but as a continuing part of a daily regiment, it works very well to white your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years and it is effective. My teeth are very sensitive but I have no problems using it. It does take a few weeks of use to really see results, however.</li>
    <li> When I smile, I don&#x27;t want the color of my teeth to register in people&#x27;s minds. I don&#x27;t want them to think, \\&quot;Wow, coffee has not been kind to this woman;\\&quot; I also don&#x27;t want them to think, \\&quot;Wow, her teeth are REALLY white. That is not natural.\\&quot; (Face it - we&#x27;ve all met those people.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whitening booster is far less expensive than most, and may not take you all the way to that obviously artificial translucent-white we see in toothpaste ads. But for some of us, we don&#x27;t want to go there! After exactly a week of use so far, I would say this booster took me to a noticeably lighter shade (noticeable to me because I&#x27;m paying attention) that is still very plausible for a natural smile. It&#x27;s good to feel like I could keep drinking coffee without worrying about my teeth!</li>
