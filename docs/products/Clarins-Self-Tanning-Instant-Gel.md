      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more acceptable on my arms and chest; however I am embarrassed to show my legs with it on.</li>

      <li>The longer you wait before putting on your clothes the better.</li>
      <li>So glad I found something that will keep me from using the tanning beds.</li>
      <li>and i absolutly love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tad bit pricey which is what dissapointed me the most when it turned out to be a smelly product...</li>
      <li>I actually love the smell of this, and the feel of it.  </li>
      <li>just be sure to wash your hands after it will leave them orange.</li>
      <li>Have had several friends who are using it, and since it was listed \\&quot;best of Sephora\\&quot;, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t do it right away because I was scared it might not look good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very excited.</li>
      <li>It does not give you a yellow shade but a very nice bronze!</li>
      <li>I asked many people to make sure it didn&#x27;t look orange, and they all said it looked natural and great.</li>
      <li>This one is really nice because it works quickly</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin (I&#x27;m irish with freckles) and</li>
      <li>and I have yet to see any lines or streaks which would show up easily on my skin.</li>
      <li>I can understand why some reviewers may not like this product, but I really think it is by far one of the best self tanning gels you will probably use.</li>
      <li>easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of sticky at first, but that goes away.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got a great golden brown tan, that was very natural looking, not a hint of orange!  </li>
      <li>very much agree with many here, if you are olive complexion, yes go for it, you will love it.  </li>
      <li>and that was fine.</li>
      <li>It was worth the buy after all :)</li>
      <li>This has a gel-like consistency and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>This self tanner doesn&#x27;t streak, goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
      <li>I bought this last spring after reading the great reviews.</li>
      <li>to its description, the gel goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
      <li>It goes on in a smooth fashion and because of the gel formula, it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m have really fair skin, so I was really surprised at how tan this made me.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, and the gel seems very easy to spread everywhere without missing any areas.  </li>
      <li>First, I have a very light complexion.  </li>
      <li>its goes on pretty smooth, more like a serum than a gel</li>
      <li>but SO WORTH IT!  </li>
      <li>Also, they&#x27;ll easily fade away with the first shower!  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful if you have normal to dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Another benefit of this product is you can get dressed right away without having to worry about this product transferring onto your clothes!</li>
      <li>It is the absolute first tanning product of ANY kind that has been moisturizing---and that is bankable.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many self tanners...never really liking any of them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It took about three hours before I noticed I was turning darker, and then by the evening it was perfect (for me at least).  </li>
      <li>What I love so much about this is that the color is buildable.  </li>
      <li>Also with the extra plant extracts I feel like I am doing my skin good.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, also love that drying time isn&#x27;t a factor.  </li>
      <li>/feel satiny, it smells good(!)</li>
      <li>The product is easy to use and provides nice color after a short period of time.</li>
      <li>the mousse will streak easily unless you are a seasoned pro like myself.</li>
      <li>but my face defintely becomes more white, than I have to put more of it to regain that tan again...</li>
      <li>I really love this and highly recommend you give it a go.  </li>
      <li>But this one is so easily applied you just smooth it in and it will dry out with NO STREAKS plus a golden hue!!</li>
      <li>This product is definitely worth its value.  </li>
      <li>i am being honest when i say this is worth the extra $.</li>
      <li>apply lotion all over (if you&#x27;re applying it to your face then u should moisturize it because thats what I do), wait for it to get absorbed by the skin for 15-30 mins then apply the clarins self tanner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this about a week ago and I tried it and so far its good,it gives u a bronze tan in about 2 hrs,but dont put too much like I did because it gives u an orange color...the only thing I hate about it is that it fades away after like 2 days,I thought the tan would stay longer but it really disappointed me,everytime I wash my face or take a shower the tan just fades away especially from my face not much from my body but my face defintely becomes more white, than I have to put more of it to regain that tan again...the smell is not that bad it goes away after about 30min-hr,so far I love this product but I wish it the tan stays alot longer, thats the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> i am very pale with freckles and i have been self tanning since self tanning was invented. i have sampled every tanner that has been on the shelves of drug/department stores. the cheapest&lt;-&gt;most pricey. i am being honest when i say this is worth the extra $. Before trying this recently, i have been using jergens in both its forms (mousses and lotions). I liked jergens better than others i&#x27;d tried and was shocked it was better than expensive brands. however there are problems with Jergens: 1. the mousse will streak easily unless you are a seasoned pro like myself. the lotion WORKS, but 2. it leaves skin feeling sticky and over-moisturized (esp. if you do another coat later for added color). Also, you need to shower before going out because it smells really weird. Also- 3. jergens has very natural color for the first couple days, then it turns this burnt orange color and you have to exfoliate it off and start all over again! So aggravating! And my final point 4. Jergens doesn&#x27;t go very far. one bottle lasts a week if you apply it once-twice a day. I say all this to say that clarins has none of these issues. It does NOT streak at ALL, its only sticky for like an hour and really it just makes your skin look/feel satiny, it smells good(!) for once, and the color lasts about 6-7 days and is the most natural brown color i&#x27;ve ever tried, annnnd, a tiny bit goes a lonnng way. the consistency is like serum. it actually feels cool. and it doesnt give me pimples like jergens. its pretty much perfect..</li>
    <li> I have used this product off-and-on for about 5-years...so long, in fact, that I remember when it was $25.00 a tube!  I am sorry to disagree with some who have mentioned an \\&quot;odor\\&quot; or objectionable \\&quot;smell\\&quot;; I find that it smells fresh and clean and as one reviewer remarked \\&quot;...like summertime\\&quot;.  It couldn&#x27;t be easier to apply, looks natural and if you wipe your hands (especially around the nails, between the fingers and under any rings) with a damp towel you should be \\&quot;good to go\\&quot;.  Since I drive a convertible, I also highly recommend the self-tanning milk (6 spf) for when you are on the go and need some protection.</li>
    <li> I, as many people, were very skeptical. I used the gel and it was very simple to apply, and the smell was not bad at all (although many people have said it was). I finished, washed my hands thoroughly, and waited. I only waited a little bit before getting dressed because I was in a rush- and that was fine. I didn&#x27;t stain my clothes or anything. Within about 4 to 5 hours, I noticed a difference. I have very fair skin (I&#x27;m irish with freckles) and this tanned me very well! I asked many people to make sure it didn&#x27;t look orange, and they all said it looked natural and great. I just did my face about a half hour ago, so I&#x27;m hoping that comes out good as well. I didn&#x27;t do it right away because I was scared it might not look good. It actually did leave my skin (legs, stomach, arms) smoother and not dry at all. It moisturized my skin.    All in all I&#x27;m very excited. I added another layer to my legs to see how the second shade will come out. I will update if it turns orange, but I doubt it!    Great product, easy to use, worth the money! Don&#x27;t be afraid of it. If anyone would turn orange, it would be me, and I didn&#x27;t. :)</li>
    <li> First, I have a very light complexion.  I have tried wash-off bronzers, lotions, spray tans, etc. and this one is my personal favorite.  It is not a bronzer where you wash off the \\&quot;guide\\&quot; color the next day.  It is a clear lotion that you apply (MUST WEAR GLOVES) and has GREAT coverage and GREAT color.  I have also tried the spray tan from a can and while it had decent coverage and color it was horribly messy.  Clarins is just like applying any lotion and leaves a perfect sun kissed color.  So glad I found something that will keep me from using the tanning beds.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product- it has gotten so many good reviews everywhere. But, like countless other self tanners I&#x27;ve tried, it turned my skin - particularly my legs - what I would call a spiced pumpkin color. The pluses were that it absolutely did not streak or create hard edges where I may have not blended thoroughly, and that alone is rare. The smell wasn&#x27;t bad and I think the price is reasonable for what you get as a little seemed to go a long way. But the color just isn&#x27;t right. It&#x27;s a bit more acceptable on my arms and chest; however I am embarrassed to show my legs with it on. And after exfoliating in the shower, a lot of \\&quot;orange\\&quot; came off on my white towels. My skin is naturally quite ghastly white with a reddish undertone, and I&#x27;ve become fairly convinced that I am always going to be out of luck when it comes to self tanners. When I asked a colleague her opinion of my \\&quot;tan\\&quot;, she unabashedly said \\&quot;you&#x27;re orange\\&quot;.     Updated - days later, I am still wiping orange schmutz off my legs when I get out of the shower. Brownish orange particles are pilling into balls and discoloring towels and tissues. I just hope it washes out of the white towels. The product, in trying to hang on so long, has worn off so unevely that it&#x27;s left horrible rust colored patches everywhere. I brought it back to the Clarins counter where I purchased it. I think the ingredient that is added in to make the color stay on longer is the guilty party. I&#x27;ve never had this experience with any other self tanner. I&#x27;d strongly recommend, especially to the fair-skinned, to look elsewhere. I traded this horrible stuff for Clarin&#x27;s Radiance Plus body moisturizing tanner, which so far is ok - just gives a hint of color w/out looking too obvious. The real test though will be in how that wears and fades off. My one golden rule for self tanning besides the usual -  cleanse, exfoliate, moisturize thicker skin and wear gloves is - buy locally, at a place whose return and exchange policy insures you won&#x27;t get stuck with a lemon. Or should I say, an orange?</li>
    <li> Have had several friends who are using it, and since it was listed \\&quot;best of Sephora\\&quot;, I thought I would give it a try.  The result was good... but, I am still on the search for a PERFECT self tanner.  The color it gives is a little less orange than drugstore \\&quot;gradual tanning\\&quot; lotions for sure, but there are still some orange undertones that come through.  Thinking about trying the Intensive version to see if I can get a deeper brown color.  Texture is quite pleasant, and the smell really isn&#x27;t that bad (I dont know what everyone in the other reviews is complaining about).    All in all, good product, okay for the price.  But, like I said, still shopping for the &#x27;Perfect&#x27; tanner.</li>
    <li> The smell bothers me. I bought this product under the impression that there would be no \\&quot;typical self-tan\\&quot; odor (as promised by the sales person), but that was not the case at all.     Luckily the color is very nice (color lasts up to a week) and I like the texture of the product. It&#x27;s a tad bit pricey which is what dissapointed me the most when it turned out to be a smelly product... I assumed if I forked over the big bucks I would be doing away with the smelly stuff!</li>
    <li> So, i bought this product because i&#x27;d heard so much about it, here&#x27;s my experience.    1) its goes on pretty smooth, more like a serum than a gel but you have to be liberal in your use or it will streak. But, at [...] bucks, it turns into an expensive application    2) the first layer i put on, you couldn&#x27;t see it at all even after 5-6 hours, it was very subtle. It takes a while to dry but i waited only 5 minutes before i put a big, baggy tshirt over it.    3) i put another layer on that night and woke with a noticable tan - not dark, but for a light skinned blonde, i could tell.    4) i waited 1 day and then applied another coat and the next morning i woke way too dark! but it wasn&#x27;t a nice brown dark like i would naturally tan, it was a little orange. my boyfriend teased me all day about looking like a cast member from jersey shore, when i yelled at him, he told me &#x27;i feel like i have an Italian girlfriend!\\&quot;    Conclusion;    good things: goes on smooth, even coverage, see color after two applications,     bad things: its not extremely orange but it doesn&#x27;t look like a real tan at all and is still a little orange, its [...] bucks!    will i buy again? probably not, i might use up the tube, but Loreals sublime is better than this.</li>
    <li> This is really and truly the best self tanner on the market. Believe me, I&#x27;ve used and tried them all.    It goes on in a smooth fashion and because of the gel formula, it doesn&#x27;t streak. I use it on my face all the time (not sure if it&#x27;s &#x27;designed&#x27; for that)  but it works really well.    The only very small issue I have with it is the smell. It&#x27;s a wee bit strong but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the color it gives you.</li>
    <li> While Clarins is a little pricey, it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost. This self tanner doesn&#x27;t streak, goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t stink. The only downside is that it&#x27;s quite sticky while it&#x27;s drying. The bottle suggests waiting before getting dressed, and I had to wait about ten minutes before I felt confident the product had dried enough to not rub off and result in a hilarious tan. If you don&#x27;t mind the wait, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I can understand why some reviewers may not like this product, but I really think it is by far one of the best self tanning gels you will probably use. If you are going to buy one consider the following:  1.) Before application EXFOLIATE your skin to avoid \\&quot;streaks.\\&quot; I used TRUE BLUE SPA by Bath and Body Works. I love it and it works great! :D  2.) If you are self-conscious about your hands getting orangey, (likely caused by not washing your hands thoroughly after use) then use gloves and when you are done with your body apply some on the back of your hands.  3.) Stickiness can feel like a sweaty feeling and that really depends on the temperature of your environment.   4.) No need to overreact on the odor. It is not revolting... unless you are sensitive to smell, then there is no need to buy it, otherwise look forward to your summer tan :D  5.) When you are showering try not to scrub so hard because more than likely your color will fade. PAT DRY your body whenever you get out of the shower. This preserves the color on your skin.  6.) I do not know the effectiveness on the face, but you CAN use it on your face.   7.) The longer you wait before putting on your clothes the better. It really depends on whether you feel that it has dried thoroughly.   8.) USE WITHIN 6 MONTHS after opening for best results.  Your Results:  * A natural and moisturized tan look.  * An incredibly satisfying look from an INSTANT GEL. Remember this is not spray tanning. You won&#x27;t look orange either. And don&#x27;t expect to go from pale white to brown. It is a gradual process.   * You will notice the instant effect.   * It was worth the buy after all :)</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanner I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  This has a gel-like consistency and goes on smoothly. I always moisturize my knees, feet, and elbows to ensure an even tan.  This will not turn you orange, it will give you a very natural looking tan without the sun damage.  I&#x27;ve only used this on my body but it suggests to use it on your face too. Another benefit of this product is you can get dressed right away without having to worry about this product transferring onto your clothes! I have already gone through several tubes and will keep buying it. I highly, highly recommend this product. Oh just be sure to wash your hands well after applying it.</li>
    <li> I happen to really love this product.  It does have an obvious smell to it, but to me, it reminds me of summer.  However, if you don&#x27;t like the fragrance, I find it disapates after a couple of hours.  The two bad things I&#x27;ll say about it is yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey and two, these days you can buy tanners with color already to them so you can see your mistakes - you don&#x27;t get that with this.  Having said that, it is the most natural look I&#x27;ve ever achieved while using any kind of fake tan.  It&#x27;s so much safer than going to a solarium (should be banned), and after a little practice, you&#x27;ll get this right.  Make sure to exfoliate well before using it and then moisturise.  I find this gives me the best coverage and natural look.  I really love this and highly recommend you give it a go.  It won&#x27;t go orange and you look great with it on.</li>
    <li> Being the self tanning guru that I am (I&#x27;ve tried Jergens, Loreal, Hawaiian Tropic, you name it) I finally decided to dish out a few more bucks and try Clarins self tanning instant gel.  It&#x27;s the most natural looking self tanner I&#x27;ve used, doesn&#x27;t streak, dries pretty fast and I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad.  The downside is that it&#x27;s very subtle, and I had to reapply three days in a row to get a deeper tan.  After two applications I had a slight tan and had some comments made at work the next day.  I&#x27;m naturally pretty pale.  It looks great and I&#x27;d buy it again, but for as much as it costs I wish it was a little more dramatic, because I&#x27;m already halfway through the tube and it&#x27;s been three days!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it because this is the ONLY TAN that doesn&#x27;t streak AND doesn&#x27;t clog pores! The tinted self tanners are the ones that streak and stains.  Also, they&#x27;ll easily fade away with the first shower!  But this one is so easily applied you just smooth it in and it will dry out with NO STREAKS plus a golden hue!! NOT ORANGE!   ways to apply it is u should exfoliate 1st then apply lotion all over (if you&#x27;re applying it to your face then u should moisturize it because thats what I do), wait for it to get absorbed by the skin for 15-30 mins then apply the clarins self tanner.  If you want a darker color re-apply it after 3 hrs or so.   THE BEST!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about all of them.  This one I went for because I really hate the bronzers, a.k.a. \\&quot;guides\\&quot;, I have been self tanning forever---I don&#x27;t need a guide!  I hate that junk on my sheets, my bra&#x27;s (if I do a touch up or just shower in a.m. and apply my tanner) I don&#x27;t necessarily need an &#x27;instant&#x27; tan... has the world gotten so &#x27;instant gratification&#x27; we can&#x27;t wait a couple of hours? Geeeze!!  Anyway, sorry about that, it is just scary sometimes what has become of the &#x27;gotta have it yesterday&#x27; mentality that exists in some people. (Of course, no  one here!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I actually love the smell of this, and the feel of it.  It is very moisturizing, also love that drying time isn&#x27;t a factor.  The color just doesn&#x27;t do what I thought it would do with all the raving and magazine hoopla. I really hate returning things such as this, I don&#x27;t hate it, but it isn&#x27;t worth the money for the size if I have to do 13 coats to get some color.  I have been using it with the daily tanning lotions and it does then produce really pretty brown, but which one is it?  My 3.99 store brand lotion or the 30.00 base?  I have to go back to the Mall tomorrow, I may trade it for the dark bottle that is out here.&lt;br /&gt;I very much agree with many here, if you are olive complexion, yes go for it, you will love it.  If you have money to throw away and can buy two different tanners this one does last and last.  I have not noticed much rub off, even when I scrub hard with a wash cloth.  Or even when I shaved with a new razor for that matter.  It is the absolute first tanning product of ANY kind that has been moisturizing---and that is bankable.  If it weren&#x27;t for the lack of color, even at two good coats. : ((</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY self-tanners, this on rocks!  It is a gel, so it doesn&#x27;t clog or settle in pores.  This can be used on body and face.  It smells better than others, \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot;.  What I love so much about this is that the color is buildable.  You gradually gain color, so you aren&#x27;t one day white, then the next day golden tan.  Since the color is buildable, you also don&#x27;t get those weird harsh lines around your hands, feet, or hairline. I applied the first \\&quot;coat\\&quot; to my entire body; face, ears, hairline, hands, and feet.  Then the next day I went back and applied again to all the major areas of the body.    Some tips that I learned: (1) take your time, make sure you don&#x27;t miss a spot. (2)dont wear gloves, but do wash your hands about every minute that you are applying. This way you can feel what you are doing, but the tanner doesn&#x27;t get left on your palms long enough to absorbe. dont forget about cuticles and under nails. (3)baking soda is a great and extrmely cheap exfoliator.  (4)watch out for skin folds and wrinkles. The back of your ankles, your neck, under your breasts...(5)watch out for knees and elbows. you might want to skip a second application on these parts.   I have very pale skin, but olive undertones. I got a great golden brown tan, that was very natural looking, not a hint of orange!  This is worth every penny, and time spent applying. Also with the extra plant extracts I feel like I am doing my skin good. I will never use any other product.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sephora, and it came with a tiny bottle of scrub and a tiny bottle of bronzer along with the self tanning gel. I have not had very good luck with self tanners but this one had amazing reviews from people, so I decided to try it. BAD IDEA! First off the smell, to me, was overpowering. And it continued to smell until the self tanner had faded. Also, the tan came out streaky, and not natural looking on me (I have brown hair, white skin, i freckle and burn verrrry easily).   Also if you check it out on cosmeticsdatabase.com you will find out that it is EXTREMELY bad for your skin as well.  All around bad product, I would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is the best I have ever tried.  It smells great, and the gel seems very easy to spread everywhere without missing any areas.  The color was great--I have a lot of trouble with streaking usually and the gel worked better for me than lotions or sprays.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gel, so it goes on clear.  Pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing because you won&#x27;t be able to see where you missed till later.  It&#x27;s kind of sticky at first, but that goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells, but that goes away pretty quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m have really fair skin, so I was really surprised at how tan this made me.  Very tan - for about three days and then it started to turn orangish and fade away.  (mostly from showering, swimming, shaving, etc.)  But for the days I wanted it for a particular dress, it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t wash one of my hands good enough, so had a bit of orange in the web part of left hand, but nothing to crazy noticable.  I have lots of freckles and this didn&#x27;t make them too dark and glaring, just slightly darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s expensive, but since it works so much better than other tanner&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried it&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about three hours before I noticed I was turning darker, and then by the evening it was perfect (for me at least).  My friends are all trying it out now - I&#x27;ll update if anyone feels differently than me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many self tanners...never really liking any of them.  From the recommendation of a friend I decided to buy this one with the thought that it would probably be just like the others....orange, splotchy, streaky, etc.  WOW...was I wrong!!  I have used this three different times now..about two to three days apart from each other and it is WONDERFUL!!!  No orange, no splotches, no streaks!!!  It looks totally real and so beautiful on!  It even lasts a long time..you don&#x27;t have to apply it every day.  I would highly recommend this product.  Might be a little pricey but SO WORTH IT!  If you have any hesitation...JUST BUY IT!!!  You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I saw that another person reviewed this product with 5 stars, but had only used the product on their body.  I have used it on my face and it is flawless; no splotchiness.  This product is definitely worth its value.  I have really dry skin, especially on my fact, and this gel actually seems to add moisture back in (along with the perfect amount of golden tan, not orangey).  I&#x27;ve also used quite a few sunless tanning products, some of which have been pretty good, but this one beats them all out.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Tis the season for every beauty magazine to once again dust off their alarmist articles about the dangers of skin cancer and tout the latest self-tanning products.  Having seen my father go through two surgeries to remove cancerous lesions from his face as a result of not using sunscreen, I can vouch for those dangers.  However, vanity will not allow me to expose my dead-white skin to the masses after spending the entire winter covered up and I&#x27;ve begun my annual quest for the ideal self-tanner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product after reading several favorable reviews on Amazon and other websites.  But at $29.50 for a 4.4 oz. tube it&#x27;s expensive.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t immediately pass on it was because I had a $25.00 Amazon gift certificate.  Otherwise I would never consider purchasing something this pricey. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;True to its description, the gel goes on smoothly and evenly.  It leaves a slight sheen so you can see where you applied it.  The product dries a little slowly but I&#x27;ve learned to apply a small amount daily and let the color build over a few days rather than slather it on in one shot.  I did that the first day and waited nearly 40 minutes for the product to completely dry before getting dressed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a color change.  I&#x27;m certainly less pale but nowhere near what I&#x27;d call tan.  Worst of all, the product smells like nail polish remover.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some other self-tanners, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like acetone either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end I gave it three stars for ease of application and superb skin softening offset by slow color change, odd smell and high price.  I don&#x27;t mind spending more for a superior product, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> ive used clarins self tanning instant gel for about a year now. this has to be the best self tanner ive used for my body. however i have used it on my face and noticed that i had breakouts and it would be blochy in the areas where there is dry skin, so i dont recommend it for the face. i used it on my legs and found that its not that great either, the color is really good and natural, it wont streak or look orange, its just that it comes off from shaving your legs and if you use it during the summer, it will come off in chlorine and in the ocean. i use it on my arms, chest and neck and i absolutly love it. its so unbelievably natural. the only thing is that i am very pale so it looks okay on me doesnt give me a tan, it just gives me a color so that i dont look pale. i think it would be best on darker skined people and give them really good color. just be sure to wash your hands after it will leave them orange. ive just ordered the clarins radiance plus self tanner instant gel-cream. ive read a lot of good reviews on this and am going to try it on my face, hopeuflly its good! i recommend the clarins self tanning instant gel and think everyone who is looking for good , natural color should try this!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sunless tanners I&#x27;ve tried, and I plan on purchasing it again. I used it on my face and body.    The Pros:    1. The color turns out really natural looking, not orange at all.     2. It does not darken pores. Before trying this product I was using Fake Bake. Fake Bake did give me nice color, but it also darkened every pore on my face. The Clarins product does not do that, it goes on very even.    3. Some sunless tanners seem very drying to the skin, but this one left my skin feeling soft and moisturized.    The Cons: (why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)    1. There&#x27;s no color guide, it goes on clear. So if you miss a spot it&#x27;s a little hard to tell. For the most part I didn&#x27;t have a problem, just a little bit near my ankles at first. It just takes practice.    2. The price is a little high for the amount you get. However, a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.    3. It does smell! The smell is the strongest for about the first hour you put it on, then fades. The smell does go away completely after you shower.</li>
    <li> I used this product all last year and I was always with a natural tan. Everyone thought it was my real color! It does not give you a yellow shade but a very nice bronze! It is wonderful if you have normal to dry skin.  But this year my hormones changed and I develop some female 30&#x27;s acne and I could not use this product, every time I would put some on my face my skin would break out. So, if you are planning to use for your face and places you normally break out, I advise you not to use this one.   If not, than go ahead because it gives you a nice tan and a smooth skin! But be aware that once you open it, you better use it soon because it doesn&#x27;t work as well after that (they say it on the bottle).</li>
    <li> Really natural looking.  easy to apply.  the smell other reviewers complained of dissipates within minutes.  I typically hate self tanners but really like this one bc it dries fast and isn&#x27;t streaky</li>
    <li> My skin is very light, thin and burns easily so I&#x27;m always looking for a good self tanner. This one is really nice because it works quickly and I have yet to see any lines or streaks which would show up easily on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t settle into your fingernails while you are applying it and it seems to dry quickly. Now, you won&#x27;t get a deep dark tan in one applaication, but it&#x27;s nice to put it on and then go out to dinner with glowing skin. You end up looking very healthy without overdoing it.</li>
    <li> I bought this last spring after reading the great reviews. The product is easy to use and provides nice color after a short period of time. Make sure you exfoliate well and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. The price is expensive, but in this case, you get what you pay for &#x3D; A quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside: It&#x27;s best used in one season. I had half a tube left at the end of last summer, and tried it again yesterday. This time, the color showed up very uneven and blotchy. The directions said to use it within 6 months of opening....and they aren&#x27;t lying. The product is worthless if used longer than recommended.</li>
    <li> Before my sister-in-law&#x27;s wedding, I used Neutrogena Micro-mist spray tan and it turned out terrible! Streaks, super dark lines and orange spots!  I was devastated and almost too mortified to go to the wedding in my new dress.  As a last ditch effort (hours before the wedding) I got this self tanner and put it over my legs and arms in an attempt to even things out.  It was AMAZING!  It toned down the crappy job from the spray tan and left me with an almost completely even, natural looking color.  I will never use another self tan product but this one!</li>
