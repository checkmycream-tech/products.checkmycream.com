### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I also see some great reviews on this page.  </li>
      <li>works great on my skin marks caused by acne</li>
      <li>I saw so good infos about this product</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and there is an amazing difference.  </li>
      <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>To be honest, i feel i lost my money.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this, works faster than coco butter.</li>
      <li>No, they are not gone, but they are so much better already.  </li>
      <li>Mederma works better then</li>
      <li>I bought Skinception before I made a lot of research about the different products available for scars, so I choose this product over the others because it seemed to be the best</li>
      <li>The formula was pleasant, non-odorous and absorbed into the skin quickly.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for putting on under my makeup (I use Bare Minerals, NOT liquid foundation) and within the first month I noticed that my scars had lightened a bit.  </li>
      <li>I was devastated at the huge, raised scars that were about 1&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Look at me and all of the other great reviews on this page.  </li>
      <li>I did order one more bottle and will have a better feel for its effectiveness after the second bottle</li>
      <li>and it diminished the marks quickly.</li>
      <li>I was right.  </li>
      <li>my opinion, WORTH THE MONEY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO INVEST THE TIME.  </li>
      <li>This company should be sued and shut down for good.</li>
      <li>I think the bottle will last atleast 6 months at this rate (or more)</li>
      <li>I am finishing up my first bottle and it seems to be improving acne scars.  </li>
      <li>After the first surgery (July 30)</li>
      <li>I have a  pretty large surgical scar, and this did nothing to reduce it.  </li>
      <li>My scars are already almost completely flat and have went from bright red to a brownish color.  </li>
      <li>certain this is like any product where it will work wonders for some people with certain skin types but not work at all for others.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I did see much of a change to my marks.</li>
      <li>compared to original photos scar has even gotten worse--how is that possible?</li>
      <li>I have used this product since the first week of October and I have DEFINITELY noticed improvements.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with what it has done for me so far, but do your research and know what is expected of you and the product, 1 month to get rid of scarring is completely unrealistic.</li>
      <li>I had a breast reduction earlier this year which resulted in large surgical scars.</li>
      <li>and i ve been using this for 1 month applying to my old scars on my face twice a day.</li>
      <li>so I can barely tell that I&#x27;ve used any.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also very surprised at the terrible reviews I just read because I am very impressed with this product.  </li>
      <li>1 month is not long enough.  </li>

<li> I have wasted my $60 freaking dollars for nothing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very frustrated because I spent money and waste time using this product twice a day everyday for the last five weeks and have no positive results.</li>
<li> I still have bad acne though, and it&#x27;s pricey to do this when I keep getting new scars.</li>
<li> If my progress starts to plateau, I will stop buying, but the company does tell you that at least 6 months is recommended depending on the scarring to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> That said, I used the product both morning and night, but unfortunately did not notice any improvement.</li>
<li> As it is quite expensive, I would recommend against this purchase.</li>

<li> However, the other leg was still awful!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this for about two months before my wedding. I saw a reduction in the visibility of my acne scars. I still have bad acne though, and it&#x27;s pricey to do this when I keep getting new scars. When my acne dies down, I&#x27;ll purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certain this is like any product where it will work wonders for some people with certain skin types but not work at all for others. It worked for me though. If my acne would have stopped and I would have kept using it, I&#x27;m certain it would have seriously gotten rid of my acne scars.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well. Had some spots I put this solution on and it diminished the marks quickly. Glad I found this, works faster than coco butter.</li>
    <li> I had a breast reduction earlier this year which resulted in large surgical scars. After some research I decided to purchase a 3 month supply of Dermefface FX7. The formula was pleasant, non-odorous and absorbed into the skin quickly. That said, I used the product both morning and night, but unfortunately did not notice any improvement. As it is quite expensive, I would recommend against this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a  pretty large surgical scar, and this did nothing to reduce it.  Nothing else has either though.  May work on smaller scars, but after two bottles I have seen no improvement.</li>
    <li> I am finishing up my first bottle and it seems to be improving acne scars.  I did order one more bottle and will have a better feel for its effectiveness after the second bottle</li>
    <li> container was half-empty when I got it. pump was malfunctioned and it kept leaking on the sides. been using for a week and 1/2 and have seen no progress. compared to original photos scar has even gotten worse--how is that possible? waste of a lot of money, going to try to return for refund.</li>
    <li> This company should give back the money. This cream does nothing. I&#x27;ve used it for months and still no results. This company should be sued and shut down for good. They should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
    <li> I bought Skinception before I made a lot of research about the different products available for scars, so I choose this product over the others because it seemed to be the best, I started to use it Sept. 13/2013 and the scars didn&#x27;t reduce the size nor the color, they are still there big and red. I paid a lot of money for a product that didn&#x27;t work but according to the product information it works in the 4th week but nothing happens.  I&#x27;m very frustrated because I spent money and waste time using this product twice a day everyday for the last five weeks and have no positive results. I want my money back....</li>
    <li> I have used this product since the first week of October and I have DEFINITELY noticed improvements.  I have had acne scars for years and my acne is still an ongoing struggle.  This product is perfect for putting on under my makeup (I use Bare Minerals, NOT liquid foundation) and within the first month I noticed that my scars had lightened a bit.  Three months later, my skin is smoother, scars have been lightened and  are not nearly as deep as they were before I bought Dermefface.  That being said, I ordered a 6 month supply and I only have 1 bottle left 3 and a half months later because I&#x27;m using the product on my entire face twice a day, and not just a section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, WORTH THE MONEY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO INVEST THE TIME.  1 month is not long enough.  3 months isn&#x27;t long enough.  If my progress starts to plateau, I will stop buying, but the company does tell you that at least 6 months is recommended depending on the scarring to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with what it has done for me so far, but do your research and know what is expected of you and the product, 1 month to get rid of scarring is completely unrealistic.</li>
    <li> This product is a lie. Don&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;buy it. To be honest, i feel i lost my money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. works great on my skin marks caused by acne</li>
    <li> I bought this product after researching several and then watching the model who was in a car wreck (winner of that reality show that I don&#x27;t watch).  I had the same surgery on both of my legs which called for 3 incisions per leg.  I was told that I would have pencil line scars.  After the first surgery (July 30) I was devastated at the huge, raised scars that were about 1&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34;...far from a pencil line.  I felt that it was a combination of whoever stitched me as well as the girl taking the stitches out dug into my skin!  I was right.  I had the second surgery done (Nov 12) and I see the pencil line scarring that I was promised (thankfully).  However, the other leg was still awful!  I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and there is an amazing difference.  No, they are not gone, but they are so much better already.  I only have to use a dot of the oil per incision so I can barely tell that I&#x27;ve used any.  I think the bottle will last atleast 6 months at this rate (or more) so I&#x27;m not sure why the other reviews I read that someone would buy in bulk to start.  I&#x27;m also very surprised at the terrible reviews I just read because I am very impressed with this product.  My scars are already almost completely flat and have went from bright red to a brownish color.  I also see some great reviews on this page.  I think what this means is that we are all different and what works for some may not work for others.  With that said, it&#x27;s $60, it&#x27;s not like you have to get financed.  Try it.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, return it.  But whatever you do, don&#x27;t shy away because it didn&#x27;t work for someone else.  Look at me and all of the other great reviews on this page.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have wasted my $60 freaking dollars for nothing. It didn&#x27;t do what the product advertise to do. I just didn&#x27;t see no change on my skin tone or scars they are still there. Mederma works better then this piece of c%$p .&lt;br /&gt;:P.......</li>
    <li> you only have to use a very little bit to put on the scar for it to work - hopefully will work well!</li>
    <li> being using i for less than a month and I can see the difference! would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> I saw so good infos about this product and i ve been using this for 1 month applying to my old scars on my face twice a day.There is nothing change. My scars do not disappear at all.</li>
    <li> I did see much of a change to my marks. Us the product for month 1/2. Should have seen some improvement.</li>
