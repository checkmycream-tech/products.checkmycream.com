<li> My scalp is very dry and flaky</li>
<li> There was noticeable improvement within a week, and several weeks later he has hardly any flakes or itching and has told me how grateful he is for this product.</li>
<li> My scalp is always very dry, itchy and extremely flaky.</li>
<li> My hair goes half way down my back and is medium/thick.  </li>
<li> I also bought this topical solution from Amazon called Oxipor, which worked better than the shampoos but the smell was very unpleasant and it&#x27;s a bit drippy.      </li>
<li> I have a dry itchy scalp and this was not even soothing, much less did it help the problem.</li>
<li> Other products have not worked in the past such as Neutrogena.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have tried everything on this head of mine to ease my insanely itchy scalp. I have seborrheic dermatitis, so my scalp is extremely itchy, I have humongous flakes, and patches of build up throughout my head. I havd have tried every shampoo/conditioner under the sun including this super expensive Clobex prescription but nothing worked...until i tried this AMAZING line of products!  After 1 month my scalp had transformed!  I used to shampoo my hair every 3-5 days (BTW I am African-American and have curly/coily shoulder length hair). Now, I can shampoo every 7-9 days and cowash in between. My hair is less prone to breakage. This stuff is a winner. I hope that this will work for everyone the same way that it works for me!</li>
    <li> It really works great .</li>
    <li> Nothing else worked, but this did!!! I part my hair putting it directly onto my scalp (my hair doesn&#x27;t need the treatment - my scalp does) undiluted leaving it on for approximately 10 min. I have processed hair and it doesn&#x27;t pose a problem. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> My hair was very thin in the front. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now. I wash my hair every other day. But put the recovery serum on twice a day. I have lots of new hair coming back it. I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena products work better</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregg Huestis&lt;br /&gt;www.b2bablessing .org</li>
    <li> The old (blue label) version worked well. Nioxin reformulated -- the newer version isn&#x27;t very effective. So sad. If you order it, confirm you&#x27;re getting the old formula in the blue/green label. Otherwise, save your money.</li>
    <li> I am black and I have natural hair and over the past couple of years, I have developed some horrible flakes that my stylist thinks is psoriasis. She is my fourth stylist in about seven years and I noticed the flakes in with my second stylist. I have no direct diagnosis, but I think it was because I was sitting under the hair dryer and the head was drying my scalp out causing it to over produce oils. Anyway, stylist number three didn&#x27;t clear it up so I started going to stylist number 4. She began using the scalp recovery and I noticed a reduction in the amount of flakes in the crown of my head. On my next visit she gave me a bottle of the nioxin scalp recovery serum to use until I saw her the next time. The flakes reduced production again. They were virtually gone. However, I stopped using it and didn&#x27;t get my hair maintained for quite some time and the flakes came back. So, if you want this product to work for you and work well, you must use it consistently. I am not sure if she used a particular conditioner, but the shampoo + the serum work well for black women who can not wash their hair daily and struggle with psoriasis and bad dandruff. This is the treatment....not sure if it is a cure. I will be maintaining my own hair from here on out to avoid getting under the dryer. I will add to this to let you know how this works in about six months. FINGERS CROSSED!!!!!!!!! !^-^!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with psoriasis all of my life and this is the first product that has actually worked!  I have tried so many shampoo products and nothing had worked up until now.  It&#x27;s actually very gentle and makes my hair and scalp feel wonderful. I no longer have problems with flaking or itching.  My advice is to try this product if you&#x27;re looking for a long term solution to psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Worked!!!! Was a quick solution to my scalp issues... Treated and healed issue with 4 washes.</li>
    <li> After doing some research, I came across Nioxin Scalp Recovery kit and was slightly skeptical at first but I&#x27;m glad to have made this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend, like myself, suffer from dry skin and from time to time, his scalp gets extremely dry and after a few uses of this kit, his scalp is noticeably improved which means, LESS flakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that works well for him.</li>
    <li> My scalp is very dry and flaky I purchased this product hoping it would help but it made my scalp worse.</li>
    <li> I have experienced dry scalp for years and it feels like I have tried ever product that is in the market.  Local salon sold me the trial kit (shampoo, conditioner and serum)and within a couple of weeks the dryness and flaking scalp had disappered.  I then purchased the larger bottles through Amazon and have been flakless ever since.  I do not use every day, as it is quite a bit more expensive than other hair products, but that has not changed the results.  Highly recommend the product!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st review on any product. I have only use this system once, but after just one use my scapl feels and look so much better. my hair seems to have stop shedding and my hair feels a lot stronger and NO MORE FLACKING FOR NOW.</li>
    <li> works for my psoriasis but I did find that I have to continue using it over and over as it is not a cure for it.</li>
    <li> This scalp recovery system neither helped nor hindered my scalp psoriasis. I was expecting at least some relief but found none with this treatment set. I have moderate scalp psoriasis and really only find relief with prescription products. Wish this could have worked out!</li>
    <li> The nixion  scalp treatment helping my flaking scalp very much</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp for more than 2 years and it falls like a heavy snow fall from my head when i comb.I am not sure if it is scalp psoriasis or not. I tried many other hair products but couldn&#x27;t get rid of my scalp. After lot of search finally saw this on Amazon and though of giving it a try. It worked!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure about the results in first week. But after using it 2 weeks magic worked. No more dandruff. My hair looks good and fresh all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Shampoo and Conditioner once in 2 days for 2 weeks and Scalp Serum daily once. Now I am using shampoo twice a week and Serum once in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Over the period of a few decades, I&#x27;ve tried any product that promised relief from dry, itchy scalp. Within two weeks my symptoms were 90% improved and with continued use I&#x27;m 99%. Product is very concentrated and last me about 6 month with daily use.</li>
    <li> Itchy scalp is actually a result of an internal issue, but this set relieved my intense scalp itching and calmed it to the point it is almost gone.  Only took two or three shampoos to get there.  Thank goodness! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Does what it states. The price is decent, not over priced. I like that and I would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this kit.  I have tried so many things, and suffering from psoriasis, it has been a lot! When I first got it, I saw how small the bottles were and was concerned with how long it would last.  My hair goes half way down my back and is medium/thick.  I actually use a lesser amount then with my old shampoo/conditioner.  It makes my hair feel great afterwards and is so much lighter.  It strips the environmental damage from each strand and I could tell a huge difference.  As far as flakes, I don&#x27;t have any anymore and its only been a couple weeks.  Depending on which shampoo I used before, with every move I could see a flake fall and it was so embarrassing. The serum that comes with it, I only use twice a week.  I&#x27;m sure you could use it more, but I tend to forget since I don&#x27;t use a ton of product in my hair anyway.  I just never liked to put a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; in my hair because every time I do it looks greasy.  So far I haven&#x27;t had that problem and use it right after the shower and make sure I rub it in my scalp real good.  I used to itch a lot, now, nothing.  If I had to have a con for this, in the beginning it would have been the price.  But now knowing that I use less each time, and by the time I would buy my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner, its really not much more.  I DEFINITELY would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nioxin products several years ago and have always loved their products. Recently I decided to try Nioxin again because I noticed that my hair was falling out and that my scalp always had buildup on it and never felt \\&quot;clean\\&quot;. I&#x27;m currently using the #3 system but it has not helped with my dandruff problem. Soooo, I decided to give the Scalp Recovery System a try. After 4 washes, my dandruff and itchy scalp was completely gone!!! I highly recommend this product! I have used every anti-dandruff they have on the market (besides prescription products) and nothing has helped. Nioxin Scalp Recovery System was the only thing that worked. I will definitely be purchasing this product in a larger size!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was hopeful and it made no difference in any way.&lt;br /&gt;and I think it actually made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;shampoo and conditioners were okay, but the serum made it itch more :(&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return it if its possible.</li>
    <li> I suffer from scalp Psoriasis/Dermatitis w/biracial hair and a sensitive scalp.  I have tried everything from changing my diet, using special oils, pills, all store brand shampoos (Head and shoulders, T-Gel, Nizoral and More) Ebooks on Psoriasis etc.  I also bought this topical solution from Amazon called Oxipor, which worked better than the shampoos but the smell was very unpleasant and it&#x27;s a bit drippy.      Like many other ethnic women or any woman who spends a lot of time with a flat iron, do not wash my hair daily because of the work involved straightening it.  When I used Nioxin&#x27;s Scalp Recovery, I was amazed at how I immediately felt it soothe as I washed my hair &amp; scalp.  Despite this I was still skeptical thinkingtr the REAL test will be to see how soon my scalp will start itching.  With other shampoos my scalp would itch as my hair dried from washing.      With Scalp Recovery, my itching and flaking was reduced greatly right away, by the second shampoo it was clearly under control!  I am very impressed!  I really like the company Nioxin because they truly focus on scalp and hair health with all of their products.     I can&#x27;t promise you this will work for you (everybody is different) but I can promise you that this review is real and this product worked for me!    It is DEFINITELY worth a try for desperate people with flaky/itchy scalp problems.</li>
    <li> My scalp was itchy, red, and had bumps all over it after having chemo treatment.  These products helped immensely!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and my dad had psoriasis ever since he came back from Vietnam &amp; this is the only product for his hair.</li>
    <li> Still have dandruff. Wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Ive had an itchy scalp for several years now. Ive tried many products over the years with very little or no success at all. After trying Nioxin Scalp Recovery Treatment Kit the itching has stopped almost entirely. Although I do still experience very little itching at times, it is a far cry of having to scratch my scalp every two minutes or so. What a major relief this has been for me. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Product was new and came in fast ty will order again</li>
    <li> Both bottles were marked conditioner</li>
    <li> My scalp is always very dry, itchy and extremely flaky. Other products have not worked in the past such as Neutrogena. After one wash I noticed a huge difference. My scalp was not flaky by far and no longer itchy. I was having to wash my hair several times a week due to being so flaky and itchy which is not the usual. (I&#x27;m African-American so normally I would wash my hair once a week) But after using this shampoo I was able to my once a week regimen as I previously did and no longer had the intense itching. It was a huge relief. The only thing is i&#x27;ve just run out of the shampoo and have washed my hair with regular shampoo and have noticed the difference. I will be buying more of this shampoo immediately.</li>
    <li> completely satisfied with the product. my 20 years pain gone now. I had severe scalp on my head. I Used many shampoo but nioxin helped me. kudos to manufacturers</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I have psoriasis and after several uses of this shampoo and conditioner my scalp itching and flaking became 10 times worse. Paid for these kit 74$, the next day it was 24$, made me think that this product is a total scam.</li>
    <li> This product works better than the prescription scalp medicine I was given. Love this product and will continue to purchase! The conditioner is great my hair feels very soft and manageable. I&#x27;m almost 3yrs natural with no chemicals and this product still works great and my hair use to get washed 2 times a week now I&#x27;m down to once a week stays conditioned and very minimal signs of flaking on my clothes. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have a dry itchy scalp and this was not even soothing, much less did it help the problem. I wasted my money on this product.</li>
    <li> I was having hair loss I thought was due to female androgenic alopecia, and thought this stuff would at least help keep the dht out of my follicles.  I used the sebhorreic dermatitis serum just because.  My hair has stopped shedding like crazy!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend, who has persistent dandruff for years and has tried a multitude of products in search of relief. There was noticeable improvement within a week, and several weeks later he has hardly any flakes or itching and has told me how grateful he is for this product. Definitely exceeded expectations and I will make sure he has it on hand whenever he needs it in the future!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp. This kit has done more to relieve itch and sooth than any other shampoo/conditioner combo I have ever tried. And, that includes many, many brands, plus prescriptions. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for scaly scalp and this seems to be the only thing that works.  I wish it didn&#x27;t come with the scalp recovery stuff as I never use that (but can&#x27;t find it cheaper without it) but it keeps my scalp clear and free of itching and scabs/scales.  It only takes a tiny bit to clean even long hair.</li>
    <li> It takes time I cannot answer the question now.</li>
    <li> I recently started getting a really dry scalp with God awful dandruff and scaling. Came out of nowhere this winter and has literally driven me crazy for about 2 months now. I&#x27;ve always used Argon oil so I now that doesn&#x27;t help with dry scalp. I&#x27;ve literally tried everything with no success. I literally avoid leaving the house because of this. I&#x27;m recently unemployed and don&#x27;t have insurance to see a doctor but I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t normal at all. My hair is thinning and breaking off the works. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! I&#x27;ve only been using it a about a week and can already tell it&#x27;s starting to work. The leave in stuff helps alot. I&#x27;m hoping it will resolve my out of the blue issues and I can move past this awful experience.</li>
    <li> No other product that I used worked on my dry itching scalp. My head itched so bad I was in tears. I found Nioxin on Amazon. It was truly a God send. The first time I used it it worked immediately. I didn&#x27;t have results like this from anything else I had tried. Thank you God and Amazon for sending Nioxin my way.Fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> my mother loves this the kit  Nixoin help her a lot her scalp is  clearing up great.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and it worked!</li>
    <li> It did not seem to improve my condition. Of course, it may work for others- just didn&#x27;t work in my case.</li>
