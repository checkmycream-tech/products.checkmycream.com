<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really great product I loved how My skin under my eyes looked and felt I recieved this product for review and testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> This is a great eye gel. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. I think the black under my eyes, has been fading. It soaks in really nice also. I know one of the most important things for skin and prevent aging is keeping your skin hydrated. This will definitely help.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and the fact that it is fragrance free.  I&#x27;ve also enjoyed other Radha Beauty products I&#x27;ve ordered.  However, I have not seen any noticeable improvement for my dark circles.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is working great so far. I have not used it long enough to see a ton of difference as far as wrinkles but the non greasy formula sinks right into the skin. I will keep using and monitor its progress :)</li>
    <li> this eye gel is some amazing stuff helped withthe dark circles and puffiness tremendously.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually suffer from puffy eyes or dark circles but I have noticed after I use this product I just look refreshed and awake. Its great for those days were I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep. I love products that make your skin happy because lets face it having happy skin makes you happy :)</li>
    <li> This product did reduce the dark circles around my eyes, but the wrinkles are still there.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. This is a great quality product that my sister and her friends use all the time.</li>
    <li> A great product for eyes. Pleasant scent, very light and application is quick and simple. I have dark circles and dark eyelids due to being anemic. So this product was just what I was looking for to add to my routine. Keep up the great work Radha, can&#x27;t wait to see what you develop next!!</li>
    <li> my wife just started using product so far seems to be working fine after about five days,</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work to well, I&#x27;ve been rubbing it on my wife for a week now, and the old bag is still here!!!</li>
    <li> After 2 months the dark circles are still there as is the puffiness.  Feels nice after applying but like all other eye creams it does not perform miracles on aged skin.</li>
    <li> This product is very good when you apply the product it stay very well under the eye doesn&#x27;t smear away like many other products. I do see a difference using this product it makes my eyes look more awake! Other than that I don&#x27;t have major problems like wrinkles and dark circles my under eye just looked tired if you know what I mean. So yea I&#x27;m happy and will buy this again :)</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference after using this for one week, I will buy again...</li>
    <li> Feels healthy on my skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. It really works. Great product. Seen results in a week.</li>
    <li> still puffy after all these years!      I have to add that after I noted that my eyes are ALWAYS puffy...no matter what...these people totally refunded me with a nice note.   So I am sorry!    Give it a try.  It is the Irish eyes I inherited from my mother which no product would help.   But try it yourself.</li>
    <li> I have only used this eye gel for one week but I could feel and see a difference in the appearance of my dark circles and puffiness right away. Another unexpected benefit that I noticed was that my eyes didn&#x27;t feel tired, the skin around my eyes felt more toned, and I didn&#x27;t look tired, like I usually do. I compared this eye gel&#x27;s ingredients with others that cost anywhere from $50-$100 and decided to try this one and so far I am very pleased</li>
    <li> On my eyelids this gel burned and caused my eyes to become red, puffy,  and irritated.  On my forehead little blister type bumps appeared (it said could use the gel for this area).  Under my eyes seemed to tolerate this gel okay although burned a bit going on.  I no longer use it except under the eyes since I had a reaction to it.  Won&#x27;t buy again since I had such a reaction to it.</li>
    <li> nice for wrinkles, did not improve the bag, circle under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but I&#x27;m pretty sure only surgery can fix my eye bags.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through three different eye wrinkle products and haven&#x27;t purchased them again. This one, however, I like. It keeps my eye area from drying out and has made my wrinkles a little less visible. Not a miracle cure but keeps the wrinkles at bay and feels nice for the entire day. Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t possess a scent.</li>
    <li> I use this under my eyes every day along with a vit c serum for my face [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex]] and the combo of these two is very powerful! I can see more lines coming off my face every day.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Bought my second one already :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect smell, perfect texture, and works great!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to giving Radha Beauty&#x27;s Intensive Eye Gel a try.  I personally found this product to be incredible, I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I love the results that I am seeing. Even my friends have noticed a change in my dark under eye circles, so much so that they have ordered some for themselves. The product feels great on the skin, a little goes a long way and it tightens the skin which feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have supper sensitive eyes, so it is very hard to find a product not making your eyes to turn red or full of tears or more...&lt;br /&gt;I got this eye cream a few weeks ago together with OZ naturals eye serum. OZ naturals had so many good reviews, so I started it first, after two weeks my eyes could not take it anymore (allergy).&lt;br /&gt;So, I started to use this eye cream. Used it for two weeks to see what happens. First of all, thank you very much! No allergy. Plus, it is not heavy, feels good on eyes, and helps to reduce the puffiness somewhat. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a week. Lines around my eyes are disappearing.  The bottle is small but little dabs of gel goes along way. I also dab onto my eyelids and forehead as other reviews suggest. At this rate by the time the bottle is finished, I hope all the small lines will disappear as well. I&#x27;ve applied the gel twice a day for seven days. Five stars here. I don&#x27;t know what will happen if I stop using.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream.  I have been so impressed with this company and the products, I have purchased more moisture cream, cleaning product, Rosehip oil and more argon oil.  The products are far better than a name brand product, and far less costly.  Better yet, the size of the product is bigger.  Win win situation. I am a customer forever.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  So soothing and seems to improve eye area without any creepy chemical to have strange effects on your skin.</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Product goes on smooth and it only takes a dot for both eyes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long but do like the way it feels under my eyes. It is a thicker gel than normal which I really like. So far, the puffiness under eyes has gone down a bit. Will next you know in a few more😊. Received this on time and packaged well. Buy with confidence</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 weeks and the results have not been positive. I purchased this product due to the surprisingly high reviews, but I am dissatisfied with this product. This gel instead of hydrating under my eyes, causes severe dryness. It has produced wrinkles and redness. I will throw this were away... Buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> Really wakes me up, and I see my dark circles have disappeared it&#x27;s amazing and I can&#x27;t wait for the next product they come out because I am definitely getting it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, so far no complaints. To soon to give actual judgement. Will keep updates</li>
    <li> I am in love with this cream -- I use it day and night! I am starting to see spots/discolorations and crows feet on the sides of my eyes, as well as bags/drooping and dark circles under the eye -- and this eye cream helps reduce all these issues. I have only been using (religiously) for a little while, but I see and feel the difference. I feel great that I am doing something about it - not just sitting by and watching it happen, and I&#x27;m no longer investing in cheap, ineffective creams, serums, and salves.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product. I doubt everything&#x27;s possibility and this one changed my mind. I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and notice a huge difference when I get out of bed in the am. Usually I&#x27;m very puffy and dark. I have seen a 80% improvement. Thanks for boosting my ego Radha! This will be my go to eye cream.</li>
    <li> Radha Beauty is one of the best merchants I&#x27;ve ever purchased from; their products are outstanding and they have a unbelievably informative and helpful Customer Assistance staff. They are thoughtful, considerate, responsive, customer-sensitive and a pleasure to deal with and provide fast, on-time delivery.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes itch. I did not like the ingredients either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife. She loves it. She is seeing great results. This product is working great for her.</li>
    <li> This eye gel works great and you can just feel it tightening the skin. Dark circles are gone too!</li>
    <li> still got the bags under my eyes so it was a waste of money and time putting it on my eyes twice a day.</li>
    <li> I find the product refreshing. It feels good when applied and has a pleasant feel.</li>
    <li> Best under-eye cream I have ever used. After just a few drops, my eyes feel refreshed and the skin feels smoother and more elastic. Handy dispenser pump gives just the right amount of cream. It smells wonderful, like a light melon/cucumber scent, that is light and very enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, because I have hereditary dark circles under my eyes, and I have tried so many things and NONE were as good as Radha Beauty Products. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to feel perked up and younger. This is AMAZING stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Wonderfully sized bottle with pump. A little goes a long ways and does not leave your eyes feeling greasy or sticky like so many do!&lt;br /&gt;Love the refreshing feel of this cream.</li>
    <li> So far seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> I know they put the oz. on the product info, but I still wasn&#x27;t expecting such a small bottle.  Well, about the product--I think it works just as well as all the other eye products I have tried.  I don&#x27;t feel that it made any difference with my slight crows feet, if that&#x27;s what you want to know.  It was okay.  Maybe I&#x27;m supposed to be using it for at least 2 months before giving it a true review.</li>
    <li> I have puffy bags under my eyes.  I have tried hundreds of products and I know I eventually will need surgery to remove them.  However, if there is one product that helps firm this area, it is this one.  I love it so much that I am purchasing another one for my son.</li>
    <li> Having tried very expensive eye creams-&lt;br /&gt;Obagi, skin Medica, dr perricone, this is much more affordable and gives you wonderful results within  a short period.  I had dark circles under the eyes it worked faster than the expensive creams.  The price is too good to be true!  I also like the fact that it comes in an attractive pump so we are not wasting product on spatulas or having to dig fingers with long nails in a jar.  I have seen a  huge noticeable difference in the wrinkles as well.  Very pleased with product especially the price.  Will be sticking to this eye cream and checking out their other products.</li>
    <li> I think the puffiness and fine lines are somewhat better looking now.  But I will be trying another product to see if I can get better results.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes, yet this wonderful product does not irritate at all!!  It feels wonderful, and soaks on right away!!!</li>
    <li> Radha Beauty Eye Gel is lightweight and effective. After my first use I notice my eyes appeared fresh and my skin felt moisturized. I love this Eye Gel, I haven&#x27;t found anything as good as the Radha Eye Gel for my eyes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this gel after trying another one that didn&#x27;t work for me.  So far i like it. The skin under my eyes is hydrated without greasy feeling, and no pilling of my concealer. Not much progress with dark circles, but puffiness is definitely improved. I would likely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE USES THIS PRODUCT. SHE IS HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS AND HAS REQUESTED ME TO PLACE A REORDER.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me !</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. Makes under eyes smooth and seems to make fine lines less visible ( don&#x27;t have many), hasn&#x27;t done much for my dark circles which I was really hoping to see results with. Also doesn&#x27;t really have any moisturizing effect which is needed in the winter.</li>
    <li> After doing some research and reading all the rave reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try. I only recently started noticing a little puffiness and some dark circles under my eyes, and figured I&#x27;d nip the problem in the bud. After the first day of using this cream, I woke up with more puffiness and my tiny wrinkles turned turned into deep creases. I was horrified, but decided I&#x27;d give it another try. After 5 consecutive days of use it seems that this cream has done exactly the opposite of what is advertised! My puffiness now looks like bags, my tiny wrinkles like creases (at least there&#x27;s no change for the worse in my dark circles). I&#x27;m happy this cream worked for so many people, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t worked for me!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells weird and I&#x27;m not convinced it does anything.  I didn&#x27;t notice any positive changes.  I did notice that it has a very odd smell to it that I found to discourage me from wanting to use it.</li>
    <li> I loved the texture of this gel, it was creamy but not sticky. A little bit goes a long way. One little dot can do your whole eye and then some. My eyes are so hydrated. I am already seeing less under eye circles and my fine lines are diminishing! I also used this on my forehead and those lines are nearly gone already!!! I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet, but I have been trying different creams to prevent them. It definitely ranks up there with pricey departments store brands but a much affordable price. My white bottle is a limited edition packing back stock from over the holidays, it is usually in a black bottle. I hope to see more products from Radha Beauty real soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Been using this per instructions for about a month and see zero results. I bought this product because it had nothing but 5 star ratings at the time but I see now that was just a scam. If you are reading, please don&#x27;t be fooled like I was. I&#x27;m pretty sure the positive ratings for this are all or mostly fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy. What a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> Use: I followed the instructions and dabbed this milky gel around my eyes, forehead and cheek area with your fingertips. I used it both in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This eye gel applied easily and had a light scent. I used it for a couple weeks, and it is something I would continue using.  I used this after applying the Radha Beauty Vitamin C Serum and before the Retinol Moisturizing Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
    <li> I definitely think that it lightened my dark circles under my eyes.  It also firmed up the bagginess.  I don&#x27;t think it did much for the wrinkles (it did smooth them out a little bit temporarily), but I guess you can&#x27;t expect everything.  The price was great and worked better than any other product I have used.  I also have to say that I do not  use it morning and night - mostly morning, so maybe it would have worked better had I used it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane</li>
    <li> Love the Radha Eye Gel.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and it goes on smoothly with one pump from the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> not sure if it reduces puffiness yet, but it is the only product I&#x27;ve found not to sting or irritate my eyes. My skin is so sensitive, most products burn the skin and turn red. ie: shiseido, estee lauder, origins, but this one is very mild and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It makes the skin around my eyes soft and I really think it&#x27;s making a difference. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It&#x27;s cooling.  I haven&#x27;t notice any dramatic differences.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the high ratings. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. I actually had more finer wrinkles and nothing happened with my dark circles at all. Nothing. I will go back to my Garnier Eye Roller, I was hoping something would work better. This wasn&#x27;t it. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> By far best eye cream ever !!  It works !! Yes I suffer from dark circle last couple year due aging I guess , I have try so many brand names eye creams anyone you can think of yes I have try it I even try to use restylan for under eyes and nothing seems to make the dark of my under eyes to go away , I&#x27;ve being using this gel cream for a month and I being noticing that my skin under my eyes looks slightly lighter I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t even have to worry about applying powder anymore I highly recommend this product ..</li>
    <li> Like the gel easy to apply.  Light in texture.  Thankyou. Jill Lehr</li>
    <li> Look like you got 8 hours of sleep, every night no matter how much you actually got. Reduces puffiness and under eye dark circles and bags. Huge quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using this for about a week. Pros: does not cause eyes to sting, not greasy, soaks in quickly, seems to brighten general eye area. Cons: so far, doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping with puffiness or dark circles, but then again, I have only been using it for a week.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I have tried so many eye crams and gels but you can feel and see the difference this one makes! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This product really works! In just a few days, I can tell a big difference! :) Great smell too!</li>
    <li> Product received packed with well and in a timely manner. I have only been using the product for a week , twice a day, but will say that the dark circles (only a slight problem for me) do seem to diminish after applying. I do defiantly notice a reduction in eye puffiness. I have super sensitive skin and was worried about the ingredients so I contacted the company. They responded readily with the full ingredient listing and were willing to work with me if I didn&#x27;t think THIS product would be ok for my skin. I can honestly say that I have seen no negative impact on my super sensitive skin which mad me happy. This is the second purchase from this company and so far I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I just got it a few days ago and I already have results! I&#x27;ve had puffy undereyes since I was a child, and they&#x27;re basically vanishing right in front of me. Goodbye, concealer. Hello Radha Beauty!</li>
    <li> I should have been more skeptical when saw those miracle describing generic reviews. I think Amazon must find a way to filter all these paid fake reviews. As far as the products goes, sticky and unpleasant feeling with no effect!</li>
    <li> Makes eyes look &amp; feel great.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results. Bought this 2 months ago.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that leaves the skin around the eyes feeling soft and refreshed. Started working within a few applications. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product does work. It visibly reduces the size of the bags below my eyes, and it lasts. I applied my moisturizer and let it dry. Then applied my makeup normally after my moisturizer dried. Even customers where I worked commented. They asked if I had been sleeping better, someone also told me I even looked younger and asked what was i using  I told her about the eye gel, she asked for the brand and where I had purchased it, so I shared the information.</li>
    <li> Radha eye cream is the first cream I have used which has really taken away some of my undereye bags. I recommend it strongly.</li>
    <li> My crows feet are less visible.</li>
    <li> I used this gel for the first time last night and it was amazing. The puffiness underneath my eyes disappeared within minutes. It has a light, non-greasy texture that feels good on my skin. I&#x27;m wearing it now under my makeup and am very pleased with its performance. I would recommend this to my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for a couple of weeks now and so far I am very impressed. It leaves my eye area feeling refreshed. I love that there are no harmful ingredients and that it is organic. I will update my review in another couple of weeks with the results.</li>
    <li> just wasted my money, didn&#x27;t not work at all, used for 2 weeks and caused my puffiness to get worst.</li>
    <li> I just received my Eye Cream and I&#x27;m so excited.i used it on the bags under my eyes and WOW, what a difference in just one use!</li>
    <li> Here is my girlfriend&#x27;s review, since this was for her - The first thing I noticed about this product is the fresh cucumber smell, which I love!  This product worked great at making my eye area appear brighter and more youthful.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Have not seen much difference</li>
    <li> Great results so far as well as great sales experience.  From the packaging (some of these smaller portioned products the package is monstrous to compared to the super small amount within), to the quick delivery... all is excellent!</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel/cream! If done mean it&#x27;s good...it&#x27;s fantastic. I have recently been subject to an odd reaction to something I&#x27;m still trying to narrow down in My home. My eyes get inchy, then burn, then I scratch and pour eye drops and lose the battle to puffy painful to blink eyes for the remainder of that day...untill today! I went thru each stage and ended up in the shower hoping for relief..now mind you I am fairly new to this product but liked it so much I already adapted it easily into my 2x daily routine...so I didn&#x27;t expect today to go any different until I lay there for a min or 30, and opened my eyes and it didn&#x27;t hurt to blink. I immediately looked in the mirror and saw MY eyes, actually less puffy than many mornings and although they were red, they not only looked so much better , that felt better. I&#x27;m not claiming they are a cure to whatever is going on with my eyes, but definitely calmed the tissues around my eyes . sadly I am on the verge of another attack, but smiled when i looked over at my dresser and relized that radha was the only thing I did differently and brought comfort and calmed the tissue around my eyes and had to immediately share my experience and thank radha for an amazing product. I thankfully have now 2 new products ( one being another company I found here on Amazon) that have replaced high priced chemical compounds that yes kept me youthful in appearance I just kept thinking and questioning y the words and newest best thing began to crossout and cross over to the point I think the last newest best was in fact the first newest best. To save the migraine to follow I haunted my routine and began to look elsewhere, I&#x27;m so glad I did. There are many good eye gel to choose from here on Amazon. This was the second one I tried. Although the previous a very good product I&#x27;m sure my eyes called the shots in the end. Very few products , actually none till now have had this calming affect. I can only think it must be the cucumber because that is always effective IF I have one on hand and that is rare. And that is temporary at best. So thank u radha.at is always effective IF I have one on hand and that is rare. And that is temporary at best. So thank u radha.</li>
    <li> I originally had a problem with a cracked bottle and no response from the company. However, my opinion has changed. Radha called and made this right. I have a new bottle on the way! That made me happy!</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie who never write reviews.  I have been using this product for approximately 2 weeks and have noticed dark circles diminishing.  I have suffered for years from chronic dark circles that often looks like I&#x27;m suffering from major eye trauma.  I have used very expensive to less expensive products that have never worked. Give this product time to work.  I almost decided to stop using after week 1 but did not and am pleased I did not.. I give it 4 stars and will update to 5 if darkness disappears permanently.</li>
    <li> fine product, but did not work on my puffiness</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now nad have not seen a difference</li>
    <li> Use daily, haven&#x27;t seen changes, though ,yet</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome! It literally made all my crows feet fly away!  The morning puffiness? Gone!&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, hubby said to me.  You look different younger, vibrant, glowing.  He has no idea I am using this gel.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it at night before bed.  Looking for a natural gel that works.?  Look no further!  Also in regards to application.&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a LOOOONG way.  Been applying daily for about 3 weeks and the bottle is still full.</li>
    <li> This is a ripoff. Thanks a lot Don Imus.</li>
    <li> I have tried a TON of stuff for under eye circles &amp; this honestly seems to make a difference. I&#x27;ve also been putting it on my fine line &amp;#34;worry lines&amp;#34; and I swear to god it looks better. Granted, this is all stuff that most people likely wouldn&#x27;t notice right away since I&#x27;m still young. But I feel better using this and will continue to use it since I love how I feel. Confidence booster. Plus it smells like cucumber so it&#x27;s refreshing and nice :)</li>
    <li> 5 STARS- I love this product!</li>
    <li> I used this eye gel for a week and I liked so far.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see that it does much. Does feel good on eyes, cooling. but as far as removing anything:not so much</li>
    <li> WOW!  I am impressed! I have had dark circles all my life.. and this has helped tremendously in the 2 weeks I have been using it. I just started esthetics school and have been learning about skin care ingredient sand the ingredient list for this product is AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I wish the packaging was more ecologically friendly - less plastic. That is the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product. Otherwise the cream is great.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any other I&#x27;ve used and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes.</li>
    <li> Great products.  Works well.  Does the trick!</li>
    <li> As a medical student, I tend to have the WORST under eye dark awful circles! This eye gel is pretty amazing and is the best I&#x27;ve encountered at making me look more rested. Not only does it improve the discoloration under my eyes, but it reduces puffiness and really smoothes out the area under my eyes. It&#x27;s lightly scented like cucumber, and goes on with a nice cooling effect! Unlike other eye creams it won&#x27;t leave your eye area super greasy either. Such a fantastic deal for so little money!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! I have been using it for a few days and I already see improvements in the dark circles, they look a lot lighter and works great for puffiness! Thank you for this great product!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many this is far the best</li>
    <li> This eye gel did not help my undereye wrinkles look better, in fact they look worse. The seller did refund my money so their money back guarantee is true if the eye gel doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of the product , very soothing.  I really like the fact that the seller is very consumer oriented and is proactive with help and directions on how to use the product. A+</li>
    <li> LIKED ALOT  WORKS GREAT  I USE IT ALL OVER FACE</li>
    <li> Does not work for me :( I have some fine lines around my eyes and dark circles. I have not noticed a difference after twice daily use for several weeks. I actually think it started looking better after I quit using this serum. Very Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It really works well.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I would like to leave a better review, because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product.  However, when I received it, so much of it had squeezed out of the dispenser and was in a huge mess inside the lid.  It appeared that I lost quite a bit of it.</li>
    <li> I just started using product so far seems to be working fine after about A week，I love the smell of cucumbers,thank you !</li>
    <li> This eye gel uses hyaluronic acid and plant stem cells to help revitalized your under eyes. This gel is definitely the thinnest gel that I have used to date, at first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like that aspect but it really is beneficial. Having a thin gel allows it to dry relatively quickly and allow me to put on makeup without a problem afterwards. I really like this gel as I feel that I can use it as a pick me up during the day if needed and not look like a have crazy gel all over my eyes. The skin under my eyes has become more soft and bright.    The only downside I have to this gel is it is a small size at .5oz. When I say small that is definitely comparatively. I think this is the best performing gel I have used, and little goes a long way so this should last me quite awhile.    This product was sent to me free of charge. This review and my thoughts are all my own.</li>
    <li> I have never found an eye cream that even slightly helps with one problem much less everything this cream helps.  I figured this eye cream may help a little like everything else on the market and it was a great price so I really didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  I could see a difference with my crows feet in one day.  Yes I said one day.  I have now been using it a week and they are drastically diminished and it can just get better.  I plan on buying ALL of there products.  If you are looking for an eye cream that REALLY works, this is it.  It really is amazing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream for my wife.  She loves the product and it has greatly reduced or eliminated puffiness and dark circles under her eyes.  She has previously used eye creams that resulted in eye irritation but this product she loves.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the dark circles and bags under my eyes since I started using this product. I have tried so many different products over the years to remove the bags and dark circles. Most made no difference and a few even made them more noticeable. Some even bleached the color from my eye area, except for the dark circles. This eye gel really made a difference. I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference right away, it took almost two weeks for the bags and circles to really disappear. I noticed a gradual change after the first week and by the end of the second week there was a huge difference. My husband even noticed the difference. A few people thought I had been getting more sleep!!I applied the eye gel once in the morning and once before bed. It only takes a very small amount, so this will last a long time. I was to the point where I thought nothing would ever help when I received a free sample of the Radha Beauty eye cream. I am really glad I did!</li>
    <li> One star because the consistency in nice.. After one month of faithfully using this product morning and night, absolutely no change. Since so many reviews are positive, maybe I received an inferior product? The product is guaranteed, so Amazon gave me a credit, even though the time for a return had expired.</li>
    <li> I use and try out a lot of fabulous (and expensive) beauty products, because I work in the beauty industry...and this eye gel keeps up with the best results!  I am over 40 and used it during the winter, which is when the skin is dryer than EVER, and my eye area looks refreshed instead of dry and crinkly!  GREAT!</li>
    <li> Good but not as effective as some other brands.</li>
    <li> This item was received on time and as described.</li>
    <li> It works! I am pleasantly surprised and very happy with this product. It truly reduces any puffiness I may have and the area around my eyes looks younger than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I completely love it it has helped my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> very good product. smoothed out, small crows feet. did remove my dark circles. but,,,,,,,,,one must use twice daily[am/pm] for at least 3 weeks and sorry to say it did not remove my puffiness, which overall is the only reason i gave four stars. i recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel each day along with the retinol cream and vitamin C serum.  I love the way it makes the skin around my eyes feel tighter as soon as I put it on.  I do not have any puffiness or wrinkles (yet) that I am trying to combat so I&#x27;m using it more as a preventative measure.  So far I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product so far. It seems to have smoothed out the fine lines under my eyes and is helping with my dark circles. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> love it  &amp;#34;the lotion is wonderful&amp;#34;  and it came on time</li>
    <li> Drying and made my not so visible lines more pronounced. Might work for others and that goes for any cream available in the market.Giving it three stars for good customer service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I would say my dark circles are a little lighter and a little less puffy.</li>
    <li> I really loved this eye gel!! I use it in the morning and at night. I could feel it working and tightening my eye area immediately. After about 2 weeks of use I noticed my eye area was brighter and generally younger looking. It smelled a little like plants, probably from the plant stem cells, not a bad smell though. I did receive a free sample of this for testing purposes. For a more in depth review, visit my blog post about it: http://www.gorgeousandstuff.com/2015/02/radha-beauty-review.html</li>
    <li> Very very small. See tiny bic lighter comparison.</li>
    <li> Feels like it is working.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product, it does not do what it claims. I have puffiness under my eyes. I used this cream faithfully, only to find out that it produced no results at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a night owl, and it&#x27;s always evident by the bags and dark circles around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been trying to take better care of them, and this cream from Rahda Beauty has been my little secret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I&#x27;ve slept a full night I have bags under my eyes. After using this cream for a few days I&#x27;ve noticed them start to recede back into my face! It&#x27;s taken care of a lot of puffiness I&#x27;d usually get if I&#x27;d been awake for too long. I love how evenly and cleanly it absorbs into my skin. It&#x27;s nice to be able to sleep and actually look like I&#x27;ve slept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a night person, any help I can get in the morning is amazing. The handy pump on this cream makes it super easy to dispense exactly what I need without having tons of product on my fingers. The top is easy to remove and snaps back on securely to keep the pump safe. The pump is also a bit smaller, so it&#x27;s easy to stick in my purse if I know I&#x27;m going to be gone for the night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this cream from Rahda Beauty! I can&#x27;t wait to see how it affects my face long-term! I did receive this product for free but price doesn&#x27;t change how well it works, nor does it effect my review!</li>
    <li> this product is awesome and does all the seller claims... Great price, great product and more....&lt;br /&gt;George</li>
    <li> Only used it for 2-3 weeks.  I am hoping there are cumulative effects.</li>
    <li> I probably have 50 different under eye serums, creams and gels in my bathroom, all going to waste, as well as my money trying them out. There was a decent one I bought previously, but it didn&#x27;t firm up under my eyes or give me the results that this one did at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 50. Eeehh gads!  So in my 40&#x27;s, I tried so many anti-aging products, some of which are good. But I still needed something that would not burn under my extremely sensitive eyes. Anything with heavy perfumes always does my eyes in. I have greasy skin to begin with, so heavy creams have been horrible and start moving into my eyes and I can&#x27;t see. Does anyone have this problem? It&#x27;s nuts how I have a fog over my eyes until I was my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, based on the reviews, and usually at least 10 are fake, I thought I would try this product since it had so many. I thought surely the majority were legit. I was right and so were they. This under-eye gel is really nice. It&#x27;s not magic, mind you, but I use my Clean and Clear Advanced face wash (with Salicylic acid - I used to use the Benzoyl Peroxide one but got this by mistake in a shipment and like it better) with my Clarisonic Mia 2, then put my Belitae Vitamin C on (cannot live without it, no joke), then my Persagel (cause I&#x27;m so greasy), and THEN I put this under-eye gel on. I even put makeup on over it, and when I wore makeup before, you could see the horrible wrinkles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, when I put my makeup on after it all dried, I&#x27;m not kidding, the wrinkles were not there. I was like, holy cow. Did I have an under-eye lift or what? I rarely wear makeup cause of how much older it makes me look, but this is an option I have now when I want to look and feel &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34; without feeling like cake mix is sitting under my eyes in all the creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No burning. No stinging. No big scent. My eyes like it. I look better with makeup on. It&#x27;s a win-win. Had to share. Thanks to the maker of this product. Many of us out there needed you!duct. Many of us out there needed you!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Ive been using the more expensive Oil Of Olay Anti Wrinkle Pro on my eyes. This works better!!!!! Under eye circles gone! Blackness around eye is so much better! The only one negative thing is it doesn&#x27;t last all day. Have to reapply it if ur out ALL day. Great product 4 the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help get rid of dark circles under my eyes. The product did not help me with this problem. The fact that the product did not help may have more to do with my unrealistic expectations of the product than it did with the product itself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Wish I had before and after pix. As a matter of fact, I began to use it all over my face! I feels great thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product works!  At 57, I have developed smile lines under my eyes and above my lips.  I have only had this product for less than a week and it works almost instantly!  I wish I had taken a before and after photo to add to my review as other customers had.  I would definitely recommend this product and will certainly continue to purchase it.  I may even check out their other products they are selling on Amazon!</li>
    <li> love this. I noticed a difference in my bags under my eyes and my dark circles from the first time I used it. every morning and night I use it I immediately notice a difference, so I started to skip a few days to see if the dark circles look any better over time and they do.</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any results. Update 12/7/14 Unfortunately this eye gel did not work for me but I was contacted by the seller&#x27;s customer service and they refunded my money plus sent me a new product! I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I like it so far, normally my skin breaks out after using any type of cream etc. so far so good and my skin seems to be softer and firmer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it is suppose to take to see results but I see no difference at all.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this product, u can see the difference in just one week.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have spent untold number of $ over the years on eye creams and gels for puffiness and nothing has worked like this product. This is the third time I have reordered it. It goes on easy. It is light and works well with makeup or no makeup, day or night. I have never used another eye product that even comes close to this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple months. I think it is working a little but hard to tell.</li>
    <li> Not irritating or bad smelling. The consistency of the product itself is good and I am starting to see improvements over the past 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and I have bags and dark circles on my lower eye lids.  Radha product did not improve my eye lid issues.</li>
    <li> I must admit I love this product and immediately see a difference in my tired-looking eyes.  However, the bottle is so small and runs out quickly and I wish the effect on my eyes would last longer than after I just put it on...</li>
    <li> Good Product &amp; Good Price, Fast Shipping~&lt;br /&gt;Quite Recommendable!</li>
    <li> * I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE OF CHARGE TO REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the product I realized I could not benefit from it so I allowed 3 people I know to review this product for me. One was a diabetic who always has dark circles under his eyes. One constantly had puffy and saggy eyes from travel and not enough sleep and the other was a young female who has crows eyes which seems to run in her famly. Long story short, this product worked perfectly for all 3. Although this is a .5 fl oz bottle, it really lasts a long time. It smells good as well like eucalyptus and cucumber combined. The texture of the gel is like lotion and vaseline combined.</li>
    <li> Great product, finally I&#x27;ve found an eye cream that works.  I inherited my moms bags and the older I get the worse they look, my struggles started recently when I begin having allergies which made my eyes looked even worse with constant puffiness.  I read the reviews and again out of desperation I ordered this cream. Well  I do not believe in miracles but for me it was a 24 hour result. I threw my other creams in the trash and have ordered my second bottle.  I only hope this Company stays true and continue to offer Authentic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Intensive Youth Eye Gel by Radha Beauty for three weeks and I&#x27;m impressed with the results.  I&#x27;ve been using Radha Beauty&#x27;s Intensive Youth Eye Gel in conjunction with their Retinol Moisturizer and Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate question is does it work? After only a week I started noticing something unexpected, my acne scars were starting to vanish, not all of them but enough to notice. I have had acne scar patches on both temples for several years. Nothing has worked at reducing them. I&#x27;ve been documenting the results so others could see for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the attached photo I&#x27;ve compared the before photo, week one, and week three side by side. As you can see there is a significant reduction in the visibility of my acne scars after using Radha&#x27;s Beauty line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness Ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing: *****&lt;br /&gt;Dark Circle Correction: Not observed&lt;br /&gt;Fine Line and Wrinkle Correction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Acne Scar Correction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness Reduction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Improved Texture and Tone: ****&lt;br /&gt;Pore Reduction: Not observed&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating:  *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: No adverse reactions, didn’t cause acne breakouts, didn’t cause redness or any irritation, and exceeded my expectations at repairing damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: In three weeks it didn&#x27;t help my dark circles or reduce the enlarged pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received Radha Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, Intensive Youth Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes. I&#x27;m not required to post a favorable review and all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a short time, nothing has changed, eyes are still dark and puffy.. Maybe when I finish the bottle it will make a difference.  I will add my comments when I&#x27;ve used it all up.</li>
    <li> was to get rid of dark circle. I do not see any progress</li>
    <li> My lines are are hardly there.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a guy... pushing 50, and with dark circles and puffiness under my eyes from genetics as well as long hours in front of a computer.  I tried this product on a whim, and after only 4 days of applying this product twice-daily, I can say it WORKS.  I have had co-workers ask if I recently had &amp;#34;work done&amp;#34; on my face, and people that haven&#x27;t seen me for a few weeks/months tell me that I look in my early 30&#x27;s.  This product has reduced the dark circles to near nothing, and reduced the puffiness considerably.  The skin under my eyes is much tighter/firmer, and the squinting wrinkles on the sides of my eyes are starting to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this very soon, because I want to keep using it every day to maintain this youthful look... and I don&#x27;t want to run out.  This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> the most amazing eye gel I have ever tried. I loved it and I recommend. It ;literally tightened the skin around my eyes. no bad scent and absorbs quickly. I will post more details in dramaandbeauty.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Yes!! Results in 2 Days 2x daily, also by using my favorite organic serum. The lines from a bad tanning experience when I was younger, have improved.  I need to note that I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I do not give 5 stars unless the product deserves it, and I have attached pics of my 2-day results (4 treatments).  Other Pros:    1) Very light, refreshing cucumber scent.   2) This has been one of the silkiest eye creams that I have used in a while, but Radha   recommends to use in other trouble-prone areas too, such as your forehead, which is a plus.   3) Soft. but not greasy looking skin.   4) Absorbs into skin completely   5) Ingredients. Mostly organic. Some of the best skincare products I have used are organic.  Cons:   1) After my first use, I was sad to see that this is only half an ounce bottle, but that is expected with   a high-quality eye treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this eye gel. I was skeptical because of some of the bad reviews but I&#x27;m on bottle 3 and have noticed a big difference. A very light weight product. I have sensitive oily skin and haven&#x27;t had any problems with break outs or irritation.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels so good on eyes. I don&#x27;t really know if it has affected the appearance of dark circles, but it&#x27;s very soothing and has a nice, light fragrance (cucumber?)</li>
    <li> wonderfully designed bottle ... Yes I got via a coupon special but this is my own thoughts :)... seems to work though I only have squint lines from being a kid</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says, did not disappoint</li>
    <li> I love this. My dark circles under my eyes have drastically reduced. It truly is something that every woman should have handy. Love this ! I also want to say that I did get this free from tomoson to try and this is me telling you, GET IT,</li>
    <li> So far so good, nice product.</li>
    <li> Just a tiny amount is needed for results.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles or bags, but everyone has puffy days and this really works for me. Has a nice refreshing aroma too.</li>
    <li> I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS BUT I FEEL THIS PRODUCT DESERVES IT.  HAVE TRIED JUST ABOUT ALL OUT THERE, HAVE ALLERGIES ALONG WITH EYE ISSUES.  WHILE NOT IMMEDIATE, I FNID THIS  PRODUCT TO BE GREAT.  IT TIGHTENS, LIGHTENS ( WHICH I REALLY NEEDED ) AND HAS NO SIDE EFFECTS EVEN THOUGH I AM USING THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DROPS.  PLAN ON ORDERING AS LONG AS OFFERED</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before I posted to see how this works for me.  I really like this eye cream.  I just turned 30 and noticed I was getting fine lines around my eyes, and I have some forehead wrinkles as well.  I ordered this product with the Radha rose hip oil, and it&#x27;s wonderful!  I only wear it at night, because I noticed it was causing my eye makeup to fade during the day, but the results are awesome.  I&#x27;ve had a major reduction in the lines around my eyes.  I also have dark circles thanks to my infant who doesn&#x27;t quite sleep through the night yet, and the eye cream had me waking up and looking refreshed and like I got a full nights sleep.  That alone makes it worth it!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this after the first use. It gave noticeable results overnight. I will continue to buy this cream. I also love that it is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> did not work. burned my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent gel, its consistency is very nice, fragrance free!!!! It make my face fresh and radiant!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding customer service!!!!</li>
    <li> Still using it, but haven&#x27;t seen much change</li>
    <li> Bought some of this and when it came I noticed a considerable amount had leaked into the cap. I emailed the company and they sent a free replacement immediately. Great product that works and has reduced my dark circles considerably! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have several autoimmune issues and I am on plaquenil which thins the blood. Mixed tbat naturally having darkness under my eyes I neef something. Have the dark circles gone away...No! They have gotten much better... Yes! That mixed with price &amp; anti-aging is enough fir me to order my second bottle. I do use a layer of cerave eye cream sometimes if my skin needs a bit more moisture.</li>
    <li> Very silky and quickly gets absorbed.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes, but felt that the skin under the eyes is so fragile that I should use something specifically for that area. I do like this product, simply for the way it goes on and feels on.  I actually use a couple of drops over the whole face and the skin feels and looks very smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream.  It does what it says.  - Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and am chronically sleep deprived so often have puffy eyes and wraith-like dark circles to variable degrees, not a great look on the best of days.  I bought some of this in my endless quest to find something to help.  This definitely helps with the puffiness.  It is clear, absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t  greasy, and I can see noticeable results within a short period of time, say 30 minutes (not exact).  I  used my first bottle daily and over a couple of weeks it has helped with dark circles, which are, I&#x27;d say, 40% to 50%  better.  (Frankly, nothing short of a few consecutive weeks of adequate sleep, i.e. a miracle,  are going to make mine go away.)  In short, I&#x27;m very happy with this and am buying more.</li>
    <li> This product has really impressed me.  It has great ingredients without any yucky fillers or preservatives.  I&#x27;ve used it for daytime and nighttime use.  I will say that I am experiencing an extremely rough winter right now and my skin is quite dry.  This did do a great job moisturizing and plumping my eye area, but I did feel the need to add a little bit of argan oil over top at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use for the product was during the day underneath my makeup.  Once you put this on, it sinks into the eye and you can&#x27;t even feel it on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup at all and it provides enough moisture to prevent my under-eye concealer from looking crepe-y(is that a word?) or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to list all of the ingredients because you can see those below, but if you google each individual ingredient, you will find that they only put quality ingredients in their products.  That is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really suffer from a lot of issues around my eyes other than dryness during winter months, but I did notice that it did help reduce the slight puffiness that I experience in the mornings.  I am using products more for preventative skincare.  This has ingredients that help heal already existing ailments as well as ingredients to add moisture and protect against them happening in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of the product at no cost to myself, but all opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> We purchased 2 bottles of this eye cream - for my wife and for myself. Between the long working hours and incessant viewing of a computer screen, both of us were starting to develop puffy eyes and under-eye circles. This product had good reviews and a 4.5 star rating so it seemed like a no-brainer to buy. Wrong! One of the poor decisions we&#x27;ve made. Used the product for 2 weeks with no results. Wrote to the manufacturer and was advised that (positive) effects should be seen in 3-4 weeks of regular usage. It is 4 weeks now and nothing has changed. The bags and dark circles have not receded - not even marginally. I have an important meeting around the corner and was hoping for this product to help me improve how my eyes appear (not tired or exhausted); and that I wouldn&#x27;t look like a raccoon in the making. Bad choice and a waste of my time. Should&#x27;ve bought something else that would&#x27;ve worked. I guess you get what you pay for. This cream is not cheap, but it&#x27;s certainly lower priced than competing products most of which have better reviews. Will not buy this manufacturer&#x27;s products again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using it for about a week now and can already see a difference! Dark circles have lightened and the skin under eyes is firmer.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;First of all I like the product. I have&lt;br /&gt;overly sensitive skin around my eye area and this product is quite soothing and&lt;br /&gt;definitely not irritating. The company sent an email to me to let them know&lt;br /&gt;immediately if I did not like the product. It is nice to have a product perform&lt;br /&gt;as stated on line. I would reccomend to others..&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> First eye cream I have used that actually works.....I cannot be without this product</li>
    <li> Definitely works as advertised.  Beats out some other competition on Amazon.  I wish it was more permanent, but for the price, I can&#x27;t ask for any better.  I&#x27;m a mid 30&#x27;s male who has a very pronounced brow.  Light makes shadows underneath my eyelids which makes me look more tired, however this definitely helps to brighten up my eyes.  Color is reduced, lines are gone, swelling is reduced.  I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
    <li> After trying several other competitors, this is by far the best stuff I&#x27;ve found to help wrinkles under my eyes.  I can actually feel it tightening after I apply it.  I&#x27;ve only used it a week and can already see a big difference.  I was sort of skeptical of all the reviews on here, but now I am one of them!</li>
    <li> The consistency seems to be too liquidly I can&#x27;t really tell if I putting eye cream on or some kind of watery serum. I think I would of preferred a more creamer consistency</li>
    <li> Sorry it didn&#x27;t work. I was hopeful but no such luck. i&#x27;m happy for those that it worked for</li>
    <li> It truly truly works.  Some people expect miracles, perhaps plastic surgery is the only option for some.  For the rest of us  it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been using this for approximately 5 weeks. I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s and have really noticed a change in the puffiness around my  eyes. I literally had &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34;.I thought I might be getting low ,so I ordered my second bottle. I was afraid I would run out. I certainly would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a week and I honestly don&#x27;t see a real difference yet. This cream is not greasy and light texture gel type, also good thing is that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes watery, I like it&#x27;s consistency and the fact that it is quickly absorbed in time to apply my makeup.</li>
    <li> worked for my dark circles. The bags under my eyes go away in the morning and come back by the next morning but it does diminish the lines. I didn&#x27;t expect it to really work but the reviews helped me to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I notice a difference right away. It did not take away all the bags under my eyes but it made a big difference on the first use. I believe with constant use it will get better and keep the puffiness down. I liked it so much I order 2 more bottles because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all. It leaves the skin so sticky and you feel it as if you had a mask.</li>
    <li> Using for 2 weeks now, no noticeable improvement,will continue use but no plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the eye gel and accompanying products  via Brandbacker &amp; Radha Beauty, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the gel the day after I received it, and was surprised. The gel felt cool to the touch and seemed to reduce my puffiness almost immediately, especially above my eye lid. Sure the result could have been due to the lighting, but it was the first time a product, bad lighting or not, had done that for me. The texture was really nice and light, and it glided on with ease. And dried with in a few seconds with no residue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and have not noticed any difference in puffiness, bags or dark circles so I guess I&#x27;m still searching.</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly. I could feel it tightening my skin. Will be ordering another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream.  While I still have bags, possibly caused by lack of sleep, I have to say that the skin around my eyes is softer and shows less lines.  It feels really good going on.  Cool and refreshing.  And, it&#x27;s not overly costly like some other creams or treatments I have tried.  I would definitely purchase again.  Four stars because I believe there is always room for improvement in any product.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d give it a 5.  Just made my second purchase!  As long as Radha makes this product, I will never buy another eye cream / gel!  Sold for life!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  I use it mostly around my nose/mouth area.  Does an excellent job of smoothing away those fine lines.  It also works well to tighten the neck area immediately under the chin.  A little bit goes a long way.  In love with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for probably about two months.  I did have some fine lines around my eyes, but I actually bought this to help with dark circles, and it&#x27;s done that in spades.  My dark circles were bad enough that I never felt comfortable leaving the house without some foundation on, but that has changed.  This has almost entirely eradicated my dark circles, leaving my eye tone very consistent with the rest of my face.  It has also completely gotten rid of the few fine lines I had.  I will be a repeat customer for sure.  Also, Radha seems genuinely concerned about making sure that you are happy with their products, which I really appreciate.  This eye gel is definitely worth trying.  Radha also makes an excellent 2.5% retinol moisturizer,  which I use and love.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;I like this eye cream, when you put it on, it feels smooth and tightening of the skin, leaves it feeling uplifted.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Since using this gel my eyes look dramatically brighter and younger. The fine lines around my eyes are gone and so is any darkness I used to have. This really is a miracle product and contrary to some of the other reviews, I find the pump very easy to use and is great at dispensing a very small amount (a little goes a long way!). The texture is very soft and silky and is absorbed very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy finish. 5*s for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for an entire month, twice a day, and have seen zero results for under the eye area.</li>
    <li> I got this free for testing and I really like it . I love how cooling it is and also very moisturizing . no smell and a little bit will go along way . this will last for a long time . this small bottle packs and big product . if you try it you will love it</li>
    <li> Really nice product not heavy at all. Really like and a decent price</li>
    <li> Excellent shopping experience, super product.</li>
    <li> One must use this product for at least 2 months to see any changes. I bought in early May, so I&#x27;m hoping to see some changes by July.</li>
    <li> I can feel the twitching around  the eyes after a few days of using.  I hope it will somehow help with my eyebag.</li>
    <li> So far So Good. I&#x27;m really liking this eye gel. A little goes a long way so only put a small amount on.Goes along great with Vitamin C serum. Happy! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Feels like it is working but I&#x27;m not sure it is.</li>
    <li> The cream does not last long. I think the tube was empty within 2 weeks. I used it spairingly. Not a noticable difference to eyes</li>
    <li> Works fast and better than expected!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!!!!! It&#x27;s truly the best eye gel ever. U see results almost immediately..Great price toooo. I bought 2 more!! WOW!!!!</li>
    <li> It does take care of morning puffiness.  I like the cooling texture.  I don&#x27;t know yet about dark circles, its too soon to tell. It does not irritate my sensitive skin.  Smells nice and seems like a good product so far for only using about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Just love this product it actually did smooth my under eye area and it has given my eye area the moisture it really needed. I will never use another product again. I absolutely love Radha Beauty Products !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great! its a perfect consistency that glides on and you can actually feel the tightening effect afterwards!! im super excited to see what results await from this great skin care line !!</li>
    <li> I used this product twice a day for a week. Not only is the bottle now empty (I used an English pea sized amount each use), but my eyes don&#x27;t look any different. The gel only dries on a shiny coat over the dark circles and bags. If I paid more than $20, I&#x27;d be upset, but all the positive reviews made me want to at least try it. If your goal is to get rid of the circles, this isn&#x27;t the right product for you. If you need a shiny under eye to distract from the circles, then this is the temporary solution for you.</li>
    <li> Love this product because it&#x27;s better than the $85 Clarins eye cream I bought last month.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this product.... Very cooling and refreshing to the eye .... Will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> I received the eye cream a few days ago and it seems to work as promised. I can tell a difference already. It also seams to&lt;br /&gt;decrease the wrinkles as well as the puffiness.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is ok its improving my skin but was I looking for a better result.</li>
    <li> I have used every eye cream imaginable and for me, this is better than all of them, and you cannot beat this price. It has a lovely fresh scent, goes on very nicely, and i can feel the skin around/under my eyes tightening immediately. It feels like it&#x27;s working just as soon as it dries. Eye makeup goes on smoothly and does not crease - there is absolutely NO greasy feel to this eye gel. I am looking forward to trying some of their other products.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in this eye cream, I used it faithfully everyday and evening for two weeks as suggested.  I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
    <li> THis is my second order of Radha eye cream.  I found it to be the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of reducing puffy eyes and smells good.  Better than the real expensive stuff</li>
    <li> I love this cream it reduced my under  eye circles</li>
    <li> I FELT the tingle the first time. And after 3 weeks of once a day usage ( I am now 2x  a day) I can see my shadows disappearing and a smoother complexion around the eye area. It stings sometimes but not badly. Be careful for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and it really works. I would buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all.Not pleased</li>
    <li> Works ok, not a big difference.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works like a dream!  Their  entire product  line is Fantastic! Love All their  products!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, it is really good to reduce puffiness and dark under eye circles. When you apply it it has a cooling effect that immediately makes your eyes feel rested. I really love that this formula isn&#x27;t strong for young skin and also it has a delicious smell of cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product from radha beauty products in exchange of my honest  opinion.</li>
    <li> Has drastically reduced the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes in a very short time.  I noticed a difference after the first day!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for about 2 weeks and have had very good results with it. I have dark circles under my eyes and have tried many product on the market. I was really skeptical about using the Argon Oil, but it has made a difference in my dark circles. They are much less noticeable and have made me look much more awake and alert and younger. There is also no odor to it and I&#x27;ve had no skin reactions from it. The Argon Oil was also shipped quickly and I had excellent customer service. I really recommend this product to anyone with serious issues with eye puffiness and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;#RadhaBeauty</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly, good product</li>
    <li> I love this so much that I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles and have my sister and mother also hooked on this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference except for a little more brightness around the eyes. The GEL is tacky upon application, but dries quickly and does not dry the skin.</li>
    <li> I like the gel consistency of the product. I use this in the morning and at night and although I find it to be moisturizing, I have yet to see my dark circles diminish. Hopefully with continued use I&#x27;ll see some improved results.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really works. My husband and I have been using this for a week now (we are in our 50&#x27;s). Best eye cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Have been using religiously for a few weeks and I see no difference in my dark circles. It is extremely drying-makes the skin under my eyes look,creepy. Finally calling it a day and tossing it in the trash. It wan&#x27;t expensive, but on items such as this 30 days is not enough time to really evaluate for return. Disappointing product.</li>
    <li> The company is great ! There was an issue with the product but contact the company directly and the customer service is absolutely amazing they really stand behind their product and there are actual people there to help you . They also gave me tips on how to use it in the most effective manner! I really look forward to using this product and will report soon on the results!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great service. I will continue to deal with this company.  Best of all, it is really working!!</li>
    <li> Terrible product that does nothing it claims to do.  Would NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Have only used a small amount over a period of time with NO RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to return this product, but am not asking for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD NOT EVER PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;Product that really does work is CHAMONIX genucel stem cell therapy..GREAT PRODUCT THAT&lt;br /&gt;DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO FOR BAGS &amp; PUFFINESS&lt;br /&gt;Thank You... Anthony Tharenos</li>
    <li> doesnt work i see no change at all</li>
    <li> I received this eye gel free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. I don’t feel that this gel really did anything for my eyes. It felt cooling going onto my skin which did help me feel fresh and awake. It didn’t bother my sensitive skin and I used it twice a day as directed. I’ve used the entire bottle and see no changes in my bags in coloring or size/puffiness. I don’t see that it did anything to improve the slight fine wrinkles near my eyes. My skin looks and feels no different than before I started using it. It may work for some but I had to mark it down to one star because I see no benefit for using it on my skin. I only used it on my eye area and it ran out quickly, using it on your entire face would just make you use it up faster with no real results. If it didn’t work around my eyes I don’t feel it would have been worthwhile to use on my face.</li>
    <li> Not sure it does anything for my puffiness but it sooths the eye area and helps keep in moisture.  Will certainly purchase again</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t improve dark circles, puffiness, or bags.</li>
    <li> This item has replaced my Estee Lauder eye products that I have been using it for the past 6 years. Read good reviews and thought I should try. I have been using it for a month day/night and can tell how much this has lighten my dark circles drastically and eyes appear to be much open/wide. It is as good as my Estee Lauder eye creams except much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This gel help me very much with my eyes puffiness..it&#x27;s amazing how my eyes now looking so rest and brighter..tku:)</li>
    <li> Seems to be working for bags</li>
    <li> I was initially surprised by how small the bottle was when I received this eye gel but overall I&#x27;m very impressed with how little goes a long way!  I have used other eye gel products in the past and none clear up the darker areas under my eyes like this one!  Has a very nice scent and absorbs quickly, unlike a lot of other gels that sit on the surface of my skin.  Very impressed, smaller bottle is no issue!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited reading the reviews,  but found this eye cream didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I didn&#x27;t see any immediate results and although I used it regularly,  I didn&#x27;t see any long term results.  Still had bags, no firming action. Just ok.</li>
    <li> Used entire container and saw no results</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for dark circles and that&#x27;s what I got it for.  It went on kinda sticky but dried ok and smelled ok but didn&#x27;t do jack for dark eye circles.</li>
    <li> Great choice. Love it</li>
    <li> Horrible! This product was irritating to my skin and left me with dry skin and burning under my eyes for a week.</li>
    <li> Have used a week now. Its amazing how fast the under eye bags are decreasing. Wish came in larger more economical container. Why is it so small ?</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say the product is bad or good. I have been using it now for close to a month &amp; personally I don&#x27;t see a difference. But to be fair, I think a true definition &amp; cause of what folks call dark circles under eyes is necessary. I bought this for that reason, which was to lessen the appearance of those circles, etc. But I had also been told a long time ago by an eye specialist that bags vs circles were 2 different things. Bags, according to him can only be lessened by surgery which entails the cutting &amp; removal of those fat deposits. As to the darkness of those circles, lessening those was the reason I bought this cream. And for that, it has not helped me at least visibly. And I do use this at least twice a day &amp; often 3 times a day.</li>
    <li> I have tried this for about a month with greatest hopes, I have tried different eye cream for my entire life and my main problem is always a puffiness in the morning even I don&#x27;t drink at all during the night. With hope I applied a large portion of this gel every night before bed and every morning after every washes, in about 2 weeks I started to see the difference. My entire eye area has been changed. My eye area skin tone is changing slowly but surely and I have better skin texture now. And the greatest change is my puffiness has almost gone ! What a great product you have created for women who is suffering from puffiness every morning. I used to not  try to looking at the mirror in the morning closely but now every morning i check and look closely, how much my eye area has been changed to a good younger looking skin. I highly recommend this product to all of the women out there who is suffering from puffiness in the morning !!! All thanks to Radha !</li>
    <li> good deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Please read the many reviews posted, there seems to be a lot of customers that aren&#x27;t happy with this product.  I used this product as directed for 3 weeks, 2x per day morning and night with absolutely no noticeable results, if anything it made my eyes look worse.  It seems to be a temporary fix, meaning it tightens up the eye area until you wash your face, then it&#x27;s gone.  Be careful when ordering this gel because there seem to be a lot of people experiencing allergic reactions and receiving opened and used bottles.  Thank goodness there is a money back guarantee if unsatisfied and I have requested a return label. I will continue on in my search for the eternal &amp;#34;fountain of youth.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This WORKS!!  As I get older my eyelids are beginning to droop (UGH!).  When I use this, my eyelids don&#x27;t droop; they stay in place so you can see my eyeshadow and give me a wide awake look.  This gel has taken away any lines or wrinkles on my eyelids and helped to minimize wrinkles under my eyes.  I highly recommend this product.  The company shipped it out immediately too after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve seen immediate changes and would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this but for about a week, and I can already see a difference in the dark circles around my eyes. My whole family has problems with dark circles and we have tried everything to get rid of them or at least lighten them up some.. i received this for free for an honest reiew. I will recommend this product to my whole family and anyone else I think can benefit from this product.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with results. Will definitely purchase this product again. Great value for money also.</li>
    <li> Have had this eye gel/cream for 5 days now and it is working wonders.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream about 5 days in the morning and night  but  I didn&#x27;t see any change for my eye bags yet. This was a big concerned for my eyes bag that why I bought Radha eye cream and also have a lot of good reviews from Amazon too. I give this eye gel 3 stars because I like the smell and the gel was easy to absorb to my skin. Hope if I still keep using this eye cream longer would help me to reduce my eye bags. I am not sure to buy this in future.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-50&#x27;s and battle my skin issues daily.  Recently I had noticed my usual products were workng. I found Radha Beauty Products, and couldn&#x27;t resist trying it.  First of all, you honestly don&#x27;t need to use more than a partial pump. It glides right on, and dries quickly.  I let it sink in for approximately 10 minutes, then add an eye moisturizer and go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the products, you will notice that it is packed full of active ingredients that have been proven to help skin repair it&#x27;s natural structure, without the use of fillers and nasty chemicals. After about 2 weeks use, my skin around my eyes looks less crepey, fine lines have smoothed out, and my skin looks a bit more plump and taut around my eyes. Honestly, I look better to my worst critic, ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 5 for packaging, its scientifically backed active ingredients, no &amp;#34;nasties&amp;#34; included, and the most important part, a 5+ for early results and no irritation.  I am going to continue using this in my regimen.</li>
    <li> 4 stars only because it is definitely not the immediate &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; that some others have described -- but over a period of a few weeks of diligent use, I have actually gotten 2 comments that &amp;#34;something is different&amp;#34; in my face from random people.  I do think it has helped with the bags and circles.... but took time.  Yep, I&#x27;ll continue to use it if the price stays reasonable (prob wouldn&#x27;t pay the advertised full price).  It spreads nicely, and is absorbed quickly -- feels a lot like spreading on aloe (which is a main ingredient).  You need SO SO little of it, almost so little it&#x27;s impossible to get a small enough amount.... not even 1/2 a pea for both eye areas.  Overall, like it and it is a welcomed addition to my routine if the bottle lasts a long enough time.  Finished my first bottle, lasted about 2+ months.  I ordered 2 more :).   Yep, it worked and I definitely think that my circles are reduced.  Love the way it feels -- just a little tingly and tightening.  For me, it was not a hallelujah miracle exactly, but the product definitely delivered, and I will continue to use it.  The only small issue is that you can&#x27;t tell when it is running out because of the black bottle, you just run out BOOM.</li>
    <li> Sorry but didn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
    <li> Did not work ..used this product morning and night for about 3 months and there was no difference . Wasted my money</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. I was very excited to try this whole line from Radha, but was very dissatisfied with it. This eye serum is okay, but I have used better products in the past. I really wish I would have been happy with this line.</li>
    <li> Basically a thin glue; it actually solidifies puffiness, and then creates white lines because of cracks in the glue once you&#x27;ve started smiling or squinting in the sun.  Guarantee promises &amp;#34;180-day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee! If you&#x27;re not completely satisfied, you can keep the bottle (it&#x27;s on us) AND get a full refund. No questions asked.&amp;#34;  But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case -- the request still must go through Amazon and a the item returned before a refund is made.  I&#x27;m fine with returning the item (it does me no good), but those aren&#x27;t the conditions under which I made the purchase.  They were great with emails letting me know about the order&#x27;s progress every step of the way, so I&#x27;m hoping they respond just as attentively to my refund request.</li>
    <li> I have very deep, dark circles and very puffy bags under my eyes - perhaps bad enough that nothing other than surgery will take care of. I have certainly tried a million products that all claim to erase dark circles and bags and none of them have ever done anything. I am on the fence about this product becuz although it has not diminished my dark circles noticeably, I do think it has helped the puffiness and bags somewhat. Nothing drastic but I notice that the skin under my eyes feels different since using this product. I will continue to use this bottle and see what happens in the long run, but I can honestly say that so far, this is the only product I have ever tried that has done at least something!! The only other note is that when I received the product, a large glop of the gel had squirted into the cap during shipping and made a mess. I just used the first several applications from the gloppy mess in the cap, so no product was actually lost, just a little messy.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional reviewer. Just a mom getting old. Because of the mixed reviews for this product, I decided to take a before and after pic. I figured that would tell more than anything I can write.&lt;br /&gt;A couple things to note... I had been using the whole line of *my regular* skin care for about a month prior to using this product. I continued using it while I used the product. I didn&#x27;t see this kind of results with my regular products alone.&lt;br /&gt;The pictures were taken at different times of day. The first one was about 5:30pm with the setting sun coming in thru the window. The second was about 8:30pm with no sun in the background. Other than that, the lighting was the same.&lt;br /&gt;The photos were taken 10 days apart on my cell phone with no type of filtering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the difference for yourself. Like I said, I&#x27;m not a professional reviewer and don&#x27;t get any type of kickback for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - love the cucumber scent!</li>
    <li> I do not have wrinkles yet but this product works wonderfully on my puffy eyes and dark circles from lack of sleep! I received this as a trial and am pleasantly surprised --it&#x27;s not greasy at all and works great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a change</li>
    <li> Great eye gel, seems to reduce puffiness better than other products I&#x27;ve tried. great price.</li>
    <li> This is a very silky eye gel. It smells lovely and absorbs quickly.  It works nicely under makeup/concealer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been  using this for approx 1 month and I&#x27;m fussy about my skin... No change at all. Won&#x27;t buy again. Better products out there for sure..</li>
    <li> Broke my face my skin out the first time i used it.</li>
    <li> Used this product for almost two weeks. Did nothing for me. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the refreshing cucumber scent! Most favorite eye product I have ever tried (and I&#x27;ve been through many!). I paired it with other Radha Beauty Products for an overall very-clean-feeling face that is oh-so-smooth!  *** UPDATE***  Still VERY happily using this product with such great results that are nearly instantaneous, nearly 2 months later! I&#x27;m so pleased I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love the product</li>
    <li> I received sooner than I expected which was nice. I&#x27;m trying the Radha Eye cream for 2 weeks, then try to remember to re-review it and their Radha Moisturizer with Retinol I received yesterday. The Radha Eye cream does make my eyes feel and look refreshed. I&#x27;m using morning and night as Radha suggests. So far, I like both products a lot!</li>
    <li> Goodbye to my bags, and dark circles. I always have issues with sleeping, and I normally use concealer to hide them, but after using the Radha Beauty Eye Gel I&#x27;ve been makeup free all week, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about being ashamed. Being Youthful is what I&#x27;m going for. Radha means Beauty Goddess, and I have been glowing. Thanks to using the system I can just wash my face, apply my serum, moisturizer, and then my eye gel and leave the house with a fresh face.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a week and a half hoping that it would be different from every other cream Or A todayajel I have tried and it absolutely did nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing do not be a fool and waste your money</li>
    <li> This is the best undereye cream I have ever used! I am a fashion and beauty blogger and before that I was an editor for a bridal magazine. I cannot tell you how many countless eye creams I have tried without seeing results. I wanted to try this product to help with the dark circles under my eyes. They have lightened a bit but the MAJOR results are in its effectiveness fighting wrinkles and puffiness. The small crows feet on the sides of my eyes have virtually disappeared. It instantly depuffs my eyes making the transition from my undereye area to my cheekbones smoother. It smells fresh and feels cool on application. Best of all, although it is moisturizing, it dries matte. It doesn&#x27;t have that horrible iridescence some products contain. This product now has a spot on my vanity. This product was given to me by Radha Beauty to review. The opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This works wonders for under your eyes as well as your entire eye area.</li>
    <li> It worked somewhat. I still have puffinss.</li>
    <li> Amazing tightening and wrinkle eye cream.. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My lines around my eyes look better, getting compliments on my skin. Recently was asked by a very good friend if I had my eyes &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;? Don&#x27;t know if she believed me when I said no!</li>
    <li> Really like this cooling eye gel and have noticed a difference after using it for only about two weeks.  Much lighter than creams and seems to give your eyes an instant &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; in the morning.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little over three weeks. I apply it first thing in the morning and right before bed and thus far this eye &#x27;gel&#x27; hasn&#x27;t done anything for my puffy eyes. Yes, puffy eyes, as in water retention, not permanent fatty tissue (i.e. bags). It&#x27;s great at moisturizing the skin around my eyes, but as for &#x27;tightening and de-puffing&#x27;, not so much. I like that it&#x27;s all-natural, unscented, and layers well with other products (such as concealer, powder, etc.), but I personally will be looking for an alternative for my puffy eyes. I know these products tend to work differently for everyone who tries them, so don&#x27;t let my review sway you from trying it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> After weeks of use, I do not notice any change for the better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and in my 40&#x27;s and I bought this hoping it would reduce my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes. However, my wrinkles seem deeper after using it. When I stopped using it, the deeper wrinkles disappear. I was able to get a refund. Their vitamin C serum worked better for my crow&#x27;s feet than this eye cream.</li>
    <li> working as suspected. The bags are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but company is great! Very reputable:</li>
    <li> Love this eye gel, and will not be without it. You can put it  around your eyes or any other place that is needed on your face and it works. Makes your face and eyes more smooth looking.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. So glad I found this! It really helped with baggieness under the eyes and started working right away for me.</li>
    <li> I have not used it enough to comment either way.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the product so far</li>
    <li> feels very good on the eye lids</li>
    <li> I like the way it goes on. Works great.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is fantastic! I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my under eye circles have diminished. Outstanding customer service from Radha Beauty as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for eye puffiness and it has done the job even though I only use it in the AM. I will definitely buy this product  again</li>
    <li> Firstly and the only inconvenience I want to reclaim is that the product was a little harmed maybe in the shipping because I found that the eye gel was melting out of the container .&lt;br /&gt;The gel texture is heavy but light on your skin ,rich but smooth very smooth with a natural sent almost like cucumber ,gives you a lifted feeling when you apply ,I use it every day twice morning and evening for 16 days now what I really noticed really and very much is plumpness on my cheeks , smoothness  and brightness on the eye area ,it reduces the appearance of dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and gives me that healthy eye look (too see much results pleaaaaasse drink water people 8 cups at least ,water will give 80% of concealing your dark circles) , it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all (I have very baaaad sensitive skin ) ,I just love it I will keep using it of course I&#x27;m happy with the results eye get .</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Will order again</li>
    <li> Definitely not as great as it&#x27;s described. If it does anything, it doesnt do much.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all all.</li>
    <li> I waited to write a review until I used this product for a while. I saw no difference at all, not even a little. Dont really understand all the rave reviews.</li>
    <li> This is great to hide the evidence of someone (like me) who does not get enough sleep.</li>
    <li> Waste your time and money. I dont think this product give any benefit for your eyes except make a seller getting more richer</li>
    <li> Does as advertised for such a Great Price! Will order multiples next time! V</li>
    <li> this is a good eye cream for dark circles! I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have been using Radha Eye Gel for approximately one week and I am already seeing a difference in the lines  and the dark circles under my eyes.  I have tried many more expensive products but the results with Radha Eye Gel are the best that I have seen.  I am very, very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> THIS GEL IS EXCELLENT!!!!!  I ORDERED ONE AND AFTER TWO USES CAME BACK AND ORDERED THREE MORE!!!  I HAVE DARK SHADOWS BELOW MY EYES AND SOME CRINKLING BELOW MY EYES, AFTER USING THIS, AFTER TWO DAYS, I NOTICED A HUGE DIFFERENCE.  I WILL NOT BE WITHOUT THIS STUFF.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT IN MY HUMBLE OPINION.  I BOUGHT THIS, AND I AM NOT A SAMPLE REVIEW.  I WISH!!!!  WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I&#x27;ll keep using it twice daily but have not really seen a difference!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> After a few times using this product, my eyes starting itching and this morning I woke up with a terrible allergic reaction. What should I do?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see no difference waste of my money</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very rich and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other eye gels. the result are still to be seen. so far I like the feeling.</li>
    <li> I have had puffy dark circles under my eyes for years and after reading other reviews, I had high hopes of this working. I have been using it for two weeks now and see zero difference.</li>
    <li> Apparently the corners of my eyes are sensitive but not my indereye area - this burns the sensitive spots. It did however seem to make a difference on my undereye area which has pretty severe dark circles and some small smile lines forming (eek). **note I use it in conjunction with Olay&#x27;s eye cream</li>
    <li> I only just received this product but after a week I can see it working. The darkness under my eyes has lightened noticeably. I love the texture of the product and the fact that it is not sticky or oily. You can actually feel it tighten. Great product so far, can&#x27;t wait for more results!</li>
    <li> had to return. pump did not work</li>
    <li> I love how smooth this feels when applied to eye area, so far I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase...I&#x27;m tired of my raccoon eyes! Will continue to use for sure!</li>
    <li> One of the reviews I read on this eye cream before purchasing included some impressive before and afters.  Well, I had a night of no sleep and at the end of the next day I looked in the mirror and found that my area looked way better despite the lack of sleep!  I have only been using it a few days but am very excited about the results so far.</li>
    <li> I had just recently been complaining to my husband about my unsightly eye circles.  I am getting older and more tired and it is showing, especially around my eye area!  So I jumped at the opportunity to try this product.  Any chance I get to try out a new beauty product and I&#x27;m all over it.  I am happy with the smoothness of this eye gel!  It isn&#x27;t thick and goopy.  It goes on cool and smooth and absorbs quickly.  It has a very natural smell, almost like cucumbers, which I find refreshing.  Your skin feels instantly smooth!  After a few days of use I do feel like there is more firmness to the areas I have been applying the gel.  I am excited to continue my use of this product and see just how great my results are.  I am very happy with it and would highly recommend it!  I did receive this product free of charge to test and review.  The seller was not promised a positive review and the opinions stated here are 100% my own unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this eye gel to make a difference but WOW! Can I buy this in a 55 gallon drum? This gel is like MAGIC! Thank you</li>
    <li> Kind of and kind of not, more on the not!!!!</li>
    <li> My mother actually stole this from me because of how great my eyes looked! I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles, but my eyes still looked and felt amazing. My mom who is older also saw a significant improvement and now she is a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> I dont normally write reviews but this stuff really works. The dark circles and bags have  diminished by atleast 75% on the first use. I wish I&#x27;d taken a before and after. I&#x27;m a 34yr old female of lighter skin.</li>
    <li> My wife likes using this stuff although i am not a fan of the smell.  It goes on easy and didn&#x27;t result in any allergic reactions.  Will look in to ordering again for my wife</li>
    <li> This is really effective. I have see result in 15 days. I love that product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on bags unless you start using it in your 20&#x27;s.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a good Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> Great product for puffy tired eyes. Refreshing cucumber scent with cooling sensation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that somebody out there is just like me...middle to older age and gullible to almost any good &#x27;hype&#x27; of a product designed to make you look less wrinkled, less puffy, and ....younger!  (translation: we all have lots of products we&#x27;ve bought and are just gathering dust because we saw no effectiveness and were &#x27;duped&#x27; yet again!)  With my newest beauty purchase- this eye gel!-  I was glad to get to try a product that just happened to arrive exactly on the day I had allergies acting up and awakened with seriously puffy eyes.  So I did one eye to compare...and wow!  It worked!  Instant puffiness reduction!  That&#x27;s what I can tell you that is helpful, what I can&#x27;t say just yet is whether the puffiness comes back later on in the day or how soon (life took over and I was too busy to check!).  So I&#x27;ll post again after I use this product some more and can provide additional helpful feedback.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles so perhaps somebody else will post its effectiveness for that (or already has below?)  In the meantime, for just the puffiness issue, I was quite impressed and recommend!  (I&#x27;ll also add that I&#x27;m sensitive and allergic to many things and had no problems at all with the gel)</li>
    <li> Very good product.  My eyes do not look as puffy.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and absorb instantly.  Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> First purchased, saw noticeable improvement from black circles under my eyes.  Under eyes look tighter and less dark.  Liked so much I purchased a second time,  this shipment came in original box, but container is smaller and. Unlabeled.  Not sure how I feel about it now since I&#x27;m paying same price.  I&#x27;ll post my findings after fully using this tube.</li>
    <li> Made no difference in my 50ish looking eyes.  But the again, nothing has.</li>
    <li> Nice and moist for your eyes.  feels good and puffiness is lessening-everything takes time!</li>
    <li> I have finally found something that really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. I think I see some effects, but certainly nothing dramatic.</li>
    <li> Excellent costumer service and the cream really works. I have lots of darkness under eyes because of the allergies and recent nose surgery. I started to see results after only few days! Nice, cooling feeling. Its the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. And I did try even some that are way more expensive.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> Just ok, haven&#x27;t seen a significant improvement.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!  I initially ordered the product hoping it would help with the dark circle under my eyes, but I have these bumps under my eyes from sun damage and this eye gel is making them disappear!  I am so happy! This product has far exceeded my expectations.  I will definitely be buying again</li>
    <li> I bought it a couple months ago. It is a good product. I can feel a little warm after applying it. It might has function on light my dark circles, even it is really hard to tell. Feels comfortable.</li>
    <li> Just got it two days ago. Used it for the third time &amp; it&#x27;s gone already.  Only used a lil bit. Very small container. Should have been sample</li>
    <li> I love this gel---not just for the price but also the fast delivery. I especially appreciate how it feels around my eyes---not sticky and absorbs fast. And after almost two weeks of using this gel, my circles are less and my bags are minimal in appearance. I love the organic ingredients and the pump. I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
    <li> this product arrived damaged (cracked open)</li>
    <li> glade I tryed it and will continue to use! Make my eyes look brighter and deep pockets under my eye are disappearing.... Look more awake and even toned! Love how it works so much I don&#x27;t use my under eye concealer any more!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I WILL DEF ORDER THIS AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Absolutely...DID NOT WORK!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I give it zero stARS.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and it made my eyes burn and itch.  Too late for me to send it back.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product a few days which is too soon to see results. It does make my skin a bit dry and WAY too much product comes out when u lightly depress the pump-total waste of $ when that happen-which is really the reason for the bad review so far. If I get any results I will update!</li>
    <li> I was really interested in the product because I have never used an under eye gel. The packaging was all I liked about this product.&lt;br /&gt;First I hated the smell. It smells like cucumbers but not nice fresh ones kind of like old nasty ones. Next the product never really absorbed into my skin so it stayed tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it under my concealer and because the product never fully absorbs it made my concealer cake up and kind of stick together and make my makeup look horrible. I used alone as well and it also made my under eye wrinkles stick together. I also noticed the more I used it the more it made my wrinkles worse and deeper.</li>
    <li> I have used this during the evening only. My CPAP machine makes my eyes puffy and this has helped greatly. I have not experienced irritation and have noticed a subtle change. Nothing is going to replace an eye lift but if you want to give this a shot you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen one change. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> 12/15/14; I have been using this product for 1 month now and see no results.  I bought this with the hopes that it would reduce my dark circles, and it has NOT.  I use the product as directed, twice daily.  I will see if their \\&quot;money back\\&quot; guarantee works.    UPDATE 12/16/14; While the product did not work for me, they do have GREAT customer service and honored their \\&quot;Money Back Guarantee\\&quot;.    Thank You.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave feedback about skin care products as I buy too many (not a good thing). This product, though, is worth a review. I refrigerate it and tap it on my eyes when I wake up - it&#x27;s a nice wake me up. It&#x27;s a light consistency - gel like which I prefer over heavier creams.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I have really noticed a difference. I will give it more than a week t judge it</li>
    <li> Was not really happy with this product.  It really did not give me great results and saw no reduction in puffiness around my eyes.  I tried it for a month, morning and night religiously and no results.  Tried to return it but it looks like my window closed yesterday, real bummer as I was going to purchase a different product.  Please red your return policy people as you will be out $$ if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.Just looks like water in it😥Got it for dark eyes.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a short while but I think I see improvement in the eye area already. I like the gell emulsion as it dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> This gel can pump you up because it has Hyaluronic Acid that help retain water. Be careful to apply only where you need it to pump. I applied on top of my eye lids and it makes my eyes look small because the lids look swollen. Do apply where you have a deep pocket or wrinkles that needs collagen to refill. Then it works. If you put it all over your face, it will make you look puffy like wearing a mask.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream. Cucumber smell.</li>
    <li> Nice feel - comforting and cooling to the eye area. The bottle didn&#x27;t seem to last very long, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Feels good upon application and throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;There is no fountain of youth with Father Time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep you posted-so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I love love this product you can see results the time you use it .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. This stuff does not work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product.  It has done nothing for me except dry out my under eyes.  I won&#x27;t be using it.  I will give it to my daughter to try.</li>
    <li> Amazing, wrinkles are disappearing, my skin feels soft and silky, this is the second time I have purchased this gel .... fantastic! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  It did absolutely nothing to help.</li>
    <li> Did not help with my under eye bags at al. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months - no result. In fact it has a very sticky texture, so your skin sticks together when you move your eye muscles, and I feel like it&#x27;s making the skin looser, so stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t honestly say how it&#x27;s working so far. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and there are no visible changes yet to the puffiness, but most products take several weeks before results can be observed. No adverse reactions, but I did learn to keep it from getting too close to my eyes...a mild stinging if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this eye gel about 2 weeks ago together with their miracle cream. I don&#x27;t have much problems around eye area but it definitely reduced dark circles and little wrinkles in the corners even after sleepless night. Skin look brighter and more fresh</li>
    <li> my eyes love this stuff! It really does get rid of dark puffy circles. I am not sure how...maybe not knowing is best.</li>
    <li> nice eye cream for dark circles.</li>
    <li> I havent used it enough to make an assessment. More like a week and a half with some gaps. But I care that what Im using around the eye area is delicate enough for that section of the face because it is a sensitive area of the face. The product is whitish creamy and more on the transclucent tinge and creamy. All you need to use is a little bit under each eye. So hopefully it goes a long way. But the proof is in the pudding so well see.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my assessment in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It really deserves six. I noticed a 24 hour difference after using this product. I have really puffy undereyes and this firmed and evened my skin so well. Thanks Rahda Beauty!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this eye cream!  I think a great eye cream is probably the most difficult to find.  A lot of times many of them are too greasy or too moisturizing and it can actually cause my eye makeup or mascara to smear.  This eye cream is more of a gel formula with aloe vera, amino acids, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, and plant stem cells, just to name a few...It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue or oiliness behind.  I can feel it tightening the skin right away and I have actually seen the super fine lines diminish.  I have only been using it for a few weeks but I am loving the results so far.  Plus it only takes a tiny amount for each eye to get the job done.  I use the amount of about the little metal balls that can be found in nail polish bottles...that&#x27;s it!  Plus it lasts all day:)  I will definitely be re-purchasing and sticking with what works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 weeks now and it is very comforting, soothing and cool under the eyes when applied.</li>
    <li> I love the way this gel goes on so smooth. Just a tiny dot covers the entire area under each eye and to the side to get my crowsfeet! After just a week of use I am starting to see some of the wrinkles disappearing! I also love the natural ingredients in this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream based  on customer reviews.  So far, they&#x27;re right on target.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a long term review but it does meet my expectations at this point.  I love the way it smooths right into the skin.  I guess the fact that I&#x27;ve reordered it speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks, but, so far so good. Considering that it usually takes 6-8 weeks to notice any improvement with beauty products, I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the full results. The product absorbs quickly without any greasiness and does seem to smooth out the under eye area somewhat. Disclaimer, I did receive this product for no cost as part of a test group. The company wanted a review sooner rather than later so here it is. I would probably have given this 5 stars in a month or so after using it for a little longer. In the time I have been using it, I&#x27;ve see no downsides to this product.   Dec. 18, I have updated this review to 5 stars after using it for about 4 more weeks. I have noticed some improvement in the smoothness under my eyes. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with dark circles so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but, when I put it on in the morning I do notice that the puffiness that shows up in the morning really seems to calm down. This is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> Love this product so far</li>
    <li> Hi! I&#x27;m a 24 year old girl and recently started a new job. Ive been more tired recently so the bags under my eyes are much more prominent. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference! Don&#x27;t use it once and except it to immediately begin working. I feel like it&#x27;s worked better on the puffiness of my eyes rather than the dark circles. I wish I would have taken photos to show.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a user of &#x27;beauty products&#x27; but this eye gel may change my inclinations. It&#x27;s refreshing and I rest well having applied it before I sleep. I am finding it as refreshing as cool cucumber slices with the added advantage of well researched ingredients that nourish my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and I quite like it.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery Ive only used it for three days but wow this stuff is amazing I&#x27;ve been waking up with my eyes looking so radiant not tired looking or swollen at all I completely recommend this product to anyone suffering from under eye bags or puffiness even dark circles because it even lighten that wow this is my permanent eye cream I&#x27;ve tried so many other creams not one has ever made my eyes look so great I&#x27;m so happy I bought this its worth every penny</li>
    <li> Great product! I work very weird hours because of my job so my eyes tend to get tired/puffy/dark circles from having such a bad sleep schedule and from being so busy! This product is great! I pop it in the fridge and use it under my eyes before I go to sleep and when I wake up my eye bags are MUCH improved! :)</li>
    <li> This product do help me reduce dark circles, and it has a cucumber flavor, which I like.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for almost thirty days and have not noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while and I&#x27;m not sure what it did. Sometimes it felt a little irritated and made the area under my eyes slightly red, and I&#x27;m not sure how much it did for the circles developing under my eyes. I contacted the company after trying it for a month and a half and they were super quick to give me a refund.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change after the roughly 2 months or so I have used it.  I applied it to one eye just to see the difference and there is none.  It&#x27;s too bad, I had high hopes for it.</li>
    <li> it really did make an improvement with my under eye area. It took a few weeks of using daily but I can notice a difference. I gave it 4 stars because I want a miracle.. This is not a miracle just a REALLY good product.</li>
    <li> This really works!!!  I&#x27;ve been using the Eyes gel for the last two week and I can honestly say it works.  I have two small children and I never get enough sleep,  hence the  puffy eyes and dark circles.  I could see the difference in the puffiness within two days and the dark circles are much lighter.  Like I said before this really works, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product not what I expected. Good but not great.</li>
    <li> November 22 - I am editing this review after talking to Radha and learning why things I was unhappy about were as they were.     -------------  Original Review   -------------  The product is ok but the packaging leaves much to be desired.    I am not a person who lives and dies by product packaging but this packaging makes me wonder if this is a truly legitimate company or a company that&#x27;s in the testing phase of its products.    The product came in a plain white box. There was no branding and just a sku label on the side. This isn&#x27;t what I expect from any company, no matter how big or small.    The second no-no is that when I opened the box and looked at the product, I was a bit vexed because there is no ingredient list. I had to back to amazon.com to find it. I have extremely sensitive skin so knowing each and every ingredient in a product is important to me, especially one that&#x27;s going near my eyes.    The product itself is pretty good. It&#x27;s not great enough for me to switch from my current eye cream but if you haven&#x27;t found your holy grail of eye treatments, this is definitely one to consider. The consistency is silky and it leaves the area around the eyes smooth and de-puffed for a few hours. That&#x27;s really all you can expect from an eye cream.    -------------  Update  -------------  Radha is a new-ish company that is working on its packaging and branding. As someone who has purchased product from them before, I did receive plainer packaging than most. They reached out to me to ask more questions about what I did/didn&#x27;t like about the product and it&#x27;s packaging. They asked for a lot of seller feedback and showed that they care about their customer.    Now on to the product - For me, it&#x27;s a four star product because I have eyes that are candidates for botox. I need a rich, moisturizing cream. I have one that I love and will continue using during the day but I use this gel at night for a cooling effect. That seems to be working best for me. It&#x27;s not a holy grailbut it&#x27;s a nice booster to the cream I have.    Please note: Radha did NOT encourage or suggest that I change my review. I did not receive compensation or free products for writing this. I updated it without their input. It&#x27;s a solid four star product for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a month now. I&#x27;m still on the fence, but overall I like the product. I like that its a pump dispenser, but dislike that you can&#x27;t see how much product is left in the bottle. The price is great! I think for me it seems to be doing all it says it will minus the dark circles (still have those but to a lesser degree). I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m a fan of how tight it makes the skin around my eyes feel, and I think it would be better if it had more of a moisturizer, which I think I really need after using this for a month... Overall great value for the price.</li>
    <li> AI can see a difference in 2 weeks, the puffiness and dark circles are decreasing.  I dont have wrinkles so I cannot speaktothat\</li>
    <li> So far love this eye cream. As soon as you put it on, you can feel a slight tightening effect. So far, very happy with the Radha products and look forward to trying more</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to try out this product!&lt;br /&gt;Over the last month I&#x27;ve occasionally had people tell me &amp;#34;You look tired. How are you doing?&amp;#34;  (Don&#x27;t you hate that!?!?)  But since i&#x27;ve been using this product i haven&#x27;t got that comment. So, I believe that something is working ;)&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is actually pretty big (as you can see in my photo). The Radha Beauty Eye gel has a nice consistency, goes on very smoothly, and absorbs really well. It smells great too. The main ingredients that go into this gel are key components to increasing cell regrowth, improving discoloration and tightening/firming.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this gel. You only need a very small amount to cover the entire eye area.  So, I&#x27;m happy to see that it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product made me produce wrinkles after two weeks of using it!!!! I Bought it for my dark circles out it did nothing for them.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Haven&#x27;t seen major improvement but I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long. Feels cool and refreshing when applying. I like it and it&#x27;s a nice price too.</li>
    <li> Love it...my &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; felt more moisturized and a little less noticeable with a few uses!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who has puffy eyes. She called me to thank her for such a wonderful product. It worked miracles on her. Her eyes look so much better and tighter after a week. She said there was no irritation, no weird smells, no oily aftermath. Needless to say, it was a great purchase :)</li>
    <li> I got this product because lately I have notice bags under my eyes, the first thing I notice when I put it on was the pleasant scent of cucumber, I like that I can recognize most of the ingredients and they work, I put it on and saw a slight change within minutes, I&#x27;m  posting pictures of the before and after, I am very happy I was chosen to review this product for free, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results, I also like the pump dispenser as you get just what you need</li>
    <li> I received the product to try and review.  I really like it.  I like that it comes in a pump and easy to use...a little goes a long way.  After just a couple of weeks I noticed my eyes are less puffy, the biggest problem I tend to have.  It also helps to reduce dark circles.  Makes me look less tired and more refreshed.</li>
    <li> This eye gel has help with some of my&lt;br /&gt;Under eye puffiness. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye gel for over two months and in conjunction with vitamin c serums (from Radha and others). I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin. I am 39yo. I have 11 lines, and I have the beginnings of fine lines and wrinkles under the eyes along with crows feet. I&#x27;ve long had puffiness and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product twice! I was skeptical since many of these reviews were from people who received this item gratis. But I figured Amazon&#x27;s return policy is great and the price was right. Good choice!&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel is divine. It goes on smoothly and is soothing. It instantly plumps the areas around the eye and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. Over the course of two months and with vitamin c serum under this, my fine lines and wrinkles have improved ten-fold. My crows feet have stopped growing and have even retreated slightly. My skin has gotten brighter and smoother. Many of these effects/results can be attributed to the vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;Everything irritates my skin, but I haven&#x27;t experienced much irritation with this product and I have never experienced any redness. It stings a teeny, tiny amount when I apply it. It is extremely mild and I find it soothing after the one second sting dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Its claims are a bit bananas. I mean, for example, What eye gel or cream can reduce puffiness really? It isn&#x27;t t magic sauce. But it is a thoroughly great moisturizer with good actives. A bottle lasts well over a month of generous, twice-daily use. I keep one in the fridge because I like putting a cool gel on my eye in the morning to reduce puffiness (the cool gel reduces puffiness because it is cool, not because of any magic sauce).&lt;br /&gt;I almost gave it 4 stars because I hate when the claims are crazy. But for $20, I have a brilliant treatment-based,non-irritating eye gel that has given me results. Who am I to rain on that parade?</li>
    <li> I have been used it for constant 3 weeks, but so far I did not see any significant improvement, my whole purpose to buy this product is to reduce the dark circle under my both eye, but I don&#x27;t see any changes, so it is kind disappointed...not as good as the online review said.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother and my boyfriends mother! They both like the product and has helped with their dark circles and puffy eyes which is very hard for them to control at times! They loved the first application of a refreshing feel and said they could feel it work!</li>
    <li> This item was very helpful, especially with puffiness</li>
    <li> It seems like a temporary fix, when you put it on you notice a difference but after a few hours the bags come back.</li>
    <li> I like it maybe it s too soon to see the results but the skin under my eyes feels more firm</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product,with its all natural ingredients. Smells like aloe, feels great on my skin and is doing its job in the little bit of time I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Saw very little results with this product.</li>
    <li> Knowing that my under-eye bags are hereditary and only truly addressed by surgery, this product was a lovely surprise (only bought it due to the price, w/ fingers crossed!).  Firmer skin and significant reduction of bags.  Love it and will buy it again, and again...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and ferls refreshing. I like that it&#x27;s mainly organic ingredients!</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping with puffiness.</li>
    <li> refreshing, non greasy, makeup goes on smoothly over product</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I found this product on Amazon considering the super highly rated products that this brand has.  I have very dark circles under my eyes no matter what, it&#x27;s just hereditary, not really due to lack of sleep.  When I wake up the skin around my eyes is puffy, and dark.  I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams but so far this is the only one that has actually made any visible change.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days (2x per day) and I already can tell that the skin under my eyes is firmer and lighter.  I know that nothing will ever completely rid me of this but it&#x27;s pretty amazing how in only a few days this eye gel has already made a big difference.  Plus it&#x27;s very affordable and much less expensive than many eye creams I was considering.  Definitely try this product out!  I&#x27;m about to purchase some more Radha Beauty products too!</li>
    <li> Intensive Youth Eye Gel came in a .5 fl oz/15 ml bottle. It has a little pump at the top. The gel is a clear-ish, white-ish color with a very nice cucumber scent. I really like the scent. So the gel after you put it on you really can’t feel anything. It doesn&#x27;t make your face tight or anything. I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to the gel. And no instant results. But after a few days you can see a slight difference. I will say that my dark circles have reduced in the amount of darkness. My wrinkles are slightly better with being less noticeable. I guess I would have to use it longer for better results but I do see it working. I would recommend Intensive Youth Eye Gel to anyone who wants to see a difference with dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> it does make your skin feel tight, but leaves it extra shinny... Almost like putting elmer&#x27;s glue on your face. I saw zero DARK CIRCLE help, I found the off name brand Walmart eye serum does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks and I can actually say it works. there are no major changes yet but I can tell a difference because my eyes are not as puffy and my face feels a little softer. My bags were not that noticeable but I could see them and I can tell that they are slightly going away. when you put gel on it goes on smooth and it makes your face feel so soft and it smells good as well. You know all products work different for everyone but I really recommend trying this eye gel if you bags or any puffiness under your eyes.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - Works really well with quick results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how so many ppl wrote such great reviews. It did absolutely nothing for my dark circles. I&#x27;m 36 and take excellent care of my skin, but I have dark circles around my eyes. When I first used this it smelled pretty awful (sort of like a plant and dirt mixed). The smell did get better or I&#x27;m just used to it...I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve used it for 1month now with no results. I had such high hopes😕 I&#x27;ll continue to use it til it runs out, bc I don&#x27;t like wasting my money, but won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.    UPDATE: After writing the above review Radha&#x27;s CEO contacted me immediately. They were upset that I had a bad experience,and apologized for my troubles. They told me that as a company who stands behind their products, and who wants their customers to be happy &amp; have a positive buying experience with them, they&#x27;d issue me a full refund. I didn&#x27;t even have to return the rest of the product I didn&#x27;t use. Not only did I get a refund, but they let me pick out another product of theirs to try for free including shipping!    Every time I communicated with them they responded right away, even calling me. You just don&#x27;t find that kind of customer service nowadays! I&#x27;m absolutely 100% happy with this company. I can&#x27;t wait to try the Vitamin C serum they sent me. I hope it works, and if it does you can gaurentee I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy with them in the future. Superior customer service! Really great company! I didn&#x27;t give 5stars bc I realize this is a product review not a seller review. Even though their customer service is five+ stars the eye gel unfortunately just didn&#x27;t work for me. So, I met in the middle with 3stars, but I&#x27;m 100% happy with this company!</li>
    <li> I bought it at November 26, 2014, one month after my eyes have a wrinkle,&lt;br /&gt;It is very dry in my eyes, I feel is not suitable for me, now I have to stop using, I don&#x27;t know where to get these five-star reviews, but it misled me, really spend money buy wrinkles.</li>
    <li> After applying the gel below both eyes, within 12 hrs I experianced a reaction to the gel. I take the drug Terasosin for my enlarged prostate (BPH) and the gel apparently interfered with the drug doing its job. After 2 days from stopping the use of the gel, the effects worn off and I am back to normal. If you take Terazosin or Flowmax, I would be cautious using this product.</li>
    <li> My skin is usually very sensitive and reacts even to products designed for sensitive skin, this gel is an exception, providing light moisturizing that smells like springtime and feels wonderful. I have been using it on my entire face and loving it.</li>
    <li> really like this product...pleased with results so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream specifically for my dark eye circles and baggy eyes. All those nights of staying up till 3 in the morning has really taken its toll on my skin and I really needed a product to help. I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly 3 weeks now and wanted to give you guys an update on what&#x27;s going on. The dark eye circles are still extremely prevalent. I know that this only worked for a select few, but alas, it didn&#x27;t work for me. A couple reason I can think of is that my dark eye circles might have been caused by sinus problems or wearing glasses. As for the baggy skin under the eyes, I do notice a slight improvement; the wrinkles have reduced a bit and the skin feels a bit tighter now. The eye cream is a gel-like substance that spreads very well, so make sure you use only a drop of it when applying. It actually doesn&#x27;t smell like lotion, it kind more like plants because of the plant stem cells they use. Don&#x27;t worry, the smell isn&#x27;t bad, I actually kind of like it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> While the product moisturizes my eye area, it did nothing to reduce puffiness.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the positive reviews I&#x27;d previously read about this product and wasn&#x27;t very familiar with the brand but I&#x27;ve been searching for a really good eye cream to preemptively fight aging at the age of 26. This stuff is great! It has a somewhat cooling effect and within minutes you can see the difference. You get a small amount but a little goes a long way. I have combination skin and the skin around my eyes tends to be on the oilier side and this product didn&#x27;t make my eyes appear oily or effect the skin around my eyes negatively at all. I&#x27;d highly recommend it- it truly works!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work although I probably gave up,too early</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye gel. I put it twice a day, morning and night. After I finished the first bottle,  I discovered that it really helped puffiness under my eye. I have no doubt to order the 2nd bottle. I will keep using this eye gel under the bag under my eye area gone.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have a hard time with retinols and eye cream in general without a reaction. I was using loreal eye cream and wanted to try something more natural. Loreal felt good but I never see any change. This bottle is now white by the way and all plastic, but the pump is good. I don&#x27;t need a full pump of this, so you will need to gently push it for a little bit. RADHA is great, but the plastic and metal bottles are not fancy. A little tiny bit does both eyes, so this will last several months. I like the way it feels and never expect a miracle product, so for what it is I like it and will most likely use this instead of drug store cream as long as the price stays low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to try things like this, but I have to say, I am very pleased with this product.  I have been using it twice daily for about a week now.  I was afraid to try it when I looked at the ingredients, as \\&quot;Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber Hydrosol) was listed as one of the top ingredients.  I once had a facial and they put cucumbers on my eyes for about 10 minutes....this proved to cause me much agony!!!  Come to find out, I am allergic to them.  This product has not caused any irritation at all.  Anyway, I can definitely feel that the product is working.  The skin under my eyes and my forehead feel much tighter.  I am 39 years old and have 4 kids, so this is super important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is .5 fluid ounces and doesn&#x27;t look very big, but a very small dab goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is manufactured in the USA!!!!!!  This is a super big deal to me.  Thank you Radha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also NOT tested on animals!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I can say.....if you ever need anything from this company, they are VERY quick to get back to you.  They have excellent customer service and a 100% quality guarantee.</li>
    <li> Another awesome product! My mom Is always sharing her eye and face creams with me so when I got in this eye gel I was excited to be able to share something with her. She has dry skin and sometimes has a hard time finding facial products that suit her needs. She absolutely loved this! Pleasant smell and works quickly!</li>
    <li> Before using this, I definitely had sagging under my eyes and black circles. I go to bed around 11:00 pm every night and wake up around 5:05 am. on week days. So, I don’t get much sleep and my eyes show it.  I was excited to try this eye gel(which I received for free, but all opinions are my own) to see if it would help. It’s really easy to use. I just squeeze a small amount on a Q-tip and spread it around the bottom and sides of my eyes. It goes on very smoothly and is a little cool so it’s refreshing. At night, my lotion goes on really nice over it, and in the morning my foundation just glides over it and doesn’t sink into my fine lines. My eyes are sensitive, I have to use a foaming eye wash in the shower, but because of the natural ingredients, this eye gel didn’t bother me at all. After using the Intensive Youth Eye Gel for 12 days, the black circles under my eyes aren’t noticeable anymore. The skin also doesn’t look so saggy anymore. I also think my skin tone looks much brighter and there aren’t as many fine lines and wrinkles anymore. I am looking forward to continuing using this product and seeing how much better my eyes will look.</li>
    <li> Noticed immediate skin tightening and dark circles went away. Really great product!</li>
    <li> Really like this gel, it feels nice and cool when applying it.</li>
    <li> I brought mine from seller &amp;#34;Radha Beauty Products&amp;#34; and package came pre-opened.&lt;br /&gt;And after pumping for a dozen time there was only a very small amount came out and have less than .1 fl oz. inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I thought it would, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new eye gel and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try and am so happy I did.  Great price and great results.  I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
    <li> Love it..great product!</li>
    <li> Yes I have puffy eys and hate it. I&#x27;ve tried alot of different products without any results. I got this put it on before bed and woke up looking better than I have in months. I will be purchasing this again. Shipping right on time.</li>
    <li> I tested this product by applying it to only one eye for several weeks, and I saw no difference. Update: While this particular product did not work for me, the manufacturer has some wonderful people working for them who stands behind the product(s) they sell and will make sure you are satisfied. I later tried a different Radha Beauty product and I do like it. Thank you for your A+ customer service, Radha!</li>
    <li> I really, really love this eye gel. I think it has taken at least a couple of years off my appearance, maybe more. It plumps the skin and smooths the wrinkles, and even lightens the dark circles a bit. I&#x27;ve even been using it on my neck, and the crepey vertical lines on my throst have completely disappeared!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t worked for me. What troubles me some is that the company announces and provides other free products to customers after they write a review so I think some of the reviews may be biased. I bought this product because it was so highly rated but since this marketing tactic has come to light, I don&#x27;t really trust the ratings.  I read the reviews at the time and someone else had said this...I should&#x27;ve listened and not wasted my money.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that really works on undereye circles.</li>
    <li> Item went on smoothly without being sticky. It feels good to wear!</li>
    <li> I love Radha! I got this product through a promotion. I left a good review on another great product of theirs (the Radha Rosehip Oil) and was eligible for this product. My eyes are quite large and on my brown complexion, the dark circles can really make me look wiped out. I don&#x27;t usually notice such a quick difference with products but this eye cream is wonderful</li>
    <li> Love Radha Eye Gel. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> How do I get my money back? This eye cream actually did not work for me and made my eye area worse! I have discontinued use and hope my eye area returns to the way it was before using this eye cream.</li>
    <li> im ALWAYS skeptical when it comes to products that promise dramatic results. i&#x27;ve had horrible bags &amp; esp. dark circles for years now, &amp; had tried several top name-rated products, none of which provided many results @ all. 1 day i heard someone discuss this item on a radio-talk show, -how someone&#x27;s wife had tried it, &amp; now swore by it, so i looked it up &amp; made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;  the package arrived early, undamaged in a protective envelope. right away i liked the compact-like container it came in. the easy to remove cap &amp; pump dispenser keeps the cosmetic neat &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;  upon opening &amp; using the product, i noticed the refreshing scent of aloe, which is soothing. i noticed the way the serum absorbed itself INTO my skin-- while moist @ 1st, it dried within a minute, soft &amp; clean.  unbelievable as this may sound, i noticed results right away-  the comforting feel of tender under-eye area was nor greasy or heavy. within 2 days, the surface &amp; texture of thin skin around my eyes was much more solid, and the 3rd day, a family member told me the dark circles i&#x27;d had for so long were GONE.&lt;br /&gt;  i LOVE this item &amp; now use it on my entire face &amp; neck. i live in a very cold, dry, windy climate, &amp; the packaging of this item allows me to easily drop it in my purse for use during the day if needed. the light serum composition blends right in with my makeup, no problem &amp; i can use it alone or combine it with my usual moisturizer @ bedtime. thx radha~!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and applied a small amount of gel around my eyes, forehead, and upper cheek area, day and night before my moisturizer. When I had the eye gel on, I noticed that it felt a little heavy compared to other gels I have used in the past. With the winter temperatures lately, I felt that was perfect for deeply hydrating my eye area. If you are a makeup wearer, I suggest you allow the eye gel to completely dry, if not, it does feel a bit tacky and will gum up. After a few weeks of using the eye gel, I did notice less fine lines, a brighter sheen, and a dewy look to my eye area. The eye gel is great for all skin types and can be used day and/or night.</li>
    <li> Only on day three of using this product &amp; not only does it burn under my eyes, I&#x27;ve also developed deep creases! I&#x27;ve never had lines under my eyes, only dark circles. I&#x27;m panicking, I look older! I&#x27;m throwing this crap away! I feel scammed!!</li>
    <li> It is a very good option for imperfections under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the reviews &amp; I cannot agree with the positive ratings. I have been using this gel as directed with NO results. I have no idea what all these positive reviews are about, but once again wasted my money for an under the eye product.😞</li>
    <li> Due to my busy schedule, i don&#x27;t get to drink much water l, high salt intake and with late nights. These have caused severe puffiness around my eyes and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using SK-II eye cream for a year. It didn&#x27;t help much on my puffy eyes. It improves the dryness on my eye area but it stings my upper eyelid. I had to use cold pack to get rid of the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The puffiness around my eyes and face get worst during PMS. After started with Redha eye cream. I get to see amazing results in less than a week. My eyes are no longer looking puffy! And guess what? That was during my PMS which was supposed to get bad puffy eyes! NO more puffy eyes after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this product on my puffy face. I applied small amount on the puffy area. It works wonder after 3-4 days use. My face gets less puffy. And I&#x27;m looking slimmer and fresh on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on fine lines on my upper eyelid area... Probably it needs some amount of time to see visible result. As I&#x27;ve just started only for 2.5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works wonder! I&#x27;d definitely reorder it again and recommend it someone who have puffiness around eyes and face.</li>
    <li> Used the product as directed for 30 days and really couldn&#x27;t see any noticable change, though my skin seemed softer</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6e21b2f576e266277f15735e82ceec28]]I rarely get sleep. Enough sleep that is with toddlers and a list of stuff to get done I&#x27;m always running around with bags and dark circles under my eyes. I love some of the ingredients in this eye cream. Cucumber is my favorite, plus it has Aloe and vitamin E. It also has Hyaluronic acid which seems to work for me. As for my dark bags under my eyes after using this product for several days my bags are much less noticeable. They aren&#x27;t as dark and puffy. Another thing about this is it doesnt contain sulfates. I have chemical allergies and this product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Sulfate free is a great thing for skin products. After using it I wanted to use it all over my face, so after I reread the description it mentions using it on your forehead and other areas. Overall nice eye gel.</li>
    <li> This is, without a doubt, the best eye cream I have tried thus far. I typically do not like gels as they can feel sticky and dry a little tight feeling. Not the case with this one, it is very smooth and dries to a soft finish. I was a little concerned with how small the product was, but I have used this for over month now and have not yet run out. 1/2 pump is plenty to do both eyes, upper and lower, and even smoothing some onto the upper cheekbones. So, it goes a really long way. The results I&#x27;ve seen in just one month are dramatic. The color under my eyes has visibly lightened, fine lines have all but disappeared and deeper wrinkles have noticeably softened. I have been using it in conjunction with Radha&#x27;s Vit. C Serum and Miracle Retinol Moisturizer and could not be more thrilled with the results. I am excited to see results with ongoing use!</li>
    <li> Have no seen any improvement around my eyes. I still have puffy eyes &amp; still have dark circles.</li>
    <li> I love Rahda Beauty Products Eye Cream!!! It feels amazingly cool to the touch and is refreshing on my skin. I  would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has complaints of dark circles, puffiness or fine lines under their eyes. Its a must buy!</li>
    <li> Truly works.  Have spent a lot of money on eye creams over the years to get rid of puffiness.  I wanted to wait a few weeks before I wrote a review.  Even if you skip a day,  the product still works.  Have not seen results in dark circles.  Maybe over time this will resolve itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few weeks ago, but jumped on the chance to use a coupon that was offered for my unswayed evaluation of the product because *LOVE* i would have repurchased when I was done with the first one...but I am good for a while since you only need to apply very little.  It&#x27;s not a miracle solution.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, I wish you much luck, but it firms without drying, moisturizes without causing breakouts, and I absolutely love to use this around my lips almost as much as around the eyes.  A half pump is more than enough.  My mineral makeup applies very smoothly and easily over the gel.  The only thing I would even think about changing would be to have this wonderful pump dispenser connected to a clear bottle so that you can see how much product remains in the tube.  Just for reference, I have aging 50+ skin, combination, sometimes prone to breakouts...</li>
    <li> My wide told me this really works.</li>
    <li> So far no change in eye appearance.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome it works and you will love it guys</li>
    <li> I really love the consistency of this cream/gel.  Not very sticky and doesn&#x27;t take a long time dry.  I love the results and feel it helps make my under eye makeup look a little more flawless.  It did does help with De-puffing the under eye, especially on days where you do not want to wear make up, but still want to look a little awake.  Definite must have the busy mom on the go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*powered by brandbacker*</li>
    <li> This is my third attempt to purchase an under cream to help reduce the appearance of my inherited under eye bags. I have been using this product for three weeks, and yes it does help. It took about a week before I started noticing improvement, but I am pleased with the results. I still have bags but they are visibly diminished, which is more than I can about the last two products.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 4 days and there is no noticable improvement. I&#x27;ll give it a week or so.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two days. I put it in the morning. It hasnt made a difference. My eyes are still puffy. :( But maybe with time. I will update my review after a month or so.</li>
    <li> A very small dab of this cream goes a very long way. It has helped with the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is so soothing to my eye area ..  will buy again..</li>
    <li> I love the fresh scent of aloe and the ingredients are amazing. Use before bed! Using twice a day consistently was the key to seeing results, for me, especially at night.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Radha- This product is so easy to use(a lil dab will do) the texture is silky not greasy- I apply to my forehead around my eyes and cheeks- I love how it instantly depuffs my eyes and those tiny lil lines are fuller looking! Hopefully over time the will completely disappear-I use this product in combination with their Rosehip oil and the sundamage on my face is fading dramatically- Thanks again Radha</li>
    <li> Works! They aren&#x27;t kidding! Depuffs, smooths fine lines, dark circles are fading fast. Sometimes I wake up with puffy eyes from allergies, and if I put this on before i make my coffee, the bags are gone by the time I get out of the shower -- then I put on a little more! I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying.</li>
    <li> good product for sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working and there&#x27;s no objections. Feels good without irritation.</li>
    <li> 4 months twice a day everyday!!! and no improvement. I believe all the great reviews are lies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now and I have not seen any results as removing the bags,I do like how it makes my under eye feel.Nice and smooth</li>
    <li> works good for puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is ok. There may have been a slight difference in the amount of puffiness under my eyes. I did however like the slight scent it has. I was also very happy with the service! The product came quickly!</li>
    <li> Radha sends you emails updating the status of your order and also sends you a &amp;#34;How to use&amp;#34; your Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve been using this line of products for over two weeks and I do believe my face looks smoother and more healthy. You may see many reviewers got the product free to review it but I bought these products. I have to say this order is my second and I plan on sticking with this line. Happy customer here!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, at least for me.</li>
    <li> As a mother of three energetic boys under he age of 5, I don&#x27;t get much sleep. Because of this, I have the worst bags ever under my eyes. this cream has literally lightened those bags so much that they are now the same tone as my regular skin and are literally gone.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams and this is the only one I have I seen good results.  I will recommend it to my friends and definetly will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the prices I have paid for eye creams in the past, I&#x27;ll be saving money and at the time getting good results</li>
    <li> This is my new eye cream. I used to be eye cream from brands such as Avon or Loreal. I will no longer be buying the name brand products because this product works so much better. I am in the service industry and work night hours. I used to have drippy, dull eyes. Now people ask me what is a young lady like you working at night. Young lady? I am an older adult who just looks more youthful. This product is worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m receiving positive feedback from relatives and friends.  It goes on silky smooth.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It is okay. It lightened my eyes up a little bit. I go to school full time and I also work full time so I stay up a lot but this product did not really work as well as i thought it would.</li>
    <li> This wonderful eye gel by Radha is the newest addition to my daily beauty routine and staple going forward!  I have very sensitive skin and have had a lot of trouble with eye gels and creams alike for years. problems would include redness, irritation, itching and burning, but NOT with Radha! I love how quickly the gel absorbs, is very mild but also highly effective! After only a couple of weeks of using this product I can see a definite improvement in fine lines, texture and overall tone around the eyes! I will be back for more, thank you Radha!</li>
    <li> seems to be helping with my husbands eyes.... so far its a really good product it does revitalize on the forst day and it gets better with every day that goes by</li>
    <li> The carrier left the package behind a bush and the heat melted the contents.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product. After doing lots of research and reading tons of reviews I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly it broke my face out under my eyes. I am sure it is a wonderful product just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Still I don&#x27;t see difference. Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream! I&#x27;ve tried multiple ones for dark under eye circles and I feel like this one is fairly effective so far. It goes on smoothly and I feel like it really hydrates my skin. I saw that one review said to put it in the fridge and I&#x27;m going to try that as well! So far it&#x27;s a 5 star for me!</li>
    <li> Great stuff this works for me and I am 57 years old and do have wrinkles around eyes not anymore I used this stuff love it. will order again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little early to tell how much of a difference this is going to make, but I do see a subtle change. I like the consistency of the gel as well as the cooling effect.  I will continue to use since it has only been 16 days.  It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;, but I am happy I see a little change thus far. It is better than the zillion other eye gels/creams I have used.  I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; 66 years old and won&#x27;t be using any Botox.  I&#x27;m glad to have found this gel for my puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see a vast difference. This cream does make it feel like your undereyes are tighter than normal. The pump design is great to dispense a small amount. It is a little pricey for a small quantity but I feel like all eye cream is a little expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> This is literally the LAST eye gel you will ever buy! I have tried literally hundreds of eye creams; gels; serums but this is the only one that does what it says it will do. If you want a real treat; put this little beauty in the refrigerator. I would always wake up with bags under my eyes and dark circles no matter what I did or used the night before. I do not have this problem now and actually look forward to checking my look in the mirror in the morning. I LOVE how this feels and just glides on and is instantly absorbed. Also such a treat for your whole face. Even without keeping this in the &#x27;fridge it has a real cooling effect and is like an instant eye and face lift. I love that it is all natural too! Took me almost 50 years but I now have my dream eye cream! This is one company that is definitely going places as the products are well priced and do what they say they will. I cant wait to see what she is coming out with next! Trust me; you will not be disappointed in this product - oh and a little goes a long way and it makes a great primer for makeup too!</li>
    <li> Leaves a smooth, clean finish.  Not oily or drying.  Great product for those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I got this cream about a week ago, after absolutely loving the quality and effects of Radha&#x27;s rosehip oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, and so far I am really pleased with this product.  It goes on really smoothly, makes my under-eye area feel refreshed and plumped (I have natural under-eye hollows), and also has ameliorated some slight crepiness I had going on with my eyelids.  I can only expect to see even better results as I&#x27;ve been using it a little longer.  I love that it is made with natural ingredients, is super gentle and my makeup goes on so well over top of it!! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in hopes it would help my under eye dark circles but it didn&#x27;t.  It definitely helps with puffiness because it goes on super cool and feels wonderful.  My dark circles are not that dark but still I have not seen any change.</li>
    <li> So far it is working - Thanks Radha!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with high hopes and have used it as instructed for about three weeks.  It has a nice cucumber scent but I cannot honestly say I see a sure difference.  It may be my genetics to have puffy under-eyes no matter what product I use.  I do see that it works well for others so I&#x27;m going to keep using it and hope  to see a marked improvement in time.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple of weeks, and the under-eye puffiness/bags seem to have decreased some...</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  Wrinkles less noticeable!</li>
    <li> Love the eye cream from Radha...amazing on eye puffiness! You do not need a lot as a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I usually have bags under the eyes, the eye gel is very effective at reducing these bags. I have tried many eye creams in the past; this is the most effective.</li>
    <li> So far every single Radha product I have used I love!  This eye cream is no exception.  I simply love it!!! It adsorbs quickly so you can apply makeup right after use.  Feels great on the skin and the pump provides the right amount for both eyes!</li>
    <li> Awesome, you need very little to go a long way.  Usually to see results with product you must use for two or more weeks so I will wait and see if there is major visible changes.  Otherwise I like the way it feels and being a licensed esthetician I can tell you this is a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;Also the received the product very quickly, great customer service.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I had bad dark circles and a lot of puffiness.  Now I have none.  I have used this product for only about three weeks.  I have never found a product that would take care of circles and puffiness.  What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 4-5 weeks now. I&#x27;m in my early 20s and unfortunately I&#x27;ve been blessed with dark circles under my eyes and occasionally puffiness. Since using this product the puffiness has decreased significantly, but the dark circles remain. It&#x27;s mostly a hereditary thing for me. Out of alot of creams I&#x27;ve tried this one is probably the best though. Affordable price and it makes the tender skin below my eye very tight. Hopefully this works better for you than it has for me.</li>
    <li> I always had puffiness under my eyes but lately it has increased and also started showing dark circles.I took pictures everyday while using this product ,at the same place at the same time the picture on the left on day 1 is with under eye concealer and the one for today is without any makeup , I saw a difference in under eye darkness and puffiness , will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it works really good. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> This ia an amazing product and I love it.  I would definately order this product again.  Love every item I have ordered from Radha!!  Package was delivered before expected time.  Feels awesome going on and rest of day.  Using it morning and night.  Love!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  Only been using it for a short time but I can already tell a big difference in the wrinkles at the corners of my eyes and bottom lash line,  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye serum. Not really a cream. It seems very hydrating</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too far gone as I don&#x27;t really notice any difference.  Logic tells one that simply applying a cream will make you look 5 years younger.  Shoulda listened to my brain on this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product so far!  I have been using the organic rosehip oil and am a fan for life.  Now, I am a fan of the eye gel as well. I appreciate the natural ingredients and the wonderful results they produce!</li>
    <li> i am very pleased and impressed this eye gel it is a very light gel and goes in the skin very fast. you can see the difference in seconds. the best eye gel i purchased so far. will definitely buy again..but i still got lots of gel left, it is very efficient. i can just recommend</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t expect to see much of a difference over other moisturizers, but I was pleasantly surprised! I used it under my eyes and around the crows feet I pretend I don&#x27;t have and it made my skin smoother and evened out the deeper lines I am starting to get. The puffiness went away and I am not seeing the dark circles I usually see. My eyes don&#x27;t have that baggy look anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way too! You don&#x27;t have to slather it on to see a difference so that appeals to the frugal side of me.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about what beauty products I purchase. The ingredients are superb! So much goodness in every drop. The consistency is a light, creamy gel. Not at all sticky. it goes on smoothly and instantly absorbs. Another fantastic item from Radha!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 weeks and so far it does not appear to work at all.</li>
    <li> I got a full size sample of this product as part of a tester group and was surprised to find I really, really love it. The packaging is what I would consider more masculine then a lot of other eye creams or gels but it doesn&#x27;t have any disconcertable scent or smell. I have super sensitive skin and allergies so my eyes are often irritated and I am frequently rubbing them, especially in the morning. Dry sore rubbed up skin makes me slightly hesitant to try a new eye product but since it was free and I had previous tried their rose hip oil and liked it I thought it was well worth the chance. As it dried the gel makes the skin around my eyes and brows feel firmer without feeling sticky or burning. It is the slightest hint of coolness but without any menthol sting and it did not leave any flakes or reside that I could see after it was dry. Overall, I thought this was a even better product then the last one I sampled with them and I would seriously consider buying a full price one after</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this eye gel. I&#x27;ve only been using a week but I can see a difference. I love the smell of it too. Definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see any visible difference.</li>
    <li> great product, great customer service.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, works as described.</li>
    <li> I like this product, as it absorbs into the skin rather than just sit on top of it.  I was hoping it would do more for dark circles and puffiness, but it was okay.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks, and hoping after a month to see a difference.  It seems to work the longer you have it on, but not sure if it is all I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whole the bottle but my skin has nothing changed...</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really c a difference but then again its takes more then a month 2 c a difference!!! I  think by now it should have shown a little bit of a difference but not anything that I have noticed!!! Any suggestions??</li>
    <li> Just received this product. Looking forward to see over time how it works. Testing it out!</li>
    <li> After just a few days I see noticeable improvements in my skin around my eyes. The wrinkles are clearing and dark circles have become much less noticeable</li>
    <li> I really like this eye get.  My eyes are sensitive to lots of creams, but this does not bother them at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is working good on the bags and wrinkles and un-puffs  skin around my eyes...</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a month.. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and it arrived quickly, also I like that it has a pump. That is why it gets 3 stars. As far as the product doing what it says it will do... I have seen no improvement in puffiness or the darkness under my eyes. I also do not like the slightly sticky feeling to it.</li>
    <li> I really like it- it goes on so nice and not greasy like some are!</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff Will be buying more when I run out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 weeks. It does not work on dark circles. I would recommend for wrinkles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> Read great reviews on this product, however, it did nothing for me.  I have been using it since I ordered it in March.  No improvement.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate that I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I have 1 month already using this, day and night very carefully and I have not seen any results, I see my dark circles and bags the same, I am getting dissapointed, I bought 2 units, I am thinking about returning the other one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works at all.  Been using for weeks now I have not noticed any changes.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to really help with the puffiness!</li>
    <li> After a few days use I&#x27;m noticing an improvement in the wrinkles and bags under my eyes. Puffiness is going away.</li>
    <li> My daughter used to have darck circle under her eyes that&#x27;s why i bought this for her to try. I was not dissapointed with the result! My daughter ia satisfied with the result, she said her dark circle get a little lighter after a week of using it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me..it made my eyes darker and it dried my skin tremendously. I had to go get Indian hemp and that helped my skin and eyes</li>
    <li> Just started using this product but am very happy with the consistency and the way it is quickly absorbed into the skin.  lightweight, non greasy and very moisturizing.  can&#x27;t wait to see what effects I see in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> Its really small for the price. I hope it works.</li>
    <li> I’ve been having major issues with circles under my eyes recently, probably due to having three kiddos I run after all day and two of them seem to have become insomniacs leaving me with little sleep! The dark circles under my eyes are starting to show my lack of sleep and I had been meaning to find a solution to them ASAP! Enter Radha Beauty Eye Gel a tiny little pump spread under your eyes on those dark circles and the surrounding areas once in the morning and once at night. I’ve used it for a few days now and it’s working awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached a pic of my circles up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses… yes still small bits of bags under my eyes but not as bad. I took two pictures in the same room with the same lighting. I have a friend that is a stickler for lighting who says that before and after photos need to be taken in the same light to show the effects. Since the picture I’ve used it a few more times with even better results but this is to show you the results start showing pretty quickly! If you notice they aren’t as puffy and the redness went down a bunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel did a pretty good job as far as I’m concerned and I’ll keep applying it to make those dark circles diminish for good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> This is awesome, I use it along with my Eb5 eye cream....works great and the skin around my eyes looks great!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the dark circles under my eyes but it didn&#x27;t make any difference after using it for three weeks twice a day. It wasn&#x27;t very helpful to me.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great.  I can tell a difference right away in regards to wrinkles and puffiness under the eyes.  It smells great, just like cucumbers.  I use it every day and definitely know when I have not used it!!  Thank you for such great products.  I will order more when I run out for sure.</li>
    <li> Just started using this cream 2 weeks ago and I already see a big improvement in the bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this amazing cream, not only does it diminish the dark circles around my eyes, it makes my eyes feel refreshed and wide awake. Definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s fought with other creams fro dark circles....This one truly works!</li>
    <li> This gel causes me to get hard bumps under my eyes. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all so I was very surprised that the gel caused this reaction. Only used twice and will not use again.</li>
    <li> It is very nice cream.</li>
    <li> First of all- the company is incredibly easy and wonderful to coordinate with- I was able to request information and give feedback directly to them and they were so accommodating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second- this stuff is pretty great. I&#x27;m not usually one to have difficulties with my eyes but this month has proven very busy. I&#x27;m working full time and in rehearsals for a production all evening and have really been able to hone my &amp;#34;I look totally exhausted and awful also droopy eyed and pale&amp;#34; look. The eye gel helped me rein in my sleepy eyes and stay nice and hydrated with this dry winter air. I&#x27;m in my 20s so the wrinkle aspect is less of a concern but I can see how it could be helpful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33yrs old this year. Serious speaking, i hv been looking for a good eye gel for long, had tried so many brands all along. My first try of this eye gel. Tried for two weeks upon receiving it. Really can see the improvement of my under eye dark circles, lighten and smother fine lines as well as reduce my puffy under eyes. Even my hubby said so.. Its time for me to say &#x27;Bye Bye&#x27; to my eye concealer..lol A little sticky feeling but good as an eye make up base for eyeshadow though. I will buy some more and continue using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so cool! You can feel it working immediately. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my dark circles but mine are genetic so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m ever gonna fix that. That said, I feel that the product works wonderful for my wrinkles and I can feel it tighten around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Doesint work at all don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Went on smoothly. Didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
    <li> See my recommendation for the eye mask.  Use it together.  Absolutely the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting on writing a review just to give it a fair chance.  This product does help with puffiness and bags very well.  The ingredients are awesome.  I don&#x27;t have very dark circles and think this product will help with what I do have but it probably needs to be used for months to see results.  The great thing about this eye gel is that it absorbs quickly so you can use it under your concealer before putting on your make up.  Greatly helps with the dryness around the eye area and the creasing that happens over the day.  I would buy this product again because I love the ingredients she uses and the great customer service.  Also you need very little of this product and I like that its in a pump so you don&#x27;t have to stick your finger in any product.  Why wouldn&#x27;t you buy something that is natural as opposed to synthetic products.  Also her rose oil is fantastic.  You would think your face would be oily from it but its so soothing and also absorbs quickly.  I put it on and then go to sleep on my silk pillow case and nothing happens.</li>
    <li> Tried this gel to help with puffiness under my eyes. After a couple of months I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in puffiness. Dark circles may be slightly improved. I&#x27;m in my forties with 2 young kids, and a specialist said my eye puffiness may be genetic, so this gel may not be a miracle cure for tired moms or bad genes.</li>
    <li> Wow, I had to wait a few nights before I wrote a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic!  I was using eye gels costing $200 and it didn&#x27;t come close to this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down the very best! I prefer an eye gel around my eyes as it weighs less on that already fragile skin. Radha Beauty&#x27;s eye fell feels so great on and leaves your eyes looking refreshed w/o any greasy film remaining. It last a long time too! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for months now and just started my second bottle. You simply can&#x27;t beat the cost nor the quality. Having purchased countless items over the years and throwing most away basically unused for various reasons, the Radha Beauty line has been a truly pleasant surprise. I&#x27;m completely sold. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other after trying theirs! You can see and feel the difference! Others will too!!!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This really tightens and lifts. It&#x27;s not blepharoplasty, but it really helps. And the cucumber scent is pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have a serious problem with dark under eye circles, which made this product attractive to me and piqued my interest in trying it.I was impressed because it was a top seller on Amazon and because of the blend of ingredients including Hyaluronic Acid, Cucumber Hydrosol, Vitamin E, Organic Aloe and more. I felt that it did a great job at helping to plump up my sagging and sad under eye area, and reduce the dark discoloration. I would recommend this product to any of my peers and would be happy to try any other Rahda Beauty Products.</li>
    <li> I always had stubborn  dark circles under my eyes, I have tried several products but all they did was to make my eyes itch. Lately, in addition to dark circles I started having bags under my eyes. I ordered this product &amp; within a few days of using it my bags disappeared &amp; I noticed that the dark circles started to lighten up. Incidentally, my eyes don&#x27;t itch from using this product. I highly recommend this &amp; I will keep using. it.</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference. Would not buy again..</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks and I do see a difference. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This caused an irritation and caused the appearance of dry/white skin under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I naturally have dark circles. Not even makeup can hide it. I wasn&#x27;t even looking for anything to really help with it and kind of dropped onto this item. I have been using it for a week now and I am really surprised at what a difference it has made. The puffy under eye has really gone down and the dark circles has slowly lightened. Pretty awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have dark eye circles. This product helps reduce them but not get rid of them fully.</li>
    <li> I had chronic puffy eyes for a year no matter how much I slept or how hydrated I was. This product made it disappear but it&#x27;s not overnight. Give it a couple of weeks, using it once at night and once in the morning. You&#x27;ll see a huge difference in a few days but the full effect is a couple of weeks later. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Maybe it works a little bit, but without any spectacular results</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and so far so good - Easy to use and feels ok/good. Th bottle is a bit small for the price.</li>
    <li> I really love how my concealer applies over this eye gel.  Also my undereye area feels very moisturized and smooth.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Works great, exactly as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I got this from my mom, she was very dark rings under her eyes it&#x27;s actually lighting them up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 7 weeks now without any noticeable difference in the appearance of the bags under my eyes.  I am giving this product two stars because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I have very sensitive skin - my face swelled after using Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar moisturizer which is supposed to be hypo-allergenic) and it smells nice, like cucumbers.</li>
    <li> Sticky and drying under the eye</li>
    <li> a refreshing feel to the eyes dark cirlces have lighten abit</li>
    <li> I have had this product only for a couple of weeks maybe - cannot really tell if it works for the reason I bought it. I have not seen a difference so far.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. First time dark circles and puff disappeared.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a week.  I&#x27;m already noticing some improvement around my eyes!  I feel it working!  Other products I have tried did not do this!  The price is great and I now want to try other products from you... Thank You Rahda!  :)</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free for review and Radha beauty is my new fav!! this is the second product I have gotten to try and I adore them, work so well and amazing results!</li>
    <li> It took a month but I am seeing results.</li>
    <li> I have been using Radha Beauty Intensive Eye Gel for about a week now and let me tell you that I love it!!! I suffer from Dark circles and puffiness so wen I came across this product I really wanted to give it a try. When I did I felt in love it works very fast  it removed my dark circles and puffiness very fast.. I absolutely recommend this Eye Gel it is my favorite &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Sponsered Post</li>
    <li> Gave it 4 Stars coz I like it but gonna give it more time to see if the wrinkles start going away. Didn&#x27;t notice till this morning at work but the dark circles are fading. Mine are no as bad as some other people were commenting but still. Now the main reason for me to get them was the puffiness in just one of my eyes - so annoying -  and the dark circles. Regarding the puffiness, I think it&#x27;s working on it but then I&#x27;ll see it again so I&#x27;ll keep using it &amp; will update my review,&lt;br /&gt;Great Customer Service I gotta say!</li>
    <li> This is now my top,favorite eye cream! My eyes are extremely sensitive! It lasts a long time! One pump for both eyes. It has a velvet like consistency. But you can feel it working! But it didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all. I have bags and hooding. So I didid use it on the hood,brow bone area also. Thrilled I found something I can afford,crueltyfree and works!!</li>
    <li> Thanks Rahda for such an incredible eye cream! This product feels soo cooling around my eyes everytime I put it on! Would I purchase this again, YES I WOULD!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, but you have to use it everyday to see results</li>
    <li> Soothing scent. My eyes feel firmer already.</li>
    <li> I read up on the best eye and face products to get before buying this. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I constantly have dark circles under my eyes and after using the intensive youth eye gel and little morning and night, I see a significant improvement in just a short amount of days. Please click the link to read a full review on my blog; http://jilliansreviews.blogspot.com/2015/02/radha-beautys-intensive-youth-eye-gel.html</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I look forward to using it daily.</li>
    <li> Did you know most of our visible aging starts with our eyes?  Our eyes show when we&#x27;re stressed, tired, sad, &amp; sometimes happy! Wrinkles, sunspots, and sleep deprivation have a huge affect on our eyes!  We can dramatically improve the appearance of young &amp; healthy eyes simply by restoring &amp; refreshing our under eye complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently sampled Radha Beauty Intensive Youth Eye Gel for testing purposes. I got it free, however the following opinion and review is true! (See blog for full review: http://theboldandthebrewtiful.blogspot.com/2015/02/RadhaBeauty.html)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is simple to use. This eye gel contains plant stem cells and is enriched with vitamin e which is important in slowing down aging on the surface of the skin!  I found this product to be amazing at not only refreshing my delicate under eye area, but restoring my natural glow &amp; reducing my fine lines &amp; over all eye puffiness. I applied it all over my face on numerous occasions and found it to work well when used prior to going to bed &amp; sleeping with it on my skin all night, and wearing it all day under moisturizer, &amp; sunscreen too.  When used over a 2 week period, I saw my skin looking more healthy and visibly firmer. I recommend this skincare product to anybody willing to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Great smell! Smells like fresh cucumbers!&lt;br /&gt;2. Not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;3. Plant stem cells &amp; vitamin e&lt;br /&gt;4. Peptides in the ingredients which are used to encourage the self-renewal capacity of our skin and thus promote an anti-ageing effect!&lt;br /&gt;5. Visible results, fast!&lt;br /&gt;6. Got rid of my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;7. Can use all over face &amp; under makeup!&lt;br /&gt;8. Does not clog pores!&lt;br /&gt;9. Moisturizes/Firms/Brightens skin&lt;br /&gt;10. Is not at all sticky!&lt;br /&gt;11. Absorbs quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None to report!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion of Radha Beauty is that they are a terrific company to work with. Prompt with shipping and products packaged neatly! Product arrived undamaged and on time!</li>
    <li> I received the Radha Beauty Intensive Eye Gel free and for review.  It came in a box that seemed to be medicinal.  I noticed right away that one of the main ingredients was plant stem cells.  The gel comes in a small pump which makes it easy to administer.  It feels very cooling to the skin and goes on rather smoothly.  It did no feel sticky upon application and it did not irritate my skin.  It contains many natural ingredients including aloe and cucumber which may account for he &amp;#34;coolness.&amp;#34;  It also has a pleasant scent which I attribute to the cucumbers.  I am a contact lens wearer and I am, on a daily basis, tugging on the skin around my eyes.  This gel, after a couple weeks use, did account for a noticeable difference in minimizing the fin wrinkles around my eyes.  It made my skin softer and more supple.  I am pleased with the product and since tis brand is new for me, I will be investigating to see what other products it offers.</li>
    <li> I  liked the consistency and I really think it hydrated my under eye area and reduced puffiness.  My only complaint was the smell.  You can definitely tell it&#x27;s made from plants because it smelled a bit like compost.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of difference.  Very dissappointed</li>
    <li> I have used the product for little over a month now and I do not see much difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ve tried the product long enough to see long-term results; however, I will share what I have noticed to date.  I will be straight-up honest and tell you that I prefer creamy-type facial products and I knew before trying this that it was a gel, so I won&#x27;t count that as a negative since some people prefer gels -- it&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first examination, I found that the gel is smooth and has a fairly benign smell -- not strong, but noticeable.  I liked the fact that it&#x27;s mostly natural and organic and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all (I wear contact lenses).  It does go on the skin very nicely (especially the delicate skin around the eyes) and spreads easily without pulling.  I noticed after a few days that some of my puffiness and darkness had been reduced some and after continued usage I believe that this will be a continued effect.  I cannot vouch for the claim to firm the skin since I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to see that particular claim to fruition.  This product also did not cause any redness, bumpiness, or itching, which is always a plus.  One of the few things that I did not care for was how long this took to dry, especially before being able to apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will finish out the bottle of the gel to see how many more benefit I might get from it; however,  I probably won&#x27;t order it again simply because of my preference for non-gel eye products.  If gels are your thing, though, click on the link on the picture to add this great product to your routine!</li>
    <li> I have received this product from Brandbacker and Radha for review purposes, none the less all opinions are my own. I was impressed with the eye gel, it has great ingredients no parabens. It has really help to relive the puffiness and dark circles I have beneath my eyes. I have been using for a few weeks now and my eye area is looking much better with less puffiness. I did not experience any burning when applying and it went on smooth and dried very quickly. It smells wonderful also, I have seen wonderful results and have received many compliments about my eye area since beginning to use. I also loved the pump type dispenser, just the correct amount dispensed. I would highly recommend to others who have dark circles or puffiness in the eye area.</li>
    <li> My eyes broke out in a rash using this product and I needed to go to the dermatologist to get rid of the problem. Way too strong of a product for sensitive eyes!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few weeks, and have seen absolutely no changes in puffiness, bags, circles, wrinkles, skin condition.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies and have dark circles and baggy skin under my eyes.  I was surprised and very pleased with the disappearance of the dark circles and the baggy skin was so much improved.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this out of the customers review and I said this is what I really looking for. and I was right, the product is amazing so light and the effect shows just after few minutes from applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s follow up is amazing, they communicate with the client and they are very keen to satisfy your needs and answers emails as fast as they receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Radha Beauty, you really made my day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this since early January and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. Granted, I do forget to put this on at night sometimes but that&#x27;s rare. I have dark circles and a little bagginess. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different since using this. Just ordered something different from Avon. Hoping for some better results. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. But seems to work from others, just not for me. Sadness! :(</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change in dark circles under my eyes</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It feels so good on your skin and you can actually feel it working. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good job of plugging up pores with no results.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I see noticeable improvement after a month.  I just purchased my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using Radha Argon Oil, Vitamin C Serum and Eye Cream twice a day for a month or so and have not noticed any difference at all.  I will not be reordering these products.</li>
    <li> I received this eye gel in the mail and it looks like it is not new. There are scratches on the container and it is not sealer. This is a present for my daughter and I am not happy with this.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Smoothes out great on eyes. A little goes a long way and if you apply too much can become a little sticky but that will go away if you work the eye gel in.  My puffiness has went away a lot.  I really enjoy this eye gel.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I will definitely buy more. I use a retinol serum...then use this on my eyes,cheeks and forehead. Don&#x27;t forget between the eyes &#x3D;). I then use Lumene Brightening face cream. Lumene CC cream in light and Lumene BB cream in medium. Ever since I statred using the eye cream and serum people comment on how refreshed I look. I absolutely love my skin now. I&#x27;m 44 and wish I started this at 30. I think the sooner you start, the less damage.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve had this product for only a few days, I can&#x27;t comment on whether it works.  However, I do know that I won&#x27;t be putting it under my eyes in the morning.  It&#x27;s a sticky gel, and my makeup won&#x27;t glide smoothly over it.  I&#x27;ve already tried that, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> While it feels and smells nice, this did nothing for me. So sad.......well, the search continues for effective bags and circles cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now.  My issue is more puffiness rather than bags and dark circles yet this doesn&#x27;t help.  I find that using a cold compress for a few minutes after waking up helps me more than this, and the cold water supply is much cheaper than this.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Did not absorb into my skin and made my make-up roll off</li>
    <li> Been using this twice a day for two weeks and do NOT see anything. I&#x27;ll keep using it until the stuff is done but I don&#x27;t expect much to change. It smells nice though sort of like cucumber. The other thing is that it makes wherever you put it sticky.</li>
    <li> Radha Beauty Eye Cream for Dark Circles, Wrinkles, Puffiness and Sagging Skin. Radha Beauty Intensive Youth Eye Gel. ingredients: Plant Stem Cells, Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic Acid, Peptide Complex, Vitamin E, Aloe, Jojoba, MSM, Licorice, Eye Bright, Gotu Kola and more... Not tested on animals, manufactured in USA. This arrived quickly, packaged well, smells and feels absolutely awesome. It has a light cucumber scent. It feels cool as it goes on, absorbs easily, gel substance, a little goes a long way. I have very sensitive skin and allergies. This did not cause any reactions, did not clog pores and made my swelling and puffiness around eyes less noticeable. It also moisturizes well and works wonderful under make-up making fine lines appear less noticeable. I haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle yet so can not speak of the final results, but so far it is amazing. It feels so light yet very nurturing to skin. It leaves eye area less puffy, seems to have a cooling sensation and after about 30 minutes, felt firmer and lines softer. So far, I am very pleased and recommend.  I look forward to what further use will provide as far as results. I did receive this for the opportunity to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion. This smells great, feels great, helps with puffy eyes, sagging under eyes, and softens lines...great under make-up too without making it look cakey.</li>
    <li> Last shipment I got two bottles on top of that there is little product, the pump stooped working looks like one of the bottles didn&#x27;t have enough product I&#x27;m still seeng results but at a slow rate.</li>
    <li> The Radha Beauty eye gel is okay. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my undereye bags - I&#x27;ve had them since I was a kid and am having a hard time accepting that nothing short of surgery is going to fix them, so I&#x27;ll continue to experiment with creams. This particular gel smells nice and feels cooling, but I would prefer something much more hydrating. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be working pretty well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy, I finally have a skin care regimen that I will keep!! 3 of Rahda Beauty Products are included in my routine! After cleansing and toning, I apply Rahda&#x27;s Eye Gel, Vitamin C Serum, then the Retinol Moisturizer.  I could see and feel a difference in my skin just after the first application. I&#x27;m on day 3 of using Rahda&#x27;s products and I&#x27;m more than happy with the results!!!</li>
    <li> Very good will look into their other products</li>
    <li> Great product which seems to be helping my dark circles.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in the dark circles under my eyes.  The reason I gave it 4 vs. 5 stars is that it is somewhat sticky on my eyelids and in the corners of my eyes.</li>
    <li> my dark circle where is it?&lt;br /&gt;awesome cream</li>
    <li> Wonderful product works brilliantly</li>
    <li> This made me break out only a week into wearing it and I had to discontinue it. This is not meant for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I use it twice daily per instruction. After 2 months, there&#x27;s NO change on my dark circle under eyes. It&#x27;s really a waste of my time. I was so excited to try it, but it doesn&#x27;t turns out as what the producter say</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great product. Im a male that actually takes care of his skin and even though I&#x27;am approaching 50 this product really helps keep the age away!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It was very small also did not work very well</li>
    <li> On the first day I felt my under eye and upper lid was a lot tighter.  Will buy this again!  I think I have tried every under eye treatment and this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this works well. I use more often than morning and night, but it&#x27;s eliminating my dark circles!</li>
    <li> Doesnt work as expected use it like directed and really no change</li>
    <li> This cream is light and easy to apply. I felt a bit of irritation during the first uses, but that went away and I can see a difference in the dark circle- diminishing.</li>
    <li> Not impressed it seemed to worsen the look go wrinkles and dark bags.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me.  It tightened the skin around my eyes and really helped diminish the lines around my eyes.  I do not have dark circles, so I do not know how this would work on those, but. I do know it has my eyes looking ten years younger.  This was packaged extremely well and arrived on time.  I will be purchasing this again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this so amazing it&#x27;s my first bottle but I already can see the different</li>
    <li> I like this company and their products! I am using this with some of their other products. This is awesome!! Nice consistency, a tiny bit goes a long way. My under eyes look firmer appear to be brighter and I don&#x27;t look so tired.</li>
    <li> Look at the before(L) and after (R). I&#x27;m in my early 40s. I LOVE this product. It smells like cucumber and has a cooling sensation upon application. Dries up several seconds later and I could see my eyebags reduced tremendously in less than a minute. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It was okay, found better products for a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!! After one bottle my dark circles had dramatically reduced! Just got second bottle and I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more my curled will fade.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a month...no change. My eye bags are still there.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye gel.  I have used it 2 times a day since I received it and already my eyes are not nearly as puffy.  I was able to try this product free after using a coupon and promising to leave an honest feed back.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d see frantic results but I don&#x27;t see any significant changes.</li>
    <li> Received in good condition but do not feel product helped me.</li>
    <li> Looked forward to trying this gel. Unfortunately  I did not see any change in the puffiness under my eyes.. It did not work for me.</li>
    <li> They product goes on nice and smells nice. Too soon to notice improvement yet but loving it so far</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Radha eye gel that came in the white container. This product seems more watery than the last container I ordered (same order but came in white container???)</li>
    <li> As a 50 yr male this crap does not work!! Does not do nothing for dark circles and nothing for bags under eyes. Big waste of money. Can not see how any one gave a great review.</li>
    <li> I, too, believe some of the reviews for this product may be bogus.  It does NOTHING.  Absolutely nothing.  Oh, you can tell there is gel under the eye, and when it dries it is dry, but it does nothing to improve the look of any puffiness, bags or wrinkles.  So ladies, until science can come up with an improvement, we wait.  This certainly is NOT the answer any of us are looking for.  And it gets one star because I had to make a selection.  If I could, I would have given it a negative 5-star review.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I can see a different under my eyes in the last month.  I like the creamy texture of the product and it glide on easy.</li>
    <li> It ok..no results yet</li>
    <li> Great product..... Works as promised!</li>
    <li> Finally a eye gel that doesnt make my eyes water. I have very sensitive eyea. Im loven this eye gel.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is thick and awesome. It feels like it&#x27;s literally pulling the wrinkles apart under your eyes. It feels cool and refreshing and always makes my eyes look refreshed even if I didn&#x27;t get a lot of sleep. I will continue to use this product. Nice size, pump gives you perfect amount so it&#x27;s not wasted. This is my honest opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> OH. MY. GOSH. I can&#x27;t even. I never write reviews, ever.. but I have to write one now. I can&#x27;t even explain how much I love this stuff. I got this specifically for my dark circles under my eyes but I read it is also an all over face treatment. I wanted to see if it would heal my zits I had at the time but I was afraid it would make it worse so I only put a little bit on one zit I had on my forehead. I kid you not the next day the zit was DRAMATICALLY better. I thought... oh my gosh. I have been using this everyday as a spot treatment on my zits for a couple weeks now and I am not kidding you my skin has completely cleared up. Like as in... no zits, clear skin. I dont even use this for my eyes anymore bc I dont want to waste it and I only want to use it as a spot treatment now. And the great thing is it is non drying! I am seriously in love and I want to buy like 10 more of these.</li>
    <li> This is truly a wonderful product.  It smells great, is quite refreshing, and in just a day or so I see positive results.  Thanks, and happy holidays.  I will buy this again and look into their other items to purchase.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product.  It made the skin around my eyes feel smoother. Have only used it a few times and already it&#x27;s something I would want to reorder.</li>
    <li> Received this product free with the promise of an honest opinion.  Saw changes immediately.  I love this product as I love all my Radha products.</li>
    <li> love that this gel isnt sticky at all when it dries and it leaves my skin so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;i received this product for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Fabulous eye gel, I keep it in my purse for hydration on the go in these dry cold winter months.  It applies easily—the consistency is thick and rich but transparent so it goes on seamlessly and dries quickly, making it barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> I pick up a cucumber scent from it. The second it goes on it tingles like when you have cucmbers on your eyes as well. Ive notice over the past few weeks my eyes looks less tired. I less self concius about my dark tired eyes and people have noticed I look less tired. I will be rebuying the product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> No change after two weeks of use. However, the company contacted me and offered my money back and a free product in its place. Very pleased</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  The gel goes is not greasy. I have bought several products in the past and I really like this one the best.  It firms up puffiness nicely.  My dark circles are fading.  I used this for several weeks before leaving a review so I could answer honestly about how it works.  It is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I use it twice daily per instruction. After 2 months, there&#x27;s NO change on my puffiness under eyes. It&#x27;s really a waste of my time.</li>
    <li> .  I always have issues with puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  I thought using this Eye Gel would take some time to show improvement around my eyes but I was truly amazed by the quickness of difference it made.  I really don’t have to say much more after you see the picture below of my before and after.  I woke up this morning around 6:00 and started off my day with a quick shower.  I looked at my face noticed how puffy my eyes were (did I say PUFFY?).  Well I slept with the ceiling fan on last night and I always wake up with a little puffiness around my eyes when I sleep with the fan on.  Now this morning was a different story!  My eyes were ridiculous this morning.  I had enough with the puffiness and grabbed my Radha Beauty Intensive Youth Eye Gel and applied it to my eyelids and under my eyes.  It was a soothing feeling to put this gel on my eyes.  Even if it wouldn’t have worked it sure felt good on my eyes.  Ohhhhh and it smelled good too (almost like cucumbers).  Well now let me finish telling you about how great it worked.  I put this gel on my eyes at about 6:30 am right before I took the top picture below.  By the time I got to work at 7:30 the puffiness was nearly gone (bottom picture).  Now that is amazing isn’t it?  I would totally recommend Radha Beauty Intensive Youth Eye Gel to anyone that is in need of an eye makeover!  I will be using this gel twice a day as recommended for best results as if it did all this in about an hour of time just think of what it can do when used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this evaluation are solely my own.</li>
    <li> These products are filled with natural, organic ingredients that your skin will love.  I tested these products as a three-step system. My first step, after washing my face, is to apply the Eye Gel.  The 0.5 fl oz bottle might not seem like much, but a little goes a long way so I am confident it will last a long time.  I use about half a pump for both eyes and still have some leftover on my fingers to dab across my forehead.  Be sure to dab around your eyes, so as not to stretch your delicate skin.  Radha Beauty Eye Gel has a light, crisp, cucumber scent that just might be my very favorite scent (I forgot how much I love the smell of cucumber)!  The gel is thick and spreads easily, but also absorbs very quickly and can be used underneath makeup.  The gel feels incredibly cooling and fresh as I dab it on my eyes.  Like I said, I also put this on my forehead but it can be used as an allover facial treatment for enhanced glow radiance.  I cannot clinically say this has changed my fine lines and wrinkles but it feels great on my face and I sure that it helps with my puffy morning eyes (I have puffy morning eyes).  The cooling gel is a great way to start my early early mornings.  After the eye gel I apply the Vitamin C Serum all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Radha Beauty Vitamin C Serum is a thin, runny serum that I was not certain I would like but it soaks right into my skin and does not feel greasy.  It is specially formulated to stimulate collagen production and renew aging skin to a more youthful appearance.  It has virtually no scent at all and just like the eye gel, a little goes a long way.  Start with 1 pump as it spreads very easily.  I like this serum and I think it has already begun to improve my skin tone.  I will provide more information on this product in the future, after I have used it for several weeks. On a side note, I love the packaging. The final step?  After the Vitamin C Serum has FULLY soaked into the skin and dried (it only takes a few seconds) itis important to apply a rich moisturizer.  Enter the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great piece of packaging, this Retinol Moisturizer comes in a tall, sleek, silver bottle with a fancy little pump.  But let&#x27;s be real, what matters is the product.  I have been in love with Retinol Moisturizers for most of my adult life (I swear by them, in fact) and this one does not disappoint.  This serum is formulated with 2.5% Retinol Complex that provides both immediate and long-term release to promote radiant skin.  The Retinol increases cell turnover rate to give you newer, brighter skin.  It is a thick and creamy moisturizer that makes for a great final step in the three-step process.  I love that it is 71% organic with natural ingredients such as Organic Aloe, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter.  So moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am a satisfied customer with these products.  The best part is that if you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can get 100% of your money back, without even returning the bottle. The customer service is incredible.</li>
    <li> For the past two weeks, I have been testing out the Radha Intensive Youth Eye Gel. When used as directed, it is supposed to reduce dark circles, puffiness, bags, and wrinkles. The company recommends applying the eye gel twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night. Being that I am a diligent rule follower, this is exactly what I did and here are my results in a before and after picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked about this product is that it is a gel. In the morning, my eyes are generally irritated due to allergies. The cooling effect of the gel is very soothing and feels great. Also, whereas most eye creams are too irritating for me to wear at night, this was not the case with Radha&#x27;s Eye Gel. The product absorbs quickly into your skin. It can feel a bit sticky at first, but give it a couple of minutes to dry before applying makeup and it is just fine. A little goes a long way, which is nice in that the product will last you quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture, some of my issues are wrinkles, dark circles, and on occasion, puffiness (usually due to allergies and sometimes wine). After two weeks of use, I noticed the lines under my eyes were not as deep. Also, the puffiness in my upper lid had shrunk. The darkness in the corners of my eyes and underneath appeared to have lightened as well. Both of these pictures were taken approximately one hour after waking up when my eyes are at their worst. To be honest, until I had these photos side by side, I had not realized what a significant difference the gel had made. I was very impressed with the results and highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Radha makes great strides for customer satisfaction. After receiving the eye gel, I also received a detailed email explaining what was in the product and how to use it for best results. The company provided a direct link for me to use should I have any issues with the product and a money back guarantee, no questions asked.</li>
    <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to be given the opportunity to receive this product for test purposes. I found it to be very helpful in eliminating puffiness and darkness under my eyes and improving the texture of the skin. I also tried it on other dark spots on my skin with the same great results.</li>
    <li> A LITTLE HESITANT HOWEVER IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS  I HAVE BEEN USING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND NOTICING MY DARK CIRCLES GETTING LIGHTER.</li>
    <li> Radhas Beauty’s Intensive Youth Eye Gel for great for dark circles, puffiness, eye bags &amp; wrinkles . It contains a number a very powerful ingredients such as plant stem cells, cucumber, vitamin E, aloe, &amp; more! I wake up EVERY morning with eye bags and this product works soooooo well!! Within minutes my bags are gone and I’ve noticed less crows feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I gave it two stars for the fast shipping, been using it twice a day for a couple weeks. I have hereditary bags under my eyes and some lines in the bags, I&#x27;m 34 but my eyes make me look older. After all the good reviews I purchased this and gave it some time, not only has it done nothing but yesterday at work I got asked if I was extremely tired because my eyes looked really tired, I actually have never been asked that before using this cream.</li>
    <li> very good product...feels great on my tired eyes, and I see a visible difference.  will buy again.</li>
    <li> After only using it for a few weeks I have already noticed a difference in my dark circles under my eyes. I have really large bags and I think they are a little less baggy. The product is easy to apply and soaks in rather quickly. I have no issues applying makeup afterwards. I really like this product and in my opinion anyone who has dark circles under their eyes should give it a try. I was given a sample to try and give my honest opinion and statements made are in my opinion only</li>
    <li> This really was not effective for me. I followed directions,but saw no discernible difference. I am older so that may have dismissed it&#x27;s effectiveness</li>
    <li> This eye cream by Radha Beauty Products has been a godsend! Lately, I have been suffering from eye puffiness when I wake up. I always make sure that I get enough sleep but that never mattered because I still have puffy eyes in the morning! I started using this Eye Gel and it has completely and dramatically eradicated that puffiness - I kid you not. I also started smearing a little bit of it on the sides of my nose where I have fine lines and I see a significant change that has made me truly excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I can see an improvement especially in the puffiness under the eyes, but the dark circles are still there--but maybe a little less noticeable and a little easier to cover up with a good concealer.  I do use it morning and night, and I suspect I may even reorder once it gets toward empty.  Maybe I was hoping for too much!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review of this eye cream. My concern was dark circles and tired looking eyes, and I must say that this product worked well for both! I like that a little goes a long way and that it is easily absorbed and not sticky feeling. Ordered as a freebie, but will gladly pay for in the future!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just reordered my second bottle.  It really seems to be helping firm up some sagging in the inner corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;When I am staying home, I don&#x27;t apply under eye concealer and it looks just fine, but when I go out I find it works best for me to apply my eye moisturizer, then a little concealer, and then pat on the eye gel.  It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t see a difference in the dark circles though.</li>
    <li> I just begin using this eye gel and I liked so far.</li>
