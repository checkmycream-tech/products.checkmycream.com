      <li>It works great and keeps my hair having a light blond look save for the natural honey coloring.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a pretty good product, arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>If I use it more often, or use too much of it, my hair does have a tendency to be a bit too yellow, so once a week is perfect.</li>

      <li>I sometimes lather twice if my color seems faded and this gives me even stronger golden tones.  </li>
      <li>This is a good - yet gentle - shampoo for color treated hair - my normal color was light brown, now using Framessi blonde to cover all my gray.  </li>
      <li>It seems to suds up better if you use it after you use your regular shampoo to clean, but directions don&#x27;t say that.</li>
      <li>so we tried Amazon and it came up right away.  </li>
      <li>Would love it if they made a deep conditioner in Golden Mist.</li>
      <li>This product is a superior color shampoo, leaving hair feeling soft and looking shiny in the proper hue.</li>
      <li>The color shampoo is exactly as it should be.  </li>
      <li>I have fine highlighted blonde hair &amp; the ends</li>
      <li>Really helps to maintain hair color..</li>
      <li>Seems to really work.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine as a shampoo, but did little to nothing for my color/highlights.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really weigh in on the color enhancement.</li>
      <li>So if you have sensitive skin or are prone to dandruff, skip this shampoo.</li>
      <li>This shampoo adds subtle golden tones to my medium golden blond color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I use the regular first and then use the Watercolors shampoo on my second wash &amp; rinse &amp; before my conditioner.</li>
      <li>Only wish all prices were consistent and low.  </li>
      <li>and this did the same without the high price.</li>
      <li>This stuff toned it down and added golden tones and evened out the color after one wash.  </li>
      <li>Natural Blonde with blonde highlights and long time user of Aveda and at this juncture</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anybody who wants a little boost to their hair color in between appointments at the salon.</li>

<li> You only need a dime size so the bottle will last a long time.  </li>

<li> I only use a small amount of this shampoo so this bottle will last quite a while.  </li>
<li> I used a different brand and it went a little ashy for my taste.  </li>
<li> The suds are thick enough to &#x27;coif&#x27; your hair on your head, then leave it a few minutes, rinse and condition.</li>
<li> Cleans well, fragrance is a little off putting.</li>
<li> My hair stylist had trouble finding it at her source</li>
<li> It happened slowly, &amp; I guess I wanted to ignore the side effects because the shampoo DOES extend color vibrancy for a few weeks.</li>

<li> No more root issues!</li>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps just enough color in my hair to keep from having to use the semi permanent color I used to use.  No more root issues!</li>
    <li> This shampoo adds subtle golden tones to my medium golden blond color treated hair.  I use it once a week or so to refresh my hair color in between color applications.  It lathers like a dream (not all sulfate free shampoos do so) and I leave it on for about 5-10 minutes while I finish my shower.  It smells nice, even though it contains some dye elements that have a slightly chemical fragrance but that is overshadowed by the nice floral fragrance.  I sometimes lather twice if my color seems faded and this gives me even stronger golden tones.  I only use a small amount of this shampoo so this bottle will last quite a while.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny when I use it in conjunction with the Blond Brilliance conditioning toner in warm tones (which smells awesome btw).  These two products keep my hair color fresh and bright.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything. Did not notice any change</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It gives my color treated hair softness and shine. Would love it if they made a deep conditioner in Golden Mist.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Really helps to maintain hair color..</li>
    <li> Myes hairdresser had told me about this and it works good for in between highlights</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for several months before realizing that it was giving me dandruff and scalp irritation. It happened slowly, &amp; I guess I wanted to ignore the side effects because the shampoo DOES extend color vibrancy for a few weeks. I think it was some chemical coconut derivative or maybe one of the pigments that irritated my skin. So if you have sensitive skin or are prone to dandruff, skip this shampoo. I have since started using 100% Pure Healthy Scalp shampoo and have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The color shampoo is exactly as it should be.  This product is a superior color shampoo, leaving hair feeling soft and looking shiny in the proper hue.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  I high-lift my roots from a level 6.5 to about a 9 and then deposit an 8N afterwards.  I used a different brand and it went a little ashy for my taste.  This stuff toned it down and added golden tones and evened out the color after one wash.  A word of caution: unless you&#x27;re looking to strip your color, I would use this maybe once or twice tops a week.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Gives non-colored hair just a hint of color and freshens up already colored hair. It does nothing for your gray.</li>
    <li> I have always had naturally blonde hair all my life until I had chemo three times and I lost my hair twice.  It came back different shades of white, Honey and silvery.  I started using the  Tressa Golden Mist Watercolor Shampoo.  It works great and keeps my hair having a light blond look save for the natural honey coloring.  Iam pleased with my results and my hair looks natural.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a good - yet gentle - shampoo for color treated hair - my normal color was light brown, now using Framessi blonde to cover all my gray.

The suds are thick enough to &#x27;coif&#x27; your hair on your head, then leave it a few minutes, rinse and condition. Good product recommended by several hairstylist I know.</li>
    <li> Just used Tressa Watercolors and it&#x27;s perfect! I have fine highlighted blonde hair &amp; the ends had become so faded...I just needed something to fill the hair shaft without using color and this is just what I needed. I used to use Artec shampoo years ago and this did the same without the high price.</li>
    <li> I have my hair dyed every 4 to 5 weeks and this shampoo keep the color in!  My hair stylist had trouble finding it at her source so we tried Amazon and it came up right away.  Please keep carrying this item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  I recommend it to anybody who wants a little boost to their hair color in between appointments at the salon.</li>
    <li> I love Tressa Watercolors products. I&#x27;ve used the Crimson Splash for quite a long time to keep the red in my hair lasting longer. I&#x27;ve recently done a gold blonde tone for summer. I love that this helps to keep the shiny gold color in my hair.</li>
    <li> good product - I use it once a week to add some shine and color back to my hair. If I use it more often, or use too much of it, my hair does have a tendency to be a bit too yellow, so once a week is perfect.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and helps make it smoother and shinier. It comes in a range of formulas based on the color of your hair -- but based on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation, I use the blond formula even though my hair is brown. I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Keeps my color looking good and natural.</li>
    <li> Nice light lather, non drying, not too much brassy color.  Only wish all prices were consistent and low.  Would buy in a 33.8 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> My coworkers don&#x27;t believe that I haven&#x27;t been getting my hair touched up. This shampoo is great. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is one of the best I found to help sustain your color in-between salon visits.  I use it along with my regular color treated shampoo. I use the regular first and then use the Watercolors shampoo on my second wash &amp; rinse &amp; before my conditioner. Seems to really work.</li>
    <li> Lathers well, rinses easily, leaves my hair clean and manageable.  Didn&#x27;t notice a bit of difference in my hair color, though.</li>
    <li> UPDATE - It&#x27;s fine as a shampoo, but did little to nothing for my color/highlights. It&#x27;s not as drying as Aveda can be, but it doesn&#x27;t perform like it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a pretty good product, arrived quickly. Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really weigh in on the color enhancement. Cleans well, fragrance is a little off putting. Natural Blonde with blonde highlights and long time user of Aveda and at this juncture, I think I prefer it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo  have use it in the past I knew I could find it here  highly recommend it :)</li>
