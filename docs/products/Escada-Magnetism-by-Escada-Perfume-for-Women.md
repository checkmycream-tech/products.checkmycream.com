<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife loved the perfume and smell beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is a very lovely scent. It is very sweet and very strong. A single spray goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with Paris Hilton \\&quot;Heiress\\&quot; and I have to say that both of these fragrances are awesome! Magnetism has a light earthy fragrance but under that it smells a little powdery and flowery. I am not able to distinguish the different fragrances that make up this beauty but I am almost certain I smell honeysuckle. I am happy that I like it because I got the 2.5 ounce without realizing it and man is this bottle large! I would recommend this for any sophisticated woman who doesn&#x27;t want to go as far as White Diamonds and Opium as of yet.  What&#x27;s in this fragrance?  Top Notes:  Leafy Greens, Basil, Freesia, Black Currant, Plumberry  Middle Notes:  Jasmine, Immortelle, Lilly of the Valley, Blond Woods, Iris, Almond Blossom  Base Notes:  Amber, Musk, Cashmere Vanilla, Sandalwood</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years.  I love the sweet smell it has and you can always find a good price for it on the net.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Escada Magnetism since I first purchased it in Rome in 2004 and I hope that it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I usually wear Viva La Juicy, but wanted something a bit more bold. It&#x27;s sweet and sexy with soft tones of vanilla in the background. I smelled it in a store before buying it online, so check it out first, but I like it!</li>
    <li> Smell is Perfect!!!!!!!Escada releases a new fragrance every 6 months and they send there old fragrance to places like Tj Maxx and Ross I learned this from a local fragrance store about 24.99 is what you&#x27;ll pay for 1.7 oz. I still buy from amazon its cheaper sometimes..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  It is light, soft and sweet.  It reminds me of the smell of cotton candy, in a very nice way.  I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to other women in my family and it has always become one of their favorites too.</li>
    <li> our feedback comment:&lt;br /&gt;I OPENED THIS CHRISTMAS GIFT FROM MY HUSBAND. PERFUME IS FINE BUT TOP DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY . A METAL RING IS STUCK IN TOP AND IT DOES NOT&amp;#34;COORDINATE&amp;#34; WITH BOTTOM WHEN SUPPOSEDLY CLOSED. IT SPRAYS O.K. BUT IS DIFFICULT TO CLOSE. THERE WAS NO PACKAGING SLIP OR ANY ORDER FORM IN THE BOX . I WOULD LOVE TO EXCHANGE IT BUT HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THIS AS MY HUSBAND THREW AWAY THE BOX IT CAME IN.</li>
    <li> I am a Happy happy women, like perfume believe i bought wrong type of ecada fragance its alright.......!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years, but hadn&#x27;t purchased it online before.  The perfume doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as the store-bought versions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for many years. When I bought this product it didn&#x27;t smell the same as previous bottles. I will not be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> I get many compliments on this fragrance.  Not overpowering, light and not too flowery or powerful.  Subtle and it lingers all day.  Doesn&#x27;t bother my asthma either.</li>
    <li> I use to wear this 6 years ago to school all day because I absolutley loved it.Now I wear it sometimes at night because it has a woody dark scent to it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells. Its heavy at first probably the first 10 mins after you spray. But then if you smell it again the fruity smells pop right out . Pineapple was a very pleasant fruity smell along with all the other fruits combined equal a nice fruit concoction of almost silk smooth wonderfulness. My husband loves it cant wait to wear it. Its spring time so the warm air will send it through the air like the wind. In love.&lt;br /&gt;Meg</li>
    <li> Wows I just received my parfume and I am in love all over again with this fragrance!! Love it m</li>
    <li> Ive been using this perfume for years! I ran out about 8 months ago and have been using Calvin Klein Euphoria (which is also freaking amaze!). I kept wanting Escada back in my life so I bit the bullet and bought another bottle hoping what I was buying was the real deal... It took exactly a week to arrive but it arrived and smells just fabulous!  Thanks for the legit purchase!!</li>
    <li> I really like this scent, but I will agree that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I really wish it did, b/c the scent is great for anyone that likes really sweet and seductive.  Shipping was pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I swear this perfume is heavenly!!!!  I never use anything else and people always ask what I&#x27;m wearing and where to get it. The price on Amazon is great as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Arrived on time. very accurate as described. nice brand, perfect size, well packed it, I got the product as it was decribed on line.</li>
    <li> I got the super small one in the mail, wasn&#x27;t happy that it was so tiny, and wrote the company about it. I was going to give them a negative review but they said they are going to send me a reg. sized one for free for the mistake that was made. Overall good service and the scent is great, my lady loves it! Now to just get the replacement in the mail....</li>
    <li> I was given this perfume as a gift and absolutely love it.  Then it happened to be on sale at Amazon just when I was running out.  Delivery was faster than I expected, too.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this (without even smelling it first!) as a christmas present for my aunt. I opened it up just to smell it and could not help but try it on myself. I am so glad it did! I have worn several Escada scents and have liked every single one of them but I think this may be my favorite! It has a cherry-ish scent to it, but it is sexy at the same time. Think \\&quot;naughty berry\\&quot;! It is really hard to describe and I think that is part of the allure. I think I will keep this for myself and purchase a second bottle for the aunt.</li>
    <li> Escada scents are unique and great for everyday.  This one is hard to describe, I think it has a sweet and fruity scent that I enjoy wearing every day and it lasts all day too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance! I have worn this for years and will forever!! I hope it&#x27;s around that long!</li>
    <li> Escada Magnetism is another \\&quot;on my knees begging to you please to like me,\\&quot; fruity floral. It&#x27;s palatable enough to appeal to people who don&#x27;t even like perfume but it&#x27;s not breaking the mold as far as fragrances go. That aside, it is pleasant and I doubt you&#x27;ll find someone that won&#x27;t think this is a perfectly acceptable fragrance for women older than 18 to wear. I find it to be sweet and just slightly powdery - a sexy sort of powder, not the kind you slap on the rear end of a toddler. This sort of reminds me of a more sophisticated and age appropriate version of Pink Sugar or Vera Wang Princess - but with a sex kitten edge. If you&#x27;re a little embarrassed to wear Aqualina fragrances, give this a try. I would say this is ok to wear to the office if you work in a creative environment, but don&#x27;t drown in it. It&#x27;s very versatile and I see it as a great fragrance to wear year round except maybe the absolute hottest days.</li>
    <li> One of the best perfumes out there. This fragrance is my favorite. I love it and so does everyone else who comes near me! Do not hesitate to try this perfume, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> it was love at first spray!!! This perfume is sexxy and soooooooo unbelievably amazing!!! i feel so in love with it!! the scent lasts all day long and goes with any occasion!!</li>
    <li> Love it smell real good  love the way it smell light smell dont last long do maybe a hour then u have to put more on but its a good smell do</li>
    <li> Escads has long since been a preferred perfume for me.  This fragrance lives up to the Escada name and exceeds even my high expectations.  It&#x27;s light but lingering scent is a delight to me and my significant other.</li>
    <li> I love love love this scent! It&#x27;s sweet, yet subtle -- I can&#x27;t stand a heavy scent -- and it gets comments wherever I go. I was saddened that I couldn&#x27;t find it in local shops, but ecstatic that it was still available online.</li>
    <li> I have loved and used this scent for almost 4 years, it is so GREAT! AND MANY COMPLIMENTS!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE ESCADA!</li>
    <li> Love Escada magnetism, it an exotic scent that you will just love!! It smell great and you will love it!!</li>
    <li> I receive so many people stop me and ask me what am I wearing. One of my co-workers wears this and I asked her what it was and have been wearing it ever since</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume last year at a store not amazon but had to review it. Amazing fragrance! The scent is addicting, I get compliments everywhere I go. I recently just ran out and found amazon to have the best price so I am now waiting for my product to arrive in the mail.</li>
    <li> THis is a very sweet smell, kind of like mango and sweet cantalope.  Its very fruity indeed.  It however does not stand the test of time.  Not enough for me anyway.  Im a White Diamonds and Fendi kind of person, I want a long life out of my perfume.  THis lasts maybe two hours the most.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I was so excited to see amazon carried this still since it has been discontinued. Escada shame on you for discontinuing this perfume! Lol on a scale of 1-10 I give it a 10. Compliments everywhere I go. I personally adore this scent. Different from the rest.  Shawty is a 10! ;) thanks amazon! Muah♥</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my Mom for Christmas, the only perfume she wears and has worn it for years. Kinda her signature now.  Great price. Ordered two big bottles.</li>
    <li> My fav scent ever created. No longer carried in public retailers....one retailer does sell this but for a whopping 80 usd.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this perfume. I have worn it since I was 16, I&#x27;m now 22, and I have always gotten so many compliments from people of all ages. My friends and boyfriend love the smell and my mother borrows it from time-to-time. It is a scent that really is appropriate for all ages! It lasts for the entire day and you only need one spray to get the full effect. MMMMMmmm so happy I decided to order it again!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my GF as a gift and she loves it. I must also say that as usual it was delivered in time and inperfect conditions. Amazon rocks!</li>
    <li> i like this scent, kind of reminds me of thierry mugler&#x27;s angel, although its sorta the cheap version of it. it&#x27;s not as pricey as any other perfume, good size for its price and last for quite a while too</li>
    <li> After checking at Nordstrom for this perfume and being informed it had been discontinued (at least by them) I immediately thought of looking on Amazon.  Took me all of ten seconds to locate it (at half the price I&#x27;d paid previously at Nordstrom).  That plus free shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this parfum for myself. i have used it before but later wanted to make a change and used some other ones. This parfum stays veeery long time on me. It is a parfum that when ppl pass next to you, they would notice it and even compliment :) i bought this parfum on my boyfriends trip to the us. It arrived very quick, I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing about Magnetism is, its bottles cap. It doesnt stay put. A bit dangerous to carry in purse or in luggage when you are travelling!&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works for you guys too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and this is the first time I got something that not the fragrance as it should have been. ..very disappointing!!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume is the best perfume I have ever smelt. Every woman should buy this product. Very good price as well.</li>
    <li> ....when I walk into a room :)  I loooove this fragrence.  It&#x27;s definitely a head turner for any woman that wears this.  I get compliments all the time from men and women when I wear this. I usually wear this in the winter season and or evenings when i go to events as it&#x27;s strong yet sexy. It definitely is magnetic and attracts attention :)  I&#x27;m a huge Escada fan!!!</li>
    <li> As far as the perfume itself, I&#x27;ve been wearing Escade Magnetism since college and absolutely love it. Head it was discontinued about 5 years ago and glad to see it&#x27;s still availagle on here! The low rating is because I specifically ordered this product because it was listed as &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; and it was shipped standard ground. Spoke to customer service, who was friendly as always, but said it&#x27;s because they want to ensure it doesn&#x27;t break, etc.. So instead of receiving it tomorrow as anticipated, it won&#x27;t be delivered until April 24th.In summary, they just shouldn&#x27;t have it listed wtih Prime as an option, especially after raising the costs of the Prime membership.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and was having a hard time finding it in stores.  This was shipped very fast.  Great experience.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This spray was bought for my sons fiance, every year I try and find a top rated perfume for her and on Amazon I always have done this. She loved this perfume, came at a great price and exactly as advertised.</li>

    <li> Excellent and unique perfum</li>
    <li> I sprayed my body with this light perfume early yesterday morning, &amp; everyone I came in contact with told me I smelled really good...</li>
    <li> This is my all time fave only thing I wear. Very soft smell not to sweet and the smell lasts.</li>
    <li> It is the only perfume I&#x27;ve worn for over 5 years now. I get compliments on it all the time. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Its hard to find Escada Magnetism,  but I found it here for a great price. Thanks found what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I initially received this product as part of a sample pack from Escada. I loved it so much that I went searching for it. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any longer and started to become bummed. I was ECSTATIC when I found it on Amazon. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> loved it was just what wanted ty smelled just like the in store perfume loved the price on that size bottle also</li>
    <li> Favorite scent that is timeless, always complemented</li>
    <li> Smells great as always! Arrived before expected date also!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I love the sweet smell and all the compliments that I receive when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume. It&#x27;s soft and feminine. It doesn&#x27;t last long, i must say.</li>
    <li> Smells great!! Spicy!</li>
    <li> This is the most classy fragrance in the world. They couldn&#x27;t have picked a better name for it! Magnetism, that the effect it has on people.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance that I&#x27;ve worn for years.  For some reason this bottle smells great when first sprayed on but wears off within a few hours.  I will order from another seller in the future.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this parfum</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still a little leery when buying perfume online but after this experience I feel very comfortable with purchasing fragrances from Amazon. I have since purchased perfume as a gift from a private seller and received a defective product they will not replace. It&#x27;s nice to know I can always count on Amazon when in doubt.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love, Love this perfume!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smells amazing! My go-to perfume!</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume love it</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume! It&#x27;s discontinued so it is sometimes hard to find. The price is a good deal for the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Last time I purchase perfume based on reviews. Definitely was not for me! Sticking to trying in store first from now on!</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this perfume because it received glowing reviews here and elsewhere.  The reviews weren&#x27;t wrong.  Magnetism is a wonderful scent. I can&#x27;t put my finger on the exact nature of its wonderful smell except to say it is quite powdery--almost too powdery masking some of the other notes. Not a bad thing just be sure powdery scents are your style.      Magnetism is very heavy and sultry.  Definitely not crisp or citrusy.  Thus, it is probably better suited to wear in the evening rather than all day.  Moreover, it is such a heavy scent that you&#x27;ll probably want to save it for evening wear because you might tire of smelling it all day.      If you are a fan of exotic oriental scents you have to try Magnetism.  Unlike others indicated, it lasts plenty long on me.  The scent was strong enough hours later for the those up close and personal whiffs intimacy brings.    My all time favorite oriental perfume was Xi&#x27;a Xi&#x27;ang by Revlon.  Smelling it was heaven on earth.  It was very sensual and ALWAYS drove the men crazy.  Men were positively seduced by it.  They loved it...and so did I.  Sadly, XX was discontinued many years ago.  It was a cheap drugstore perfume but I had yet to find its equal in any price range until I smelled Magnetism.  One whiff of Magnetism and I was immediately transported back to my XX bottle; my nose will always remember that exotic scent.  Magnetism smells almost exactly like it except it is more powdery because of its stronger base notes.      For comparison, XX notes are:   Top Notes: lemon and tangerine.     Middle Notes: jasmine, rose, gardenia and orange blossom.    Base Notes: Peach, plum, raspberry, vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli and oakmoss.    Magnetism notes are:  Top notes: Pineapple, blackcurrant, melon, lychee, cassia, leafy greens    Heart notes: Rose, magnolia, jasmine, heliotrope, iris, freesia, basil, thyme, Lily of the Valley, green notes    Base notes: Cashmere vanilla, caramel, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, benzoin,amber, musk     After all these years and many scents later I am in heaven once again!!!  If Escada ever discontinues Maganetism I will stockpile hoards of it.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> perfect for the summer</li>
    <li> Escada Magnetism by Escada for Women -- Drawn in like metal to a magnet.  The name fits the product. It has a hint of mango or passion fruit or some other wonderful fruity smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this Perfume!!!  Lightning Fast Delivery!  :-D</li>
    <li> My favorite of all time.</li>
    <li> SHE LOVES THIS PERFUME. I BOUGHT THIS FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND SHE WILL BE VERY SURPRISED WHEN I GIVE HER THIS ONE! XD</li>
    <li> I got this in less time than expected and the price was great!  I would recommend this buyer to anyone who is looking to buy Magnetism!</li>
    <li> I love this Parfum.  I had purchased before at Nordstrom and loved it and this time I purchased thruough Amazon.  It arrived quickly and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Sweet and strong beautiful scent.&lt;br /&gt;I always get a lot of compliments when I wear this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Just love it</li>
    <li> Best perfume in the whole wide world best gift ever! Authentic Escada worth every cent would definitely purchase again.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Everyone giving compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this perfume it smells really good not floral but sweet kinda like cotton candy I have never been into sweet smells but this really does smells great</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever !!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! This is my signature scent!!</li>
    <li> Item just as described and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> How can you NOT like this scent on your woman.  Smells like Cotton candy mixed with sex,sex and more sex!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> A wonderful scent that is sure to be noticed when worn. I like it so much that i bought some for my close friends in a set! This will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Escada is made in France, however I was not aware that it is also manufactured in the UK (as stated on the bottle that I recently ordered).  Does anyone know of this….?</li>
    <li> Love this scent it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Escada Magnetism has a soft, pleasant, but not over powering scent.  As a nurse, the need to get very close to my patients is not unusual. It is also not unusual to hear &amp;#34;you smell good.&amp;#34;  One morning I was trying to assist a reluctant elderly gentleman to a standing position when he blurted out &amp;#34;You smell good,really.&amp;#34;  He then allowed me to assist him to stand.  So, if you want a man to follow your directions this is for you.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a great product.. Shipped on time. It really smell good. I bought it for my girlfriend once and she is still using it now.</li>
    <li> This smells great but it is not the original.... my momv got it and she immediately could tell that this was not fhe reall one</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a few years now and Amazon has the best price so far.</li>
    <li> i currently live on the island of Oahu Hawaii and ordered this product and was expecting it to take long time but actually came within days of ordering without selecting fast service. when i lived in the mainland it was my favorite sent and was sad when they stopped making it. I tried to find it here but had no luck other than online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My perfume is new like advertised and at first i was sad it had no smell. But after a few sprays it came back to like. Simply because it has been sitting for a long time since its production long ago. But i can honestly say I am happy with my purchase and with the service of Amazon along with the company who supplied the perfume. I dont feel cheated but happy I have my Escada once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a smell unlike out there now..maybe except Prada Candy which i also like very much. But still Escada Magnetism and Sentiment I love dearly. How could Escada hurt me this way and stop making them??..lol</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering from them. My package arrived on time. This perfume is the real deal, this is my favorite and I would definitely know if it was a knock off brand.  I am very pleased.  Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I have had a huge crush on this perfume for years.  Amazon is the only place I can find it anymore.  This is a wonderfully sweet, fun fragrance that lasts on your clothes for a long time.  I get many compliments when wearing this.  I love this and would recommend!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere in the state of Tennessee my wife loves no one else has it. Last all day .</li>
    <li> The name says it all, it will attract all the attention.&lt;br /&gt;All girls are asking my wife (wow, what is the perfume you wearing?)&lt;br /&gt;Everybody like this type of question, because it reflects your taste of how you look :D</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gift, and I checked all the stores for the prices and here is where I found it cheaper. The shippment arrived excellent and on time.</li>
    <li> I like the smell!  I would like to order this item for friends and family members.  Now I know what to buy for gifts.</li>
    <li> This scent is soft and very feminine.  I bought this for myself and a friend and she loves it.  It is one of my favorites.  I try many scents, but I always go back to this one and the compliments keep coming!</li>
    <li> Sensuous fragrance that is so compellingly beautiful. It has a musky, floral-type aroma that I&#x27;m just delighted to call my own.</li>
    <li> Third purchase, my favorite go to and soft enough to wear to work at a hospital.</li>
    <li> Subtle scent at a bargain price compared to other retailers</li>
    <li> I like it but this is not one of my favorite Escada&#x27;s - most of the others that I have used are sweeter than this one</li>
    <li> Love this scent......they actually have stopped making it (i was told) I was also warned that since they no longer make it to be careful purchasing it because that means that whoever is selling has had it for a long time.  Parfum gets very strong as it ages............I have not had any issues yet so will continue purchasing for a long as I can find it!  :)</li>
    <li> Have been wanting to order this for years after having a small bottle as a teenager. The price in stores is always so expensive so glad I found it here for less.</li>
    <li> Talk about being complimented EVERYTIME! I love the warmth yet clean smell.</li>
    <li> It was on a christmas list for my daughter, placed the order alittle late but was still here by Christmas and the price was right compare to what they were asking in some of the local stores.</li>
    <li> I purcharsed this product &#x27;cause my mom requested me to.  Item exactly as described, great size bottle, great smell and arrived on time.  I highly recommend this product for women who want a sweet, intense and sparkling fragrance!</li>
    <li> Is the perfect scent for a young women... Bought it for my girlfriend (26 years old) ... It&#x27;s the kind of perfume that just won&#x27;t let you down with the perfect scent and also the time it last on !!! You can wear it all day and you will still get the same intenisty of scent ...</li>
