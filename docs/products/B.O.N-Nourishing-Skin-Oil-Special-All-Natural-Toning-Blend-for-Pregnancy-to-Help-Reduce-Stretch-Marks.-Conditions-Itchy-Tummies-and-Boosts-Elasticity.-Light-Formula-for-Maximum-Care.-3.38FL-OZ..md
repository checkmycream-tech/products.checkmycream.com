      <li>The color also seems to have blended in with my skin better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used many different oils and this one seems to work the best and also the quickest.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>

      <li>I loved that my skin soaked it up right away</li>
      <li>So far so good! ,</li>
      <li>And thanks to its ability to help improve the elasticity of the skin, it works amazingly well as an anti-aging moisturizer too!</li>
      <li>but what really makes this one of my most loved products is what it doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
      <li>It has a nice pleasant natural scent as well, and is easily spread across the skin, making it easy to massage into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This is my first time to use avocado and rose hip.  </li>
      <li>With continued use, you will find that it works to minimize fine lines and wrinkles as well as even out skin tone.</li>
      <li>After only using it three times, the scars are noticeably better, this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re dealing with dry skin, which I most certainly am, this skin oil will be your best friend.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how it helps after using it even more, it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using B. O. N. Nourishing Skin Oil for about 3 or 4 months now.  I can not believe the difference it has made.  I use it daily from head to toe.  My complexion has changed dramatically.  My skin tone is more balanced, wrinkles has disappeared, or gotten less noticeable, the elasticity is amazing...like teenage skin again.  I always had ruddiness, that is gone and my pores have gotten smaller.  I never used to leave my home without foundation because of my skin texture.  Now, it definitely is not a problem.  Now, as far as the rest of my body...my skin feels AMAZING.  It is so soft...NOT greasy.  NEVER greasy.  I have no dryness and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, my Mom broke her ankle in July and had the cast removed in September.  Her skin looked like fish scales.  I gave her a bottle of B. O. N. Nourishing Skin Oil to use and you would NOT believe the difference one day made.  You couldn&#x27;t even tell she had a cast one. Her skin was soft and not dry or scaly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an AWESOME AWESOME and AMAZING product.  I don&#x27;t EVER want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this oil!!!  My skin is dry to begin with and when I am cleaning, around dust or when the weather starts changing, my hands get so dry they start to hurt.  Instead of using the usual lotions, I tried B.O.N. and was thrilled with the instant relief to my dry hands.  It wasn&#x27;t oily at all and the scent was very light.  I now use it on my face, cuticles and feet as well.  It is the perfect head to feet oil.  I even keep a small, purse sized spray bottle of it in my purse :-).</li>
    <li> I bought this skin oil not long ago after getting some pretty bad skin scars. After only using it three times, the scars are noticeably better, this stuff is amazing! I highly recommend it and it really helps. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it helps after using it even more, it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
    <li> I have been using BON oil for my mastectomy scars. My scars are barely visible and my skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing!! I had foot surgery recently and needed a good oil to help with the dry flakey skin you get after having your foot wrapped &amp; in a splint for so long - as well as for the scar. This oil works beautifully. Feels great going on. Has a very light clean scent. No more dry skin and my scar is fading nicely.</li>
    <li> This product is not greasy at all! I have extremely dry skin (living in Arizona only makes that worse) and it has definitely helped my skin feel so much smoother and more hydrated. I also get bad rashes on the backs of my arms from the heat and it has also helped reduce the appearance and the amount of breakouts I have experienced.</li>
    <li> This skin oil is amazing! After only three days it was working so much better on my dry skin than lotion. I also appreciate the natural ingredients and lack of chemicals. I decided to let my pregnant daughter-in-law try it since it is also recommended for stretch marks and she loved it so much I decided to let her have the rest. Now I need to get another bottle.</li>
    <li> I liked this oil as it has a nice smell and perfect for my dry patches on my body and stretch marks pregnancy left on my stomach. It is definitely a nice oil to use when you have very dry skin. I liked it was natural and cruelty-free. However, there is fragrance and this is what appeals to me more. I like natural products but I also like pleasant scents. So this oil meets them both.</li>
    <li> BON Nourishing Skin Oil really does what it promises!  I&#x27;ve used a combination of oils on my skin for over a dozen years.  This is my first time to use avocado and rose hip.  When combined with the grape seed and vitamin E, a good thing only gets better.  While I didn&#x27;t experience every single claim indicated by BON, I did experience many of them for myself.  The one I least expected, but I am most thrilled about is the relief from itching due to eczema that recently broke out on my hands.  A couple of applications a day is all it takes to keep the itching under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://dealsfrommsdo.com/bon-nourishing-skin-oil-giveaway/</li>
    <li> I used alot of bottles but didn&#x27;t see much improvement.i like it because the oil doesn&#x27;t stain in my cloths.is not greasy so is easy to use</li>
    <li> What makes this oil one of my favorites is that it is an oil blend of my favorite oils and I don&#x27;t have to apply but one product!  This oil contains a high quality Rosehip Oil which is shown by the nice orange hued color of this oil blend.  The Box indicates this blend is from South Africa which is super important when we are discussing Rosehip oil.  A high quality Rosehip Oil originates from places like Chile, South Africa, not America.  Also, Rosehip oil is known for reversing signs of aging, promoting youthful skin, stretchmarks, scars, various types of dermatitis, and is even said to aid in arthritis.  I have personally seen amazing results on my face wrinkles with Rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also contains Avocado oil, which is important because Avocado oil is said to do things such as:  reduce wrinkles, help with psoriasis outbreaks, clears skin of dead skin cells, moisturizes, prevents acne outbreaks, and is awesome in many ways for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next oil this blend contains is Grape-seed oil.  Grape-seed oil is said to contain an antioxidant that is 50x&#x27;s stronger than the one found in Vitamin E and Vitamin C!  Grape-seed oil provides protection against the sun and is astringent so it tightens the skin.  If you read the ingredients on many quality hair products, Grape-seed oil is usually listed because it promotes hair growth.  Lastly, it has been cited for  being helpful for acne, eczema and other dermatitis problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last quality oil I am going to discuss is Vitamin E.  My mother has opened a Vitamin E capsule and rubbed on her face since I was a tiny girl (probably longer) and I can attest that she looks a good 20 years younger than her age.  I am convinced it is the oil that makes her skin so nice.  It also helps with eczema, psoriasis, stretch marks.  It is great to use on your cuticles to keep them soft and hang nail free.  Also, it is said to help heal cold sores.  Many People claim it is excellent for a sunburn, but I am hesitant to try it on any burn since oils tend to hold in heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is like the super power, kick butt and take names later oil blend of oils!  Each oil individually makes a huge difference, but when paired with the other oils, it really goes above and beyond in helping with so many different things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******Disclaimer:  I received product in exchange for my honest opinion of this product.

    <li> I recently made myself a body butter and used this oil in place of the almond oil the recipe called for. It worked really well. I will say however that this one bottle seems to be 125 ml as it filled up a half a cup. Using this in the body butter made the butter very luxurious. I now use it nightly on my hands and feet. You could also use this as a massage oil. I&#x27;m finding this really does make my skin look younger. After about a week you may notice a difference too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> So far so good! ,will see the results in the future.</li>
    <li> Leaves silky moisturized skin. Very absorbent for oil. Also helps fade scars. Def worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> I sustained bad burns on my hands.  Hands have healed but get tight and dry. I massage this oil on my hands on the drive to work to keep flexibility</li>
    <li> I do really enjoy this oil.  The scent is light, but refreshing.  I use it on my belly and other areas, especially while pregnant.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in what existing stretch marks I have, but the oil leaves my skin fresh and smooth.  I even use it in my face, with no problems.  The little bottle does last quite a while.  I have ordered this oil twice and the customer service is what all businesses should be.  I will definitely promote products and a business like this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to moisturize my abdomen, and hip area during pregnancy. The oil is very dry once applied and not greasy to the touch at all, which is nice. I do think the scent is a bit overstated, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. The reason I gave this oil just 3 stars is because it was overpriced for the performance, and I definitely think the fragrance should be left out or toned way down. I think any $10-15 oil would&#x27;ve done the job just as well and I would not have had to put up with the fragrance. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and when it runs out, I will simply go Whole Foods and purchase some jojoba, grapeseed, or apricot oil and call it a day.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels and smells! Has done wonders for my scar in helping it heal faster and feel better!</li>
    <li> My mom got this stuff and it&#x27;s great!!! I was skeptical since I struggle with blemishes and have very sensitive/temperamental skin. I was worried that this, like most products, would irritate it. I have used it once a day for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with the results. My skin feels much softer and hasn&#x27;t broken out from it, probably because it&#x27;s not greasy. Definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This nourishing skin oil is AMAZING! I love that it has a spray pump so that it sprays the perfect amount each time. I&#x27;ve used this on my skin, face, fingernails to soften my cuticles, and even spritzed a little onto the ends of my hair for a nice soft shine. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and I am very pleased with this purchase. I will definitely be buying more at full price once this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made with all natural ingredients including avocado oil, grape seed oil, and rose hip oil. I love that it is a more natural product with no harsh chemicals. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and rehydrated. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped quickly and packaged it properly so that it wasn&#x27;t damaged or leak during transit. Very helpful and generous. I highly recommend purchasing from them.</li>
    <li> Living in the dry, high-altitude climate of the Rocky Mountains comes with extreme skin challenges....B.O.N. is amazingly rejuvenating for my aging, dry skin. I love it! ....and the effects are nearly immediate. This product is  non-greasy, gentle, nourishing, and revitalizing. The natural ingredients are like a blessing for my skin - all without a lingering fragrance or oily residue. I can highly recommend this for anyone suffering effects of wrinkling or loss of elasticity due to exposure to sun, high-altitude dry climates, or simply getting older. My skin feels soft and healthy!</li>
    <li> Amazing! A friend recommended this to me for a curling iron burn--it helped soothe and heal that injury in what felt like record time with minimal scarring. I&#x27;ve since been using it as a general moisturizer--particularly on some chest wrinkles that are a result of too much time in the sun when I was younger, and they are actually looking minimized after about a month of use. The smell is light and lovely, the oil sinks in quickly. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got to try my BON oil out on my stretch marks for the last month and have been pleasantly surprised by the results. Not only is it incredibly soothing to the skin and thanks to the massage, makes my skin look and feel healthy as well as gives it a nice glow, but my stretch marks have seemed less noticeable too! The color also seems to have blended in with my skin better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved using most about this oil (besides the fact that it really does make those awful stretch marks less noticeable!) is that it made my skin feel so soft and moisturized. I noticed this right away, after only a couple of uses! The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin (especially when you&#x27;re helping to massage it into the skin). It also doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue either and you can put your clothes back on right away and won&#x27;t have any oil rubbing off onto your clothing! It has a nice pleasant natural scent as well, and is easily spread across the skin, making it easy to massage into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only can you use BON oil to fade and minimize those nasty, super visible, stretch marks, but this oil also has a TON of different wonderful uses! You can also use it in the same fashion to reduce the appearance of scars too. (In fact 70% of subjects in a recent trial noticed improvement of their scars within 12 weeks of using BON oil!) Not only does it work great for making those scars less noticeable, but it can also help with the annoying itching of scars you often find, thanks to the soothing moisturizing ingredients found in this super hydrating oil. It also works great for softening the feel of the scar, making the texture more uniform with the rest of your skin, and it can also decrease the tight feel of the scar as well too, bringing you some relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BON oil also obviously makes a fabulous massage oil, as well as a great face and body moisturizer (especially for those super tight and dry areas of the skin like your elbows and heels!) It works great at protecting the skin from the sun and other harsh environmental pollutants your skin comes in contact with on a daily basis. And thanks to its ability to help improve the elasticity of the skin, it works amazingly well as an anti-aging moisturizer too! With continued use, you will find that it works to minimize fine lines and wrinkles as well as even out skin tone. BON oil also works great for moisturizing dry hair and nails too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with using my BON oil for my stretch marks over the last month, I also used it as a facial moisturizer day and night, as well as applied it to the tips of my dry hair every other night (You can also use it on the scalp if you happen to suffer from dry, itchy scalp), and to my cuticles nightly as well. I found this oil to be incredibly hydrating on the skin, hair, and nails. It makes everything feel smoother and softer too! I loved that my skin soaked it up right away and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I just applied a few drops to my hands and smoothed and massaged over my face until I felt my skin soak it up, which was usually only a few minutes. I also really loved applying it to my hair as I have super dry hair and lots of split ends. It made my hair feel amazingly soft and it looked so much healthier and more moisturized during the month of using my BON oil too! I loved using it as a treatment for my cuticles too and found that my nails are growing longer and stronger and I&#x27;m not getting any hang nails either (which I unfortunately tend to get pretty often!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see here, this really is a great little all-in-one oil you can find so many uses for! Thanks to only needing a few drops (a little goes a long way) this bottle will last you months too! Even if you&#x27;re using it for all sorts of different ailments like the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with the results my skin, hair, nails, and stretch marks have seen using this super lightweight oil frequently.The biggest difference I noticed right away is how much softer and smoother it has made everything feel. It also leaves a really fabulous, healthy glow to the skin too! I loved using it under my makeup in the morning because It really seemed to wake up my skin and leave it looking and feeling so radiant. I also am completely addicted to how shiny, smooth, and soft it has made my super dry hair look and feel. I also am of course, absolutely ecstatic that I&#x27;ve seen results with my stretch marks while using my BON oil too, and those ugly marks have become less noticeable and have also seemed to blend with the color of my skin better lately too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided.

    <li> I have terribly dry skin.  This oil was recommended by a friend and I can&#x27;t thank her enough!  This oil has helped my dry skin and now I use it daily.  Great for stretch marks, I now give it my pregnant friends and recommend they use if for their stomach for both itchiness and to reduce stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about skincare products. After my c-section, my scar has itched and remained purple even months later. I started using this on the scar and the big wrinkle across my forehead. It smells amazing. A lot of natural products don&#x27;t get this right. It is affordable and has truly improved the texture of my skin. My forehead especially looks impressively more fresh. Definitely consider trying this oil. I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Sprayer never worked. Oil was ok but was more satisfied with Bio Oil</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and not at all oily like you would think. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this under my foundation for a nice dewy glow. Not oily and simply perfect with no mess.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel especially here in Arizona with the amount of sun we are exposed to and how dry air is.  I use it on my face at night and everywhere I would normally use lotion.  It takes about 20 minutes to seep in and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after that time. This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I wish I could say that I loved this like all the other 5 start reviews,  but I think purchased this by the reviews and by the fact that it says suitable for children and infants, non greasy, no parrifins, parabens, mineral oil, no colorants, no animal products.  I guess since it  seemed to be made by people who didn&#x27;t include bad thiings it would be perfect for me.  I had hoped.  HAHA! Sadly I did not notice that it does however contain fragrance.  I am allergic to fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and am pleased with it.  It gives my face a glow without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> This B.O.N® Nourishing Skin Oil is an excellent moisturizer that helps to reduce stretch marks.  We purchased this skin oil in a promotion for personal use, honest evaluation and review.  It&#x27;s a lightweight oil that leaves no greasy residue and absorbs quickly.  The spray bottle is convenient, and helps to reduce waste.  This oil contains a blend of rosehip, grape-seed, avocado and vitamin E oils, and contains no preservatives or harmful chemicals.  I have been applying to some problem areas in the hip and thigh area, and have loved the results so far.</li>
    <li> I used this while pregnant and loved it. I love that it uses natural ingredients and use it for my baby&#x27;s skin during the winter when it tends to get very dry.</li>
    <li> Great product! I would recommend highly to anyone with scars.</li>
    <li> I have no Stretch marks at all.  I used this everyday.  Now I buy it for all my girlfriends who ask me how my stomach looks so amazing after pregnancy. LOVE IT!!!  I kind of wish I had used it on my thighs though. I have small stretch marks there.  I tell my friends to use it any where you expand.</li>
    <li> Got a sample and love it! Was looking for something natural that would  hydrate and nourish. This is working great on my sensitive skin. Will definitely purchase when my sample runs out. Finding that a little goes a long way, a sign of great quality :-)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  It is naturally nourishing for the skin. The fragrance is clean, fresh, and subtle.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness, this oil absorbs quickly and does not make my skin feel hot like a lot if other oils do. I use it as my moisturizer and have noticed an improvement, it also does not make me break out. A couple things I don&#x27;t love, you can&#x27;t really spray it on, it comes out in a stream (at least mine does). Also it contains a fragrance and I prefer fragrance free products as I am sensitive to fragrance. If they made a fragrance free version I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  Unlike other similar products&#x27; overwhelming scent, B.O.N.&#x27;s subtle fragrance and almost dry-oil-like quality make it so pleasant to use.  And the spray bottle is the best!  It makes it so easy to apply every day!</li>
    <li> BON is known the world over for this magical blend of nourishing skin oil. If you&#x27;re dealing with dry skin, which I most certainly am, this skin oil will be your best friend. It also helps skin that is stressed, skin that is showing fine lines or wrinkles, an uneven skin tone and it helps with your skin&#x27;s elasticity. As I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m noticing that my skin is not acting at all like it used to. My skin is thinner which has brought a whole other set of problems than just the showing of a few wrinkles and dry skin.  I really like that it has avocado, grape seed and rose hip oils but what really makes this one of my most loved products is what it doesn&#x27;t have. It does not contain mineral oil, paraffins, BHT (which is a chemical that is added as a preservative), colorants, preservatives or harmful chemicals. In the world of me, what this product does not contain is huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product won me over from the time I saw the packaging. The design of the bottle along with the overall feel of it reminds me of a day spa. I love that it comes in a spray bottle. When dealing with any types of skin oil, this is a plus. Without a spray bottle, things tend to get messy. With BON, I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting oil everywhere. The smell is heavenly. Again, think day spa. It&#x27;s not a heavy perfumey smell like most oils that have fragrance added to it. It has a very subtle floral, clean smell to it. I was impressed with this fragrance because when I put this on my face, I don&#x27;t want to be smelling something overpowering  all the time. Before I forget, I need to mention that I am allergic to most skin oils. Those bath oil beads that you put in the bath, really make me itch and it&#x27;s so frustrating. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what it is that I&#x27;m allergic to but I was amazed that I did not have one single bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I used this skin oil was right after I got out of the bath, I toweled off and then added the oil on my legs, stomach and arms. It didn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it like most other skin oils I&#x27;ve tried. I did have to wait a few minutes though until it absorbed into my body. My skin was left feeling so soft and moisturized. It really was a night and day difference. As most moms out there, I have stretch marks on my lower abdomen. It doesn&#x27;t matter what I try, they never go away. Thanks to BON, while they haven&#x27;t completely disappeared, I am noticing that my stretch marks are starting to fade a bit. I&#x27;m really eager to see how they look when I&#x27;m done with this bottle. I will definitely be buying another bottle when this one is done.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.ve a greasy feel to it like most other skin oils I&#x27;ve tried.

    <li> This is an excellent skin oil. Unfortuntely, it is packaged in a spray bottle.  No matter how I try (spraying closely into the palm of my hand) droplets of oil are deposited on my mirror and sink vanity.  This is my second bottle.  I was hoping the manufacture had come to it&#x27;s senses and put it in a pump or squirt bottle, but sadly, no.  I will transfer the oil to another bottle.  I DO like the oil.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I have used so many other products on my face but this is probably my favorite.  It absorbs quickly, is reasonably priced and seems to help with fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing, natural alternative to my usual oils. It was gentle on my extremely sensitive skin. I love that the scent is so subtle, it nearly fades to non-detectable. It is non-greasy, but highly moisturizing. I use it from the tips of my hair to the tips of my toes. I live in flip flops during the summer, which drys out my skin. Using this on my feet really helped keep them soft and moisturized.  Most importantly, it worked great under my sunscreen! And, because it&#x27;s an oil, a little goes a long way. Highly recommend, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a natural, chemical free product!</li>
    <li> It gets absorbed very quickly and I already noticed that my skin feels very soft and smooth. Very happy with this product :) I will definetely buy it again and recommend it to my girl friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have seen a change in the skin on my feet and heels.  I use it every day.  It&#x27;s even good on your hair and nails!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re pregnant, or have dry skin, you need this product! I experienced extremely itchy skin on my stomach during my pregnancy. It was so itchy, it burned and was very painful! I tried lotions and cocoa butter products, but nothing soothed the burn. It was awful. I was introduced to B.O.N and I immediately experienced relief from the itch. I was worried the oil would stain my clothes or be too heavy, but it is light and absorbs into the skin leaving no residue behind. It&#x27;s perfect! In fact, the heavy lotions I was using before left more residue and stick on my clothes. The oil smells absolutely delicious, and leaves my stomach and hands feeling soft but not oily. I&#x27;m in week 39 of my pregnancy and I have no stretch marks!  I also use the oil on my elbows and on the dry areas of my face. I have extremely dry skin so this product has been a miracle. I highly recommend this product for any mom to be. The itch doesn&#x27;t have to take over your life! Thank you, B.O.N!</li>
    <li> I had reconstructive surgery on both of my feet and I have deep scars. My feet and ankles were bound after surgery too tight and I ended up with circulation scars. I&#x27;ve tried other products but saw little change. I researched what was top of the line and found this through a search engine then decided to purchase it on Amazon and give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;  I am pleasantly surprised. I have been using it once a day after my shower for two months and I&#x27;ve seen a gradual change in my scar&#x27;s appearance. The circulation scars have faded noticeably. Two out of four deep scars are looking a little lighter. I probably won&#x27;t see any large changes in the other two deep scars but I will keep using the oil on them and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;  Everyone is different but I recommend giving this a try. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker over night. It takes time but it is working. It&#x27;s light in scent and my skin absorbs it well to where it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to add to my maternity stretch mark cream arsenal after reading all of the positive reviews. I have to say, the scent is beautiful- really light and fresh smelling. I&#x27;ve been using it on my baby bump, but also as a natural moisterizer all over. It isn&#x27;t greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t evaporate completely either. After a day&#x27;s wear, the scent sort of fades to a natural mineral oil smell, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used BON oil for a couple of months now and I love it. It is highly moisturizing while being non- greasy and it absorbs well. Unlike similar products, BON oil contains no &amp;#34;nasties&amp;#34;, so no worries there and safe for all ages. You can use it from your head to your toes; it even takes care of those rough heels. Being a spray it is easy to use and a little goes a long way. The purse size is ideal to take with you wherever you go. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This so far is not making me break out or have any skin reactions, which oils sometimes do to me. As far as all it claims to do - a tad too soon to say. Only been a few wks.</li>
    <li> Just purchased as part of a pregnancy gift basket for a dear friend.  She is raving about it - loves that it is safe and helps prevent damage to her skin (especially on her growing belly!).  So glad I heard about this in time to include it in her gift!!</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and this is great for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible oil.  I have used many different oils and this one seems to work the best and also the quickest.  It is fantastic for my one son&#x27;s eczema and also for scarring.  I am absolutely delighted with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Seems to be nourishing my dry skin quickly and effectively!</li>
