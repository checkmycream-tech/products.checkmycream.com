      <li>Really tightens and forms the skin!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>

      <li>With this product I have more than accomplished that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ethocyn in the vial format for several years, along with a good moisturizer (M.D. Forte Replenish Hydrating Cream)</li>
      <li>It keeps your skin super hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I keep trying new anti aging products and they&#x27;re ok.</li>
      <li>this product gently makes wrinkes that are fine almost disappear.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I make certain that I&#x27;m never out!  </li>

      <li>I have fair, naturally dry skin;  and I&#x27;m 61 years old.  </li>

      <li>and Everyone thinks I am easily 20 years younger than I am.</li>
      <li>recommend this product very, very highly.</li>
      <li>Feels great on your face, especially where the skin feels tight.</li>
      <li>and I can already see a huge improvement in my chin and upper lip wrinkles</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
      <li>but I have used it for years and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>A drop of Ethocyn oil on each cheek is absorbed quickly to moisturize without leaving greasy residue or drag on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Only thing I have ever used that really did have quick results.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you apply it evenly to the spots you want tightened (IE, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend only doing under the left eye, etc.)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The actual product did feel nice but a little oily for my taste.</li>
      <li>I am 56 years old and have been in the sun quite a bit as I live at the beach</li>
      <li>, I have used many other products not near as eye lefting&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman with two adult children and a 17 year old.  </li>
      <li>2 drops were certainly not enough for the whole face.</li>
      <li>i am 58 years old &amp; look 45-48.</li>
      <li>it keeps the skin hydrated &amp; soft.</li>
      <li>I am about to turn 57, but most people think I look like I&#x27;m in my mid to late 40s.  </li>
      <li>Several years ago Dr. Bruce Hensel of KNBC highly recommended this for collagen rebuild along with, get this, the lifting of skin such as jowls.</li>
      <li>My skin looked dry and I looked much older.  </li>
      <li>I was told by a cashier who apologized for having to car me from some wine because obviously I looked old enough to by alcohol, but she countered with &amp;#34;truly you don&#x27;t look 40&amp;#34;!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a major ingredient in another line of products that sells for double the price of these vials.</li>
      <li>I have read endless information on anti aging skin products and looked at dozens of studies that essentially say the only real difference between Oil or Olay and La Prairie is the price...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love this product and have been using it for over 14 years. I&#x27;m now in my late 40&#x27;s and have no lines or sagging and my skin is as firm as it was when I was in my 20&#x27;s. Yes, it&#x27;s due to this product and it&#x27;s a major ingredient in another line of products that sells for double the price of these vials. This is the concentrated Ethocyn and a little goes a long way. I have yet to find something better for my eye area and it&#x27;s also great for my sensitive Rosacea and acne prone skin (I&#x27;m lucky huh?). I&#x27;m grateful it&#x27;s still being made and I hope never to be without. I keep trying new anti aging products and they&#x27;re ok. Some are too heavy or harsh and others are just glorified moisturizers but this and any well formulated retinol product (or prescription strength tretinoin) are the only products that truly make a difference to my skin (and I&#x27;ve tried practically everything!) It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommends ethocyn for the skin around the eye. Most products have molecules too large to penetrate the skin, but Ethocyn is different. Its been on the market for over ten years, with published studies on its effectiveness. Its pricey, but it works, and a little bit of it goes a long way. One bottle usually lasts two months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 8 years now and it works.  I just turned 50 in Feb. and everyone thinks I&#x27;m 43!  It keeps your skin super hydrated.  I can feel my skin sucking this up as soon as I put it on and it feels good!  The ONLY downside is the price.  Since getting laid off in March, I have to watch every penny, but I am on my last drop of this and I am going to have to break down and buy it soon.  I would buy more if the price wasn&#x27;t so outrageous.</li>
    <li> Several years ago Dr. Bruce Hensel of KNBC highly recommended this for collagen rebuild along with, get this, the lifting of skin such as jowls. He said it would be a good adjunct to prescrip Retin A which I dont use. But I use This and Everyone thinks I am easily 20 years younger than I am. Get started today is my advice!</li>
    <li> These vials are probably the best product in the world for a persons skin ever made. Not only do they make you younger but they help to keep you that way! Plus, this company sent me them in the expedited way from Fed Ex. I could not believe how fast I received them! I have been smiling ever since. This GI Jane has launched one heck of a company in a big way! Keep it going!!</li>
    <li> I have used Ethocyn serum for years until I could not afford it any longer.  I started looking online and found this seller.  The price is great, and I can start using it again!!!</li>
    <li> It looks like it&#x27;s achieving my skin goals. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who can afford it. It takes years off your look,</li>
    <li> I have fair, naturally dry skin;  and I&#x27;m 61 years old.  My skin is super-sensitive, prone to break-outs and allergic reactions.  I&#x27;ve been using Ethocyn in the vial format for several years, along with a good moisturizer (M.D. Forte Replenish Hydrating Cream);  and my skin looks great: It&#x27;s soft, free of wrinkles and crepe, and vibrant.  The Ethocyn is wonderful -- although the price of it has doubled recently -- ouch.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product very, very highly.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ethocyn for a couple of years and notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  It adds moisture and has rejuvenated my skin making my skin more bright, and lessens lines.</li>
    <li> Very expensive...but I have used it for years and it works very well.  Only place I could find it.  It came, I used it as always and do not really have anything else to add.</li>
    <li> I am a 12 years user or Ethocyn long before it became the :popular as component of NuSkin products, this is the best defense against wrinkles, dry skin etc....I have used many cosmetics, and this is the best by far.....</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  Only thing I have ever used that really did have quick results.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and believes that it is beneficial. What she likes, I like, therefore this is a great product.</li>
    <li> A drop of Ethocyn oil on each cheek is absorbed quickly to moisturize without leaving greasy residue or drag on the skin.  My skin feels clean &amp; pampered.</li>
    <li> love this product ! have used this over 20 years ago &amp; finally found it on Amazon. it&#x27;s expensive but it truly works. i am 58 years old &amp; look 45-48. i have good skin but with age comes wrinkles. this product gently makes wrinkes that are fine almost disappear. it keeps the skin hydrated &amp; soft. whenever i use this product after having stopped because i run out, friends &amp; family say what have you done to your face? fine wrinkles disappear &amp; i look more youthful. although it&#x27;s pricey it contains 2 vials which last a month each &amp; this is cheaper than injections. plus with injections your skin returns to the way it was before. maybe if i had the money i would use both but for now i use this product.</li>
    <li> I have read endless information on anti aging skin products and looked at dozens of studies that essentially say the only real difference between Oil or Olay and La Prairie is the price... moisture is the essential difference. The exception to this is Ethocyn Essence. In comparative studies only Ethocyn actually, physically reduced wrinkles by about 25% and this has been my experience with the product. I have been using it for twenty years and I feel like \\&quot;The Picture of Dorian Grey\\&quot; as my face has hardly appeared to age over all this time. I have good skin and am in excellent health which has also played a part however I have carefully watched those places where wrinkles try to develop and Ethocyn, with regular use, just smooths them out. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this Ethocyn on Feb. 6th 2015 and I can already see a huge improvement in my chin and upper lip wrinkles, I&#x27;m amazed each morning when I look in the mirror.  I use it twice a day and once I am satisfied with the results I will use once a day since it is very expensive.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> the only skin care I believe in, NO wrinkles and I am 56 years old and have been in the sun quite a bit as I live at the beach</li>
    <li> It had so very little of it. 2 drops were certainly not enough for the whole face. The actual product did feel nice but a little oily for my taste. It&#x27;s too expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have fewer wrinkles and firmer skin. I hope that they don&amp;#34;t discontinue the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 5 years.  I rate it a 5, I have used many other products not near as eye lefting&lt;br /&gt;for the lids as this product is,  I truly recoment this to others,</li>
    <li> Dermatologist had charged me a bundle for thIs&lt;br /&gt;Product, so I ordered it . Incredible results. Really tightens and forms the skin!!! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used to work for Chantal Pharmaceuticals when I was 19, and I saw the actual studies, and photos that were taken of actual users - it&#x27;s the real deal. Make sure that you apply it evenly to the spots you want tightened (IE, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend only doing under the left eye, etc.) otherwise, you WILL notice that one side is noticeably firmer. Love it, love it, love it. And - I haven&#x27;t spoken to anyone at the company in years and years, so this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I make certain that I&#x27;m never out!  I simply put a few drops with the face serum I use (I use to use Lavera&#x27;s hydro life, but Lavera quit producing it, so now I use Dr. Hauschka Regenerating Serum, 1.0-Ounce Box) every morning.  My skin looks healthier and younger!  I also use a needle roller and the two combined make my skin look like I&#x27;ve been spending thousands at the dermatologist.  I am about to turn 57, but most people think I look like I&#x27;m in my mid to late 40s.  I have not had a face lift, I just take exceptional care of my skin.  The one time when I ran out of Ethocyn, it was obvious within a week.  My skin looked dry and I looked much older.  WITHIN A WEEK!  So, I quickly ordered some from AMAZON, and now NEVER run out!  It is by far the best skin care product I use.  I also loved Lavera&#x27;s hydro lift, and the two combined could not be beat!  I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if I could no longer find Chantal&#x27;s Ethocyn.  Give it a try, you&#x27;ll be really glad you did!</li>
    <li> Now this is what I love.  The essence vials with the oil. Feels great on your face, especially where the skin feels tight.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I have tried a lot of different products and I always wind up coming back to this.  I find it very effective and easy to use.  I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman with two adult children and a 17 year old.  I&#x27;m not trying to look 21, I just want to look good for my age.  With this product I have more than accomplished that.  I was told by a cashier who apologized for having to car me from some wine because obviously I looked old enough to by alcohol, but she countered with &amp;#34;truly you don&#x27;t look 40&amp;#34;!  I smiled, thanked her and said to myself, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll take that&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Haved used for 15 years. Very expensive but there&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have used it for years, but the price now is more than I can afford.  It was at an affordable price until it  got attentoin on a national morning show and immediately the price went up......  Hate to do without you ethocyn,  but I just can&#x27;t afford you any longer</li>
