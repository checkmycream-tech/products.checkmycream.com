    <li> I have used Edge&#x27;s &amp;#34;Extra Moisturizing&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34;, and the &amp;#34;Soothing Aloe&amp;#34; Gels. While I always buy the Edge Gel, which Edge Gel depends totally on what is available at what price. I do however prefer the twin packs so I do not have to reorder as often.</li>
