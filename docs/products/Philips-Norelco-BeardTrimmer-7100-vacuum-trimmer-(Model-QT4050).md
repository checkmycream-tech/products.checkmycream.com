      <li>so I am quite happy with the trimmer.</li>
      <li>Does a great job.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> been wanting one of these for quite some time. works well, however i wish it would cut the hair more smoothly. sometimes have to go back over my beard 2 or 3 times. minor complaint though. it doesnt make a mess, and my beard is always looking clean. i&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my husband as a birthday gift. He said it was ridiculously ineffective at trimming his beard and either incredibly dull or of very-low quality in general. I give it two stars for the idea of adding vacuum suction.</li>
    <li> This thing works great</li>
    <li> I used idem like this for years, I just wish it was a little faster with more suction, my old one had more.</li>
    <li> I was excited about the vacuum feature of this product, but it turns out to be its biggest liability.  The little swing door that you unlatch to empty the vacuum receptacle broke and doesn&#x27;t stay closed any longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the location of the vacuum opening near the blades makes it really hard to use this trimmer for detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the power button is in a really awkward place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away!</li>
    <li> Horrible buy and my 30 days is over and screwed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> As with the original my husband loves it b/c it has the vacuum option and to him that was very important.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; feature, while not perfect as other reviews have pointed out, works well enough that clean-up is quite a bit easier, and the battery life is great.  There are a couple minor design flaws, however.  The first is that the vacuum attachment can make trimming edges without the comb guard difficult because you can&#x27;t always see where the blades are.  Second, I think the comb guard teeth extend a little too far forward as I have to practically shove them up my nose to completely trim the hair under my nose.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor for beards. It&#x27;s a must have to tame your facial hair, especially if yours grows like mine. Love that it is cordless. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> ** UPDATE ** After a ton of back and forth, I finally got a replacement roughly 4 months after starting the warranty replacement process. That was about a year ago. This week the replacement died on me in exactly the same way as the original. Spited by the furtrap again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is an invaluable tool of the bearded male who shares a sink with a female. Think of the vacuum as working like your dryer: empty the lint (fur?) trap before each use and it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the door to the furtrap latches with a flimsy piece of plastic which breaks off too easily. When the door isn&#x27;t held shut, the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work. As a careful reader may have inferred, mine broke in this exact manner, much to the dismay of my partner. Fortunately it was still under warranty. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve talked to philips 3 times and had replacements ordered but for some reason they never ship. We&#x27;re going on two months and pounds of shavings in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sad times.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Lithium-Ion battery holds a charge longer&lt;br /&gt;+ International-voltage charger&lt;br /&gt;+ Fine-grained and more secure height adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Swing-open door for hair removal a pain&lt;br /&gt;- No narrow-blade accessory for mustaches&lt;br /&gt;- No carrying case&lt;br /&gt;- Somewhat wimpy vacuum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past two and a half years, I have been using the [[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]], which is an earlier generation of the Qt4050.  I&#x27;ve been generally satisfied with the T980, except that its NiCd battery won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  The Qt4050 has a big advantage in that it uses a Lithium-Ion battery, rare in products of this nature, though I expect it will become more common in the future.  Li-Ion batteries last longer between charges and don&#x27;t degrade as quickly as NiCd or NiMH batteries do.  I also like that the Qt4050 includes a universal-voltage AC charger, unlike the T980 which was US voltage only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another advantage of the newer model is the height adjustment - there are more settings available and the setting is clearly indicated in inches and millimeters, whereas the T980 just had a 1-10 numbered dial. The T980&#x27;s adjustment dial would sometimes get moved, especially if something pushed on the trimming comb (such as if it was packed for travel.)  The newer design seems to be more resistant to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One change I do not care for is how one empties the vacuumed hair.  On the T980, there was a generously-sized cup that just pulled out and you could tap over a wastebasket.  The new model has a swing-out door with a rather difficult-to-open catch.  The hair chamber is small, and has crevices that catch hair.  One has to use the supplied brush to get most of the hair out, but some will remain nonetheless.  The new one also seems to collect more hair in and around the comb than the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual trimming function for the Qt4050 is fine, and is pretty much the same as the T980 - no surprise because the blade and comb design is identical.  I found I could even swap in the narrow mustache blade from the T980 - the 4050 doesn&#x27;t include one and I consider this a serious omission for something claiming to be a mustache trimmer.  I use the trimmer for my beard and mustache only, not elsewhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works reasonably well - perhaps the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; motor of the higher priced [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Qt4070/41 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro]] would be stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the trimmer without the comb - as one would do for trimming the neck or sideburns, the 4050 lacks the sliding gate that adjusts better for angle that the T980 had, though I&#x27;m unsure if this makes a difference in real use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T980 included a very nice carrying pouch for travel - no such thing for the Qt4050.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the T980 is still available from Amazon (as of this writing), I&#x27;d tend to recommend it over the Qt4050 if it weren&#x27;t for the NiCd battery issue.  However, the battery may not be a deal-killer for most people and both trimmers can be used on AC power even if the battery is dead (you&#x27;d be astonished at how many similar products can&#x27;t be run on AC.)  The Qt4050 is by no means a bad product - it&#x27;s better than those from other manufacturers I have used (and that&#x27;s quite a few.)  It&#x27;s just disappointing in comparison to its predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: March 23, 2011&lt;br /&gt;The T980 is no longer available from Amazon or really anywhere else.  Too bad.  I have been using the Qt4050 regularly and, other than the poorer vacuum performance, it works ok.  I&#x27;ve managed to come to terms with the door over the hair collection chamber and learned to stop and clean it out more often.  I do like that I can go a much longer time between charges. (Note that with a Li-Ion battery, it will last longest if you keep it \\&quot;topped up\\&quot;, unlike NiCd batteries that prefer being deep-discharged.)  If you&#x27;re considering the Qt4050, maybe spring for the Qt4070 with its more powerful motor. (I have not tried that model, however, and its reviews are decidedly mixed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our household, we have a saying that \\&quot;they &#x27;new-and-improved&#x27; it\\&quot;, meaning that it was made worse than the old model. In some ways that applies to the Qt4050.  Who knows - if I had the Qt4070 I might feel differently about it, as the poorer hair collection is really my major gripe compared to the T980.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: May 22, 2011&lt;br /&gt;Remember when I wrote about the \\&quot;fiddly\\&quot; door over the clipped hair compartment?  Now it&#x27;s more so - the small plastic tab that serves as a latch broke off the door, so it no longer stays shut.  I now have to remember to keep my finger on it to keep it from swinging open while in use.r, and its reviews are decidedly mixed.)

    <li> This Norelco beard trimmer is ergonomically shaped and rubberized. It feels lightweight yet sturdy. The blade height adjustment control is a bit unusual, however. The control is located in the middle of the trimmer and is shaped like the dial of a deodorant stick. You twist it to one direction to raise the blade head and twist in the opposite direction to lower it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem I have with it is the vacuum feature. It&#x27;s pretty useless. There&#x27;s a small motor inside the housing that sucks air in. It&#x27;s more like a faint breeze than a vacuum. Hair collects in a small windowed compartment that has to be emptied frequently. It owes the collecting ability more to gravity than vacuum suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good for grooming beards, but don&#x27;t count on the vacuum doing its job very well. You&#x27;re probably going still going to have to wipe up stray hairs from your sink. I had quite an amount of beard trimmings to clean up trimming my 1/2\\&quot; beard. On a positive note, battery retention is excellent and it holds its charge for several months.</li>
    <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only had 2 trimmers, but this thing is pretty fantastic so far.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months, and have yet needed to recharge it.  The trimmer does an excellent job on my beard, requiring many less passes than my previous one.  The lowest setting may not be considered \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; by some, but it is extremely close.    The vacuum does a pretty good job gathering up hairs from trimming. It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs, but that&#x27;s not really a realistic expectation.    Very simple cleanup and operation. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> works well and the vacuum feature is pretty great</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned seeing so many reviews harping on this not being as good as the previous model.  I was using an older one, a few models prior to this one, and so looked around trying to find the previous model, but had no luck.  So took the gamble on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, outstanding.  I can see why people would complain about the little hinged door for emptying the trimmings, it does make this a little messier.  But the reason I replaced my old one (and the one prior to that) was that the little cup type receptacle they used to use always broke on me after time, becoming separated, front and back, so that trying to pull it out just pulled off the front cover, letting things fall out if you weren&#x27;t careful.  So while this isn&#x27;t as neat as the previous solution, it&#x27;s definitely a better engineering design, less prone to the plastic glue coming undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On both my previous models, I ALWAYS had whiskers flying onto the counter and sink when doing my chin.  Always.  This one, nary a hair.  Everything went where it was supposed to be, into the vac stream and into the catch bin.  Much neater than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I preferred the outer ring for adjusting the depth of the trimmer to this smaller internal rotating adjustment, but it still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not any louder than the previous model despite having a better vacuum system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using this for much longer than the other ones, since it no longer has the same design flaw for where it stores the clippings.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my facial hair at a constant 5 &#x27;oclock shadow kinda look.  It works really well.        Another review on here complains that the guard is pointed and you&#x27;ll end up stabbing yourself.  I&#x27;m not the lease bit careful when I shave and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it.  Never been stabbed.  This thing works like a charm and I highly recommended it. If I were to lose it I&#x27;d definitely get another one just like it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Norelco Vacuum Beard Trimmer.  My first unit lasted for eight years and had the added feature of the Turbo button.  When I purchased this unit on Amazon, I didn&#x27;t see the Turbo listed at the time I made my purchase otherwise I would have gotten another Turbo unit.  This Trimmer works really well and the Vacuum feature is excellent.</li>
    <li> Needed a new beard trimmer to replace my previous Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer T980. The advantage of the newer model is that there are more trimming settings than the T980. The wheel used to set the trimming height is much better than the older model T980. The wheel on the T980 had a tendency to move while you were using the trimmer (a bad thing.)    In reading the reviews of others who purchased the newer model, a reviewer made mention that the new trimmer did not include the small detachable mustache trimmer. I have always used the mustache trimmer to clean-up my mustache, the hair at my earlobes and the edges of my beard. I read this person&#x27;s review and it told me I could use this detachable trimmer from the T980 with the new model Qt4050. For me, that was very important. I hope the Philips Norelco people read these reviews because not including this trimmer with the Qt4050 makes no sense. This small trimmer is a must for me. I would not have purchased the Qt4050 had I not read in the other review. Philips Norelco people, what were you thinking by not including the trimmer? At least offer it as an optional piece of equipment. A perfect example of being penny wise and pound foolish. Come on guys, try cleaning up these edges of the beard or mustache without the trimmer attachment...it cannot be done unless you use a scissors and/or a razor. Someone needs to get his head out of his ...</li>
    <li> I bought this unit a few weeks ago.  So far I like the fact that it is rechargeable  and that it has a vacuum for the hair.  I had an older battery unit from another  company that lastest a long time, but the older technology and battery changing  was challenging.  Good unit worth the price.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for the boyfriend, but he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a lot of bad experience with many kinds of electric razors before but just as I expected Phillips is holding the trophy for being one of the most reliable hardware manufacturer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is just my opinion but, I feel that Phillips unlike other companies/corporations, don&#x27;t seem to design their products to break after a certain amount of usage. It is solid material, it shaves extremely well as in, I don&#x27;t have to pass at the same spot multiple times like I did with my last Remington razor and the one before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vaccum on it is kinda useless though because it doesn&#x27;t manage to suck in all the hairs (which defeats its purpose entirely) but it catches about 3/4 of the hairs and it is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery in it lasts REALLY long. Since I bought it some month ago, I didn&#x27;t even have to recharge it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic thing on it that determines the length it should cut, is brilliantly designed. Its impossible to accidentally change the length and at the same time its very easy to remove if you just pull on it a little when its time to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up for this product and if one day it breaks, as is the fate of all man made products, I will buy the same model again next time!!</li>
    <li> Use it every day and love it. It is light and holds a charge for a very long time. Easy to bring on trips, and love the versatility of the adjustable comb length. The vacuum is quite loud, but just close the bathroom door and you won&#x27;t disturb others too much.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly expensive product, but it comes with some nice features. This shaver gives you lots of options. For example, there are 18 different length settings. Sometimes you can have too many options, and this may be the case. Do you really need 18 different settings?    Still, there&#x27;s a lot to like. The design is very stylish. The shaver has a distinctive look and is easy to hold. Another nice feature is the lithium ion battery system. Who wants to be burdened with cords?    Probably the best feature is the vacuum system. Instead of making a huge mess the shaver uses the vacuum to dispose of loose hair.    This shaver also has a 2 year warranty if anything goes wrong.    Ultimately, it&#x27;d be nice if the vacuum was stronger. It&#x27;s also be great if the charge held longer. These are minor quibbles, however.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer now for three weeks and I have mixed feelings about it. It operates as it is suppose to - I did not cut myself, no hair became snagged in the blades, and it has been cutting evenly and well for the past three weeks every other day. It is easy enough to remove and adjust the blade guard which has settings for nearly every beard length, however is comes with 0 extras, and it is difficult to use on the mustache. The trimmer construction is okay, but it feels light and I worry I am going to break it - though that hasn&#x27;t happened. It holds a long enough charge for one careful trim, and the vacuum isn&#x27;t the best. The compartment for holding hair is also small, and you have to blow out a small area between the compartment and the blade after every trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in sum - nothing wrong with this trimmer it just feels mediocre all around, so if the price is right and you only need to trim your beard, I would buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used both the Wahl and the Norelco beard and moustache trimmers.  I have often found it difficult to use them in the bathroom without making a mess.  I&#x27;ve tried cutting or shaving over a plastic bag, etc.  This tool really does vacuum enough of the hair to make it possible to do away with the mess and the plastic bags.  It does not vacuum everything, but about 95%.  The only difficulty I find with it is that the top does not come off as easily as I would like and the plastic is a bit thin compared with earlier models.  Nevertheless, the added benefit of the vacuum is quite helpful, and the way it cuts is effective.</li>
    <li> I love the vacuum, even if it doesn&#x27;t catch every hair.  It catches the vast majority.  Love the ease of the height adjustment.  My old one (a Philips) only ran on the battery, so love this ones versatility - battery or cord operated.</li>
    <li> Definitely don&#x27;t use this when your hair is damp because the vacuum won&#x27;t work on it and it just clogs. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped for and seems kind of gimmicky. The actual trimmer works fine and I like all the different lengths you can choose from.</li>
    <li> This trimmer replaces a Wahl that I liked but had two problems: unable to accept overseas voltage, and battery died. The Norelco Qt4050 with lithium ion battery maintains a charge for several days (not fully tried yet) and can be used anywhere.  It trims my longish beard neatly.  The vacuum feature is more effective than in the Wahl but the chamber that stores trimmings is a bit small.  Mine must be emptied once a week. The clear face on the chamber is very convenient because you can easily see when the trimmings need to be emptied.  The only design flaw that I notice is the case appears to be snapped together, which prevents home handy-persons from opening it for service (change the battery?).  Just have to buy a new one when that happens, I suppose.</li>
    <li> Floating head hugs the face.  Vacuum really does catch most of the trimmed hairs.  But awkward to use to define beard line as vacuum inlet gets in way and forces odd angle to hold it</li>
    <li> Considering the previous vacuum model that my husband owned is no longer available, the only choice was this one.  So far, it is meeting expectations.</li>
    <li> Terrible. the vacuum feature is useless. It keeps clogging and the storage is tiny. It takes multiple passes to cut all hairs. This is a kids toy, If you are a real man avoid this Trimmer.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco trimmer provides a convenient way to keep beards in shape. It is a bit on the large side as compared to other trimmers, but it is extremely lightweight. There is a bin that is supposed to collect cut hair, but it doesn&#x27;t collect all. Quite a bit of trimmings remain on the blades, but this can easily be removed with a quick brush, unlike some trimmers that take a special tool to clean.  One low point is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well when the hair is wet or damp.    It is quick to charge and easy to turn on. But the true selling point is the variety of cutting adjustments, listed both in inches and mm, it truly can fit anyone&#x27;s style and need.</li>
    <li> The product does what it is supposed to do. Is easy to use and the length setting is a very nice feature. It holds charge for many uses without connecting it.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have had several battery-powered beard trimmers. Until trying this Norelco, they all ended up in the trash after a couple of weeks. Either they were too weak, or they didn&#x27;t cut well.    The Norelco is plenty powerful, has good battery endurance and cuts cleanly.    Its extra bells and whistles, however, turn out to be of only marginal benefit, at least if, like me, you have a long, soft, curly beard.    I wear mine short in the sideburns and longer on the chin. The Norelco is pretty much useless for trimming the longer parts of my beard, and the little rack that supposedly manages the depth of cut doesn&#x27;t help much on the sideburns.    The vacuum feature works to an extent but nowhere near completely, so you still have to shave over a bowl.    For trimming the mustache and the neck hairs, it is handy and quick.    For the main hacking, I will still have to depend on my Weck barber scissors. These were expensive when I bought them 35 years ago but they look good for another 200 or 300 years. Taking into consideration buying power, the Norelco power cutter cost a tenth as much and probably won&#x27;t last a tenth as long.    But I&#x27;m not throwing this one away. For what it does, it does it well and the price is reasonable.    Though I haven&#x27;t been able to experiment, it appears that the Norelco ought to work better for the short, stubble look, especially if your beard is straight and stiff.</li>
    <li> cuts really good, the vacuum somewhat works but not that good, the vacuum slot where the hair goes through will get clogged, the way the blades sit, its hard to do edging</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, vacuum really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the plastic latch to the vacuum compartment broke off when I was slightly less than gentle in popping it open. Oh well.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good and I am happy with it. But havent  used it enough to get the feel of it.</li>
    <li> Works great! the vacuum feature is nice, makes less of a mess.</li>
    <li> The bin that catches the vacuumed hair spills when opened, unlike the previous model which had a cup would be removed and emptied.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and does what it is supposed to do. It does what it is supposed to do but if you are looking for something to cut closely this is not the product for you. If you are looking for something to make your beard look nice this is the product for you. The vacuum is a nice feature as it makes clean up a lot easier and the maintenance is very easy so that is nice. Overall this is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a decent set of trimmers but after a few months the clip on the vacuum hatch (or what ever you call it) broke.  So I have to hold while I use or it will flop open and spill hair shavings everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the little door is cheap plastic and the clip is cheap plastic.  It just broke from every day use.  If they fixes that it would be a pretty good set of trimmers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this specifically for the vacuum capability. It&#x27;s quite a pain to clean up after shaving at the sink, so I thought this would be great.  Even when I shaved daily (which is not ideal), there was quite a bit of whiskers on and surrounding the sink.  I attempted to play around a bit with speed and direction, but was never successful. The shaving capability wasn&#x27;t extraordinary either.  I&#x27;m currently working with Phillips to return based on the 45-day money back guarantee.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing a waterproof shaver as a replacement.</li>
    <li> After my old trimmer gave in to inevitability of time, I held on. And kept on holding on. That thing was plugged in and I&#x27;d use it because the battery was otherwise dead! I swear!  Why did I do this? C&#x27;mon look at the reviews for all these other products. Its a tough cookie to crack. Do I want the 3.5 star rated $45 version, the 3 star rated $15 product by some other company or the $70 one? AHHHHH!!!  I read and read and read reviews.  In the end I went with the Norelco Beard Trimmer with a Vacuum at the price I felt comfortable with. The one that died was the same, but I didn&#x27;t remember pay $40 for it either. But who knows it lasted me for about 4 years. I was happy with it and reluctant to look for something new.  When I first unpacked it, I was surprised by how light it felt. This one change makes all the difference. Ergonomically it fit my otherwise large hands because it gets wider as you move up the trimmer.   The only complaint I have after three weeks of use is the trimmings trap. You can&#x27;t remove it from the unit. Previous version  you could.</li>
    <li> Hi. I bought this Philips QT4050 because it was the only one available in Canada. The QT4070 is available only in USA apparently. I have it since about Aug.1st and I am still on the original charge. Great battery life. I used it on my goatee+moustache and it works fine. Only the part under the nose is difficult to trim. You would have to remove the trimming comb to do it better. You will have to go over the trimming area a few times to do it perfectly though. The trim is not perfect on first pass. I was not cut (skin) a single time by the unit. It is very safe. I even tried it on purpose and couldnt hurt myself ! I found it very good also for trimming my eyebrows. I set it at 3mm and it looks great. I started a few years ago trimming these eyebrows and it needs to be done on a regular basis now.  One thing for sure, this unit is not designed to cut your hair. Believe me, I tried it and my hair is not that long (I have them cut at 1 or 2mm every 2 or 3 months by the barber). The hair gets stucked in the trimming comb and cutting unit. I believe if you keep your hair at 1 or 2mm long, maybe it could do the job keeping it that way but cutting hair after 2 or 3 months of growth, no go. You will end up burning the motor or the cutting unit will be worn down.  For the hair-collection chamber, it works ok but collects about 80% of the hair. The rest ends up in the sink. The adjustment ring for hair length stays at the chosen setting always.  On the whole, I am very satisfied with this product as it performs great for what it was designed for. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer. Not extremely effective, but I do use once in a while. The little door though is poorly designed and won&#x27;t stay shut.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot to note here, as is usually the case when reviewing personal care products. My SO uses this to maintain that oh-so-subtle day-old stubble that I find so appealing and finds that it does a good job. The battery is apparently rather long-lived compared to other such products that he has used (at my gentle insistence, I must admit) in the past; this one showed up, fortuitously enough, just as his previous trimmer had expired. He finds it easy to clean and maintain and other than that, easygoing type that he is, has no other comment on it. I personally hope that he continues to maintain it but with summer coming, it&#x27;s unlikely. :(</li>
    <li> This is my second one. Excellent product. It is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull my beard. The adjustable feature give me plenty of settings to choose from. The vacuum feature helps keep the trimmings off me and the surrounding area.</li>
    <li> after having the T-980 for years this is really a disappointment. don&#x27;t know why they have stopped making the t-980. the vaccumn cup doesn&#x27;t collect all of the hair and unless you have a very long beard the only setting where you can get a trim is the next to closest which makes it look like you have a stubble beard. also, has no pop-up trimmer like the others to even the hair above your lip and under chin like others.</li>
    <li> After 6 months of usage I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the machine. Many complain about the little door breaking off and I do not see why that happened to them. I guess my advice would be to clean the machine do not be rough with it,lol. About the trimming it does what it says it does. I haven&#x27;t been nipped or poked by using this machine; again when using this machine or any other be gentle bc at the end of the day it&#x27;s your skin that will be harmed. The vacuum works, however for some reason the longer you have your beard the less it&#x27;ll pick up. I would say normally it&#x27;ll collect 45% of the air it trims.</li>
    <li> As one who was very skeptical to buy this beard trimmer, I now will always have one. It&#x27;s cuts smooth as butter. The vacuum is by no means a shop vac but it does VERY well. I trimmed my beard off completely with it and it caught over 90% of the hair. SO much easier and less messy. The adjustable head is clearly marked with the actual length and not just arbitrary numbers. Seems solid in the hand. Good feel to it. Overall very pleased</li>
    <li> The refinements are effective.  This trimmer is slightly improved from the prior model in several respects.  The vacuum is a bit stronger, the vacuum chute stays clear, the hair chamber is easy to clean, the comb has shorter, rounded tips, and the cutting head is more precise.  I was initially troubled by the change in the vacuum chute and the chamber because the chute is no longer retractible and the chamber now has a swing-out door.  However, the new chute stays clear (and there is no spring to fall out) and the chamber is simple to clean (and the door opens easily after a few times).  The new comb design allows closer access around the nostrils and the new cutting head allows more precise results when the comb is removed.</li>
    <li> I never shave, just keep my beard clipped close; kind of the rugged look. The charge holds well through a clipping &amp; the vacuum eliminates cleaning up a lot of hair. Great value.</li>
    <li> Had the previous model and LOVED it! Needed a new one and asked for it for Christmas. I got it, used it, and returned it.    - It cuts unevenly.  - The blades and guard are spaced apart a significant amount which doesn&#x27;t allow for much control on shorter lengths.  - The retractable shield from the previous model does not retract on this model. This makes it difficult to clean the vacuum chute.  - The vacuum chute clogs easily.  - I found I had to hold the trimmer at uncomfortable angles to get semi-decent results.    Overall, don&#x27;t waste your time and money.    The only nice thing I have to say about it is that it looks pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought the qt4050 because of warnings I read about the qt4070 guide comb.  I don&#x27;t need the fancy extras that come with the qt4070 so this one fits the bill nicely.  I&#x27;ve had it now for about a month and it seems to be very well made.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I think this is much better than the QT4070. I used them both and recommend this over the QT4070. The reason being is that it actually cuts to the setting you set it to, whereas the QT4070 doesn&#x27;t have the front teeth high enough and depending on your angle you could cut it completely or partially. The reason I am only giving 4 out of 5 stars is that it does not have a better level indicator.</li>
    <li> As expected, it is the one i was loookin for. It shaves the hair evenly and it has multiple degrees in it in both inches and milimeters. Its just outta words and i recommend it!!</li>
    <li> After my last Norelco trimmer died, I purchased the Qt4050.  Very similiar in performance except no turbo vacuum.  The head should be smaller to get in tight places around the nose.</li>
    <li> It is good better than the other I have used but it isn&#x27;t perfect yet. I would recommend it to others specially if its on sale.</li>
    <li> I brought this because I wanted a neater way to keep my bread groomed between barber visits. It does a nice job trimming, though even the lowest setting didn&#x27;t quite give me the stubble I was hoping for. But it&#x27;s sleek, and gives a very smooth trim, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like my previous pair of clippers did. However, the vacuum sucks. The vacuum might suck in about half of what you trim off, but your sink will still be a mess of clipped hairs when you&#x27;re done. While it didn&#x27;t blow me away, I don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I searched far and wide to find a beard trimmer that ran off of a cord alone. I&#x27;d already gone through two other trimmers when the batteries wore out on them, even though the rest of the trimmer was functioning just fine. There are plenty of HAIR clippers that run off of cords but they are too bulky to comfortably use to trim a beard. I was surprised to find that this Philips Norelco trimmer fit the bill. YES it DOES have a battery and one that lasts for a long time (both between charges due to my experience and the length of the battery itself according to things I&#x27;ve read about the lithium ion batteries). BUT it also can run on just the cord without the power having to go through the battery and then to the motor like most other rechargeable trimmers. So when the battery  kicks the bucket on this one I&#x27;ll still have a functioning trimmer. Though I have a feeling the battery is going to last a long time on this one. I&#x27;ve charged this trimmer only once in the month and a half I&#x27;ve had and used it (about 1-2 times a week)    The vacuum feature on this trimmer is a bonus but not the reason I purchased it. It certainly helps and does suck up some of the hairs that you cut while trimming but be warned that it won&#x27;t get them all unless you are doing a small touch up. You&#x27;ll still have hairs on the sink to clean up, just far fewer than with any other trimmer.    The adjustable length guard on the trimmer is fantastic, comfortable to use and accurate. I hate having to keep track of a million different pieces (read a ton of different sized blade guards) so this is awesome.  It also easily slips on and off so that you can use it to cut really close and clean up the edges of your beard. In fact, after getting this trimmer I never shave with a razor, I just take the guard off of this trimmer and get as close to the skin as I can on the edges of my beard.    Overall a fantastic product. It earns maybe a 4.5 since the vacuum doesn&#x27;t quite work to contain the mess, but everythingelse is stellar. I bought this trimmer to last me a long time, and it looks like it will do just that.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Norelco QT4050 after my simple, solid, dependable 20-year-old Braun beard trimmer finally gave up the ghost.  Although the QT4050 has more features and settings than the old Braun, it&#x27;s an inferior product.      It has a lightweight, cheap feel to it.      When you remove the adjustable trimming comb attachment to trim the bottom of your moustache just using the blades, you have to hold the QT4050 almost horizontally for the blades to make contact with the moustache.  Then the body of the QT4050 blocks your view, making it difficult to trim a straight, clean line.    The vacuum feature is a joke.  A lot of trimmed hair does get sucked into the hair collection chamber, which then must be emptied.  But a lot of trimmed hair also ends-up all over the body of the QT4050 and in the sink.  The QT4050 has many crevasses and nooks that collect hair, and the little cleaning brush that Philips provides is hardly up to the task of getting rid of these wayward trimmings.  I ended-up holding the QT4050 over the tub and blowing the wayward hair off it.  So, despite the vacuum feature, clean-up after using the QT4050 takes longer than clean-up with the old, vacuum-less Braun.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a beard trimmer that would adjust to the length I wanted but I did not know for sure what that actual length was. This trimmer has a broad range of adjustment and once you set it it holds at that setting exactly. I started with longer settings then just adjusted down to what I preferred. It cuts quickly and easily with no pulling and all facial hair is cut to the length you select. The Vacuum system cannot possibly capture all the hair being cut but captures the majority of it and is easy to empty out from time to time. The adjustable head can be removed to expose the trimmer itself for straight line trimming for sideburns etc. This trimmer holds it&#x27;s charge a long time and I am very pleased with the purchase. I should have bought it much sooner then I did.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend put me onto the idea of using a beard trimmer for trimming my pubic area with better ease. I can&#x27;t believe how right he was. After a lot of researching both men/women body shavers and trimmers I decided to give the Qt4050 a try. OMG I&#x27;m a pretty smart lady but my BF is a genius! Never before has the act of trimming delicate areas not caused me to break out in a sweat with shaking hands. Now when I need to take care of business it is an absolute breeze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard is great and moves along the contours of your skin. Length adjustment is simple and switches easily as well as firmly so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally change when holding the trimmer during use like reviews I had read on some other trimmers. When researching this particular trimmer, I had read about how it doesn&#x27;t actually capture all the hair with the vacuum so I decided to stand in the tub the first time I used it so hair wouldn&#x27;t get all over the floor. Sure enough the trimmer didn&#x27;t capture all of it but I would guess it did capture 90-95%. I used the medium length setting and was amazed at how easy it worked but by the time I was done I had switched to the shortest setting and was extremely pleased. Not a nick or hair was pulled. Clean up was easy, holds charge well and fits nicely in a small makeup bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign up ladies, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various different ways to keep my beard at that stubble look and found other products have been a pain to use. I highly rate the Philips Norelco Qt4050. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like for people with full on beards, but for those who just want to keep that 5 O&#x27;clock stubble look, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this product...</li>
    <li> I discovered this product because my brother bought the QT4070 ([[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver]]), which I tried and enjoyed. I then accessed amazon to buy it, but the QT4050 had better reviews on the site, including someone who had both and preferred the 50.I decided to \\&quot;go with the flow\\&quot; and than bought the QT4050, but I regret my choice. Why? The main reason: It won&#x27;t cut as short as I like it. The \\&quot;1mm\\&quot; measure is only at the best case scenario - as if you were full of static energy and your beard hair was all straight. In other conditions (irregular beard growth, for instance) it won&#x27;t deliver a 1mm beard... The QT4070, on the other hand, cuts much closer - and you can always adjust the trimming level for longer beard if you prefer.  Besides that, the loong charging time is another stopper for this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed having this trimmer over the last year. It has been going strong for the past 14 months and doesn&#x27;t show any signs of stopping. I use it about once a week. It doesn&#x27;t catch every bit of hair that is trimmed, but does keep the mess down overall. I&#x27;d say it catches about 90% of trimmings. The attached photo is a result of trimming my goatee this morning and shows what was remaining on the sink. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I had the Remington model # MB-300 when I started using this.  I can say for sure that the Norelco model trims much more evenly and the vacuum in the model is a HUGE plus!!!    The Remington, however, has a better angle and hence is definetely easier to use at different positions.    As you can tell, each has their advantages, but the but in the end the Norelco charging system is more user friendly and with this in mind, if I had to make a choice, I would use the Norelco instead of the Remington.</li>
    <li> Written by Barbara&#x27;s husband, TEA - I had to send my Phillips Norelco T970 out to get new batteries, so I purchased the QT4050 as a replacement.  I Figured the T970 would be my backup if the QT4050 ever needed service.  I loved the T970 and after using the QT4050 for more than two months, I am extremely pleased.  I use the beard trimmer every morning to trim my full beard and so far have only charged it once.  The T970 needed charging weekly.  I am six foot tall so while the T970 fit my hand without a problem the QT4050 is even more comfortable, slightly smaller and lighter.  I feel the QT4050 does a better job trimming and cutting my beard each morning than the T970.  The only thing I like better about the T970 is it has a tray you remove to clean it.  The QT4050 has a flimsy plastic door you open.  Once open I then bump the trimmer on my sink to dump the trimmings out of a compartment.  The QT4050 comes with a brush to clean out the compartment and it only works \\&quot;so-so.\\&quot;  Five stars to Phillips for making such a useful device.</li>
    <li> After reading negative reviews, I was leery so I bought one at Target (and paid more than I could have) for easier return. No worries, it works great. I use it on my beard (very thick) and what&#x27;s left of the hair on my head (also very thick). Not only does it cut through everything without a struggle, it does so better than most corded trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two attachments; I tried the floating guard but it didn&#x27;t allow for as close of a cut so I switched to the fixed guard. Both work great, neither catches or snags skin like some reviews state. I&#x27;ve even used it without the guards with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The turbo boost switch is excellent (not sure why you&#x27;d use regular speed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum seems to catch about 80% of trimmings if I go a few days between but catches everything if I shave every other day. Clean out the hair trap after every use for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is quite good (I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks, 2-3 times a week and have charged it 3 times). And, best of all, it&#x27;s zero maintenance (but you do need to clean out the hair trap after every use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars? I had a boss once who refused to give 5 stars on performance review because that meant everything was perfect. And, while I can&#x27;t find a way to make this better for what it is, I&#x27;d like to see them try.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a beard, but I occasionally raise some stubble. So after I tried it, I gave it to a friend who does have a beard. He raved. \\&quot;The vacuum is the thing I like the best!\\&quot; he said. \\&quot;I don&#x27;t have all those little pieces of hair down my shirt front, or in the bathroom sink...and it is a really good beard trimmer besides!\\&quot; And he says he&#x27;s keeping it, too.    So, there you have it. The addition of a vacuum to a beard trimmer is one of those \\&quot;duh\\&quot; things that only become obvious once somebody does it.    Really first rate design stands out. Really first rate design for use is a thing of beauty.</li>
    <li> I find it a very good beard trimmer.  It took me several times to get it the way i wanted. At first I was taking too little off, then too much. Holds a charge for multiple uses. The vacuum collects about 90% of the clippings. I hope the blades remain sharp for a long time, but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> This is a big improvement over the prior generation. Battery lasts longer, motor quieter, cuts more consistently.  If you have the mustache trimmer from the prior version, be sure to keep it as it works just fine on the newer model. Pretty easy to clean, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is functional, but it&#x27;s short of spectacular.  The positives are found in its design.  Norelco, as usual, did a good job concepting an ergonomic razor that offers all the little conveniences that make shaving easier.  The trimmer is light weight and feels good in your hand; it smoothly follow the contours of your face.  It has 18 different length settings, which I find particularly useful.  Each setting is reached by simply rotating a wheel that clicks into place at each length.  Given these clicks, there is no guess work as to which length setting you are on.  The vacuum compartment door is clear, so you know when it&#x27;s time to empty the razor.    While the design of this trimmer ranks high, parts of its execution are lacking.  The obvious shortcoming for me is the vacuum.  I find it ineffective.  For every hair the trimmer collects, it seems to spill one into the sink.  So, great, I still have to clean out my sink while also having to clean out the trimmer&#x27;s vacuum compartment.  Philips has the right idea by adding a vacuum, but there is still work to be done in the R &amp; D department before this feature becomes a selling point.   The trimmer has also clogged a couple of times when I&#x27;ve trimmed off any significant amount of hair.  I know most beard trimmers occasionally clog, but other Norelco products I&#x27;ve used haven&#x27;t had this problem.  Finally, this trimmer is not ideal for use on a mustache.  Unless you remove the guard, it can be difficult to maneuver the blade around your upper lip.  And, if you have to remove the guard, it defeats the purpose of having a trimmer in the first place.      The bottom line is that this is a sturdy product that is better than a lot of options out there right now, but it isn&#x27;t overly impressive by Norelco standards.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer I have owned in the 10+ years I&#x27;ve been using one. I previously purchased the QT4070 and hated it! But used the money back offer from Norelco and got it right away no questions asked.... I then both this one, the QT4050.....and it is absolutely perfect.  Several features make it superior to others I have owned.... One, the dial for adjusting the lengths is recessed so that it can&#x27;t be moved by accident....Two, it accepts international voltage making it perfect for travel....and three, it cuts more evenly than any I have ever owned.  When fully charged it provides more trims that my prior Norelcos and can be used with the cord if you need to... Overall I am extremely happy with it and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a beard trimmer    Oh, one last item.... I had no trouble emptying the vacumm container nor did I think the few hairs that it didn&#x27;t catch were an issue.... so again, excellent</li>
    <li> It does as advertised, collects hair well in the container.</li>
    <li> Mixed emotions on this.  Love the vacuum but for trimming the moustache it gets in the way and makes it hard to get right under your nose.  You have a moustache you know what I mean.  The tines on this end up in your nose and still I miss some hairs</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift that I had asked for to replace a much loved Brookstone model that had an engineering design flaw.  This beard trimmer works very well and is easy to set to the length you need.  The blades were sharp and did a good job even on the mustache hair.  Cuts evenly and does a good job even in the bushy parts of the beard and on the jaw corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two downsides to the model are that for those of us with a heavy beard, the vacuum compartment is far too small and fills very quickly.  The other issue is that there is no precision blade with the trimmer.  Precision cutting around the mouth and on the neckline is very difficult.  You either have to keep a precision cutter handy or get a cheap straight razor to handle those spots.</li>
    <li> The vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t really work, there&#x27;s still going to be a ton of hair in your sink. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like.</li>
    <li> I thought the vacuum would be a gimmick but it actually works. No more sink full of stubble! Only con would be it doesn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sone who has owned several beard trimmers over the years. He likes the shape of this trimmer as it is easy to grip and he commented on the compartment that holds the shaved hairs as a great feature. He is a neat freak and there are no longer hairs in the sink after trimming his beard.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job well.  It is comfortable, has adjustable lengths, and creates a great stubble look.  I have had it around a month, and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet, using it every 2 days. I would definitely recommend this trimmer.  It&#x27;s a nice bonus that it has a vacuum that works well if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair you are trying to trim.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a great trimmer and only time will tell whether it is as good as my last Norelco trimmer. I do like the vacuum feature of this trimmer and it seems to work quite well. Hardly no beard hair in the sink, so I&lt;br /&gt;do think it&#x27;s going to be okay.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for offering it on Amazon, as the price was competitive.&lt;br /&gt;After using this trimmer and only thing that Norelco could improve on is the little door that you open to get rid of the stubble. It is flimsy and mine wouldn&#x27;t stay closed, I had to use a little tape to keep it closed. The little catch on the door broke and that is why I had to tape it shut.</li>
    <li> So I bought this because one morning I was using my regular electric to trim my beard down when I put a giant hole on my cheek and I was forced to shave my beard down quite a bit. An entire 2 week growth gone! Gah! Don&#x27;t you hate it when that happens ladies?  Pro: It does cut my beard very well and evenly.  Con: The vacuum does not work like a hoover. It does trap some hair, but not all of it. The first few times I used it, I noticed the front of my shirt covered with remnants of my former manliness. So that kind of sucks...  But I have the solution! If you do not mind looking like a complete moron, just get a small plastic trash bag, cut down the sides about 3/4 of the way, fold that front lap over and you&#x27;ll have yourself a DIY hair bib. No joke, I did this a few days ago and it worked great. No more hairy shirts for me! You do lose a trash bag however, so that is my only Con to this solution.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly adequate clipper, no better or worse than others I have used. The adjustable guard is nice because you don&#x27;t have all these attachments to keep track of and lose, and you can get just the length you want. But its big selling point is supposedly the vacuum feature. This proves to be more of a hassle than a convenience. The area under the blade clogs quickly as does the compartment for holding the clippings, and I have to clean them out 2 or 3 times per use. As a result clippings still end up in and around the sink, defeating the whole purpose. Also, the door on the clippings compartment broke and will no longer stay closed. I Have to hold it closed while I use the clipper. I did not subject this to hard use or dropping, so the door is clearly flimsy. I generally like Philips products so I was disappointed. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it fails because it does the job well enough, I suppose.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a 6 year old Panasonic in which the batteries would no longer hold a charge.  It would seem to me that Panasonic has discontunued their line of Trimmers...and perhaps even sold this design to Norelco.  I like this design because it is ONE-PIECE and does a very good job.   I don&#x27;t want a drawer full of attachments like some of the other brands.      I was very happy with the Panasonic...but I am happier with the Norelco for 3 things.  1) the Lithium Ion Batteries stay up much better. The older Panny had NiCads which lose a large percent of their charge, even when not in use.   2) The Norelco has higher RPM&#x27;s and just works quicker.  3) The Norelco vacuums much better...not perfect, but better....probably due to the higher RPM&#x27;s.    Minor quibble others have mentioned:  The Panasonic had a removable clippings drawer you slide out and can take to waste basket and tap out the clippings.  The Norelco is more of a side-door that does not come off...so it is a bit harder to empty.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t grab all the clippings, you certainly still have to check for a few that got away.  But compared to my prior trimmers that had no vacuum feature its a huge upgrade.  For just a light daily trimming I didn&#x27;t find the compartment filled to much.  Just knocked it out in the sink when I&#x27;m done, swept the few loose hairs into the sink and all set.  Pretty happy overall though have yet to really test the strength of the battery.</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty over-priced, in my estimation. It feels light and cheap. I&#x27;m used to a more solid, metal head, and this plastic head didn&#x27;t work well for me. I returned it and bought a Remington Mb975 Rechargeable Chrome Detail Beard Groomer, which was a basic model of a shaver I had previously. I&#x27;m much happier with this one. And it&#x27;s about half the price, as I remember. This one looks pretty cool, the vacuum is an interesting feature, but it&#x27;s kinda bulky, and hard to use on your face. Save yourself some money and go with a solid performer.</li>
    <li> Purchased the unit 3 weeks ago to replace worn-out Philips Norelco T980 vacuum trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco adamently warn against other use than beard trimming; in addition to beard trimming I&#x27;ve always used mine to trim the hair on my skull down to minimum length twice a week, and in spite of this abuse I&#x27;m very satisfied with its durability - my last unit held up for 4 1/2 year, and while the blades gradually dulled and the vacuum lost suction, there were no catastrophical failures and if I&#x27;d been more patient I could probably have continued using it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new QT4050 unit is lighter and easier to get a good result with. Compared to when my former unit was new the QT4050&#x27;s vacuum function is somewhat weaker, but it still does a decent job; I&#x27;ve never expected it to be able to suck up 100% of the hair, but always used it over a sink not wearing a shirt. I really have no issues trimming under my nose, but individual anatomical features might explain different results here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m happy with the replacement.</li>
    <li> I had a Philips Norelco it last for 10 years. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Getting this beard trimmer via Amazon&#x27;s Vine program meant it was not researched.  Even then not being bearded, I&#x27;m not sure I would know what to look for.  Having gotten it, my experiences of course are only vicarious and second-hand at best. But with a boyfriend that has a beard and is pretty fussy about it, I can get good data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEARD IT WAS USED ON:&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend has a goatee, meaning he has both a mustache and a beard only on his chin connected by hair on either side of his mouth.  He keeps the beard all one length, but trims only the end of the mustache, which means the hair on top is longer than the hair just above his lip. So essentially he uses the close trimmer on the sides of the goatee and bottom of the mustache and the length trim part on the beard section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT CHARGE AND CORDED DESIGN:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was working out of the box, but we put it on an overnight charge as recommended.  Since then my boyfriend had used it for about 5-6 goatee trims with no need to charge it again. This being over about about a month and a half span of time. What is cool about it, is if you run it until it is exhausted, you can then plug it in and use it, then leave it to charge.  That&#x27;s cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VACUUM VENT CAN IMPACT CLOSENESS OF TRIM&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum mechanism is about 80% effective, meaning you will still get hair in your sink.  Also due to the location of vacuum opening, you cannot get the trimmer as close to your face as you would like. However that is still pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIDER DESIGN MEANS QUICK TO USE&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer being non-corded is very flexible to use.  The trimmer since it is wider than some other trimmers,  would make quicker work of a substantial or whole face beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPACER PLACEMENT CAN BE TRICKY&lt;br /&gt;Since most beards need both close and length trimming you need to pull the length head off.  What is cool about this design, is there is a roller that you set the length with so when you put the spacer back on, it is correct. You don&#x27;t have to reset it each time.  The spacer was some what tricky to put back on. You had to be sure to have the edges lines up and sliding on straight. Once you got the hang of it however, it went well.  Yes, I tried this myself as my boyfriend said it was a bit tricky and it took about 4-5 tries before I had a technique to do this repeatably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;As far as beard trimmers go, this is a pretty good value. Extra points on the charging and a few points taken away for lack of closeness, tricky spacer placing and under 90% vacuum.time.  The spacer was some what tricky to put back on.

    <li> I liked my old one better</li>
    <li> Update on 11/6/2012 (Purchased 10/19/2011):  The review below still holds, but I thought I&#x27;d let you know that the plastic door on the vacuum debris compartment failed recently.  I like the unit, but the door that you open to empty the clipped hair is molded plastic and so is the integral clip that holds it shut.  I don&#x27;t know how I did it, but the plastic clip broke, so now the door needs to be held closed while shaving.  Not something I&#x27;m going to put up with.  Odd that for a nice machine, the failure of a tiny plastic clip will render the unit useless (as far as I&#x27;m concerned).&lt;br /&gt;Original review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have the issues some of the other reviewers were having.  I took a good look at it and couldn&#x27;t see how I could cut myself with it. Seems safe to me. I really like the adjustment for hair length; it works well and is a lot nicer than the old clipper I was using with its removable plastic clipping guides.  Speaking of which, the finished product (my beard) is a lot smoother now.  This unit does a better job of trimming the hair to a consistent length so it looks neater and actually more dense with a tighter, more consistent surface.  Until now, I didn&#x27;t realize I was walking around ragged. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl unit this replaced lasted 25 years...I doubt this all plastic unit will, though it is quality workmanship for what it is.  That said, this is a technological step-up for me that I&#x27;m really enjoying. The depth adjustment is easy and quick, I feel more confident I won&#x27;t screw-up and gouge my beard in an inattentive moment - that would be impossible with this unit if you set the depth correctly to begin with - and the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; does work and keeps the place neater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box I was disappointed not to find a charging stand.  You can use this unit with or without its cord.  My sink area looks neater now without a stand anyway...I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll adapt. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  Good luck in your search!</li>
    <li> I have a full beard that I want to keep short.  This Philips Norelco beard trimmer does the job.  I like how easy it is to use and adjust. The user has multiple options to adjust the height of the shave. Very easy to keep clean. The battery runs for a long time.  I get over 2 months on one battery.   I highly recommend this battery run electric beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model of this product and loved it. When it broke, I immediately bought the QT4050 -- and then returned it 2 weeks later.    There is a larger gap between the blades and the beard guide, in order to give the vacuum a greater chance to grab hairs, but this also means that trimmer rocks back and forth on your face easily, trimming unevenly. Getting an even trim around my chin was nearly impossible and my entire face was a mismatch of beard heights.    I never had this problem with the previous model. Unfortunately, there was nothing to be done but return it.</li>
    <li> This is my first dedicated mustache trimmer.  I have a Wahl hair clipper that I&#x27;ve always used just to trim for length, and in my opinion that works much better than the Norelco, but it&#x27;s big and clumsy and of course has to be plugged in to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt at using this little guy was kind of unfair, because I was trimming about an inch off of my \\&quot;Carl Senior\\&quot; mustache which was at that time out of control... This unit has a vacuum system that picks up the hair, but it can&#x27;t do well when the hair being removed is an inch long!  It just kind of pushed the hair around and didn&#x27;t cut well, so I gave up and took out the Wahl to do the job.  But the next time, and from then on, I just trimmed a quarter inch on a regular basis, and this works fine for a shorter mustache.  Even without a bag or a case to carry it in, it tosses into my luggage easily and the cord takes no space to speak of.  I can make myself look a little cleaner with just a few seconds work, and then use my razor to clean the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m glad I have this little guy.  I recommend it for guys with short beards or mustaches.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband.  Not only was his old trimmer a different style and had a couple of broken spots on it from falls, it left a big mess of hair everywhere.  Even after he thought he cleaned it all up, I&#x27;d still be finding and seeing hair around for days.  This model &amp;#34;vacuums&amp;#34; the hair up as you use it, and he estimates that it gets about 90% of the hair, which is a great improvement.  It works well and he has no complaints about it whatsoever.  He&#x27;s happy with it and says that he&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  Good product for a reasonable price-can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Good quality cutter.  The height adjustment works great - ratchet height wheel locks firmly so no surprises.  I&#x27;m not sure I understand why some reviewers expected so much.  It does take a couple passes to get everything cut to a precise length but that is to be expected when using a comb-like plate to position a precise height above the skin, some hair will lay down under the plate. The vacuum is a bonus (what do some reviewers expect from a fan the size of a dime and a comb-like adjustment plate that must hang the cutting blades in mid air?)  A quick trim of a few wild hairs before heading out - the vacuum gets it all.  A once in two-weeks major trim using the height plate, there&#x27;s hair in the sink as you might expect.  Simple physics - when the plate is set high, there is no way to focus the vacuum effect without using a hood that would interfere and keep hairs from being cut correctly.  For what it was designed to do, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two improvements - the door to empty the vacuum chamber is weak, you have to be gentle with it.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a stand for storing it on the counter or upright in the medicine chest, especially while plugged in for recharging.  Stands are not available as an accessory either - the manufacturer says they never made one for this model.  It lays on the counter while charging and has to live in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second of these products.  Unfortunately, the first one met with tragedy.  No fault of the product.  I was very pleased to learn that it was still available.  I like every aspect of its performance and the long battery life between charges is a great improvement over any trimmer I have owned in about 30 years of having a beard.  Some reviewers have complained about the vacuum feature.  My beard is salt and pepper but mostly salt.  The vacuum feature is very welcome in keeping trimmings off my clothing.  It isn&#x27;t perfect but is superior to any other I have owned.  I like the hinged door.  I just open it over a trash basket or the toilet and the trimmings are gone.  Very easy.  I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about this.  Unlike earlier trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, on this one the depth of cut adjustment has never slipped out of place.  If tragedy strikes again I&#x27;ll order 2 next time.</li>
    <li> had one for 10 year finely broke down and got a new one hope it last as long or longer but i am writing this under protest since i don&#x27;t think the seller of this fine product should be punished for Amazon&#x27;s poor choice of removing the sales of confederate flag and me not  buying anything else from them until they come to there senses and allow people to make there own choice and not make it for them</li>
    <li> The vacuum works well, if not perfectly and the trimmer is easily adjustable and trims well.  The vacuum systems misses enough hair that it&#x27;s still beneficial to trim over the sink, but it contains things enough that it can all be easily washed after.  Without it, the hairs end up all over the place.  The battery life is fantastic, the build is solid, and the adjustment settings are nicely gradated.</li>
    <li> This Norelco product is exactly what I was looking for in a beard trimmer. The guide comb works wonderfully and can be removed for toching up arond the mouth and other places that need a little individual attention. The battry holds a charge for a long time and the triiming is smooth and even. Just follow the instruction manual that comes with the trimmer. I look forward to years of dependable service from this trimmer!</li>
    <li> Great product. I enjoy the built in vacuum as it reduces mess dramatically.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco is easy to use and easy to clean. It has numerous settings and it can be adjusted while it&#x27;s running. The battery is rechargable and lasts for many trimmings. It&#x27;s fairly quiet, too, a plus when you&#x27;re trimming ear hair (if you don&#x27;t have it now you will when you get older).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all there is a lot to like with this trimmer and I can&#x27;t think of anything that I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is easy to use and fits well into your hand. Don&#x27;t buy this trimmer based on the vacuum aspect. That part of the trimmer works okay, but you still have a mess to clean up around the sink. So don&#x27;t think it will completely eliminate the clean up. All in all it&#x27;s a good quality trimmer that should meet all your trimming needs.</li>
    <li> Received package with the polyethylene casing partially opened. Don&#x27;t know if this is an issue</li>
    <li> Just as described. Sharp as a straight razor.........Prompt delivery. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works well and the vacuum actually does work. Doesn&#x27;t catch everything, but definitely the amount reduces hair down the drain.</li>
    <li> really surprised cuts my ethnic black natural hair great and chin hairs close and also when I wear my hair straight and I am a female I can create many short cuts</li>
    <li> It works great and trims more evenly than my last set.  The one drawback I noticed on my first use is that it is not ideal for outlining my facial hair.  The opening for the vacuum kind of gets in the way so you have to angle it in a way that doesn&#x27;t really give you the best view of what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations based on the reviews here in Amazon and the QT4050 delivered. The contour follow comb works great, making for a smooth experience without scratching my skin, hair pulling, nor uneven trimming. The vacuum worked as I expected, it doesn&#x27;t catch everything but makes cleaning after trimming very, very easy. Great battery life, a full charge will get you dozens of beard trims.</li>
    <li> I have a full beard I like to keep between 1/4 and 3/8 in long. This works fine no quality control issues with the one delivers to me. Can&#x27;t speak to longevity or durability yet it just came today and I used it once. It a little light and plastic feeling, but build quality seems otherwise decent everything fits tightly etc.. For the money this seems a well made product and I am satisfied. I really like that it has just 1 comb which is adjustable rather than a whole bunch of different lengths which could potentially get lost or misplaced. It is comfortable and easy to use. I found the vac feature not very effective, it got maybe 75% of the clippings but enough still ended up on the counter and sink that I needed to do a full cleanup and wipe down after so it didn&#x27;t save me any time. The comb comes off allowing for more precise trimming to get a sharp line if you want but I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a detail trimmer. After a few passes my beard is evenly trimmed and clean/professional looking so I am happy with the result. It&#x27;s quick enough to clean the parts come off easy so it can be brushed out but the teensy included brush is a joke, expect to be frustrated or find another cleaning tool (I have a better one that is left over from an old electric shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the trim it gives and the value. I would probably purchase again. I give only four stars though stars because the vac doesn&#x27;t really help much (I was hoping it would) and the included cleaning brush is seriously so tiny I don&#x27;t know why they bothered with it.</li>
    <li> The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is that the plastic clip on the hair trap broke after a month or so. It was very disappointing. I pretty much just tape / hold it shut while I trim now. Annoying, but still a solid trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am using this regularly and have no issues so far. Only complaint I have is, vacuum doesn&#x27;t collect everything. Recommending this.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for over a year now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The guard allows for a nice even shave with minimal work. Sometimes you do have to press hard on it.  The vacuum portion worked for about a month and now doesn&#x27;t catch half but no big deal.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I cant take the guard off to use the trimmer in tight spots like my mustache.  Overall very pleased.</li>
    <li> The idea of this is awesome, but its not what it is advertised to be.      -The Vacuum/ \\&quot;Clean free shaving\\&quot; &#x3D; Terrible, absolute BS.     *The vacuum filled up twice during each shave, making me stop shaving to go empty out the compartment.     *It doesn&#x27;t suck up all the hair, it probably sucked up 2/3s of the hair, but the other 1/3 of the hair was still all over the sink which still needs to be cleaned up.  It is absolutely no quicker to clean up 1/3 of the hair or all of the hair...      -The Trimmer  &#x3D;  Nice... Kind-of.     *I liked the quality of the shave.  It did a very good job of cutting all the hairs evenly, and was a comfortable experience doing it (the combs were well made, not sharp).     *With this trimmer, you cannot take off the comb so you cannot make clean lines with the shaver, meaning i still need a second shaver for this...     *Doesn&#x27;t work to trim your mustache.   The front of the combs is quite a bit further forward from the blades because of the vacuum that by the time the combs go up your upper lip and hits your nose, the blades are only half way up your upper lip, leaving the top half of your lip unreachable with this shaver...      Unless you want a half shaven mustache and no clean lines, you will need a second shaver just to compensate for what this shaver doesn&#x27;t do.    Botton line, don&#x27;t waist your money on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overall satisfied with this trimmer. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months now and it works well. The vacuum gets some of the hair, but really seems like more of a gimmick. I still have TONS of hair left in the sink. I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the battery life. I used it every other day for 3 months and only charged it once. The trimmer guard contours well to my face, and doesn&#x27;t stab my like the more expensive version is rumored to do.   Cons:   -I have to push down the guard with changes because if not it is not a consistent length  -Vacuum is weak  - worthless for trimming under the nose, I still have to use scissors  Overall still a good trimmer. If I&#x27;d known the vacuum was so poor I might have bought the more expensive one, or gotten a trimmer without this feature.</li>
    <li> This was is the second 7100 that I have purchased.  I like it&#x27;s utility and simplicity.  Now if I can keep it out of my son&#x27;s hands!</li>
    <li> My son asked for this for Christmas and loves it!</li>
    <li> By Amazon standards, 3 stars equals \\&quot;It&#x27;s okay\\&quot;.  And that&#x27;s all this trimmer is.  They stopped making the T980.  Chances are the one you purchased 4 years ago finally died and your search brought you here.  It works.  But it has no \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button.  Remember how you thought that button was pointless on your T980? Boy, could the Qt4050 use it.  The trimmer does indeed cut.  But the blades pull.  And it misses spots.  There is a vacuum, but I estimate it only captures about 60% of the trimmings.  Seriously, what&#x27;s the difference between having to clean up 40% of your trimmings and 100% of them?  I paid about 40 bucks for it.  I don&#x27;t feel ripped off, but I&#x27;m not especially satisfied either.  Perhaps money would be better spent on a nice trimmer without a vacuum, as the Qt4050&#x27;s vacuum barely works anyway...</li>
    <li> Very comfortable over my beard.  Trims nicely and evenly.  The vacuum catches about half of the hairs, but that&#x27;s better than nothing.  A nice bonus is that it uses the same charger as my 10 year old Norelco electric shaver, so I can take both my shaver and trimmer with me but only need one charger.</li>
    <li> Was fairly good value item so decided to get it.  Only use the shortest setting (1mm) and it works great with the vacuum feature.  Also like the flexible head which conforms along with the neck/chin curvature.</li>
    <li> Guard is a pain to take off, and even with it off it doesn&#x27;t work well for trimming things such as a mustache.</li>
    <li> one of the worst trimmers i&#x27;ve ever had, poor design and materials make it a chore to trim my oversized beard *without* the height guide. if you have a regular beard, it would probably work for you. otherwise, take a pass.</li>
    <li> For what I spent on this trimmer I expected much more. Dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature works pretty well considering this is a handheld trimmer. Its easy to empty and clean and the adjustment settings are pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does NOT do a good job trimming evenly. I have used $10 trimmers that have done a much better job than this one.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect to do any edging with the guard taken off, the design of this trimmer is such that the teeth of the trimmer are just about flush with the plastic housing so there is no room to edge your facial hair with this trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Trimming your beard, and sideburns is possible with this, although it takes a long time to get a nice even trim, but trimming your mustache? Forget about it. Again, a design flaw in my opinion, there just inst enough room for the trimmer to get the job done without hitting your nose and trimming the first small portion of your mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with the Norelco YS524 instead and this trimmer is MUCH better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money here.</li>
    <li> Plenty of power and the vaccum system works really well.. Pleasantly Surprised at that. When you remove the adjustable gate to trim edges the vacuum port is in the way and makes it difficult to see what your doing. An ear and nose trimmer would have been nice as well. All in all a nice product and the Lithium ion battery will continue to charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a very good beard trimmer.  The blades cut the first time and they provide for a very efficient and even trim. So why does it only get 3 stars? The answer is related to its primary \\&quot;buy me\\&quot; feature which is vacuum aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is pointless. Do not believe the reviews stating that there is hardly a hair in sink after using the trimmer. That may be true if you have it on the shortest possible setting, but on the longer settings the guard is so far away from the vacuum inlet and the vacuum has so little power that most of hair ends up right in the sink like any traditional trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, if you are buying this because you think there will be less clean-up go ahead and look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Runs well, good battery life.  Pulls hair on the longest settings, so consider its range to be 1-12mm instead of 18.  Vacuum performs OK -they will never catch all the hair so I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; fails within weeks of your first use. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as you&#x27;d like if you&#x27;re hoping to maintain a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the motor still works well, and it gives you a bunch of options for longer beards. When I had a longer beard - It worked great. Now that I&#x27;m looking to keep it closer cropped... not as much.</li>
    <li> The main issue I have with it is the fact that I can&#x27;t remove the guard so it&#x27;s impossible to get to the blade and even out sideburns.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift, and I&#x27;ve struggled through months of life with it because I know the person who gave it to me put a lot of thought and money (for them) into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But damn it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the time I&#x27;ve tried to live with it, when I need a really good trim (job interviews, funerals) I have used the same trimmer I use to shave my dog. Hear that Norelco, a cheap dog grooming tool works better than this beard trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 weeks into use, the LED display that is supposed to tell you how long the trim will be messed up. It now shows 1mm length when the adjuster is 7 clicks away from the bottom. I think that would be a 7mm cut. Anything shorter than that, the display won&#x27;t show you how long it is. You have to rely on clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway, because you can trim with this thing for 30 minutes, and not get a clean trim. Like someone else said, you can go over it 99 times, and still miss hairs. My experience is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum system is worse than worthless. It gets maybe 75% of the hair that does get cut, but that leaves 25% which is hardly any less of an ordeal than cleaning up all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of that, it&#x27;s very difficult to get the vacuum container part fully empty. You&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s empty, and then even a drop of 6&amp;#34; will pop it open and cause it to spill all of it&#x27;s contents all over the bathroom floor - which even if you thought it was empty, is stil a lot of hair to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even considering how all the good ideas turn bad in execution, it&#x27;s just not any good at it&#x27;s primary purpose of trimming a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You ever been sitting in a waiting room, waiting for a job interview and realized you have a path of beard the size of a dime that&#x27;s twice as long as the rest of your beard despite the fact that you spent 20 minutes diligently trimming it with the latest and greatest beard trimmer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Norelco.</li>
    <li> I really like this model, the vaccum sucks out most of the hair (not all) inside and helps me manage my sink properly. Definitely a good deal, and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I keep my beard at about 1/4&amp;#34; length, and it is of a medium density. Certainly it takes several passes to get a consistent cut --- but that&#x27;s another 30 seconds in the trimming process.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Vacuum Beard Trimmer Plus is a great litter trimmer. It works well, feels solid and comfortable in the hand, and keeps your sink mostly free from trimmed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a decent size (about the size of a TV remote control) and is shaped like an ice cream cone. It is put together well, is light in weight, and has a rubberized grip on the back. There is a spinning dial that you use to adjust the height of the cutting comb, which in turn determines the length of your beard. The dial clicks into place very firmly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it moving if you press too hard while trimming. The comb adjusts from 18mm to 1mm in cutting length. Additionally you can pull off the comb and use the blades to clean up the edges on your beard. There is a single power button on the front and that pretty much does it for controls. It&#x27;s very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the trimmer is a compact charger that is nicely done as well, with a little rubber grip. On the front of the trimmer, below the power button, is a battery light that indicates when the battery is low, when the battery is charging, and when it is done charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has a built in vacuum system that is supposed to suck the cut hairs into a chamber so they don&#x27;t just fall into the bathroom sink. The vacuum works for the most part but there are always a few stray hairs that make it to the sink. When the time comes to clean out the trimmer you just pull open the little door on the front and dump out the hair. It works well, but an older Norelco vacuum trimmer I have has a little drawer that you pull out. That system works a bit better than this new one, as it is a bit less cumbersome and messy. Lastly, you can also pull off the cutting comb, remove part of the blade assembly, and clean under there, but that does not need to be done often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use the trimmer is smooth. It never snags or feels painful, and there&#x27;s a spring-loaded part on the back of the comb that follows the contours of your face.  Volume wise, it&#x27;s not much louder than a regular electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about the trimmer I have is that it takes 8 hours to fully charge the battery, granted it lasts a couple of weeks between charges, but 8 hours is a bit longer than ideal. However, you can use it while it is plugged in, so if you don&#x27;t have time to wait for a complete charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a terrific beard trimmer that prevents a mess of hair from landing in your sink.s the contours of your face.

    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He has had two other beard trimmers that were less expensive in the past few years. We should have invested in one of the Philips Norelcos from the start. Zach loves it! He has come up to me multiple times to say \\&quot;Look at my amazingly even beard trim.\\&quot; Seriously, the other beard trimmers did not provide an even, quality trim. He looks handsome and  just well put together! And, the vacuum, well, that&#x27;s honestly more for me. I&#x27;m the one that usually wipes down the hairs around the sink. The vacuum creates a lot less work for me! Love it!</li>
    <li> I used a Wahl beard trimmer with vacuum for many years to tend to a full King Edward style beard, and bought the QT-4050 7100 as the closest equivalent I could find.  Overall, pretty good.  Comfortable grip, low vibration and relatively quiet.  It does a good job on the bulk of the beard and picks up most of the clippings as long as you are careful not to block the vacuum exhaust.&lt;br /&gt;  This trimmer loses points when it comes to cleaning up the edges with the guard off.  The geometry of the cutter head makes it difficult if not impossible to tell exactly where you are trimming and it is very hard to cut an even edge.  Also, when cleaning up neck stubble the cutter leaves enough peach fuzz to be noticeable.  This may prevent razor burn but is aggravating to me.  It is still early days, though, and maybe I can learn how to work around these issues.</li>
    <li> 4 not five or three  pros  decent vacuum doesn&#x27;t get everything but definitely cleaner then my old Remington mb200  nice easy adjustment with just one attachment  holds charge for along time  can use it while its plugged in if u forgot to charge it before hand  long battery life id say about five uses before u have to charge again  cons  cutting isn&#x27;t spectacular mb200 was better  cant trim the mustache well with the guard on&#x27; have to wing it without the guard  cant rinse the head underwater&#x27; which isn&#x27;t too bad since the vacuum is alright</li>
    <li> Love it! The vacuum might not get every piece of hair, but 90% of the mess is gone!!! The guard on the head of the unit is very comfortable as well. I am very pleased with this product, and so is my beard! :)</li>
    <li> If you are purchasing this trimmer for it&#x27;s ability to vacuum stray hairs as it shaves, then stop now. It doesn&#x27;t work unless you have 3 small hairs that are magnetized towards crummy vacuums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s trimming function works well but so does my 5 dollar rechargeable trimmer. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> + Impressive charge hold (I can use it for several trims between charges)&lt;br /&gt;+ Good blades/cutting action (No snags.  No heat from excessive friction at cutting blades.)&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum captures only about 60% of trimmings, so it is useless (still have to clean sink area)&lt;br /&gt;- Have to clean vacuum chamber in addition to typical clean areas (and since vacuum is useless, this is extra work)&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum nozzle/inlet gets in the way when trimming without comb/blade guard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for several months now.  I soon realized that the vacuum was practically useless as it only captures some of the hairs.  But the biggest pain about this trimmer is the vacuum inlet near the blades.  When I do some trimming without the blade guard/comb, that inlet gets in the way, and I am very limited in how I can position and use the trimmer.  That alone is tempting me to get another trimmer (WITHOUT the vacuum \\&quot;feature\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 5/10/14:&lt;br /&gt;The latch for the clear plastic door to the vacuum chamber broke.  Now it flaps around when I use it.  I will be getting a different beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> does all things you need</li>
    <li> Because of this razor, I kept the beard until February.  It is highly adjustable for just the right length... holds a charge for a couple of weeks and cleans up pretty easily.  The vacuum feature is about 90% effective at capturing the cut hair.  There is still some clean up involved.  I solved this problem by taking the razor into the shower and rinsing the loose hair down the drain. I suppose that the only con to this razor is that you cannot rinse it off with water as you can with other models.  You practically need canned air to get in deep and blow out all the trapped hair.  This is not a huge problem though.  I will be using it again next year when my wife starts missing the beard.</li>
    <li> very good, but think to purchase additionnal electrical adapter if you live in the EU ;-)</li>
    <li> EITHER I HAVE BEEN USING A TOTAL PIEECE OF CRAP FOR FAR TO LONG OR THIS TRIMMER IS THE REAL DEAL!!! VERY SMOOTH NO PULLING , NEAT HAIR VACUUM (DOESNT CATCH ALL THE HAIR BUT IT DEF COOL IDEAL THAT WORKS PRETTY GOOD).  I HAVE ONLY USED IT A FEW TIMES SO I CANT REMARK ON LONGEVITY BUT FOR THE MONEY ITS SWEET!!</li>
    <li> My old Norelco, non-lithium battery, trimmer did a much better job. (Sorry I can&#x27;t remember model number from 4 years ago.)  What&#x27;s to like about the QT4050?  Great battery life.  Does passable job of trimming my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like about the QT4050?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Poor trimmer settings:  The setting I use does not trim close enough; a notch down is too close.&lt;br /&gt;*Does not trim moustache line well With the plastic guide removed, the blade only cuts if angled EXACTLY right.  Even then, the cut is weak!&lt;br /&gt;*Getting the plastic beard guide back on is annoying.  Must be lined up exactly right.  Not forgiving at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy the trimmer again?  Would not.  (Appreciate any suggestions for another beard trimmer.)</li>
    <li> Everything works great and as expected, except for the vacuum. It&#x27;s not terribly important to me, but I would have rather them left it off since it only catches about 30% - 50% of the hair.</li>
    <li> I specifically chose this trimmer due to the fact that it has a built in vacuum in the hopes of reducing/eliminating cleanup. The vacuum catches some hair but still leaves quite a few all over the counter. I&#x27;m debating exchanging it to see if I got a bum unit.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a good job cutting my mustache and beard.  What I don&#x27;t like it that the vacuum feature makes it so that you can not actually see the blades.  I need to see the blades in order to trim around my ears and to actually trim the mustache just above my upper lip.</li>
    <li> For the most part I like this trimmer.  You can read about all the things it does well elsewhere.  The one non-minor complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t work well for hair that lays flat on the face.  The hairs on the front of my face stand straight up, and the trimmer cuts them evenly with easy.  But the hairs on my cheeks and neck lay down very flat, and this trimmer has trouble lifting them for an even cut.  I like to have a very short beard, so I use the 2nd or 3rd shortest settings.  I blame the plastic guard which has rounded ends that tend to push the hairs down as you move the trimmer over them.  More pointed ends would be better for lifting the hairs off your face.  Some people on here think the vaccuum is meant to lift the hair before it cuts, but it&#x27;s not nearly strong enough for that.  The vaccuum is only to catch cut hairs.  Also, unlike several posters have said, the guard does detach for guardless trimming.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair.  Only about  1/2 of it.  I got it for my husband, and he likes it though.</li>
    <li> I should have purchased the one with a digital display so you can tell what length you&#x27;re at. Also, the other model comes with a turbo mode, which I&#x27;m guessing is better for close shave neck hair, which this one just doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> this is a very good trimmer&lt;br /&gt;seems to work fine&lt;br /&gt;but the vacuum is some what useless&lt;br /&gt;50% of the hair falls in the sink</li>
    <li> Well, it does vacuum a little bit.  Still leaves a mess but the razor has many settings a works fast and neat.</li>
    <li> The last version of this gave me a closer cut.  It seems to be made well other than this draw back.</li>
    <li> Not that bad, only thing I don&#x27;t like is that u need another trimmer to line up your beard. This is only a beard trimmer and I hate that I have to carry to trimmers. Vacuum is really nice and the trimmer leaves a good and even.  Battery last for a long time that&#x27;s the best part of this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer yesterday and just used it once this morning.  My previous trimmer was a Remington that I got as a gift, and did not want to repeat that fiasco. I was aggravated of the easily moving settings and the lack of enough length options. I also didn&#x27;t like the several attachments that needed switched on an off.&lt;br /&gt;So far I love it.  Length setting system is very concrete and won&#x27;t slip.  The product is made with easy user features. If there&#x27;s one thing below par about it, it was I had to go over my face more than once in the same spot (but I have really thick hair, my burden), so I&#x27;m uneasy about the blade sharpness.</li>
    <li> My previous Norelco beard trimmer recently stopped working after about 10 years. The NiCd battery would no longer charge and it wouldn&#x27;t work when plugged in. I chose this model as a replacement because it can be used plugged in, and the vacuum feature sounded great if it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time today, and was very impressed. The length adjustments are much more precise with smaller changes between settings. The vacuum feature worked well. It caught about 90% of the trimmings. Unlike previous reviewers, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the door to empty the clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the trimmer without the guard to trim my neck line, the result was much closer, and the rounded tips were much less scratchy than the old trimmer. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit more difficult to get the guard back onto the trimmer as it has to line up properly on both sides. This is pretty minor, and I will probably get the hang of it with time.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use, cuts my beard the right length every time.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Stubble&amp;#34; should be removed from the title. Doesn&#x27;t go nearly close enough to be considered a stubble trimmer, although I&#x27;m sure it would perform fine as a strictly beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I tried a few trimmers I got from walmart, but they were pretty crappy. You couldn&#x27;t use it while plugged in, and had to wait for the battery to charge for 10hrs and it would last for like 30mins. Even the other Philips models they had there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is much a better quality. Vacuum is a great bonus. It sucks up most of the hairs, I still get some that fall obviously, but not nearly as much. Makes cleaning the sink much quicker and easier for me.&lt;br /&gt;I can plug it in, and use it when the battery is low, and not worry if it is going to die on me mid trim.  Still takes a while to fully charge, but it&#x27;s much better than other models I&#x27;ve tried. And the battery life lasts a lot longer than the other models I got from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustments are nice and just what I was looking for as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this. Good price, works well. I&#x27;ll buy it again if I break my current one or it dies n me.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas 2012 present for my son.  He is a neat person and wanted this&lt;br /&gt;to use as he trims his facial hair.  He was very pleased as it is of great&lt;br /&gt;quality.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well enough, quality seems higher than previous.  Only complaint is there are no markings on the length adjustment.</li>
    <li> The guard is really good on it. There&#x27;s less clean up with the vaccuum. I am really glad that I saw this product in a GQ magazine.</li>
    <li> the adjustable trimmers  are hard to find in stores this one replaced the one i&amp;#34;ve had for 6 years new and improved I love it</li>
    <li> It does its job well considering the cost. It is designed for shorter beards. I found it cut quickly and smoothly, but the vacuum feature was not great. It did suck in some of the cut hair, but just as much ends up outside the vacuum chamber and on me or the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4/5 stars because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to well and is easy to adjust.</li>
    <li> The battery life, power and portability are great.&lt;br /&gt;The length settings are a bit hard to hard to determine. To be sure of the setting I&#x27;m on, I have to click it all the way down to zero, then count the clicks back up to where I want it. It&#x27;s too hard to read exactly where it&#x27;s currently at solely based on the measurements printed on the side of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer gives a good, level and consistent trim. The spring-loaded guard makes it easy to navigate the tip of you chin while maintaining a constant length.&lt;br /&gt;However, the feature that I bought this trimmer for, the vacuum, is only about 60% effective so it may as well not have a vacuum at all. Even though a good portion of the whiskers are collected in the small compartment behind the blades, there are still about 40% of the whiskers that get sprayed all over your countertop, sink and floor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good trimmer...but if you&#x27;re buying this model for it&#x27;s vacuum feature, but that money towards a model that has the digital  length setting display.</li>
    <li> This trimmer leaves you a full beard. The shortest setting is far from stubble more like a 1/8\\&quot;. You can remove the guard for a closer shave. If you are looking for a stubble look this is not the one to go with.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco QT4050 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer to replace one that had interchangeable heads for each beard length.  One of them had broken, the all in one body is a much better design and the hair storage is a great addition, although its not 100% perfect. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try and consolidate my Wahl hair clippers and beard trimmer in to one unit.  The vacuum was a nice perk, and really fell in love with the idea while I was waiting for it to arrive, though my gut said it probably wouldn&#x27;t work terribly well.  Honestly if I had kept the packaging I probably would return it, it&#x27;s not really $40 worth of OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life seems pretty decent.  Kind of buzzy/noisy, but it&#x27;s cheap consumer electronics I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable guard with relatively fine adjustment helps consolidate my bathroom junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Trims hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I disliked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum is..a decent effort?  It&#x27;s not super effective to be honest, especially on heavier facial hair. Do not buy it for this feature alone or you&#x27;ll be disappointed, I still have plenty to clean up post-use.  I&#x27;d gladly put up with less battery life and/or more noise to have this be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a bit bulky, presumably because of the vacuum feature and guard adjustment.  It&#x27;s hard to get a good trim under my nose and at the back of my jaw line.  If you are looking for something to use \\&quot;down there\\&quot; you should probably look elsewhere, this will not be any good for nooks and crannies type work.  :-p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;ducting\\&quot; for the vacuum is in the line of sight to the cutting blades, making it a bit of a guessing game when it comes to where *exactly* you are trimming.  After a few uses I have gotten used to it a bit more, but I still don&#x27;t like it.  This is not for precision work, even with the guard completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Guard adjustment is pretty stiff, I have to use two hands to move it.  Minor annoyance.</li>
    <li> Love this set. I keep my goatee about 1/4&amp;#34;. This set does real nice job. Battery lasts longer then expected before recharge.</li>
    <li> So my last trimmer finally gave out on me after more than 4 years of use. I bought this trimmer because I don&#x27;t have to change a lot of adapters to get the right depth on the guard, just adjust the wheel and it moves up or down. I also bought it because it has the same vacuum feature as my last trimmer. I don&#x27;t like having all the trimmings falling everywhere in the bathroom. Although some still fall it&#x27;s a lot less than the trimmers with no vacuum.</li>
    <li> I had an older model for years , decided to update and am very pleased. Does a good job with no mess.</li>
    <li> quick shipping and I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Thevacuum could be better.  As a result, a small percentage of hair is scattered on the trimmer or the countertop,  Instruction book is worthless.  On the other hand, the trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little chincy/cheap feeling in the hand but this unit works great!  I purchased this mostly just for an eyebrow trimmer as my &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; Wahl sucks as such and the attachment they give you for brow trimming is laughable.  I&#x27;m a lazy bald guy who usually lets his hair grow out until it looks doophus and then breaks out the trimmers with no spacer but only actually shaves once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because I do own a nice Wahl for trimming my head but out of curiosity, I used this Philips unit to trim my head recently and was amazed at how well it did and how well the vacuum function worked.  I had almost a G.I. Joe crew cut when I did it, so I ended up emptying the catch well several times but this trimmer handled it like a champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can solidly recommend this product and can only imagine it would be fantastic as a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The brush that comes with it to clean out the catch well is a bit of a joke but if you have another lying around, all is well.</li>
    <li> A better quality cutting head would make this an excellent machine. Did what it said it would do for a pretty competitive price</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer, it has a wide range of lengths, while other allow only half the length, and the vacuum has excelent performance :)</li>
    <li> Recommended by Aaron Marino of Alpha M, I tired this out only to realize I love having a little fun every week or 2 trimming or even flat out cutting my hair in between haircuts. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a nice beard trimmer but it has some issues which drive me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Pros...&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum thing works well&lt;br /&gt;-Quick charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons...&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s impossible to use this without the guard on! If you are trying to line up your sideburns it&#x27;s terrible. Trying to take your beard down to stubble? Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;- Not super consistent when trimming with the guard on either, i always find a patch that i missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone. Go with a simple trimmer that isn&#x27;t trying to be a vacuum too!</li>
    <li> I bought the trimmer mostly because of the features. Corded/Cordless use, long battery life, vacuum. All of these work pretty well. However, it does not work very well trimming my beard. My beard hairs are thick, but my beard is medium density. I keep it between 0.5\\&quot; and 1\\&quot;. When it starts to get longer (when I need to actually use the thing) it is more likely to push the hair out of the way than to trim it. I have to go through my beard MANY times before it cuts most of the hair, but there are still long strands sticking out. I can also feel many places where it only nicked the hair, leaving it dangling, or split. After a year of use, I&#x27;m tired of following up with scissors, so I&#x27;ll probably move onto another trimmer.</li>
    <li> Not what I had thought it would be, I bought it for my husband who has very thick, coarse face hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does not &amp;#34;suck up&amp;#34; the hair it clips, a lot falls away from the shaver.  I will be sending this back.</li>
    <li> Overall the trimmer is ok. There&#x27;s nothing really special about it,&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Charging indicator is nice. It blinks while charging and seems to blink faster as it gets full and then turns off when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;- Charging adaptor will work on 110 or 220vac and is light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The vacuum &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; is not even worth consideration. Really, this shouldn&#x27;t have passed product testing. Sure, it will catch some hair, but your sink won&#x27;t be anywhere close to hair free. I feel that I throughly tested this on different lengths (with and without guard attached) and have found it constantly poor on capturing. The whole &amp;#34;keep the trap and pathway clear&amp;#34; guidance doesn&#x27;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;- The hair trap isn&#x27;t very durable. I&#x27;ve carried this trimmer around in my carry-on and the trap broke, and now won&#x27;t stay closed. Can&#x27;t imagine if I had put in my checked bag...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend considering this against any basic trimmer. I wouldn&#x27;t add any consideration on account of the vacuum. I&#x27;ve owned cheaper models that have traveled more, and held better charges.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on really shaggy beards very well.  And it&#x27;s a pain to keep clean.  But for normal trimming of short beards, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Does everything it was advertised to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I purchased this item and the price dropped a week later.</li>
    <li> very efficient ---you have to go all different ways with it to get all the hairs but overall definitely gets the job done</li>
    <li> After using two similar trimmers by Remington – each of which was good but had at least one serious drawback – I bought this one and it is excellent.  Good battery/charger arrangement, easy controls, and the vacuum arrangement is good and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> For the price of this trimmer (and the positive reviews), I was really disappointed by the quality of this product.  Compared to the $20 trimmer I had before from target, this one is far inferior.  Yes, the vacuum is sort of cool (catches about 50%) of the hair, but it makes the entire thing bulky.  You need multiple passes to get an even shave and if you&#x27;re looking for prevision, forget it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a serious manscaper such as myself, do not get this product.  I could see it being useful to someone who trims their entire beard to one length, but for someone who wants to also trim a goatee or sideburns, this product will only frustrate you.  If I didn&#x27;t already discard the box, I would return it.</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 norelco beard trimmers in the past, and this is my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I take the &#x27;guard&#x27; off entirely, to get the closest beard trim -- but the guard on this one is extremely awkward, it pivots from the top and doesnt really work.</li>
    <li> Works get! Neatly trims my hair leaving just the right amount. If I could find any complaints it would be that it doesn&#x27;t catch all the hairs in the vacuum (catches most and is still way better than having hair everywhere).</li>
    <li> I am still trying this trimmer, I wish it had a removable cover like my older Norelco I could go a lot closer for final trimming.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well. However, a tiny plastic tab broke off within a month--the tab that holds shut the door over the area that holds the hair. That said, the Philips Norelco customer service department was excellent. They shipped a replacement right away at no charge without further questions, and they provided a shipping label for return of the defective one. It was under warranty, but I was still pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I need to have my hair cut about every week in order to keep it long, but within military standards.  My wife loves using a battery powered trimmer, and when our last one broke we switched to this one.  The little vacuum cleaner works fine, the comb parts feel good and the adjustable settings are great.  The battery lasts for a long time and since it is lithium you won&#x27;t have to worry about it getting screwed up in about 2 years like those horrible NiCad batteries do.  Overall great purchase!  I look forward to cutting my beard with it here in a few weeks after signing in off of leave.</li>
    <li> This lightweight trimmer is all the reviews and descriptions claimed it to be.It trims beautifully, trimming height is easy to set and accurate, and the vacuum does a pretty darned good job. Amazon had it in my hands 2 days after I ordered. I admit that I&#x27;m not that picky about my beard. But my wife has not complained a bit about any aspect of THIS beard, which I&#x27;ve managed from the start with this trimmer. I&#x27;d buy another and would certainly recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Not good as  i expected.</li>
    <li> Works well, as mentioned in other reviews its true the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch everything but thats to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a good trim.</li>
    <li> Good solid beard trimmer. The length adjustment on it is easy to use and holds in place very well. The vacuum works surprisingly well. I didn&#x27;t expect much from this feature, but it has greatly reduced the amount of trimmings that clog up the sink. Also, the vacuum still works when you take the length adjustment piece off. So far, the charge is holding very well. One word of warning is to start at a longer length setting than you think you will need when using a new trimmer. I am reserving a 5 star rating until I have used it for some time and I see how well it holds up.</li>
    <li> Sucks up cut hair very well and consistently, wish I could say the same about how it trims. Misses most hair even after many passes.</li>
    <li> Not only is this thing great on the face (and other areas as well), but it has held up extremely well. The only thing to go on it is the little latch that keeps the door to the timings closed.</li>
    <li> I have two trimmers which i bought from ross for $8 , i have been using them for like two years. It was amazing. Then i thought of upgrading to  a bit priceier trimmer, thinking of it will do a best job than my $ 8 trimmer. Disappointed. $8 trimmer was way way better than this. The main purpose of trimmer is trimming, not vaccuming. it had a huge gap between blade and vaccum, so forget about the precision. Its not even trimming properly, everytime i try to trim after a week or so, i ended up taking all my beard because the comb and trimmer makes up botched up job. I know how to trim, i have been doing it for years. But with this trimmer, i had to trim like i shaved. skin became very irritating. I would have happily cleaning my sink for the mess that i make during trimming, but now, sink is clean not my face. When i received the package, me and my wife were cleaning up all the boxes that we have received from amazon from our previous shipped items. Unfortunately this was the one product i hated that i purchased, since we throwed all the packing of this trimmer, i was not able to return it otherwise i would have happily return it. I feel very bad that i am writing a review for the first time in a negative way.</li>
    <li> This is a decent beard trimmer, but the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t do what you&#x27;d hope. It gets some trimmings, but lots still fall in the sink, even if you trim off a short length of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only goes down to 1mm, not good for edging. The plastic vacuum storage door on mine broke so now it won&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
    <li> I use this as both a beard trimmer and head shaver! This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased and I will continue purchasing this product until the company is no longer in business! The settings are perfect, the sizer is great and the hair catcher thingee does its job! All in all, a great buy that will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I like this it is very convenient to use, it doesnt get 100% of the hair, but it does get the worst of it and makes it so much easier to clean up after i trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It has a vacuum, can be used plugged in or cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the Vacuum collection chamber is kinda small if you have a substantial beard to remove, it may require multiple passes.  The screen filter in the chamber is somewhat fragile so be careful</li>
    <li> PROS: Love the razor and the vacuum, works great, battery last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: A little plastic clip/catch on the door on the vacuum part broke very early on, now I have to hold it closed while using it or hair falls all over the counter.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for our son and he says it works very well.  Has bee pleased with the trimmer in all areas.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described. It was given as a Christmas gift. The gift receiver states it works great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alittle loud but does the job just the way I like it. The vacuum makes it less messy than the old one i had. I recommend this and it does not cost much.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my 5 year old trimmer that had finally ceased keeping a charge. Due to it&#x27;s built-in vacuum this trimmer definitely reduces the amount of trimmings that land in the sink. However, it does not eliminate them completely, which was my expectation of the vacuum technology. As a personal preference, I prefer trimmers that have length numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., whereas this one has the actual measurements of 1/8, 1/5, 1/2, etc. As this is just a personal preference, I did not lower my star rating for that reason. Overall I like the trimmer, just do not love it. But, at this price point I think it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Good machine! too bad is hard to trim the mustache under the nose.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers I found this trimmer to be harder to clean out than previous models with a collection bin that comes out completely. On the plus side, the length adjustment holds the setting much more securely that my older model. I use it to cut my hair and I can move it all over without worrying that the adjustment will slip (always to a shorter setting). I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to measure battery life.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve never had one like it.  The battery lasts for a long time and the vacuum really works.  There&#x27;s still a few hairs on the sink but nothing like before.  I enjoy using this trimmer.  It&#x27;s for the real men who have beards!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he uses it all of the time and seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for two months, and it&#x27;s functioned well so far.  The mustache trimmer is a little short on exposed blade, as some other reviewers have noted.  But it&#x27;s tolerable, and I have no complaints about anything else.  I appreciate the vacuum feature, which makes for less mess.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is great but the catch basin doesn&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
    <li> I have, per se, no problem with the manner this device cuts my beard, or captures the trimmings.  My complaint concerns the design decision to use a small plastic &#x27;flange&#x27; as a locking mechanism.  The material weakens over time and ultimately breaks off.  This happened seven months after purchase, and the company was quick to send a replacement.  I wonder if they will be so accommodating when the replacement fails in a similar fashion, and it&#x27;s back to holding the &#x27;door&#x27; closed with a bit of tape.</li>
    <li> Firstly I have to admit I don&#x27;t have a beard. How can you review this product without having one? Well you can shave your head. That&#x27;s right, in order to test this product I recently shaved my head with it to see how well this sort of product works with a full of head of hair while rotating around the head and adjusting to the bumps (like you would for a beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sufficiently to say the product did a great job when it came to this function. It quickly removed hair and didn&#x27;t get caught as it did it. I must admit it sometimes had hair stuck inside the razor which needed a cleaning every few minutes but all in all considering the amount of hair removed it did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, however, it doesn&#x27;t really do a good job sucking in hair to avoid a mess. Even on the final layer of my hair it knocked the tiniest of hairs to the ground instead of vacuuming it up. I honestly think that this product is worth it though considering the final effects. It isn&#x27;t too costly and gets the job done. With a beard it&#x27;d be fine as well.</li>
    <li> OK all you long bearded hippies, listen up! Your unkempt beards make parents clutch their children when you walk by. If you are going for the street person/ crazy anarchist look, fine, but if you want to be accepted in starbucks as a hipster, you need to trim that goat or vandyke of yours... that&#x27;s where this trimmer comes in very handy. This Norelco is very sharp and very adjustable. I was able to trim my vandyke from mountainman to hipster in about 5 minutes, including squaring off the edges and evening everything up. A few weeks later, it took me less than a minute to get it looking all spiffy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to getting this, I was using a haircut trimmer, which worked okay, but no where near the precision and ease in which this trimmer works. The vacuum function works well to keep the hair off of my bathroom sink as well. I highly recommend this to those still sporting facial hair!</li>
    <li> If if like the stubble look, this is the one you need.  You can adjust the length for just the right look you want.  A must have for the neat clean look.  It uses the good ION battery, for longer service.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer for my head... I used a standard Buzz cut type trimmer with a number 1 before purchasing this one.  (Note: a regular number one is the second shortest setting on this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum&lt;br /&gt;Battery powered - lasts a surprisingly long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum, although extremely useful, is not the strongest.... so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trimming with a shirt (hair clippings will get on your shirt and give you an itch fest)&lt;br /&gt;Mine had the hair cover break after less than a month.  I now have to hold it closed since it will open by itself if left alone while trimming.....doesn&#x27;t expire confidence in its durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve had it for well over 6 months and it still works fine (except that hair door that broke).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a cheap trimmer....if it lasts 2 years I will be satisfied with the purchase...and it seems to be able to last that long.</li>
    <li> Should be &amp;#34;merged&amp;#34; with the Philips Norelco Multigroom 5100, All-in-One Trimmer with 7 attachments. This works very well for me for beard trimming, but the latter takes care of everything else better.</li>
    <li> It is the best shaver I have ever owned.  I hope it never breaks.  I don&#x27;t need a battery read-out, or tons of buttons.  I want my face even.  And it does just that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! Easy to use and good for close trimming. Would defenitely reccomend this product to any one. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t trim as close as I hoped with the guide attachment, still a fine product.  the vacuum system is top notch</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older version Norelco shaver. First off the battery is great, it&#x27;s charge lasts a long time. Unfortunately I like to shave my beard &amp;#34;with the grain&amp;#34; not against it as the instructions tell you to. With this shaver the distance from the front &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; guide stays the same no matter what setting you place the adjustable guide at so shaving with the grain is not possible.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that if you are getting this trimmer for the vacuum feature, look elsewhere. After a trim there is a lot of hair on the sink. There is also a lot in the chamber so it is doing something, but it is not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand this is the best trimmer I ever had. The blades are very sharp. Once charged there is a lot of power. By the time I got the trimmer I was sporting a very thick beard and it did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard length adjustment is very easy to use and unlike my last trimmer it will not slip if I press hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really like the trimmer. It does a great job at the core function, trimming. It would get a higher rating if the vacuum was better since that is how it is promoted but still a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Pros, it has a vacumn so you avoid a lot of mess, negative, not the closest cut if you want that I need a shave look.</li>
    <li> my son wanted this the trim his goatee as well as edge along his sideburns. does well as far as length. HOWEVER he has problems with it when it comes to detailing them</li>
    <li> It feels solid and well made. The battery seems to hold a charge. But the design of the blade guard is not very good. What is the point of the pivot? I need to go over multiple times in the same spot to get all the hairs trimmed. The cutting blades are set in from the sides of the guard making it hard to tell where the trimming activity is happening. The vacuum only gets about 50% of the trimmings. And the little compartment for the trimmings is too small and difficult to open. As has been mentioned, there is not mustache trimmer. I had to trim with scissors after using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had previous versions of this product, it works great and keeps my beard nice and even. My only complaint is, the trimmer used to come with a small travel bag, which apparently is no longer the case.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I don&#x27;t have this as it was gotten for a &amp;#34;Christmas Gift&amp;#34; and the guy who now has this really likes how he can trim his beard and shave his head (that&#x27;s his style) and he looked into this Philips Norelco Trimmer for it&#x27;s capability and he is enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend getting the QT4070 over this model. This one doesn&#x27;t trim close enough. The attached guide comb makes it difficult to trim tight spots. The QT4070 gives a closer trim without the annoying pivoting guide comb this model has. They both have the same difficult-to-open shavings compartment and both will dump the shavings onto the floor if turned upside down. But overall the QT4070 is a better model and worth the $10 more. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this one.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to empty hair collector. Fast charging. Perfect replacement for my last model they no longer make. Hi</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations in more than one way: it did the job well (although I would not recommend to go for an important interview the first time you used it because cut-off hair needs to grow a few days before you are presentable for the interview!).</li>
    <li> I also use this trimmer for cutting my hair.  I keep my hair very short so it is very easy to do myself.  Just set it to the length I want and away I go.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Vacuum Beard Trimmer is a great tool for maintaining a full or partial beard and mustache.  It has a removable electric cord that allows for operation using AC power or to charge the battery in the unit for cordless operation.  This second function is very helpful because the trimmer cord can restrict movements while trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is a good looking trimmer with a flat black, glossy black, and silver plastic covering.  It has a clear plastic cover over a chamber for trimmed hair to be deposited by a built in vacuum device.  The cover flips up on a hinge to empty the chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head is unique with a hinged clear plastic comb that travels in and out with curves of the face and neck keeping the blades at a constant angle.  The blade can be adjusted for desired beard length in the following increments (inches): 1/32, 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 15/32, 5/8, 23/32.  The blades cut a 1 1/4 inch path, wide enough for efficiency in cutting broad areas of the cheeks and neck yet narrow enough to trim mustaches and sideburns.  Blades and rechargeable battery are replaceable by the owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn a beard most of the time for many years, and have kept it short, medium, and long to fit the occasion.  I always determined length in the past with an electric barber razor with a few available attachments.  The built in beard length determiner of the Norelco is very useful. Turning a wheel to the desired setting in the body of the trimmer guarantees consistent length. Trimming cleanly without putting down newspapers to collect cut hair is a real advantage offered by the vacuum and hair collection chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent beard trimmer, and the owner will not have to allow a beard to grow beyond desired limits because of the hassle of setting up a cutting session.  I accompany my wife on her trips as a travel agent, and the Norelco is a useful device in my bath travel kit. I highly recommend this trimmer to anyone beginning a beard or maintaining a beard, long or short.taining a beard, long or short.</li>
    <li> Works well. Good battery life. Pretty easy to clean. The vacuum will pull up about 85% of the hair. The other 15% will be in the sink. For me that works fine. I think it is unreasonable to expect a small vacuum like this to remove all the clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  If you work the trimmer slowly you will capture much more of the clippings. Move it fast and they tend to fly off in all directions. Also smaller clipping are easier for the vacuum to suck up, so trim more often.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, does what it advertises and lasts for years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had a problem like this but the little latch that catches  and holds the vacuum door snapped on mine after 3-4 uses.  It still works well enough, I just have to put my finger over the door and hold it down, but a more substantial latch might be a better design idea.  Shipped fast, works well, etc.</li>
    <li> I have never grown a beard thus never having the need for a stubble trimmer. I read the reviews and this seemed to be the trimmer best suited for my needs. I have to say I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I use the closest setting and find it makes my beard look extremely sharp. I love the vacuum feature. I get very little stubble on the sink and only need to empty trimmer shavings weekly. I also use it to trim my eyebrows. Can&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;s a trimmer that can do more.</li>
    <li> Overall I like the razor/trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:  I love the dial a length feature.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing or switching out a comb.  Just dial the length I want.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum -  As mentioned in other reviews it is not perfect but it is a LOT better than my previous trimmer which left hair all over the bathroom counter (which I could never clean to my wife&#x27;s satisfaction).  I typically give the trimmer a blast of canned air to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;It is not uncomfortable to hold and maneuver, just takes some getting used to as with any trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is awesome. I have not had to recharge the trimmer yet and this after several weeks of me and my two sons using it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Just one.  Unless I am doing something wrong (very possible) I have not been able to get the area under my nose.  There is a quarter inch of plastic surrounding the blade making it impossible to get the area right under the nose.  This is the big reason i gave the trimmer 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the reviewers who questioned the durability of the vacuum compartment door and the comb has to be lined up carefully to slide on easily.</li>
    <li> works great, vacuum is good and just have to be careful when opening the collection tray. It seems like it&#x27;s very easy to break but the trimmer itself is awesome</li>
    <li> This is one of those rare times when a product is BETTER than advertised. It holds a charge for months, cuts great and no stuble mess. This product is great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Trims really well and the vacuum feature is awesome! No mess. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I needed it to do. It replaces an older version of this same trimmer that I dropped on the tile bathroom floor and broken - not the trimmer&#x27;s fault. It still &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34;, but I decided to check and see if a new version was available. The only thing I had a little trouble with was that my old trimmer just had a number for each setting...I used Number 2. Suddenly the new one had actual &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; adjustments (7/8 inch, etc.). It took a session experimenting to find which setting was the one I had become accustomed to on the old trimmer, but once I found it, all has gone...smoothly.</li>
    <li> i like this compared to my other one. cut closer and also more settings compared to the other one. works great</li>
    <li> LOVE the vacuum feature.  It really helps keep the bathroom counter clean!  Does a great job working with the adjustable comb, or just the blade for really close trimming.</li>
    <li> Was a little hesitant about this item after seeing reviews comparing it to the older model, which I needed to replace due to a worn out battery.  But I find this trimmer to be in improvement on the older model - lithium rather than Nicad batteries, a bit lighter and easier to hold.  The shaving head and swiveling comb are identical to the old model, but the depth setting is much improved - stays where you set it, the old one tended to shift easily and you had to watch out for that.  I don&#x27;t miss the turbo function the old one had - it&#x27;s available on a more expensive version but in my use it added no value.  Assuming this trimmer holds up over time like the last one, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Great shaver    Pros: Cordless, long battery life, adjustable trim length, quiet, light weight, vacuum and container, easy and no hassle cleaning.    Cons: The container for clippings doesn&#x27;t come out like older models, it&#x27;s just a small little &#x27;door&#x27; you open and empty.</li>
    <li> A pain to clean. A few of the pieces broke fairly quickly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything significantly negative to say about this product (which is good, right?).  It&#x27;s easy to adjust and not only is great for trimming my beard, but also works just fine on what I have above my ears.  The vacuum mostly works (note four not five stars), but I&#x27;d never expected it to catch ALL the &#x27;cuttings&#x27;.  The swing door opens easily but stays shut while I&#x27;m running this device.  I like the range of settings and the ease of slipping from one to the other.  I&#x27;m more into integer millimeters than into fractions; the twist dial selector has both.  All in all, I expect this Norelco to pay for itself several times over during the next 12 months (no more barber or salon!)</li>
    <li> Works great on my beard.  Comfortable.  The variable length cut works great.  Holds a charge for a long time. It holds your stubble in a compartment for later cleaning.</li>
    <li> No mess my arse!! Not worth it! Doesn&#x27;t do a good job. If you like to spend triple the time it should take have at it.</li>
    <li> It was ok until the plastic latch for the hair trimmings reservoir broke off. Now the door of the reservoir swings open and all the contents spill out eveywhere. Not good!</li>
    <li> I will actually start with what I did not like about this trimmer...not much really. It is a bit loud and the vacuum could be a bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good stuff far outweighs the bad. Firstly it is a pretty good price as I compared several models and prices, and this one has a great value. Secondly, the vacuum is not bad, it just could be better. It still certainly keeps a lot of hair from going everywhere. It helps to empty it midway during a beard trim to keep suction strong. It has a good battery that lasts for about 8 trims for me before charging is needed. It is also easily adjustable for lengths via a small dial that lifts the guard by millimeters. This allows for precise trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning. I have had trimmers that work without the guard, meaning you will not be nicked by an open trimmer blade. This one was sharp so if you try to use it without the guard you could get nicked. It is no barber&#x27;s clippers but it will get you if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering buying a trimmer that is not just a drugstore throwaway I would go with this one for sure. Good price, decent vacuum feature, and easily and precisely adjustable. Definite good buy.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a great job on my face and also keeps the hair trimmings in the machine until I am ready to clean it.</li>
    <li> The little plastic binding wedge that functions as a \\&quot;latch\\&quot; for the whisker reservoir cover snapped soon after I started using the trimmer.  Not a major problem since one can easily keep the cover closed while shaving by placing a thumb over the cover.  Trimmer holds a charge for long time,  is easy to empty and seems to be a quality product.</li>
    <li> 1 year since I purchased the product and it works just perfectly - although the vacuum doesn&#x27;t remove all hair during trimming, its still worth purchasing for its quality.</li>
    <li> Love this thing for beards. Worthless as neck trimmer. Never had one that wouldnt do both. Not for close to skin trimming.</li>
    <li> Good but not great, it takes many times over the area to really get the length on my beard. Its tray fills very quickly and the charge doesn&#x27;t last long, although it does last a trim, some of us have to trim a 3 times a week, and then this thing is back on the charger. It looks nice and is compact. Otherwise this would get 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as closely as my husbands Remington did.  He wanted a shaver that captured the clippings and they was basically the only choice on the market.</li>
    <li> Compatible with my old Norelco trimmer, so I could use narrow trim accessory from the old one.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Vacuum gets most of the hair. Charge lasts a long time. Comb comes off for doing edges and trimming mustache.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this trimmer is not nearly as good as previous comparable models. The swing out door is a pain and the latch broke after about 2 months. Per Norelco, the warranty only covers the motor so anything else is not covered. I have had a few other Norelco trimmers and was always pleased, but like everything nowadays, quality is lower and price is higher. Would not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> The battery stays up forever - and cuts well.  This trimmer is versatile and lightweight though I don&#x27;t care as much for the fine trimming as previous Norelco&#x27;s.  As a beard wearer for 28 years I find this does as expected and works fine other than the really fine touch up trimming which is okay but could use just a bit of improvement.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has all the settings that you could ever want.  Trims evenly and the bonus vacuum makes everything neat and clean in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model ( T770) it was far superior in trimming, much easier to use the settings, was clearly much easier it remove the trimmings from the catch area. When I am opening the catch area , I feel , It may break off. The previous model slid out.&lt;br /&gt;Usually when a company make the next models, they improve them. This model  is a big step back!</li>
    <li> the stubble trimmer is somewhat weaker than expected&lt;br /&gt;could not trimm to desired beard length efectively to get a stuble of few milimeters  long</li>
    <li> I have used one for a couple of years to trim my beard...the deal that sets different length broke for no apparent reason.  But I liked it so bought another.  Vacuum aspect is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the trimmer for about 3 months now and I can say I am pretty unsatisfied. The only good part about it is the battery does have a pretty good life between charges. The vacuum does get a good deal of hairs but not all of them. I have a pretty thick beard and even on the turbo mode it still takes 5,6 sometimes 7 passes to get it trimmed and the guard is so bulky you can&#x27;t get under your nose at all. Somebody must make something better than this. This thing needs more power.</li>
    <li> I replaced a much older model after it finally would not work even plugged in. I was pleasantly surprised as how close to the original yet better this one is. True it doesn&#x27;t have a catch tray anymore but instead you open a door to clean but it isn&#x27;t really difficult to use. The graduated trimming guide is better than the old numbered system. Another reviewer had stated that the head wouldn&#x27;t come off so mustache trimming would require another implement. I bought it anyway. This proved to not be true and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Simple easy to use beard trimmer. I just received it and used it, so I will update this review at a later date.</li>
    <li> Works really well on beard hair.  The vacuum system is great for avoiding hair trimmings getting all over the place after shaving.  The battery lasts a long time without recharging.  It&#x27;s very light weight.  The trimmer does not irritate my face and it is comfortable and easy to move accross the jaw and neck.  Only con is that it is difficult to get at the mustache hairs, particularly under the nose.  The device reaches my nose before the timmer picks up the hairs above my lip and just below the nose.  All in all it&#x27;s a good, quick and affordable trimmer, but it won&#x27;t meet all your trimming needs if you keep a well -groomed beard.</li>
    <li> Definitely trims my beard just fine but the vacuum barely works.  Barely.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  The battery seems to last forever.  However, like I said, I would prefer a tighter &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; setting.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best that I have owned except it does not cut (stubble) close enough.</li>
    <li> So so. No trimmer which my old one had. It&#x27;s just okay...</li>
    <li> Very good product. Charge lasts a long time, I rarely charge the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustability is nice, many options for the perfect trim or shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside, it fell off my shelf a foot or two, and the latch to the door broke, so now I have to hold or tape the door shut. Still works great though.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. The vacuum sucks all the trimmed hairs so he was using it in and out of his bathroom.</li>
    <li> has a tiny fan that sucks up the hairs. It gets 99% of them, making it a much simpler clean up. My wife appreciates the clear sink.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of trimming my beard.  However the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work too well, it only sucks up about 1/4 to 1/2 of the hair that it trims.</li>
    <li> Honestly I was suspect when it came to buying a trimmer with a vacuum.  I had just bought a Whal trimmer that lasted all of a month and I wanted to get one that was comparable with my old one another Norelco that I had had for years.  Dont waste your money on the cheaper ones.  This one is probably the best one I have ever had.  It does what it claims and I would say that 90% of my stubble ends up in the vacuum.  Its surprising, but true.  I will never get another brand of beard trimmer.  I cant say for sure about this one, but my last one lasted over 10 years.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it says. sturdy, much improved model over previous philips trimmer I owned. holds charge very well, charges fast.</li>
    <li> While it does leave a little bit of hair in the sink, the vacuum preforms wonderfully and makes clean up a great deal simpler and quicker. My only real complain is the angle of the blades. It makes it a bit awkward to do precision trimming around the beard and they leave a strong stubble. However, they aren&#x27;t truly large issues so I am quite happy with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over 10 months since I purchased this trimmer and today is the first time I&#x27;ll be charging it. The lithium-ion battery was a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic flap feels a bit flimsy as I&#x27;m trimming but being aware of other&#x27;s poor reviews I&#x27;ve taken care to not be too rough with it and it&#x27;s served me well.&lt;br /&gt;I dig the adjustable lengths, letting you really dial in your favored length/look.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum doesn&#x27;t keep every hair from falling on the counter but it still seems to nab 80%-90% of it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great unit for the price. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> pros: Even though it is a Beard vacuum I use it to maintain my hair shaved and it is wonderful to maintain the bathroom clean graces it&#x27;s vacum&lt;br /&gt;Only cons: Vacuum Ports is too fragile and the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; broke after a couple uses. Not a big deal.</li>
    <li> My order came very fast, the seller was perfect.  The product, however, left a lot to be desired.  The vacuum on it barely works, and fills up quickly when it does.  It also doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much power as my normal hair trimmers, and despite its smaller size, doesn&#x27;t fit the contours of my face any better... After a couple uses, I&#x27;m left wondering what ever possessed me to buy it, and I&#x27;ve gone completely back to using my real hair trimmers, as they get everything in one pass, instead of taking multiple passes for a worse cut.  I absolutely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, and would sell it if there were any resale on such a thing.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Good, but the vacuum is not a good as I would like.</li>
    <li> Great product. My husband loves it. He has a very thick beard and does wonders for him. The built in vacuum is a great bonus feature.&lt;br /&gt;If i must say one negative thing about this product it is the tiny cleaning brush that it comes with shld be bigger since men have generally large hands.</li>
    <li> Was ok for about 11 months the comb is  plastic breaks easily now I have a crummy shaver</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Philips norelco beard trimmer and would recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I have had my beard for over 30 years and this is the best trimmer I have found. The one thing I really like is the vacuum on the trimmer. All the whiskers are collected as you trim and then you just empty them into the trash.. The one negative is the clip broke for the door where the whiskers are collected. Other than that, I recommend this trimmer to anyone who has a beard.</li>
    <li> I have recently had the opportunity to try three different Philips Norelco beard trimmmers:  the [[ASIN:B00HB2ARDU Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 Beard Trimmer]], [[ASIN:B00HB2ARHQ Philips Norelco, BT9285/41 9100 Beard Trimmer]], and [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco QT4050 Vacuum Beard and Stubble Trimmer]] models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three models look quite similar but have different features.  The first two models (5100 and 9100) have dual side trimmers that can trim your beard or be turned to trim the beard edge.  The 4050 lacks the edge trimmer but has a built-in vacuum to capture cut whiskers.  The 9100 model has a built-in laser that is supposed to be helpful when trimming the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the 5100 and 9100 models are relatively quiet whereas the 4050 is quite noisy.  All three products trim beards equally well.  The 4050 vacuum system works quite well and is a feature that my wife appreciates very much as there are no (or very few) loose hairs left over from the trim.  The other two products leave hair detritus in the bathroom sink and surrounding area.  This is the beard trimmer that I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, though, that the laser gizmo on the 9100 model is fun to use.  You remove the guide, press down on a button, and the laser pops up and casts a red line across your face or wherever else you point it.  I found it useless for actually guiding the trimming, but it is fun to play with in a transformer sort of way.</li>
    <li> Vacuum great for reducing a mess, but makes it impossible to create a straight clean line at the bottom of your sideburns which is a real pain in the ass.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this item per my boyfriend&#x27;s words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Good shaver. Would recommend!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, from my point of view, it does seem to catch most of the clippings like it says and he keeps his beard decently long.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, so far - so good</li>
    <li> I was looking for a trimmer for my goatee,that would simplify my ease in trimming my beard.My beard is too short for this trimmer.For someone with a longer,full beard,this might be o.k.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer replacing a Remington Precision which I had owned for 7-8 years. I dropped it and broke it which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I bought the Norelco QT450 and it has turned out to be a far superior trimmer. It trims smooth and even, unlike the Remington. With the Remington I had to go over the same area again and again to get it even. With this Norelco one pass gets my beard even and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum system on this trimmer has gotten some negative reviews complaining that it doesn&#x27;t vacuum all the beard trimmings. While that&#x27;s true, I would say it does get at least 90-95 percent. With my old trimmer, I had to put newspaper down across the counter and sink to catch all the beard clippings, or I had a gigantic mess on my hands. With this Norelco only a very small amount of clippings end up in the sink, and they are easily washed down the drain. It is a system that works very well and I give it a definite thumbs up. There have been some complaints about the door, etc. that opens to dump the clipped beard trimmings. I don&#x27;t see any problem with it at all. Simply open the door, hold the trimmer down inside the trash can and shake the clippings out, its that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might add that the different height settings are more than adequate for any length you might want your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This will not and hasn&#x27;t held a charge from day one! Good features but I&#x27;m thinking this item was sitting around for some time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Beard length guide works well and the cut hair vacuum works very well.</li>
    <li> It works very good, just as described on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This works great. Now if you want your beard hair completely off then you need another trimmer. This leaves a beard with a 1mm growth look. You can take off the top plastic part to get closer but still not smooth. Also, FYI, this works for a woman part (ahem) as well😂. Separate trimmers of course 😁</li>
    <li> Awesome!  My husband uses it to keep his bead at that oh so perfect sexy stubble length.  It&#x27;s the perfect way to maintain a professional look but still look manly instead of lazy.</li>
    <li> I have used the trimmer once a week ( 7 times) and it is just as advertised. not much escapes(2% max) onto the area below. Much better than without a vacuum catcher.Very satisfied with the product.I recomend this Norelco product.Purchased from Amazon,good price,good service.It does a great job also.</li>
    <li> It was delivered today $35 on amazon. I am ordering another conair I stubble even though they don&#x27;t last 2 years. The Phillips was very loud and left a terrible trim. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take to get it an even trim. I give up gonna shave</li>
    <li> A number of years ago I was in the infancy of my manhood.  I had an interesting period in which I thought about men&#x27;s style, facial hair styles, sunglasses, and what kind of cut to get.  Anyway, I saw this video on youtube about a guy who was pushing a specific type of facial hair style.  It was stubble.  He recommended getting this beard trimmer and I followed suit.  Since that time I have rocked the same style of facial hair, let&#x27;s call it season 5 Miami Vice Sonny Crockett.  I really like the style and the trimmer is what gave me the freedom to keep it going day in and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself functions very well and will do what you need it to, which is keeping a certain length of stubble on your face.  If you are using this to trim your huge beard, you may be better suited to getting some kind of hair clippers.  That&#x27;s not my game so I can&#x27;t point you in the right direction, but if you are rocking stubble, this trimmer is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge on the battery lasts a pretty long time, maybe 15-20 uses of it.  Then it&#x27;s just a simple recharge and you&#x27;re good to go.  I don&#x27;t see any problems whatsoever with the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts very well.  I will usually put it on setting 2 for my face and then take the length attachment off to shave areas that I don&#x27;t want any hair.  In this regard it&#x27;s very useful.  Some of you may enjoy having a slightly longer length mustache, and this will work perfectly for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one gripe with this product.  The little door that holds the hair compartment is so flimsy that the little piece of plastic that snaps shut broke off.  This isn&#x27;t a huge deal for me because the door will still stay closed if you just push it closed.  It&#x27;s just that it won&#x27;t snap shut now.  I really don&#x27;t have a problem with this but it&#x27;s like, why couldn&#x27;t they have just made that thing stronger?  It&#x27;s annoying if anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I think it&#x27;s a good purchase, and if you have stubble youwill love this.  Just don&#x27;t monkey around with the little hair door that much.</li>
    <li> I love it for quick touch ups as need and no hair fall any where with built in vacuum. I would recmmend to a freind.</li>
    <li> This trimmer came as advertised and works well. Easy to maintain and hassle free. One drawback is that I have trouble reaching right under my nose with this trimmer. Charges quickly and maintains charge for several days. Came on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> When my old Wahl trimmer died after 12 years, I was hard pressed to find a suitable replacement. I was looking for a trimmer with a vacuum feature, this model had that and it worked better than my old Wahl, that had been discontinued. It doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair, at least 90% which makes cleanup after trimming much easier. If you are looking for a close subbble trimmer there is another model which trims closer. This model suits me just fine and would I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Quality, easy-to-use trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is my third trimmer in five years.  The other two were a different brand, the first having NiCad batteries that finally would no longer hold a charge.  I replaced it with another, with Lithium Ion batteries from the same manufacturer, but they had changed the plastic comb that sets the beard length and I found it would not give me a good stubble-cut.  I tried modifying the comb, but with less than satisfactory results.    I am very happy with this Philips Norelco trimmer.  The comb pivots so it follows the contours of my chin very nicely, making for quick trimming.  The length adjustments are very precise and easily made.  I thought that the vacuum feature was just a frill - all I was looking for was a Lithium Ion trimmer with good beard height adjustment.  After using it I find that the vacuum is one of the best features.  I was so accustomed to having to clean up both the sink and my face.  The vacuum completely eliminates this nuisance, again saving time and irritation.  A small brush comes with the trimmer for cleaning out the compartment where the whiskers are held.  I recommend using it to clean that little compartment after every trim (and so does the manufacturer).  Pay special attention to the filter at the end of the compartment; if you don&#x27;t get that clean the vacuum will not be able to do its work as well.    Lastly, I also found that the trimmer works very well on my eyebrows.  If you plan to use it for eyebrows be sure to start out long and work your way shorter to get the length you desire.    A great tool, highly recommended and from a company that knows a bit about electric shavers and trimmers, having been in the business for decades.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst bread trimmer I ever had. I will cut this review short and list the goods (very few) and the bads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Large LED display to show trimmer positioning/height. (Cool to have, but very unnecessary)&lt;br /&gt;- Good vacuum, but expect 10-20% of the hair not be sucked by it.&lt;br /&gt;- Good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: (Don&#x27;t know where to start from)&lt;br /&gt;- Very un-smooth and un-ergonomic on the chin. I had to -literally- press really had on my chin and sideburns to get close to an even cut. It Hurts, and you will NOT GET AN EVEN CUT.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t have a sharp trimmer. Say you want to trim sharp your sideburns or the beard. It is virtually impossible. The trimming blades are not high enough for a sharp trim due to the vacuum opening. This is really annoying and you will end up with blending sideburns instead of sharp looking ones (like you are in Jail or something).&lt;br /&gt;- The vacuum is good, but not 100% effective. If you tilt it, hair will start coming off.&lt;br /&gt;- Bad customer service. The Money-back guarantee is a marketing scam only. I tried going for it, but you have to ship it at your own cost, wait for like 6 weeks, and then they will mail you the money back. Not worth the efforts and extra hassle honestly. I am not against Philips, in fact, I have another very good Philips head-hair trimmer, and it is perfect! This beard trimmer though is so bad.&lt;br /&gt;- It is expensive, at the cost doesn&#x27;t pay off for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, stay away from it. Very bad product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m skeptical when buying things like this online but I must say............I&#x27;m glad i did! My husband loves this and the vacuum works very well. He has used it 3 times now in a month and hasn&#x27;t charged it yet! Way To Go Phillips Norelco!!! Shipping was fast and easy!!!</li>
    <li> The vacuum works awesome on this thing, really makes for a clean trim.  Battery last a long time as well. Only complaint is wish on the shortest setting it cut a lil shorter and it&#x27;s a bit slow. Takes me a little longer to trim compared to a cheap battery (non vaccuum) trimmer I own.</li>
    <li> All I can say about this product is that the recipient was pleased.  I cannot rate&lt;br /&gt;the performance since I am not using it.</li>
    <li> Works great as a beard trimmer and I like the wide range of length settings, but do not buy this beard trimmer for its vacuum. I hated cleaning my sink from beard shavings every time I trimmed my beard so I bought this. It definitely reduced the amount of shavings, but I still had a considerable mess on my hands.</li>
    <li> Had a Norelco for a decade and after so many uses, the battery died on the old unit. Picked up the new one, it is as good as it gets. I use it on the lowest setting, it gives the perfect groomed beard look every time I try. The vacuum collects almost 90% of the hair, makes it easy to clean up after grooming. Simple and effective tool.</li>
    <li> As a beard/goatee/facial hair wearer for over 35 yrs I have owned many appliances to keep it from becoming unruly, and one of the main attributes I sought out in buying this was the ability to easily adjust the length of cut.  Some units give you various length guards to install but I wanted a positive-stop adjustability.  This unit is one of the few I have found that has that feature, and it works great.  The vacuum ability is a plus, but the opening for the vacuum is below the cutting blades, and thus interferes with your ability to actually see the blade making the cut, when doing fine trimmming work.  More experience with this trimmer will undoubtedly improve my results, but for this detailed work, I would prefer that it not have the vacuum port below the blade.  Otherwise a fine unit, and my last rechargeable Norelco served me for close to 10 yrs.....</li>
    <li> This trimmer works really well. I have a very thick beard and the trimmer rips right through it with ease. My only complaint is that even without the guard on it does not trim as short as I would like.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has blades that cut the hair well, but the vacuum is a bit of a joke, in that about 1/3 of the hair still ended up on my bathroom counter. I like Norelco brand products and will continue to buy them, just not this vacuum trimmer.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long but it trims my beard easily and with little mess, no pain.  Trimmer works as advertised</li>
    <li> The good : nice look and design, easy to operate, vacuum feature, good battery life&lt;br /&gt;The bad : when vacuum fills (it fills quickly) the hair start falling on the counter etc.&lt;br /&gt;The ugly : can&#x27;t define lines or can&#x27;t easily trim certain area (cheek, neck lines or goatee ares). I had to go back to razor for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good trimmer if you want to maintain same beard length and don&#x27;t require certain area definitions.  I will probably look for another trimmer because I need to maintain cheek and neck lines and I want to avoid razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit because it stated that it comes with Vacuum technology that will not leave big mess.  It turns out it does the opposite.  I gave three starts because everything else but vacuum works great.    Pro:  Works good, trims well,   Con:  Vacuum is horrible.  It makes more mess than my $15 trimmer that has no vacuum.    Don&#x27;t buy and pay extra for vacuum technology.  It does not work as it&#x27;s stated.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo7EGZBBCDLE8S]]The main selling point of this particular unit, to me at least, was the vacuum function and it just sadly doesn&#x27;t work well.  Couple that with poor performance in the trimming department, at least on the longer settings, and you&#x27;ve got a product that doesn&#x27;t work very well.  It took forever because I kept having to go back over areas, things clearly weren&#x27;t even and even on my second attempt to use it as a touch up it started to pull/snag hairs.  Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ It catches some of the hair&lt;br /&gt;+ Can be used on battery or while plugged in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Doesn&#x27;t cut well&lt;br /&gt;-- Snags hairs&lt;br /&gt;- It only catches some of the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short end of it, maybe this works better for some, but not for me, it&#x27;s being returned next week.</li>
    <li> Philips has had this problem for years; I don&#x27;t know why despite all the feedback they don&#x27;t do anything about it! The distance between the blades and the comb is just too much, even when the comb is set on the lowest set. I tried this trimmer once and it gave me an uneven trim all over my beard. Not to mention that the vaccum collects less than 50% of the hair leaving you with nothing but a hassle for cleaning it! I returned this trimmer the next day and got a Panasonic trimmer which works very well.</li>
    <li> I had been using a standard Wahl clipper with plastic attachments for YEARS to trim my beard. This would leave my bathroom counter and sink COVERED in hair every time I shaved, even with the bathroom trashcan on top of the counter right under my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After extensive research looking for a vacuum beard trimmer, I bought the Philips Norelco QT4050 and I am SO GLAD THAT I DID. In every category, this thing outperforms my old simple clipper with plastic tips. I love the way the dial in the middle of the unit turns and extends the attached plastic housing outward from the unit to provide a uniform beard trim without having to deal with attachments. The dial never drifts with pressure while shaving. It locks in to the length you want and stays there. I normally use the shortest setting and just shave my beard with that to achieve a stubble look, but I have also tried different length settings too and they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum function works MUCH better than I expected. Of course, the occasional stray hair will make its way down to the sink, but I&#x27;m talking VERY few hairs overall. The vacuum gets about 99% of my beard trimmings, which is a HUGE improvement over the old style clipper with plastic attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally empty out the little vacuum trap two times during a single shave. I could probably make it through the entire shave without emptying the trap, but for some reason it makes me think the vacuum is sucking harder when it has the entire chamber free of hair. However, I might just be imagining this. Regardless, it&#x27;s very easy to open the trap, shake out the wad of trimmings in the trash, and resume shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit doesn&#x27;t make much noise at all. If anything, to me it seems a little quieter than all of the standard beard trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been nicked or cut by the thing. It seems to give me a very nice and even trim all the way around. It should be noted that the entire head ofthe unit does slide off if you want to access the trimmer by itself to trim sideburns or get a close buzz without the stubble guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems strong and holds a charge without a problem so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the three months that I&#x27;ve owned this Norelco, I&#x27;m VERY pleased and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just shaved with it for the first time this morning, and it&#x27;s leaps and bounds smoother than my previous razor. Length settings are great, and comfort is perfect. Nice even shave all around. Vacuum didn&#x27;t suck up long hairs, but that&#x27;s understandable.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Especially appreciate the vacuum feature!  Good selection of trim lengths. My beard had grown fairly long (an inch or more) and this had no trouble giving me a nice even trim without having to go over the same spot more than twice. No irritation, just a nice clean trim.</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer to maintain the perfect stubble on my face with minimal cleanup.  Its a great trimmer for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean - the guard, blade and hair chamber all come out with ease and can be put back together with ease&lt;br /&gt;* Effective - creates the perfect stubble (around .5mm) on my face without the guard.  I can&#x27;t comment about performance with the guard but it should be fine if you want longer \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;* No mess - the vacuum captures 80-90% of the trimmed hair which can then be released from the chamber and washed down the drain in a controlled manner&lt;br /&gt;* Long battery - this device uses the same battery tech in modern laptops which means it has a really long battery life.  I trim my stubble every other day and I probably charge this thing every 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a full beard and like to keep it cut pretty close.  This trimmer handles it with ease.  Great battery life and I&#x27;m amazed the vacuum system works really well.  No issues that I can think of.</li>
    <li> I suppose this trimmer might work for shorter beards but I did work well for me.  Doesn&#x27;t effectively cut hairs and splits a lot of them.  If you have a longer beard my advice would be to keep looking.  Back to old school scissors and comb....</li>
    <li> A nice trimmer but I find that I have to go over and over more times to get an even cut than with my old Norelco! I definitely like the vacuum feature as well as my &amp;#34;wife&amp;#34; who now doesn&#x27;t get nearly as upset when I trim my beard. Also, when I remove the trimmer shield for a close cut around the ears, the cutting edge does not extend all the way to the very end so it is difficult to use for this as I did with my old Norelco. The trimmer adjustment is in &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34;clicks now a days for that rough look and this is the definitely the trimmer for those guys. As for myself, I don&#x27;t necessarily need that fine of an adjustment but it is not a hindrance either. I also like the fact you can use it battery operated, which lasts a long time, or if you forget to charge it just plug it in. I have been using Philips Norelco for over 30 years, I wish I could add some old features into this new design and make one heck of a trimmer!</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I have ever used, very good shaving, however, it automatically turns off after around 30 seconds of shaving, so in order to shave for a long period of time I will have to press the &amp;#34;turn on&amp;#34; button a couple of times which is kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> Really nice. This was the 2nd one I tried- the others went back as cheap, and tough to use (Sorry forgot which ine). This one is great after many months of use, and the vacuum actually works.</li>
    <li> Trims great, vacuum works better than I thought it would. Significantly less hair in my bathroom sink. I&#x27;ve used it 5 times now on one charge. The locking guard is great, cleaning is not a problem. After reading all the reviews about the vaccum door, I think it works quite well. Trim up, open the vaccum door, tap it out, and you&#x27;re done. I have no problem trimming my whole face in less than 1 minute. My wife is thoroughly impressed by my trim beard and my bathroom appearance. Had to rate it 4 stars because the vaccum could be a little better.</li>
    <li> My son loves it and that makes a momma very happy!</li>
    <li> I have to say I am very impressed and won recommend this to any MALE that is looking for something line this that is convenient and without a doubt MESS FREE. A MUST have.</li>
    <li> works ok, the only problem is that the lid to hold the cut hair is not closing tightly so you might loose some of its content</li>
    <li> Received this trimmer as a gift to help with my current &amp;#34;stubble look.&amp;#34; The trimmer works great, keeps a decent charge, and cleans easy.</li>
    <li> No trimmer is perfect. I trim my beard once every two weeks, and the machine doesn&#x27;t get all of the trimmings through the vacuum. If you want the vacuum feature to be more efficient use it daily. As for the trimmer, it works great! I love the adjustable guard, and the long battery life. On one charge I can go up to two months!</li>
    <li> To be honest, if returning wasnt such a hastle, I would have demanded my money back. The vacuum feature isnt as convenient as it sounds. Could just be my face shape, but along my jawline I find it challenging to maintain the &amp;#34;fresh-trimmed&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> I have kept a beard for almost two years now, and before purchasing this product I have not felt confident to trim my own beard.  Now, I can evenly trim my beard without having to make a trip to the barber shop to have it done.  Out of the packaging, this product is easy to use, the trim levels are easily understood, and the dial setting keeps the guard level from moving like on other products.  The vacuum feature is not perfect, at least not when there is a significant amount of hair to trim, but it does catch most of the hair...just be sure to be over a sink unless you don&#x27;t mind hair trimmings falling on the floor or counter.  All in all this product is well worth the price paid, probably more, and it is easy enough to operate that it is a must-have for anyone with a beard that wants to keep a neat and kept appearance.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love the design, but as others have said, the vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect. It trims very well and I&#x27;m glad I have it</li>
    <li> The vacuum sucks up maybe half of the hair trimmed. And because of the positioning of it, makes it an awkward angle for trimming, which has doubled my grooming time each morning. It&#x27;s okay for now, but I found my old cheaper trimmer (that I left on vacation) much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my cousin and because he speaks so highly of it, my boyfriend bought one too. He also loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  He loves it.  I love it because it has a vacuum on it that sucks in the hair and doesn&#x27;t fall into the sink.  It also is very easy to use with the easy slide to adjust the settings. Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco trimmer because I had one in the past. They no longer offer the trimmer so I went with the Norelco name and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The automatic trimmer head is great and one of the reasons why I purchased it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and I really like it.  Battery life is fabulous!  The vacuum works OK, not as well as the trimmer I owned before (another older Philips).  The variability of the length settings is great and the longer settings for a longer beard length are a distinction for this model.  The cutter works well and I like the brush.  I find myself combing through an area more times than the previous unit, but it&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;m quite happy with recommending this based on a couple months&#x27; use.</li>
    <li> Tired of cleaning hair out of the sink? Not any more!&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum on this works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Positives&lt;br /&gt;- Long battery life (I hardly ever charge it)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to use:&lt;br /&gt; - Don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening blades&lt;br /&gt; - Relatively clean with vacuum sucking up hair&lt;br /&gt;- The vacuum door (where the hair is stored) is transparent so you know when to empty it&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps your beard neat (even)&lt;br /&gt;- It can easily adapt to different lengths of hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;- Not all the hair gets sucked in by the vacuum and is found in the sink&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes the vacuum door opens&lt;br /&gt;- Find it difficult to trim the mustache area (unless the guard is removed)&lt;br /&gt;- I would like it be able trim closer (1mm is closest)</li>
    <li> We had one of the previous same models, it lasted at least five years. Needed to replace it due to it would no longer charge. It was always run down to &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; before recharging. This beard and stubble trimmer is perfect. It offers plenty of cut lengths and we loved the chamber which collected the cuttings; it worked very well and was easy to dump out into the trash can. It really kept the process of trimming so much more neat and it never plugged up. Get in the habit of dumping the collection chamber out with each trim. It is comfortable to hold onto. Winner winner, chicken dinner!</li>
    <li> I only used for two months and then the cap of the vacum broke and know it trows hair everywhere when i use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 9 months ago.  As of about 6 months ago the part of the door that held it shut for the vacuum storage broke.  I simply hold it shut while using it, and it still works.  It is true that this product will not catch 100% of long hairs if you have a full beard.  When I trim my beard it will catch any where from 70-80% of the hair... which is better than nothing.  Currently I have a little over an inch long beard hairs, just so you know where I am coming from.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use the attachment and are just clean shaving than this does a really good job of catching 99% of the hair, so long as you don&#x27;t over fill the little storage area.  For the price of this product this is exactly on point with what should be expected.  If this product cost anywhere near all the others out there, that don&#x27;t have vacuums built in, then I would be giving it less stars.  As it stands 4 stars is what this gets as it hasn&#x27;t failed me, and has reduced the mess that I have to clean countless times.  Is it perfect?  No, of course not, but its only 39 bucks.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer.  My one frustration is the lid on the beard trimmings.  It worked great till it broke.  When it breaks, then you have to have to tape the thing.  Otherwise, excellent.  I even replaced it with the newest and extra feature rich version.  I will probably keep on buying them.</li>
    <li> Have no issues, it is what it is. Nothings perfect but it was as advertised. Longevity is the next question. If it holds up then it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Nice Trimmer. Great battery life. Vacuum feature is marginal at best worked first 3-4 times then lost its suck (insert wife joke here). I will try giving it a thorough cleaning and see how it goes. Trims great, nice adjustments.</li>
    <li> all hair become stucked on the compartiments. difficult to clean. I will not recommend this product. see other options to buy.</li>
    <li> This trimmer gives me an excellent trim, and the vacuum system actually works, which I was not expecting. Other benefits are fewer, if any sharp remaining hairs left after a trim, which was a common problem with my Wahl trimmer. The only concern that I have with it is that the cutting blade is a bit recessed from the leading edge of the comb. This took a bit of adjustment to shave in the first place, but is tricky to use for accurate trimming of sideburns into the beard or around my nose. Not impossible, but trickier than I was used to.</li>
    <li> the vacuum traps a lot of the hair, but I&#x27;ll admit to expecting a better job. The charge lasts a long time at least.</li>
    <li> Very good value trimmer. Easy to use and very good value. I like the fact that it has a vacuum collector which most trimmers don&#x27;t. For buyers outside the US, you may have to separately purchase a power plug adapter for your country. Amazon could probably improve their service by including the appropriate adapter based on the destination address.</li>
    <li> this trimmer would be perfect if it was able to get directly under my nose.  The vacuum seems to work ok, with the occasional hairs falling into the sink.  The power seems more than adequate and the dial is sturdy and secure.  Very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying this is best for people who like short stubble, not those with beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Great battery life. No need to charge it after every use.&lt;br /&gt;+ Built in adjustable comb.&lt;br /&gt;+ Sharp trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Weak vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;- Not water proof&lt;br /&gt;- Not good with beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this isn&#x27;t perfect its a great deal for the money. As long as you don&#x27;t have a beard this should work just fine. Helps me keep between a 5 o clock shadow look and 1 week without shaving look constantly.</li>
    <li> Hubby really enjoys this razor. How nice to find his beard stubbles all over the pace now.  Might find a two or so, but nothing like before. Saves on cleaning drains.</li>
    <li> I have been using it 2 weeks with NO issues at all.. Charges, cuts, and vacuums Perfect.  I would purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> Performed well but it stopped working after three days. Philips responded immediately and dispatched a new item. Hope that this one lasts longer!</li>
    <li> Does what is suppose to do.  Very light, doesn&#x27;t feel solid / built to last.  Door that covers the stubble waste is a pain to open.  When I travel with it, I have to remember to empty it, else the waste can end up all over the travel bag.</li>
    <li> Great cut, vacuums well, easy to handle.  Would recommend to anyone who is going to purchase a trimmer.  A winner!</li>
    <li> This trimmer did not meet my expectations.  It tears out as much hair as it cuts.  It collects about half the hair it cuts.  You are better off using a home hair cutting with a plug in cutter and the plastic guides.  It may be suitable for daily stubble look, but is not adequate for a beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a year or so now and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The guard adjusts to the length you want with ease. The vacuum feature is more of a gimmick than anything, but it is somewhat useful. I&#x27;d say it sucks up about 50% of what it cuts, maybe a little more. The battery life is outstanding. I use the trimmer once a week or so and I&#x27;ve only charged it two or three times since I&#x27;ve had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if I could do it again, I&#x27;d still get this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for more than four years now, still works great!</li>
    <li> It dint work for me on day1. So I returned it and got my full refund.</li>
    <li> I have owned numerous Philips trimmers. They keep getting better, the vaccum feature keeps clean up minimal but is noisy. Using it as a trimmer for my mustache is disappointing, the older models worked better, closer, cleaner more accurate and neater.</li>
    <li> Versatile, easy to use, convenient.  The vacuum feature could be a little more powerful but overall, it&#x27;s still a great trimmer. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Christmas present for  my son n law and he just loves it! Daughter loves him more now because there is no mess!</li>
    <li> Battery charge indicator lacks information, vacuum catches I&#x27;d say 75% of the trimmings, adjustment is nice.  Nothing to write home about, but does the job it&#x27;s meant to do.  It&#x27;s better than the Norelco trimmer it&#x27;s replacing, but not significantly.</li>
    <li> Noisy but does the job.  Battery  hold charge.  I don&#x27;t know where the  &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; bit comes in but I guess it works too.</li>
    <li> The adjustable frame and the vacuum makes this trimmer the best. Might require certain experience to use though. I&#x27;m having a tough time using it but should be fine for anyone else. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and is one of best I have used.  Like the way it cuts and is easy to handle.  Only draw back is it is a little time consuming to clean if you are in a hurry.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Had the previous model but after a few years the rechargeable battery died.  This is the new upgraded version.  They took off the ability to use or not use the built in vacuum .....also their was not the mustache blade included like the previous model but I found that the old attachment works on the new upgrade...yea!  Also their was not a travel case included so I can use the older versions travel case.</li>
    <li> Maybe my standards are too high for a $40 device (is that a bad thing?), but after using the QT4050 for a while, I can honestly say that I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Here&#x27;s why&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - It does a good job of trimming at a variety of heights, but there&#x27;s no way to shave all the way - which means you need a separate shaver device just for that! (making the effective cost of this at least $60, plus having to deal with charging two shavers...)&lt;br /&gt;2 - The vacuum part only does a half-decent job. Sure, it sucks up a fair amount of the hair - but not all of it, so you still have to clean your sink either way. Plus, it&#x27;s pretty noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the battery life and overall build quality. Still wouldn&#x27;t recommend, though. Currently on the hunt for another shaver that solves 1 (2 doesn&#x27;t matter a lot, probably won&#x27;t get a vacuum next time). Will update when I&#x27;ve found a better shaver!</li>
    <li> Nice looking razor and works great.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a replacement for an older model that no longer held a charge.  This one does not trim my beard nearly as well as the old one.  It seems to leave my beard ragged and uneven so I have to finish up with scissors.  It does hold a charge for a good long time and the vacuum catches most of the trimmed hair.  Not all but the sink is definitely easier to clean.  Sure wish it trimmed better.</li>
    <li> Beard Trimmer yes it is, but Stubble Trimmer it is not.  If you want the stubble look, stick with Conair&#x27;s i-Stubble.  To get this to do the stubble look, you have to remove the blade guard/guide and it does not do it evenly like the Conair i-Stubble.  This should be not be titled Stubble Trimmer, completely misrepresented.</li>
    <li> very good enough although YOU DO HAVE TO BE PRECISE,but even so its still very good enough,it has a built in vacuum to pull most of the hair in,its charges and last a very very long time,and YOU CAN TAKE OUT THE BACK PLASTIC TOP NEAR THE CUTTER,to trim HOWEVER this will leave the hair very very small since it cuts very near the skin,very good enough trimmer kit...........</li>
    <li> Work exactly as described. In fact this was a replacement for an older model that I had for over 8 years, and it works even better! The length adjustment seems tighter, and more precise, and the vacuum got almost every hair from my beard.</li>
    <li> this is great!  cuts the beard nicely without pulling hair at all. every other electric razor/trimmer i have used in the past pulls my hair and is often painful.  i like my beard very short, almost stubble, and the lowest setting is perfect.  this is the first electric that i have used that cuts it short enough.  also, the vacuum is great and gets about 95% of the clippings which is better than i thought it would be.  my gf likes it too.  she likes how i look and how i now do not make a mess in her sink :)  awesome all around trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer. Gets the job done without a mess.</li>
    <li> It should have included the close shave cutter the original unit did. I kept mine but others could use this blade assy also.</li>
    <li> UPDATE - 10/31/12: I&#x27;d just try and go with another electric razor at this point.  The compartment that holds the hairs (that actually get sucked up) has now broken and won&#x27;t close completely like some other reviewers have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this product after dealing with the countless small hairs that inevitably fall down in every crack or piece of real estate on my bathroom sink.  Past electric razors have been ok, but I was hoping this one would avoid the mess while still giving me the semi-beard look on a weekly basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unfortunate part is that even with an emptied compartment under the blades, the vacuum is hardly sucking up anything and the hairs go everywhere.  The amount has diminished somewhat, but overall, it&#x27;s not doing what I would have hoped which was avoid the mess!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clean and easy to use.  First time I have used this type of shaver and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but it take a little bit long than my last trimmer did. Remington titanium, the motor or battery started going bad.</li>
    <li> Works great  just as reviewed</li>
    <li> For me, this is the perfect trimmer. The price is right, and it has a great feel to it. Others I researched had too many options; this cuts my beard, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. I love the measured steps on the cutting height--it&#x27;s perfect for my beard. I like the contoured cutting comb that conforms to my face. The vacuum feature seems gimmicky to me, and I really didn&#x27;t need it, but it works well nonetheless. Seems to hold a charge well. So far, I really love my purchase.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to hold, guard lengths are precise, guard comb is just wide enough to get a close trim and still feel comfortable against your skin.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  The vacuum function is very useful - makes a significantly less mess than normal trimmers.  Easy to use.  Seems very durable.  Expect this to last for years!</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard, and it works great. It is way less messy than the average trimmer because of the vacuum thing. It still drops some hair, but it is way better than most.</li>
    <li> The vacuum is not working well, I see lots of hair falling to the floor. Also, not impressed with the cutting speed.</li>
    <li> Norelco has been my favotite brand of trimmer for years. This model is, so far, the best I have purchased. I recommend this highly. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Trims very nicely, blades are precise and settings are numerous.  However, the vacuum function does not work very well, it only captures half of the hair, at most, and the chamber needs to be emptied frequently.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  I pulls the hair while clipping.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I especially appreciate the vacuum feature.  While it can never capture every hair, it easily gets 90%+ of it which makes cleaning up afterward a snap.</li>
    <li> Vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck well, which sucks. I always get stuff all over the sink and counter which I would expect this to mostly eliminate. The length selection setting is always perfect, however and the price point was good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. So far, it has been great. He loves the ability to change lengths easily, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave little hairs all over the sink.</li>
    <li> This type of trimme,r that has a vaccum on it, is hard to find and was so excited to finally find one of these. My husband had one before and it quit on him and he desperately looked for a replacement but had no luck finding one. I ordered this for him for father&#x27;s day and he used it and loves it. That is why I gave it 5 stars. We were well pleased with the vaccum feature and how well it trims.</li>
    <li> This was an awesome gift for fathers day, he just loved it! He needed a new philips Norelco, because he had his for over 10 years and loved it but it was not cutting very well anymore. I love...love..love that it has a vacuum on it, makes cleanup easy! Great gift for the men in your life!</li>
    <li> Like that you can shave while charging. The vacuum attachment is nice but does make it hard to do detailed trimming. However, for a general purpose trimmer it is great and allows you to keep a longer beard.</li>
    <li> I owned an earlier model of this and absolutely loved it.  Worked great.  Didn&#x27;t drop one hair in the sink. Battery died after 2 years. Can&#x27;t say the same for this one.  It works great when you&#x27;re trimming hairs that are short. I keep my hair buzzed so 90% of the time it works great.  No hairs in the sink.  HOWEVER, whenever I trim my beard it makes a mess.  I trim my beard once a month (maybe) so the hairs are much longer.  The vacuum just can&#x27;t suck hard enough. It also makes it difficult to reach hairs directly under the nose or close to the ear.</li>
    <li> great item-very quiet, cuts evenly and smoothly-shipped well, and works great-need to add nine more words so I added this</li>
    <li> Everything worked very well for this product. Highly recommend it! I would add that the vaccuum hair collection component also works quite well.</li>
    <li> I keep my goatee fairly short and this bugger works well. Plenty of power for cutting on a single pass. The vacuum function is more of a gimmick than anything, but i suppose it helps with cleanup some. I would recommend this if you have a beard like mine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace a model 4070 ( purchased two of the 4070&#x27;s in an effort to get one to work properly), then gave up and purchased the 4050.  All of this was an effort to replace a Model T970 that I&#x27;ve had and enjoyed for several years. This is a very good basic trimmer, does exactly what it is supposed to do, and was less expensive than it&#x27;s 4070 sibling, which wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few days.  This one cuts evenly with the contour head in place, regardless of where you are on your face.  It&#x27;s lightweight and the battery holds a charge very well.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bells and whistles (unlike the 4070),and the vacuum is only partially effective, but overall, it does the job very well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend, said he likes it a lot. Cuts well but is bulky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made of quality materials, well built, nice multi step design for hair cutting as well as beard grooming&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum a little weak and only works for small beard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: only one blade included which is detachable and would have been better if they gave you a 2nd finer one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Thoughts: For the price its awesome, but I&#x27;m looking into a similar model that doesnt have a vacuum but rather a shaver on the bottom</li>
    <li> The vacuum door broke pretty quickly, not that the vacuum did much.  It&#x27;s impossible to get a clean finish around the mouth or under the nose.  Everywhere else, even when I go over the same area 99 times, always comes out with long hairs the trimmer missed.  A pretty junky product.</li>
    <li> The Norelco I bought is simply worse than the old trimmer I had. It is harder to shape and trim.</li>
    <li> I like using this device to trim my beard, but the vacuum only catches about 2/3 of the hair.  I must clean the sink every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer... Can use it all over (except one area :-) ) without issue.  Buy a specialty trimmer for those sensitive areas and combine with this Norelco.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an older one and I am very happy with its performance. I works as advertised and is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but, the cheap plastic cover latch broke, I don&#x27;t use it that often either. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for decades but it may be time for a change.</li>
    <li> I like to trim my beard so it has a uniform length a bit greater than a stubble. This trimmer struggles to cut all the hairs of my beard. I constantly have to go over my beard tons of times to get all of the hairs.</li>
    <li> Trims nicely, is easy to adjust, and the vacuum gets most of the trimmings.  The battery is nice, too - I&#x27;ve used it maybe 6 times in the month I&#x27;ve had it, on just one charge, and the battery shows no signs of fading yet.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see a thing wrong with it, and should probably give 5 stars, but I just can&#x27;t figure out what to &#x27;love&#x27; about a beard trimmer.  They&#x27;d have to come up with something pretty innovative for me to &#x27;love it&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the vacuum beard trimmer. It has more length adjustments then my previous trimmer. Great to not have trimmed hair all over my shirt. New rounded blade teeth don&#x27;t stab me in the neck.</li>
    <li> After seeing high ratings and reviews on this product, I decided to try it. But, I&#x27;m not impressed. It does have several positive aspects: the length adjustment setting is well designed. Any length can be easily programmed and the trimmer will stay at this setting until it&#x27;s changed. The head glides very smoothly across the face without pulling or scratching. It&#x27;s a one-piece product, so it would work well for travel. However, it also has several limitations: It&#x27;s very noisy. Easily the noisiest trimmer I&#x27;ve ever seen. The vaccume function either does not work or is poorly designed. The commercial for it talks about &amp;#34;ending hair on the bathroom sink forever.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s not going to happen with this trimmer. You will still have hair around the sink if you use it. The vaccume function is very weak. And finally, the trimmer head; it does glide smoothly across the face, but it also misses a lot of hair because of this. I end up using another trimmer with snap-on length adjustors a lot because this one misses areas. All in all, this is an okay trimmer, but not what I would consider a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have broke the previous model to this and bought this as a replacement.  Works great.  Wish it came with a case.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with this...I&#x27;m not an overly hairy guy.  I&#x27;m no bear.  I use it about once a week to keep the stubble look going.  So, for me, this thing is perfect.  I have owned for about a year now and still works like new.  But now that I write this, it will probably break.  At least I know I have got my money out of it.  You should buy.</li>
    <li> The vacuum feature works and helps keep the mess of trimming down so long as you empty the catch chamber, but for regular trimming even this should be minimal.</li>
    <li> This is my second QT4050 Vacuum Beard Trimmer, so obviously I like it. The first one is still running fine, but the plastic tab broke off the door that has to be opened to empty the beard trimmings. I used my first one for several years, so I got very good service out of it. The big plus to this unit is the vacuum so you don&#x27;t have hair falling all over the place while trimming. Also, if the rechargeable battery goes dead while you are using it, just plug it in and keep going. I have only had that happen a couple of times because the rechargeable battery has long battery life and does not quit all at once. When you notice it start to slow down a little just plug it in for a few hours to recharge. I can highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> This is the first beard trimmer I have purchased.  As far as trimming it gets the job done.  As far as vacuum function, it still leaves a mess.  Maybe 50% less mess, but cut hairs do manage to get out.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would recommend this to someone else.  Again, it&#x27;s 50% less mess... is it really worth it?</li>
    <li> Bought this for my uncle as a gift. I&#x27;ll probable buy one for me too.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Vacuum isnt great for longish beards.</li>
    <li> Everything was Great!! Very Happy!!</li>
    <li> This item seems to work pretty well. Here&#x27;s a list of pros and con (yes, one con):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The vacuum is a GREAT feature, it really works and helps eliminate mess (if you clean it out regularly otherwise there is overflow)&lt;br /&gt;* Small, lightweight and compact&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts evenly and without leaving razor burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;* Definitely a beard trimmer as opposed to a stuble trimmer. It will only go so far with the attachments and if the stubble is already on the shorter side you may not see much with this without removing any attachment and just shaving it completely off.</li>
    <li> To tell you the truth, I quite like this, but it is not I use this shaver, the future ,i can give the baby.这是买给男朋友的爸爸的，本来以为剃须会很不错的，但是到手后发现，还是比较适合剃头发，男朋友的老妈说：这款适合国外的大胡子，黄种人不是很适合……想着可以给将来的宝宝剪头发还是不错的……感觉还是飞利浦的另一款三头剃须刀比较高端大气上档次……</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd iteration of this product over the course of 10 years. i use it to shave my head weekly, so it gets a lot of use. the vacuum definitely helps with mess, but doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t anything to clean up afterwards.</li>
    <li> Worked great... at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer takes a charge, wont turn on.  Battery light just flashes - of course, this right after the return window expires for my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Trims nicely. Hard to put back the guide.</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought this to replace an older version. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long. Vacuum works much better than my old one when it was new. The little cleaning brush I tossed. As it was worthless. Apparently it does not come in a travel/storage  case. I&#x27;m glad my old one did.</li>
    <li> Received on time and is exactly what i was wanting for a gift for my brother.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks A lot!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sammie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a set of Wahl clippers to get the stubble look going on my grill, but someone recommended this Norelco to me. I bought it on his recommendation and I wish I had bought one years ago. I love the fact that it vacuums away your trimmings as you shave. I&#x27;ve hated the cleanup afterward when using the Wahl. I love the adjustable size settings--the Wahl had a big box full of different attachments. And the charge lasts forever! The box says it has around 50 minutes of shaving on one charge. That&#x27;s like two months of trimming in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer...seriously, buy it.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit it but I have dropped this trimmer on the floor twice and it had no adverse effect. And it does what it advertises it will do. That alone is a high recomendation.</li>
    <li> Does a great job.  My only concern is the fact that, because of the vacuum function, it is wider than my previous trimmer.  Does a very good job of containing the hairs while trimming my beard.  I would definately recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> It picks up most of the hair when trimming my beard, making it easier to clean up around the sink.  It also seems to trim better than my previous bear trimmer because I don&#x27;t have to go over my beard as many times to catch all the whiskers.  I even use it to give myself a haircut every 2 weeks, can&#x27;t go longer else it starts to clog up with the longer hair.  Needless to say, I don&#x27;t have much hair to cut.  :O)</li>
    <li> Bought it instead of buying a replacement blade for the qt4070 which costs 30$, this machine cost me only 40$.. I keep it as a replacement in case my qt4070 breaks&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Trims my beard quite effectively and the vacuum catches *most* of the hair - but its awkward to use on my lip under my nose.</li>
    <li> good clippers, and the hair &#x27;catch&#x27; works marginally.  dont think you could use this and it will catch all the hairs it cuts.  this clipper works very well on sideburns, and areas covered by your bathing suit.  the dial on the back to get to the proper hair length works well.  although i find im always cutting the hair shorter then i wanted.  comes with a rechargable batter and charging cord.  good value too.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer.  I replaced an older Norelco with this new one when it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts well and isn&#x27;t insanely loud.  The floating head does seem a little fragile, but snaps back together fine when I knock it apart.</li>
    <li> easily cleans, catches lots of hair</li>
    <li> great trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sizes im unsure about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i turn it upside down the hair falls out, still hair in my sink</li>
    <li> The spacers are not efficient and the vacuum is poor, hair still every where but not as much. I purchased based on reviews that appear to be made up. Does not trim very well at all, you have to keep going over the same spot.  Disappointing. I wish there was a trimmer that had a comb that would pick up the beard and then cut it in one pass, why not, this is 2014.</li>
    <li> Love the product, wish it cut lower sometimes, but great trimmer for everything.... EVERYTHING.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to take the guard off for close trimming. The vacuuming works fairly well. It gets most of the trimmings</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the old one. With that being said, it&#x27;s as good as the new model can get. The door tab on the vacuum will break. Does not matter how gentle you are. It will break anyway</li>
    <li> Good and works nice to the price paid. I do not see any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to read the instructions prior first use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a fine job of cutting, but it is INCREDIBLY NOISY. I would strongly urge anyone who buys it to use ear plugs or some other means of safeguarding your hearing. It&#x27;s that loud. Seriously.</li>
    <li> this product is faulty. it will not turn off. and it spontaneously turns on. awful DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an aging Remington beard trimmer, and this has been a fairly nice replacement. The battery seems to last quite a while, and the vacuum system works very well. However, the contouring head seems to be kind of useless, and although the vacuum system makes cleanup easier it gets in the way when the guard is removed. It juts out a bit too far and makes precision trimming difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> Cannot make one swipe through the hair without it clogging.  Very discouraging.  Vacuum a neat idea, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco completely met my expectations.  Very good at trimming my beard and I really like the chamber that collects the trimmed hair for later disposal.  Also like the ability to adjust the trimmer.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This device does a fine job trimming but the vacuum is weak at best. If the vacuum is important then you might be disappointed with this unit. Very rugged, very well built. Not flimsy at all.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older model Norelco trimmer I bought in 2005 and which I lost while traveling. Wow! Big improvements from previous versions! Love the vacuum that effectively holds hair clippings, its light weight and the lithium battery that holds a charge sufficient for a week&#x27;s trimming.</li>
    <li> Adjusting the settings and emptying cuttings is difficult for those of us with arthritis.  Trimmer works well when setting are done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for several years, and occasionally it&#x27;s nice to not have to use scissors to trim it.</li>
    <li> I have had several trimmers in my lifetime and this one is my favorite. Its performs very well and the design guarantees an even shave. I like that you can trim while its plugged in. I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the vacuum but it actually works very well and it&#x27;s nice to not have the clean the counter afterward. I like the height adjustment too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son so I cannot provide personal testimony but I asked him and he is happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product works as described. I wish it would be a bit heavier.&lt;br /&gt;It trims nicely, but you have to pull several times across the same area to achieve a uniform length of the hair. I like the stubble-length setting (1 mm).&lt;br /&gt;I would say it manages to vacuum about two thirds or three quarters of the hair. While this is not ideal, the mess in the bathroom is smaller than without this function.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, doesn&#x27;t really catch all the hair.  Not bad though</li>
    <li> Purchased after my older model vacuum beard and stubble trimmer died on me.  It was also a Norelco.The old model just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I think I had that one for at least 6 years or more and I got my use out of it. This one seems just as good although the door to empty the hair seems flimsy so be careful. The adjustment feature has been updated and makes cutting to a length easier not just picking a random number and cutting by trial and error. I hope the battery lasts as long as the old one and I&#x27;ll be a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave very often but I&#x27;m really lazy. I use the stubble trimmer to make it look like I shaved recently enough. I&#x27;ve used this for almost 2 years and had no problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This thing looked great on paper, but it was poor quality. It would not hold a charge nor work properly after a full charge cycle... I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for over 30 years, had a few bread trimers. This is the best one of all. Holds a charge a long time. I use it twice weekly and recharge after a month never losing power. Very nice trimer.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s good quality and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had an old one of these that lasted years. On my older unit you could pull out the vacuum/hair container. This one has a door that feels likes its going to break every time I open it. Overall... works great.</li>
    <li> I like this guy.  Its convenient that there are no attachments, cause i always lose them.  It keeps my bathroom cleaner too.  All good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you totally wrap medium sized shrimp in thin sliced bacon, the shrimp will almost always be done once the bacon is cooked through and the fat is starting to cook off.</li>
    <li> Fair function; not as powerful or functional as the original Norelco rechargeable, but it is no longer available</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it a month and it works well. Keeps the sink area nice and tidy.  I do wish the guard was removable.</li>
    <li> Does the job well in all areas.  I&#x27;vd had it for 6 months and it still hasn&#x27;t needed a charge.  Great product</li>
    <li> There is nothing fancy here - this just flat out does a good job trimming your beard.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Have gone through probable anywhere from 7-10 in my life and this one ranks in the top 3.  Great for trimming beard over 1/2 inch and then some or keeping the stubble look.</li>
    <li> Suction is very weak and catches 50% of the hair at best.</li>
    <li> This is third Philips Beard trimmer I have had in 43 years. They all have worked great and each one lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer, but was hard to find.  I like the adjustments and that you can take the top off and trim without it for a closer look.  The vacuum works good if your beard hair is short, but not at all if your beard hair is long.  It charges within a few hours and stays charged for a good 3-5 trims before needing charge again.  Good for manscaping too. Glad I found &amp; bought it on amazon, but took over a week to get here, way beyond the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this. Have to go over the same spot many times. Can&#x27;t reach mustache hair under nose because the guard is so far in front of the actual blades. Vacuum barely works.  I have a much older Norelco that is falling apart that works much, much better.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Have had it for over a year and is still working fine.</li>
    <li> The Razer itself works great. I like the adjustable guard, and the blade seems to be nice and sharp. The vacuum is an awesome feature, it almost completely eliminates cleanup.</li>
    <li> works great, Li-ion batteries are nice, vacuum feature works well, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer.  Trims evenly and vacuum system works very well.</li>
    <li> Product is good but of no use in Australia without aus power socket.it sucks wn u don&#x27;t get one with ur online purchase</li>
    <li> As several have mentioned the position of the blade and the guard is just terrible.  It&#x27;s very difficult to get close under you nose, and other sharp corners.  I also have to run this over many times to get a decent cut.  I took the adjustable part off and its still very hard to use with the blade being in the position it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much hate this thing and would return, but isn&#x27;t worth the hassle at this point.</li>
    <li> Works ok. It could use a higher speed and better edge trim. This is my 2nd Norelco with vacuum and the 1st came with edge trimmer but the battery life wasn&#x27;t good. As other reviewer have said the vacuum dump door needs to be more rubust.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well for a short period of time. I mean that in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;1. It requires regular cleaning of the combs and blades in the middle of a trim (depending on length of clippings). Doing this, you get a good trim.&lt;br /&gt;2. The clippings door is a fatal flaw, and may only last for 6 months or so. The door is held on by a flimsy piece of plastic that weakens every time you open it. Leaving too much behind the door makes the vac less powerful. One can see how this doesn&#x27;t work out too well. I refuse to continue to use tape or rubber bands to keep the thing together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when there is nothing in the way, the vac will only catch about 40 to 60 percent of the trimmings it causes. Maybe it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this item in October 2011. Within 6 to 8 months of regular use, the door latch snapped off. When I contacted customer service, they made it a long drawn out process, including having me pick the broken part from a list of accessories (which does not contain the piece that broke). Eventually, they agreed to replace the unit, as it was under warranty. Somehow, the terrible representative felt the need to drive home the idea that it was a \\&quot;special privilege that they do not normally perform.\\&quot; What&#x27;s the point of the warranty if the company is condescending and prohibitive about honoring it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I got the replacement unit a while ago, and just now I&#x27;ve accidentally bumped the door-side of the unit on the counter. Looking the unit over, nothing seemed wrong but - of course - the door now does not stay shut because the SAME EXACT piece that broke off from the first one is now missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Norelco&#x27;s (durable) electric razors, but I have completely lost faith in their ability to design and support their trimmers. Rather than deal with Captain Condescending over in customer support, I&#x27;ll keep this (broken) one in a drawer in case I need a backup, but I&#x27;ve moved on to another brand.other brand.</li>
    <li> Honestly, one of the best trimmers I have ever used.  I have worn a beard or goatee for about 25 years now and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  For ease of use and convenience this trimmer is great.  More than enough trim levels and settings to suit anyone.  The vacuum feature works pretty well.  It doesnt catch every whisker.  But considering all my prior trimmers caught none, I&#x27;ll take it.  The one downside to this trimmer is there is no fine trimmer feature.  I can&#x27;t trim around and clean up the edges of my mustache and beard.  The head does come off and you can attempt to use it as such, but it doesn&#x27;t do the best job.. the head is a bit too broad to get into close spaces.  To be honest, the product description never mentions anything about fine trimming. Other than that, its an excellent trimmer.</li>
    <li> It trims my beard, and it does so consistently. The vacuum helps with the facial debris, but it far from absolves my sink of becoming laden with hair. Every other function works phenomenally.</li>
    <li> Cuts great, the adjustments really make a great shave. The plastic piece on top takes some getting used to. The thing that worries me is the feel of the thing. its very light but, seems very fragile as well. I feel if it was accidentally dropped from any height over 2ft I think it would shatter.</li>
    <li> I bought this one after researching the other Norelco QT series Trimmers on the market and decided this was the best bang for the buck. Was not wrong. This is a good trimmer with only one flaw. The vacuum is not as potent as expected. Some whiskers are still falling down to the sink/tub, but most of them are caught in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length selector is quite wonderful as it measures in mm not just levels like others do and it goes from a stubble of 1mm to a growth of 18mm. The battery charge is amazing, went over five weeks of weekly use and still had not had to recharge it. did it just to be sure it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars, the whiskers falling down and is a little bulky.</li>
    <li> I used mine first time yesterday. I agree with a lot of reviews on here that the side door latch isnt the greatest improvement. When you open it the hair doesnt fall out easily. I empty mine in the toilet. Anyway i use this to shave my head and goatee. Overall it works ok. I even tried it on the boys below and groin area and its ok as well if you dont get to close i am sure like all other trimmers i have tried in the past. I dont press on my boys with it so it cant grind into your skin. I learned that the last time from my old trimmer. One thing i dont think i like is when you take the trimmer attachment off to do your neck its almost as if its kind of blocked because the plastic is built up to close to the blade so you have to use it backwards but still it doesnt feel like its getting everything. i use that to trim some of my shoulder and upper back with and just felt like it wasnt doing much until i turned it backwards. And yes the vacum doesnt catch everything but neither did all of the others. So over all this is just ok. i like my other one better. To be able to pull out the cup and empty hair was better than having the latch door.</li>
    <li> I compare this trimmer with QT4021 similar trimmers which I own for many years. The QT4050 drawbacks are:&lt;br /&gt;- the minimum stubble length is much larger than QT4021 so I have to remove the comb to get shorter length, but the trimming feeling is not so pleasant;&lt;br /&gt;- not even trimming, some face areas are hard to trim at all;&lt;br /&gt;- the distance between blades and the comb edge is too large so it is hard to figure out where the trimming currently occurs, and this in turn reduces the ability to control the process. In addition due to this large distance it is impossible to trim some areas.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, QT4021 provides better solution though less glossy</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the vacuum works very well.  My hair still ends up in the sink and requires cleaning afterwords.  I think it should perform better for the money.</li>
    <li> This works perfect if you&#x27;re using this as a beard trimmer espeically for the stubbled look however wish it had a better trimmer to trim sideburns and to get mustache off of lip.</li>
    <li> Why I bought it: 1) the built in adjustable beard trimming, the ability to work plugged in or not (not all shavers can do this), 110v *and* 220v (darn important for travelers) capable, &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34;/trimming/sculpting and 3 out of the 4 work just fine. The vacuum piece gets in the way of the trimmer so I can&#x27;t trim around my side burns of goatee very well, very annoying (am still considering drimmeling off part of the vacuum piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not particularly impressed with the vacuum feature, it works but not all the great though that is not a deal breaker for me as that was not why I bought this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 because I really want the trimming to work and the vacuum feature is really touted but doesn&#x27;t really work, so 3 &#x3D; alright (for the price) but not phenomenal.</li>
    <li> The vacuum to catch all the hair works great and cuts well. Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have grown a beard.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact it has a vacuum built in.&lt;br /&gt;No mess with hair cuttings falling all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I clean out the trimmer about once a week&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the trimmer for over two months and not had to recharge it yet.</li>
