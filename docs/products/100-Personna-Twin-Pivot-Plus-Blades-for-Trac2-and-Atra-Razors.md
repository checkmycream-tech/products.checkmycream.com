<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Price on a great value blades fro my old track II</li>
    <li> This was a fabulous buy.</li>
    <li> My face now gets cut frequently when shaving with these blades.  Shave not very close, even with a fresh blade.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to what I&#x27;ve been able to find in retail stores. Fits my old Atra razor. Blades are sharp and last as long as any blade I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> At least so far, it appears that these blades work as well as the name brand ones.  I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Best value - great quality - very happy!</li>
    <li> They do what is expected - get the beard off.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and of great quality!</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Blades work perfect in my Old Atra.  With shipping works out to 25 cents a cartridge. In the tough times who can afford the Phony marketing claims of the 3,4 and 5 blades.  At these prices I can afford to shave twice if I really thought it necessary!  Got product in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> Great price! I was glad to find these as the local stores raised their prices on these blades. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Good blades at a great price.</li>
    <li> is an excellent product, just what I wanted as shown on the internet, right price, all very well, thank you.</li>
    <li> Razors are as described. work fine and the cost is a great deal. Only thing to complain about is the way they shipped the items in a priority envelope which would of been fine if they would have used some bubble wrap, but they did not and some of the razor plastic holders was broken and razor were flopping around inside. Most seem to be ok . Still a good deal for price. but someone should take a little more time on packaging.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price!!!  Bought about 10 packages; I&#x27;m able to use each cartridge about 2 or 3 weeks before changing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. Came in a timely manner, packaged correctly and is doing the job!</li>
    <li> 17.9 cents a blade, how can you go wrong? Can&#x27;t find them in Walmart or any place else any more. 8.3 years worth of blades for less than 6 months worth of fusion blades. Will reorder in 2023.</li>
    <li> Such good value but be careful.&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp</li>
    <li> I use these in a Headblade to shave my head and they seem to work well enough, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent buy.  The packaging could have been better as the contents were so very loose.  Fortunately, nothing was broken.  Nevertheless, I am happy with the razors.</li>
    <li> The blades were sold as new, however, they were not new they were re-sharpened and then sold.  Would have like more honesty.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Trac II blades and very reasonably priced.  So far I&#x27;ve been using the same cartridge for two weeks and still getting a good shave.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a daily shaver and consider myself to have a medium coarse beard and average sensitivity skin. I have been a Trac II user for thirty years and the prices were really becoming insulting. I found these and decided to give them a try. Glad I did. Very glad indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smooth and CLOSE shave 5/5&lt;br /&gt;2. No nicks 5/5&lt;br /&gt;3. Lube strip is super slippery lotion 5/5&lt;br /&gt;4. The design (twin plus pivot) PREVENTS load up. The gap between the blades is bigger than the Wilkinson brand  and the hollow channel behind and below them allows for easy cleaning whith a swish in the sink. 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At approximately .20 cents each, I am 100% satisfied and extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE.. RAZORS ARE GOOD QUALITY..</li>
    <li> Walmart used to carry Wilkenson Swords that I used to use, but these are cheaper and better.  I use these in my Headblade to shave my head daily and I get 3-4 uses out of each one, and at this price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I researched these as they were supposed to be compatible with my headblade razor. They are and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of the cartridge and the smooth shave that they give. I will now buy these over the Gillette every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor provides good communication and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying in bulk provides an excellent price. I strongly suggest trying them. You&#x27;ll be happy with the great shaves, it&#x27;s sold by a great vendor, and you will be ecstatic about the cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal. The only better deal is the bulk blades. Been using these blades for 40 plus years and hate all others</li>
    <li> First, I think these blades are exactly the same as those advertised as being Personna TwinII Plus; both fit my old razor. This is a great deal. I have just begun using these blades, and their cost, even including the shipping charge, is only about 1/20 what similar blades would cost me locally. I don&#x27;t understand either how these blades can be so inexpensive, or how such blades can cost so much locally here.</li>
    <li> works as well as brand atra blades ---- does not come in any manufactor packageing stating personna --- but shaves as well as personna blades I used to get at walmart,  so whether or not they are personna they shave very well,  i will buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for...inexpensive blades that dull quickly.</li>
    <li> because the seller might raise the price, but truth be known, I believe it&#x27;s the best value I&#x27;ve ever seen on Amazon.  The price is marvelous, the blades are sharp, they last at least as long as others, and because of its design the plastic cartridge doesn&#x27;t clog like others do.</li>
    <li> great product for the money</li>
    <li> Great value, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to swivel as freely as the Gillette Atra heads, perhaps because of the connection for Trac II razors.</li>
    <li> Outstanding, it still works</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying $8-14 for just ten razors at the supermarket that&#x27;s when I looked for something like this. This was a great deal for me. They fit the only razor i have ever used... it was the one i got from my dad. That&#x27;s why I continued to pay so much, but now I love it because I have found this great amazon deal.</li>
    <li> Works as well as name brand for way cheaper.</li>
    <li> If you properly prep your beard before shaving one of these blade may last a month or more. This doesn&#x27;t happen w/ the malty blade type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as there still available I will keep using them.</li>
    <li> Just kidding. Good blades, much cheaper than the previous blades I was using. Should last me a good while. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for years and they work just fine. You occasionally get one that isn&#x27;t as sharp as the others but at this price, who cares? (Compare to the genuine Gillette product that costs over $1 per head - rip-off!!)</li>
    <li> This was the perfect item I was looking for at a great, low price that I could not find in my local stores.</li>
    <li> I hate to tell you how great these blades are...you might buy them and then there wouldn&#x27;t be any for me!  I have a tough beard and most blades wear out in three days.  These are still sharp after seven shaves!  Remarkable.  If you need some good blades that last, these are the ones for you.</li>
    <li> Great value at these prices.</li>
    <li> If you cringe at the thought of spending for Atra Blades  these are a reasonable blade at a much cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Great price for 100 razors. The razors give a great shave. I will buy these razors again. 5 stars.. These razors work for me.</li>
    <li> I just ran out of my plain atra blades that I had bought a small stash of 8 years ago. I shave a couple times a week and a blade lasts me at least 1 month, sometimes 2.....I get about 10 to 12 shaves per blade.....my skin is somewhat sensitive, and beard is medium. These blades took me by surprise as they are as good as the atra blades(which I had bought in bulk) I just replaced....no kidding. And paying what I paid.....these are a steal. Why would I go out and buy one of those triple or five bladed creatures just to do exactly the same shave but at 18 times the money? I got sent a fusion proglide, and yes, I have to admit it was a little better, but not 18 times.....really. No cuts, no nicks.....so I have no reason to switch. These are good blades at an extremely fair price. If you have ultra sensitive skin, I can understand why you might want to pay for an ultimate shave, but I will take my green to the bank....tyvm!</li>
    <li> works well with handle</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass up the savings these blades represent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost 5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Shave 3 out of 5  -  There is far more plastic around the blades then the Atra blades so getting the whiskers under my nose is difficult and judging side burn trimming might take a couple of passes. Blade angle seems to nick me more often then the Atra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Fits Atra Razor -  5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Number of shaves vs. Atra 4 out of 5 -  I get three (3) GOOD shaves from these verses four (4) GOOD shaves from the Atra blades. I push 3 more from these Personna blades and get about the same last shave with the 8th use from the Gillette Atra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17 points divided by 4 &#x3D; 4.25 stars</li>
    <li> Blades are of same quality as the hard to find store brands.  Should last a couple of years!  Fits my Atra very well.</li>
    <li> Blades were delivered in a timely manner. Quality of blades was impressive. I&#x27;d been paying much more for five packs of nationally advertised blades. Don&#x27;t need blades with a lot of slick bells and whistles. Just need a blade that will provide me a close comfortable shave at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Sorry to be the downer in this garden of great reviews, but I received my blades loose, held together by a red rubber band and in an open  plastic bag.  The first shave left me with more cuts and razor burn than I&#x27;ve had in total in the  last ten years. I should add that I&#x27;ve used Trac II blades regularly for many years and liked them very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe, with all these great reviews, that what I got was representative of what other people have been getting-so this is just a warning: if you get the packing that looks like something someone threw away, be very careful shaving with the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, Amazon customer support could not have been more helpful...I hope their culture never changes.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO BUY THESE!  Same as the ones you pay three times the price for in the store.  DO NOT, buy them anywhere else!  Amazon rules!</li>
    <li> Got them as a gift for my dad and he loves them!</li>
    <li> I bought the razor to go with these blades off of Amazon for like $5 And I got a hundred razors for $20 There is no way to beat that</li>
    <li> If you art still a track II user these work well and are very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> for the price these razors were excellent. Have recommended your product and website to others to but online It was easy and convinent.</li>
    <li> Like shaving with a lawn mower blade. A very dull one. And rusty. These blades fit my razor just fine and they appeared to be the real thing, but shaving with them produced a bloody scene straight from Freddy Kruger. I tried three different blades over six shaves -- same result. I&#x27;ve updated my review to two stars since the vendor readily refunded my money upon returning the unused blades. Better to buy third-party brands at CVS or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> These are so economical and loved the free shipping!</li>
    <li> This Transaction Personna Twin Pivot Plus 100 (replaces Auto Plus) Altra Razors  did meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I would proberly buy again.</li>
    <li> The blades are as sharp (if not sharper) as any that cost much more, but the depth of the razor cut is more then others (been using track II since they were made). In other words the space from plastic to blade tip is more then others. It will cut hair better then others, it will also cut you just as quick. Slow down and use less pressure or you will be a bloody mess. I have not been happy with price or quality from other blades lately but I believe I am going to like these if I could just stop bleeding.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great deal for blades this is it! They stay sharp for at least a week or more. These work as well as the name brand blades definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> Excellent products; great quality and terrific volume of product.  The item arrive in a very short while after ordering.  I am very pleased</li>
    <li> Great value. As described.</li>
    <li> These blades are at least as good as Gillette Atra Plus, if not better. In fact feels like a more comfortable and closer shave than Gillette. Amazing deal, super lightening fast shipment practically arrived before I even ordered it. A+</li>
    <li> Very good blades.  As good as Atra blades, and at a fraction of the cost.  Don&#x27;t let suspect looking display on Amazon turn you off; They work well.</li>
    <li> Been looking for the no name brand.  I was in the military and bought similar under the exchange brand.  These will keep me in stock fro a while,  I basically use one a week.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I look for these everywhere and can not find them. I find them here and for a great price. They work great and the price is the best to be found.  I will have blades for a while.</li>
    <li> I would buy these all the time at Walmart but they stopped carrying them.  They are less expensive than the name brand and they work just as good.  What a bargan for 100 of them,  I wont have to buy them for a while unless my husband starts using them.</li>
    <li> amazing razors for the price. not quite like my sensor, but at 13 cents a cartridge .......  i am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I thought I had waited a little too long to re-order a replacement batch  of blades, but Amazon was very prompt in getting my re-supply</li>
    <li> It is difficult to locate blades for the older Trac 2 blades in the box stores and I had to research these to find the best price. Well, here they are.</li>
    <li> If you go to any store you&#x27;ll pay the same amount for 10 or so of these blades. Getting 100 of these blades is an incredible buy for $10 and so far they work just fine.</li>
    <li> Worst blades I have ever tried. I know they didn&#x27;t cost much but you would think they could make a better blade than these. Pure torture getting through the first shave. I would grow a full beard if these were the only blades available. Never again....I sent the other 99 back for a refund.</li>
    <li> These blades provide an excellent shave and I was happy to get 100 of them at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Personna razor cartridges get 4 star rating.  They work pretty good and much cheaper than Gillette.  Get four or five shaves per cartridge.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time today and shaved today with my first one, Great Blade!  These cost about $0.15 per blade which is D/E blade cost so for any cart on the market this is very, very inexpensive.  All were well made, in good shape, and look brand new.  The shave was as good as any I have gotten from Gillette Trac II, smooth, close, no nicks or cuts and no irritation.  At this price if I get 4-or-more shaves I&#x27;m happy, but I expect to get about 6 - 7 shaves.  If I only get four shaves per blade I have enough carts for a year.  That&#x27;s almost Uncle McScrooge good:) I&#x27;ve loved the trac II type razor since 1974 and am very happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;No pack, just in an envelope wrapped in some magazine ad paper and held together with rubber bands and if that keeps the cost down I&#x27;m cool.  The plastic cart dispensers are brand new looking and in good shape.  I put my first one on a Col. Conk gold tone trac II handle and it fit great so I know it&#x27;ll fit my Gillette, Schick and no-name Trac II handle.&lt;br /&gt;Shaved with the grain and then wet my face, applied some Poraso pre-shave and did some quick touch up for a BBS shave and again: No nicks, cuts or razor burn.  Fast shaving and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wrote Personna and asked about their twin pivot plus blades and received a response that basically said they have no plans to stop making these blades as they are one of their biggest selling blades world wide, based on sales records they sell as many of these blades in the U.S. now as they did at the peak of the twin blade era.  That tells me that a majority of men in America are still using the venerable twin blade cart and will for the foreseeable future.  That tells me these twin blade carts will be with us for a few years to come (also, Dorco has brought back their twin cart razor due to popular demand.) as there seems to be a resurgence in it&#x27;s popularity.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed by this blade and the seller comes through quickly.</li>
    <li> I use these in my Atra razor, &amp; they are a fabulous deal &amp; work very well for me.  I get about one fewer shave from them than I do the actual Gillette blades, but the price is so much lower that I&#x27;m still saving tons of money.  I now purchased Atra razors for my daughters &amp; husband so we can all use these blades, because this is about a 10 year supply for me otherwise!</li>
    <li> great shavers at a great price</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I searched all over for trac II blades, everywhere I found them, they were cost prohibitive. Great price, great product</li>
    <li> I found the quality as good as name brand - price is indisputably fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&#x3D;Cameron&lt;br /&gt;Listen to my music here:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> My husband has been searching for replacement blades to his razor without paying outrageous prices.  These are the answer.  They are as good as any of the big name razors.</li>
    <li> The first time I use a pair of blades I usually get a couple of nicks. You can&#x27;t beat the price point. I am trying really hard not to give up my Trac 2 with all of the new razor systems being to expensive. This should hold me over for a few years.</li>
    <li> great value great price</li>
    <li> The photo makes it look like a plain Jane blister pack but mine came lose in a padded envelope. This was fine by me because I did not have to tear the 10 plastic containers out of shrink wrap and paper. Just put two rows in a ziplock bag. I used a safety razor till the late 70s when the pivot head Atra came out and I think it was a stocking stuffer. Well made of metal mine still works fine but the generic blades were no longer available in stores and Gillette is double the price if you can find them. These are great and cheaper than in the 70s. Pivot head is the way to go and someone gave me a 4 or 5 blade trial model and I saw no improvement over 2 blades. For what these cost you can&#x27;t get 5 of those other multi blades let alone 100. You know there is such a thing as diminishing value regardless of what it is.</li>
    <li> Just what needed at a decent price for the razor.</li>
    <li> I use these on my head blade 2. Amazing savings.</li>
    <li> The fit the Atra razor handle well and the blades give me a smooth shave. The only small complaint I have is around getting the stubble out of the blade when I clean it. I have a thick beard and it takes a little more work than it does with an original blade but it still comes clean with a bit of tapping and rinsing. Overall I am happy and I would but more blades like this.</li>
    <li> received in timely manner...disappointed did not have PERSONNA label, but after using one blade was no longer concerned about the quiality</li>
    <li> I was looking to get away from the high priced cartridges I was using.  I even considered going for the double edged safety blade option so I could save some money.  Problem is I like to shave quickly in the shower on my way to work and the double edge option didn&#x27;t seem to fit the bill.  I was using a \\&quot;SensorExcel\\&quot; and I must say even though these carts are a little larger from top to bottom they give me just as good a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired them up with the [[ASIN:B0011Z3WXU Bump Fighter Shaving Kit]] a non pivoting handle that works well with these cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some of my savings into a shaving soap and brush and am getting way better shaves for pennies.</li>
    <li> for the price of these razors you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> These are nice.  Close shave at a fraction of the price of the newer razors.  Great service.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really nothing more to say--great blades at a great price.</li>
    <li> Very close to the old Gilette. A bit hard to put on</li>
    <li> Cheaper still good quality, Now i dont need to look for next 7-8 months for blade</li>
    <li> Do not like the quality of this product</li>
    <li> As good as the name brand. How do you beat this price.</li>
    <li> Great blades.  They are on par with those selling for much more in retail stores, when you can find them.  They help keep the cost of shaving where it belongs instead of trying to keep up with the current shaving gear price frenzy.</li>
    <li> Great blades and they shave well.  I use it on my headblade and use a generic Atra handle to shave my face.  For the price these blades are really good.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product, definitely a money saving purchase.</li>
    <li> These are just swell.  And a lot cheaper than buying at the store.</li>
    <li> I hated when WalMart quit carrying these blades.  They are a great buy</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Atra brand, but at so much less of a price. 100 pack will last me a long, long time. What a great bargain!</li>
    <li> 1. It fits my razor perfectly&lt;br /&gt;2. it is functional well as Gillette&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;3. great price no one can beat it&lt;br /&gt;4. I definitely will buy more!</li>
    <li> What a deal!  I think I have a lifetime supply now.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to use the old razor that my daughter gave me when she was just a little girl.  One of my best purchases ever.</li>
    <li> A great value, the very same quality you buy in retail stores at a lot cheaper price. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I ordered on 3/7/14 and received it on 3/10/14. I had ordered 100 pack of Persona/Atra razor blades the cost with shipping was $13.47 ..unheard of.. What was received is exactly what was promised, new,fits, sharp as original blades. I will order from Mr.MrZippy again.&lt;br /&gt;Len Eaton</li>
    <li> Work great, sharp as the originals.  Gave them a 4 because the back of the cartridge isn&#x27;t open to help with rinsing, but they clean/rinse just fine from the front side.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Arrived quickly. All new</li>
    <li> works very well as expected.</li>
    <li> These are great! And a great price!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect these razors to be this good at such a great price.  A hundred of these cost about what 10 of them cost at the store, if you can find them.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the Atra blades that Gillette makes.  The reviews were somewhat confusing because they talk about sliding on.  These clip on and fit my old Atra handle without a problem.  Very good product at a GREAT price.</li>
    <li> these are excellent razors.......two blades are enough ....</li>
    <li> The cartridges come quickly and it takes a little practice to connect  the metal&lt;br /&gt;handle to the cartridge and then take single cartridge out of the 10 pack plastic&lt;br /&gt;carrying case. The all metal razor handle allows the cartridge to pivot when&lt;br /&gt;shaving and that is a big benefit over the plastic twin blade systems. I get a&lt;br /&gt;week of close shaves with one cartridge and another week of satisfactory&lt;br /&gt;shaves. My 100 pack might last for nearly 4 years!</li>
    <li> I give it a 4 star rating know complaints at all</li>
    <li> I have always used &#x27;Personna&#x27; blades in the past, but I could not get them locally anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This is a super deal.</li>
    <li> It seems that the older you get, the more frugal. What a great saving in purchasing these in bulk! The quality is equal to (and probably exceeds) what you&#x27;ll find on the retail shelves, but more importantly, the prices they charge at the brick &amp; mortar establishments are criminal in comparison to what you&#x27;ll pay for these. Absolute &amp;#34;no brainer,&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re using similar products off the store shelves, you&#x27;d be insane to pass this up.</li>
    <li> I admit, they&#x27;re a little &amp;#34;clunky&amp;#34; compared to the name brand but at this price I&#x27;ll endure the inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Just like the original</li>
    <li> Works better than the ones I used to buy at Wallmart</li>
    <li> They are razors they either work or they don&#x27;t.  Been a while since I had to shave close, takes a couple of days for you face to adjust to the razor.  Showed up on time.</li>
    <li> A tremendous value. I use these with my head blade sport and get great shaves at a fraction of the cost. Looks like this many will last just about forever but if I ever do run out I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the name brand.</li>
    <li> Great value!!! Been a Trac 11 guy since the 70&#x27;s. Save lots of money and go with this product - you won&#x27;t be sorry. Major razor companies heve been blowing smoke up your a-- with claims that expensive multi blade systems are better. (Better for their bottom line!) Ha!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the quality at first, but these blades are a great value and last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Good Product, great price. What more can i say? Oh, at 1 blade per week, I am good for 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great deal fast delivery! !!</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying $15.00 for 10 Gillette Atra blades, so I figured I&#x27;d take a chance on these. My main concern was that at such a low price, I would not get smooth, comfortable shaves, or very many shaves per blade. So far, smoothness and comfort are fine, and I&#x27;m getting about 10 shaves per blade, the same as with the Gillette Atras. The only noticeable difference from the Atras is that these are slightly larger and &amp;#34;clunkier&amp;#34;, but that is something I got used to after only a couple of shaves. In summary, I got 100% of the Atra performance for 10% of the price. What a deal!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product, cost, and speed of delivery.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, nice and sharp works great just as good as gillette brand.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe the number for the price.  You guys are good</li>
    <li> With everyone going to the 3 and 4 blade razors I found it hard to find Generic replacement blades for my Atra razor. I paid as much for these 100 than I would have for 10 of the brand name ones. The Shave is close and the blades are good. Great buy. I will buy more Get the while you can!</li>
    <li> If you use an Atra Shaver or Personna shaver, you can not go wrong purchasing this product, as you will save a&lt;br /&gt;substantial amount of money over retail prices for the exact SAME product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between these blades and the same blades you purchase in your local store is the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes senses to pay less--for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this product.  Who needs the manufacturer&#x27;s fancy packaging anyway?&lt;br /&gt;Save a tree...and a some money, while you are at it!</li>
    <li> Price is great, razor&#x27;s edge on some seems a little rough.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for a good product. If you&#x27;ve shopped for these, in many stores the sticker shock is serious - they demand almost $20 for 10 blades. I&#x27;m not sure these are of the highest quality available but they&#x27;re fine for me - I&#x27;ve got a pretty tough beard and still usually pull a week from a single blade.</li>
    <li> Excellent razors! Great price!</li>
    <li> Quality is as good as other off label versions I&#x27;ve tried and about as good as the original at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Very good price 4 money</li>
    <li> yeah it just seems like stores are phasing them out there getting harder and harder to find off the shelves bottom line this was so much cheaper and they were perfect just as advertised</li>
    <li> I saw conflicting reports and Q&amp;A regarding these blades fitting a Trac II. Mine arrived Thursday and they slide on to the razor perfectly and fit snugly, no problem. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and will be ordering 100 more today.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Came way before date stated.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality and value. Just cant beat it... share with family if need be.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my father since we can no longer get the regular TracII razor blades.  I doesn&#x27;t care for the lubricating strip, but is glad he doesn&#x27;t have to purchase a new razor because he can no longer get the blades.  No wonder so many men choose to walk around with beards.  Blades are so darn expensive.  I am glad I was able to find these online!</li>
    <li> They fit my Atra just fine. Good quality. A real bargain.</li>
    <li> hard to snap onto razor, but works great!</li>
    <li> Great twin blade razor, replacement for Gillette Trac II, much cheaper and work just as well for me.</li>
    <li> Shaving is one of the biggest deceptions going and marketing genius. Do you really believe that 5 blades shave better than one? Of course not but if you believe it, then you are willing to pay $25 for 4 refills for you current razor which works out to be a significant amount for each shave. So you use one blade, perhaps getting 5 shaves before dulling is a factor. So you replace it with a new blade which is inconsequential when the pack of 100 costs $25. What you are not paying for is the relentless advertising to get you to purchase the expensive blades. I haven&#x27;t worked out the cost for each shave but it is pennies compared to dollars. I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 because you cannot go to the drugstore and purchase these when in need because all they sell is the expensive items. So the convenience factor is worth 1 demerit point. Hey our fathers shaved with one blade for years and there haven&#x27;t been any significant technological improvements to really make a blade sharper or last longer. So work it out. This is a significant and realistic cost saving and a great deal. Thank you Personna.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but does the job and for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and packaged perfectly. I tried one right away as I was leery as to the quality for the price, but thay shaved better than the ones I have been buying at my grocery chain over the years. The blade was sharp and the coating has lasted 20 shaves so far. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Quality product, great price and superb delivery service. A definite 5 star special!</li>
    <li> I may never need to buy a razor blade again - unless I start shaving my back...</li>
    <li> I had to return them they were wrong for my razor handle</li>
    <li> Looks and performs exactly like the name brand blades</li>
    <li> I was using a sensor razor and was having trouble finding third party cartridge blades for it at any of my local drug stores. I refuse to pay the ridiculous price that Gillette wants for a pack of ten blades $18-20 in Canada which is robbery. I&#x27;m so fed up with having my pants around my ankles and big companies taking advantage that when I saw this deal I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do the maths:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 cartridge blades for $30 on Amazon vs 100 cartridge blades at local drug store for $180-200. That&#x27;s a pretty significant savings. If this lasts me a year and lets assume I have another 40 left I&#x27;d save $6,000. If I was to make invest that money over 40 years, I figure I could probably have a lot more in my pocket. Now if I can convince a handful of readers to do the same, I just pulled the pants of big co. down and... well let&#x27;s say they get what they deserve ;)</li>
    <li> Came before expected !!!!!!!!  Very happy !!!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT GREAT VALUE !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
