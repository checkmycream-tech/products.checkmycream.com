      <li>Love the led lamp!</li>
      <li>No kidding this OPI lamp looks like it could survive with me through the zombie apocalypse (to keep my nails amazing and to knock some on the head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but once I did my math and realized that for the price of 4 salon visits (and that&#x27;s not even including tip and gas) I could do my own gel nails at home</li>
      <li>After about 3 of my own gel polish.</li>
      <li>so when opening my own salon</li>
      <li>The built in timer is a nice feature as well.</li>
      <li>I have always done my own nails because I&#x27;m so picky</li>

      <li>Perfect Condition, thank you so much :))</li>
      <li>Love this light!!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are also very roomy fitting most any hand and finger size, plus the folding feet on the underside prop up the front for perfect pedicure curing as well, the auto on sensor works correctly every time, and it comes with a j year manufacturers warranty.&lt;br</li>
      <li>even did my toes which was great and really pretty end result.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love the led lamp! Pricy, but worth the extra $ for a lot less time under the light to cure!</li>
    <li> I bought this item to do my own gel polish and it works great-It does take some practice to perfect the use. My gel polish went on fine and stayed on well. After about 3 of my own gel polish. I&#x27;ve paid for this.  even did my toes which was great and really pretty end result.</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey, but the quality is A+. Every salon I&#x27;ve gone to has used these exclusively. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Gel is harded as quickly. It is very useful!</li>
    <li> Gel Nails at Home. Treat Yourself &amp; Teach Yourself. It&#x27;s a skill that will save you gobs of money, and I&#x27;m sure your girlfriends will want to visit more often once their in the know.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this LED lamp.  It is so fast, much faster than my old UV lamp.  I can do a complete gel manicure in under 45 minutes.  I love the fact that it has the timer and control buttons on top instead of in the back like most lamps.  If you DIY, this is a great feature.  Plus, it feels very sturdy and solid.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but it has a handle on it so it&#x27;s easy to move around.  I&#x27;ve used it with OPI, Gelish, and Ink with no problems so far.  Everything cures beautifully in 30 seconds or less.  Plus, with a 50,000 hour life, I will never have to replace bulbs, yay!</li>
    <li> This is the light the salon uses and it&#x27;s fast and solid.  Very heavy duty and well made. Expensive but still a value because it really is a well designed and manufactured light</li>
    <li> I am satisfied , I got exactly what I ordered !</li>
    <li> I used this item for 8 months and product ruined my nails. Not to mention losing money on purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> GreatSeller,ItemPerfect,Emails,FastShipper &amp; trustworthy-that’sImportant</li>
    <li> O m gosh... I love this lamp, I will recommended to anyone! Love it, love it</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006QXKIDY OPI Led Lamp False Nails]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having my manicurist use this light on my nails, I immediately ordered it.  While it is a bit pricey for me (I&#x27;ve seen it as high as $450), I do my nails all the time and knew I&#x27;d get my monies worth.  I followed my manicurists procedures, using the OPI Gel base coat, IBD Gel Polishes (2 coats), and finally the OPI Gel Top Coat, and wound up with FABULOUS nails!  Having switched to gel polish after years of acrylic and fiberglass, I find the gel doesn&#x27;t tear up my nails, but gives them better protection than just regular polish.  I go through all the steps on one hand, curing for 60 seconds on each step, then complete my second hand, and in less than an hour my nails are beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can get the old gel polish off in about 30 minutes using the nail wraps with acetone.  It&#x27;s really a great piece of equipment that I recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> The OPI LED lamp is the BEST!  solid construction and great performance. Cures OPI LED gels and Harmony hard gel and Gelish. easy to use with 15, 30, 45, 60 second timers. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This light is fantastic.  Expensive, yes, but it will pay for itself eventually since I used to spend $32 on a gel mani...now I just do it myself.  I tried a few of the cheap lights but they weren&#x27;t consistent with the drying (I think due to hand position).  With this one, it doesn&#x27;t matter how you have your hand inside, as long as your fingertips rest where they are supposed to.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This unit will cure most Shellac color but not recommended. Tried to cure Shellac \\&quot;Romantique\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t work. Tried for 30 sec, 1 mini, 2 min this just will not cure this one particular shade.  Might just return one and keep one and buy the CND UV light.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been doing nails since 1985. It&#x27;s been hard to adjust to all this new technology. This lamp makes it so easy to do gels. The gel is set in 30 seconds. It sets all gel products except Shellac Romantique. Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I am a professional nail tech who has been using the old white UV light that came in my beauty school kit for 2+ years. I&#x27;ve wanted to purchase a new LED light but was reluctant to spend the money, however this was the cheapest I had seen it so when opening my own salon I bit the bullet and purchased it and I am so so so pleased with it!!! It dries so much faster than UV so I can get clients out the door quicker! I love the automatic turn on and I love the large count down display on top. This is a wonderful item I recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I  got this for my  job and it is wonderful.  that being said, I  would  recommend  not  using opi axxium  in it or cnd  shellac. axxium  will not  cure  in it  and  only  some shellac  colors  will.  Gelish &amp; le chat will. I  haven&#x27;t  tried  essie&#x27;s  gel yet.</li>
    <li> This product is great, the price is reasonable, it is very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;And let my nails very beautiful</li>
    <li> Exactly the one that my manicurist has at her office so I can get a professional quality gel manicure at home. Now only if my hands were as steady as hers.........</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd light got it for X-mas 2013 it cures my polish just like if I was in a salon.  This light has feet so you can do your feet as well.  Polishes I have used thus far that works great with it is Gelish and Red Carpet the blue sky does not cure well.  I would recommend the led gloves if you are going to change your polish a lot.  Overall this was a good investment and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to do their own nail at home the other low voltage led lamps in my opinion are a waste of money.</li>
    <li> We used these lamps in cosmetology school, they are excellent, well built, durable, quality construction and truly hold up to the 50,000 hours of performance they claim. And they truly cure OPI gel polish in 30sec each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also very roomy fitting most any hand and finger size, plus the folding feet on the underside prop up the front for perfect pedicure curing as well, the auto on sensor works correctly every time, and it comes with a j year manufacturers warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this unit because of how well they performed at school, the quality, durable metal construcition, the qty of  led bulbs, tand the consistant, quality results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend one of these units to any professional !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are WELL WORTH the money</li>
    <li> I love it! Am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have had this lamp a little over a year. In that year I have only used the lamp a total of 4 times for maybe 20 minutes each time. ! row of my led lights are not working already and the company refuses to help in any way. I will never purchase another OPI led product again. This was a complete waste of money and i got no where near the 50,000 hours of usage that it advertises.</li>
    <li> Bécause i use opi gel color and its much quicker to get dry With this lamp. Opi lamp is the best</li>
    <li> Works great. Just like at the nail salon</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own nails for sometime with a small LED light that came with a kit I bought. I saw this and went back and forth about purchasing it because of the price, but I am so glad I made the investment. It has cut my time down since I can put one whole hand in, instead of doing fingers and thumb separately. I only wish I had found this sooner. I LOVE IT! It arrived SUPER fast too.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few third party lamps to try out, but was disappointed with them. Yes this lamp is almost double those other ones, but holy moly! It gets the job done and my nails are awesome!</li>
    <li> I use the OPI gel base and top coat with opi gel polish and also the creative shellac polish. The creative polish works with the opi base and top gel coat.</li>
    <li> Perfect  and good price</li>
    <li> This thing is GREAT!  When I first started doing my gels at home I bought a 2-hand UV light which takes longer to cure but works just fine.  This product is really MUCH more convenient and of course faster.  It&#x27;s sturdily constructed with a metal casing and has a convenient carry handle.  The best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t use harmful UV light on your hands.  You really only need a 1-handed light since the gel polish needs to be cured as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li> Awesome lamp for gelish nail polish too!! I use this lamp for 30 sec cute time on all coats and cures perfect- have even used lamp to fast dry regular nail polish too!! It worked!!!! Worth every penny :)</li>
    <li> Now i can have Shellac on my toe nails! Professional, shiny, thick look. Definitely an investment, will save you at least one hundred dollars or more each month on pedicures and manicures.</li>
    <li> Perfect Condition, thank you so much :))</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. There are several other brands to choose from, but I highly recommend this over other cheaper brands!</li>
    <li> Gel manicures at home!!! I love OPI products. The LED lamp is faster and kinder to my skin. Yes, it is expensive, but pays for itself pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my OPI lamp, easy to use and does a great job. Great service as far as shipping etc.</li>
    <li> Love this light!!  The real deal from OPI!</li>
    <li> The OPI LED light has excellent five finger curing.  The timer settings have the right options, are in the right place, and are easy to change.  The light comes on automatically when your fingers touch the inside of the fixture at the lower rear.  I can&#x27;t imagine any aspect of a gel curing light that could be more convenient to use.  The housing is mostly metal which makes it durable and a bit heavy, yet there is a properly placed handle, also metal, for moving the fixture around.  This one is the best!</li>
    <li> Used it twice and works great.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I originally gave a fab review of this but that was too soon.....I have since then completed 2 OPI gelcolor mani&#x27;s following ALL directions with base,color and topcoats THIN layers CAPPING free edges, etc etc etc. They PEELED OFF AFTER ONE DAY. So, I&#x27;ve experimented with GELISH base, OPI gelcolor color coat, then GELISH top coat. So far so good, after 3 days but my pinkie finger has already chipped!!! This NEVER happened with my CND UV lamp so..........I&#x27;m bummed. I will probably be returning this to ebay store and sticking with cheaper versions. This is overrated I think. It should be absolutely EXCEPTIONAL for the price but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
    <li> I know this is expensive compared to other Gel Polish Dryers, but this is the very best!  I experimented with about three cheaper dryers, even paying $150...but nothing cures like this one from OPI!!!  I wasted so much time, glad I finally learned my lesson!</li>
    <li> Saves time and money love it</li>
    <li> I have not yet purchased but wanted to give some input related to my experience with using this product.  This is the exact curing light that my nail salon uses.  I get the french look about every 2-3 weeks.  However, since it is becoming expensive, I would like to do my own at home to save money; this unit will eventually pay for its self.  I want the same result as I get at my nail salon, therefore I suggest investing in this OPI Led Lamp.  I work at a hospital and wash my hands frequently.  My nails do not ever chip in part because the nail tech makes sure to thinly paint the edges of the nails.  If you find your nails chip after using this unit, the issue may be the paint technique used, it most likely is not a fault of the lamp.  Many reviewers deduct stars related to paint chipping early so be careful to read directions on painting technique for the best, long-lasting result.</li>
    <li> Not paying for gel manicures at the salon anymore.  Very thoroughly dries gel polish in hardly any time.</li>
    <li> We have other lamps in our nail salon, but this one by OPI is by far the most convenient, durable one we have. We now own two of these. The built-in timer helps our customers know how much longer their nails need to cure under the LED lamp, and the convenience of an open bottom means our customers don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging their newly painted nails while inserting their hands into the lamp. They simply leave their hands on the table, and we drop the lamp over their nails for curing. There is a touch sensor toward the inside back of the lamp that activates the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did have one issue with our first lamp. It worked fine for the first couple of months, but after that, the first lamp seemed to have some kind of circuitry or electrical problem that kept it from starting. So far, the last two that we currently use and have owned for the last two months in the nail salon have worked flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I bit the bullet and paid top dollar for this Gel Nail Lamp because it is the same brand that my salon uses, and because of the favorable reviews.  I used the lamp with OPI base coat, Gel color, and top coat.  The instructions noted that, \\&quot;Heat sensation can occur due to individual sensitivity, and thickness of gel applied.\\&quot;  I followed the instructions and applied the gel color as thinly as possible.  Note:  This lamp can get VERY HOT VERY QUICKLY!    The first bad experience I had occurred after I spread out my fingers wide (following the instructions) and burned my thumb on the side lamp.  I noticed that there wasn&#x27;t as much burning sensation with the base coat, but the heat intensified with every additional coat applied.  I could not place my hand completely into this appliance and instead placed the tip of my middle finger on the edge of the bottom plate after the light was triggered.  The burning sensation occurred immediately after the light went on and seemed to lessen in time.  I used the 45 second setting and the gel polish did set, but always had an odd tacky feeling that eventually went away after a couple of hours.    The other issue I had is that the polish would begin to peel off at the nail tip after only two to three days.  I even tried roughing up the nail surface with a sand paper file for maximum adhesion.  My Gel manicures from the salon last me two weeks without any peeling or chipping.  Not so after using the OPI lamp and polish.  The polish lifted every time and I could easily peel off the polish from the nail without any damage to my nails.    So after several attempts,  I am returning this item because I am afraid to use it due to the excessive heat and because the polish peels off.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with nail stuff lately and this led light is amazing. It cures gel polishes soooooo fast. I&#x27;ve used the OPI gel polishes, Gelish foundation/polishes and ASP top coat all work wonderfully with this light. And I love the little kickstands on the bottom to use when you&#x27;re doing a gel pedicure too.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but the last time i bought it&#x27;s only 180</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! Totally worth my investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since i discovered gel nails i never went back to regular polish and never had to get acrylic or solar again. But keeping your nails up to date with the gel polish at the salon can be really pricey, I live in Houston and a gel manicure is about $25 to $55, for me a picky person is always in the higher end of those prices so I decided to get my own products. I first purchased the Sensationail starter kit and it did its job but it took hours literally, 4 fingers at a time for about 1.5 minute cure on every layer. Who has time for that? Really who? I ended up back at the nail salon, who just happens to use This OPI lamp, so I came home and looked it up. At first it seamed pricey but once I did my math and realized that for the price of 4 salon visits (and that&#x27;s not even including tip and gas) I could do my own gel nails at home how ever many times I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a lot of reviews and even trying some other lamps, I made the best choice by purchasing this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most other lamps this lamp is big enough to fit your whole hand i have a large hand and no extra time on the thumb.&lt;br /&gt;My nails cure in 15 seconds in between layers and I do a 1 minute cure at the end and that&#x27;s it, I am set to go!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a fast powerful lamp, NOT flimsy like most other lamps out there. No kidding this OPI lamp looks like it could survive with me through the zombie apocalypse (to keep my nails amazing and to knock some on the head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad part is that my friends now think that somehow is ok to ask me to do their nails, and to them i say the same thing...&lt;br /&gt;GET YOUR OWN OPI LED LAMP NOW!</li>
    <li> Love this light... the only draw back is that when people leave their hands in it will kick the light sensor and turn the light back on... Other than that it is amazing!!! Very durable!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is the bomb!  It works great!  I was reluctant to spend the money because it seems so expensive, but when you compare the cost of it to going to the salon to get gel polish applied, it really isn&#x27;t that much.  I highly recommend it.  My husband polishes my nails with the OPI base coat, gel polish, and top coat. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Bought for use in Australia, easy to convert just buy a replacement power cable from dick smiths or get in touch with OPI in your state and they will send you one. So glad i spent the money because it cures so well and so quickly. This a professional lamp and you get professional results.</li>
    <li> Recieved fast and in great condition. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using my OPI LED light on myself and others. I&#x27;m rating the product 5 *&#x27;s due to the prompt delivery, plus the great condition it came in. I received what was described from the warentee to the OPI dvd and instructions, as well as the 10 fingers nail display.&lt;br /&gt;The machine does fit a whole hand in it, I love the blue light along with the way it turns on when placing hand under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curing took me, 1 min per coat for better results. I put on two coats of polish along with two coats of top coat for long lasting result. I&#x27;m hoping this lasts me a long time, but if needed to I will repurchase from the same seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY, it&#x27;s worth every penny !!</li>
    <li> Update.  Today, I need AC adapter replace.  When I call OPI they told me that I bought it from not authorized dealers so no warranty.  If you want full 1 year warranty I suggest you find out whether they are authorize OPI dealers first.</li>
    <li> I am a manicurist and this light is exactly what I was looking for doing doing gels. It works with all gel products.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed nail tech and our salon uses this OPI led lamp. Be aware that some of the gel polishes will not dry with this lamp. So be sure to gently touch the polish after you cure it to make sure your first coat is dried before applying the second coat. It does dry fast for some other gel polishes and that&#x27;s why I give only 4 four stars.</li>
    <li> came in perfect condition... works perfect!!! It seems to work better on the 45 second setting more me. I use opi gel products. would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was debating between the Gelish lamp and this one and finally decided on the OPI lamp because it was metal instead of plastic.  I LOVE this lamp it works perfectly every time. I have saved so much money doing my nails myself instead of going to a salon that it has paid for itself and then some.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> Came in excellent condition and I love mine! We have one at work but this was a good price! I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the fastest machine that I worked with. Sometimes it does feel like it&#x27;s too hot on the nail, burning feeling. That&#x27;s why 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to invest in this light, it has significantly reduced mani/pedi times. Also I haven&#x27;t had any lifting even after 2 weeks have passed.. It also works well with gelish. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Item works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have always done my own nails because I&#x27;m so picky, I decided to finally try the opi gel nails, I heard better things about opi over other gel types of nail options. I&#x27;ve gotten it done 3 times and was happy with the results. I asked the nail tech, If I have all of these products, I can do this myself at home? She replied with yes, but you have to have a license to order the products. So I checked on Amazon and sure enough everything I needed was available. I did my first &amp;#34;gelly&amp;#34; sandwich manicure today and it looks just as good as when I get it done professionally. What a gelly sandwich is, is gel base and top coat with normal polish. Just as long as you make sure to cap the edges you should have long lasting polish wear. I&#x27;m glad I bought this, and I may get some opi gel polishes, they are just so pricey and I have a large collection of polish already. I like that it cures in 30 seconds, with a spray of alchol and a wipe down your good to go. Awesome shine! Would deff recommend this product for any one who wants the salon gel look at home. I justified paying for this because of how much the manicures were adding up after tip, it will pay for its self after a few months. This comes with a 1 yr warranty, was bran new in box,</li>
    <li> Great item. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this light. It&#x27;s easy to use and allows all 5 fingers to cure at the same time. The built in timer is a nice feature as well. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I go opi gel polish on the acrylic fake nail, all my client call me the day after becau color opi gel pill all off, but if I use another brand name it s not like that happen , please take a min to try it and u will see.</li>
    <li> excellent LED lamp. great price.  highly recommend.</li>
