<li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent but at least I don&#x27;t notice it once my hair is dry.</li>
<li> I guess I am disappointed in this product since the shampoo and conditioner are so good.</li>
<li> I have fine, thin hair and this product works wonders!  </li>
<li> Its not awful, it doesnt feel greasy or dirty</li>
<li> I color my hair because I am completely grey.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and keep coming back to this product.</li>
<li> I sprayed into the root and then started to blow dry it.</li>
<li> I use a few sprays at the roots on the crown area and the spray really lifts when using a round brush.</li>
<li> Definitely gives your roots that little oomph</li>
<li> I used it as directed and noticed it added a little volume, but could feel the product in my hair.</li>

    <li> Thin hair? Gives it a nice lift and very light scent. I&#x27;ve tried other products and keep coming back to this product.</li>
    <li> Helps with volume most of the time.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do the job.  My hair is fine and this product did nothing to enhance the volume.</li>
    <li> It is hard to imagine when you spray this product on your hair that it is going to work so well but it really does give my thin hair surprising volume.  I have used several products over the years but I keep coming back to this one.  It is a little pricey but not as bad as some others.</li>
    <li> Did not give  volume will not reorder</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fusion spray for many years. Helps give you great volume at the root. The products was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Tried this to do beach hair. Worked really well and gave my hair more body</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use if you don&#x27;t want build-up and the ability to brush your fingers through your hair after you have used it. It gives me natural looking volume and shine. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent but at least I don&#x27;t notice it once my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended Eufora Volume Fusion Spray, and it really works!  I use a few sprays at the roots on the crown area and the spray really lifts when using a round brush.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It adds a ton of volume to fine hair and is quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that this product actually worked. I tried so many volumizers, and this was the first product that made me a happy customer! I have fine straight hair, so it&#x27;s hard to keep the volume up. This, for some reason, does the magic. I tried it both on wet (after washed) and dried hair and learned that wet hair right after a wash worked best. I sprayed into the root and then started to blow dry it. It lasted until the second day when I needed to wash it again. Also, it smells great. Knowing that the many ingredients are derived from plants is a big plus. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent for very fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this gives me volume without weighing it down.  Gentle ingredients doesn&#x27;t damage hair in any way.  Good product</li>
    <li> not wrapped properly - sending this one back the product seems to be ok not sure yet will have to try a new bottle</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and this product works wonders!  It&#x27;s not heavy but gives my hair lots of volume and fullness.</li>
    <li> This add amazing body to very fine hair - couldn&#x27;t imagine ever being without it!! I&#x27;m a devoted fan and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair. I tried this brand. I do not like it as it feels weird to me on my hair. I color my hair because I am completely grey. Maybe that is the problem. My son likes Eufora, he uses a shampoo for his dandruff and says it works well. It might be just this product reacting with my grey hair, but for me it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> GREAT RESULTS - JUST WISH THEY WOULD PRODUCE A LARGER SIZE!&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT.  LEAVES MY HAIR WITH WONDERFUL VOLUME AND TEXTURE.</li>
    <li> Great and on time.  The product is wonderful to use especial when you have flat or very fine hair .</li>
    <li> Adds great volume for fine air. Spray on damp hair at the roots, and you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> This pumps up the hair at the crown like no other product.</li>
    <li> Definitely gives your roots that little oomph but you can&#x27;t just spray it all over and work it in. You have to lift your hair and just get the roots otherwise you&#x27;ll have a bad hair day 😜</li>
    <li> I usually enjoy this line of product, but this item was just ok.  Makes my hair too sticky.</li>
    <li> When I blow-dry my hair, adding Eufora Volume Fusion Spray to the roots on the crown of my hair makes a huge difference in how my hair looks and behaves.  I love this product!  It smells great and does a super job of adding volume!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Weightless body and shine. Love it for every day use. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE eufora products, but knew this might not work for my hair ( I have very thick waist length hair). I used it as directed and noticed it added a little volume, but could feel the product in my hair. Its not awful, it doesnt feel greasy or dirty (i&#x27;m sure it would if you use too much) but when my hair settled and flattedned out after styling and using this, i could feel it more. I bet it would work really well for someone with finer, shorter hair. I&#x27;ll probably give it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am giving this volume spray 3 stars because I have gotten more volume using Rusk volume spray.  I bought this brand since my hairdresser recommended Eufora shampoo and conditioner, and I saw great results with them.  I didn&#x27;t get much volume with this volumizer, and went back to using the Rusk brand.  I guess I am disappointed in this product since the shampoo and conditioner are so good.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product.  Every bit as good and a nice change from Pureology.  I believe I actually have more volume, more softness, easy comb though, more control, and even a longer lasting hold.  This is my second bottle.  I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;m very picky and have used all the best.  This is a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
    <li> This product is used at the beauty shop that I go to and I love the way it adds body to my hair!</li>
