      <li>love how i only going Tanning once a week now..</li>
      <li>and I could see a difference in my color after my first time using it.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I got compliments right away on how much tanner I looked.</li>
      <li>Nice dark tan with first use.</li>

      <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
      <li>My closest friend works for a tanning salon, this is the real stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the darkest I&#x27;ve ever seen straight out the bottle</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
      <li>Very discouraging.</li>
      <li>really bounced my color.</li>
      <li>but I highly suggest wiping your hands and between your finger after applying it because it will stain your hands.</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin, and often times certain perfumes irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I typically use Black Elixir, which is also great.</li>
      <li>this lotion gets you dark fast!!!  </li>
      <li>not a heavy fragrance either!perfect</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just super cheap, I&#x27;m guessing fake.</li>
      <li>Stains your skin, leaves you looking orange, and majorly streaks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m left wondering if I purchased a fake inferior product due to cheap shrink to fit labeling over a white bottle.</li>
      <li>I am VERY please with upgrade to black.</li>

<li> Gives you a deep dark tan.</li>
<li> Was not what I expected.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve used other lotions that work as well.</li>
<li> Definitely wash hands after putting this lotion on as with all dark colored bronzers!!!</li>
<li> and i get so dark in one use for a week...</li>
<li> But Upgrade to Black</li>
<li> but I was a little disappointed that it&#x27;s taking so long to improvey color.</li>
<li> I tan approximately 3 times a week</li>
<li> , you&#x27;ll want to get a base tan before you start using it just because of how dark the bronzer is.</li>
<li> would advise against using this before you have a base tan, as the lotion itself is dark in color.</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t a bad lotion</li>

    <li> I love love this stuff!!! It is a Spray Tan in a Bottle..i will use it to go tanning and i get so dark in one use for a week...love how i only going Tanning once a week now..this stuff is the best!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad lotion but I was a little disappointed that it&#x27;s taking so long to improvey color. I tan approximately 3 times a week and I&#x27;ve used other lotions that work as well. Also make sure you apply evenly. It will streak.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, indoors or outdoors.  My colour tanning is dark and this product is excellent.</li>
    <li> Definitely wash hands after putting this lotion on as with all dark colored bronzers!!!</li>
    <li> Came factory sealed on time as promised and is exaclty what I ordered. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> awesome product. really bounced my color. thank you</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot</li>
    <li> I love love love this! Gives u great color in just one use!</li>
    <li> Nice dark tan with first use.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> Its good but you need to put it on right before you tan.  It can leave a stain on your cloths it will wash out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all!  3 times in super bed and couldn&#x27;t even tell it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m left wondering if I purchased a fake inferior product due to cheap shrink to fit labeling over a white bottle. It isn&#x27;t the same packaging as one I saw at the tanning salon. The bottle top comes apart as well. It&#x27;s just super cheap, I&#x27;m guessing fake. Very discouraging.</li>
    <li> BEST LOTION EVER!! It smells amazing. The results you get from using it is Just Absolutely worth it. The price is excellent. Definite recommendation.!!</li>
    <li> It is amazing!!!!! I love it and will order it again.</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery. Overall happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I got compliments right away on how much tanner I looked. It smells good. I would recommend wearing gloves or washing your hands immediately to prevent staining.  Make sure you get it rubbed in completely or it will leave you with streaks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product give me that tan I wanted</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions on the market to day!</li>
    <li> I am VERY please with upgrade to black. I have a great tan and no orange color at all! I have had may compliments about my tan! I could tell a difference after one use! I also got my order very fast with the free shipping! GREAT LOTION AND GREAT COMPANY TO ORDER FROM!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Noticed a change with one use. It&#x27;s the real deal. My closest friend works for a tanning salon, this is the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great description!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. Stains your skin, leaves you looking orange, and majorly streaks.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Gives you a deep dark tan. And it came super quick. Very happy with product and seller.</li>
    <li> this lotion gets you dark fast!!!  I got tan just goin fora walk lol.  not a heavy fragrance either!perfect</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s one of the darkest I&#x27;ve ever seen straight out the bottle and I could see a difference in my color after my first time using it. Definitely not a lotion you want to start with, you&#x27;ll want to get a base tan before you start using it just because of how dark the bronzer is. I haven&#x27;t had any streaking while using this product but I highly suggest wiping your hands and between your finger after applying it because it will stain your hands. Overall great product!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!! Needs rubbed in really good but makes you dark after one time in tanning bed!!</li>
    <li> Noticably darker with just one use of this bronzer!! will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal tanning lotion!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been tanning off and on for the past 7 years and this lotion is definitely my favorite. Awesome bronzers, color, and smell before and after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Ed hardy lotions, but this one takes the cake. I typically use Black Elixir, which is also great. I have tattoos and the tattoo protection is great! I use J Woww&#x27;s tattoo color protection lotion (it has no bronzer, and is meant to be applied only to your tattoos prior to applying your tanning lotion) and my colors are still bright! But Upgrade to Black made me darker faster.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and often times certain perfumes irritate my skin. Nothing from the Ed Hardy line has ever caused me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I would advise against using this before you have a base tan, as the lotion itself is dark in color. Washing your hands before tanning is also a must.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> Wash you hans as it stains</li>
