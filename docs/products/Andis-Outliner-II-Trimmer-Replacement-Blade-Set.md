<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use these with the outliner II, to trim my facial hair. These blades have the best precision out there. nothing else compares in my opinion. It&#x27;s obvious these are the best because they&#x27;re used in barber shops everywhere. So if you&#x27;re looking for the best precision, the best quality, then the Andis Outliner II blades are for you. Once you use the Andis Outliner II, you wont use anything else.</li>
    <li> Good replacement, wish it was sharper though.</li>
    <li> Very good replacement...</li>
    <li> Got it fast and works great</li>
    <li> replace your blades yourself save $$$$$$ although amazon price keeps going up lol doh! great blades buy in bulk I&#x27;ve bought atleast 20 no prob</li>
    <li> got this as a replacement for the one i had, works even better and the value is totally awesome. awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product will highly recommend for self barbers. Sharp and very precise. No need for readjustment. This is a top quality product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed and it arrived much faster than expected.  Saves me the time of driving to a beauty supply store.  I&#x27;m going to order two more right now.  Thanks for reminding me!</li>
    <li> The local beauty supply store was selling this same item for $22 dollars.  I understand the need to support small business in a community, but a smart buy is a smart buy.  This was the precise item I needed.  My old blade was starting to rust and dull. Once installed, the difference was pretty evident in the quality of the edging.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Andis.  I suggest this trimmer to all my friends.</li>
    <li> i used this blade yesterday and out of the pack it was cutting sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had to buy this blade as i purchased from another user and that blade failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this blade is an original it has the andis logo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy buy buy</li>
    <li> Ordered these from CBS Express received promptly in an original package but there seems to be a black market on these. The stainless steel finished seemed to be too shiny (painted), I was wondering why I couldn&#x27;t never get them to cut razor sharp. Upon further review I noticed that the teeth were not as sharp in detail when compared with 2 other blades that I have, I also noticed that the &amp;#34;andis&amp;#34; stamp on it wasn&#x27;t as clearly stamped in detail as the blades that I was replacing. By living in Chicago where there&#x27;s a black market for just about anything it was pretty easy for me to spot the differences. Waiting on reply for return to CBS Express. Ordered from &amp;#34;Andis&amp;#34; website for a few bucks more.</li>
    <li> I almost threw out my machine and was going to buy a new one, until i found out that all u need is just the replacement blade, switch it up and it works fine, no need to buy the whole machine, buy the blade first before dong anything!</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this seller and with the product! I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> These are nearly as sharp as the original ones that came with my trimmers.  However, with a few minor adjustments, they are cutting really well.</li>
    <li> What you would expect - it  appears to be a new outliner II trimmer blade in the package. Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> If you need to replace the blade for you andis outliner II clipper then this is exactly what you need.  Assembly is a piece of cake, simple use a phillips head screwdriver to remove the old blade and then pop the new one right in.  I only wish that some clipper oil could have been included with the blade, but overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> THE BEST EDGER,TRIMMER OF ALL TIMES! WAHLS OR OYSTER CAN&#x27;T TOUCH THIS! I CAN GO OUTSIDE AND TRIM MY GRASS WITH THIS THING! AND HAVE THE SHARPEST LAWN ON THE BLOCK! LOL FAST DELIVERY! EASY INSTALLATION! NO PROBLEMS! 100% SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> need to buy 2 more works great with old clippers cuts close an does cut skin love them buy !buy !</li>
    <li> Awesome product as everyone knows. I dry shave with these and bought an extra blade as the T blade was a little too long to get into the curves of my neck. Watching some videos on YouTube you can bring the cutting closer to the skin which helps too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product no need to sharpen just adjust and use  packaging was great to .</li>
    <li> good quality trimmer now works like new</li>
    <li> I needed a new set of Andis blades to shave and I received these and lightning fast delivery.  They work perfect and I have not had any problems with them since I bought them.</li>
    <li> Great blades no need for adjustment</li>
    <li> Fit my trimmers perfectly. They weren&#x27;t working before and I wasn&#x27;t sure what the problem was but apparently just needed a new blade!!</li>
    <li> Replaced my previous blade on my clippers and it&#x27;s been running smooth cutting better it&#x27;s a great replacement for the original blade.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition, and did the job.  New in the box and ahead of time.  I think I will get some grooming done now.</li>
    <li> Blades were on point but I think I might need to adjust the gap. It gets the Job done 98% of time.</li>
    <li> great price and great fit will buy again if i need replacements</li>
    <li> The blade is not as sharp as the original blade. I don&#x27;t know what else to say besides this. sharpen the blade and it would be great.</li>
    <li> My trimmer are like brand new now saved me from buying a new pair of trimmer money well spent</li>
    <li> The replacement blade was easy to attach and cuts nicely. I had a old pair of clipper and this did the job.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect and very easy to instal.</li>
    <li> Worked better than I thought... just as close as my straight razor cuts...</li>
    <li> The new blades were easy enough to install, however, now my outliner does not trim very well.  I think I&#x27;m going to just have to replace the whole thing.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this blade and it was dull out of the box not worth your money but it somewhere else</li>
    <li> Would you believe I&#x27;ve been paying up to $32 for 1 blade.  Now I can get 2 blades and still get a Venti with the change.  No brainer.</li>
    <li> does the job! OUT THE BOX AND INSTALLED LINES ARE PRECISE.  WILL BE ODERING REPLACEMENTS AS NEEDED.  KIRK OUT, PEACE!</li>
    <li> Suck the don&#x27;t waiste your money</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I got the package fairly quick but a small piece of the blades was chipped. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed but life goes on. LOL</li>
    <li> Its been a couple years and they still get the job done.  Two Thumbs Up!!!</li>
    <li> I have the [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]] and I dropped it, chipping the blade. I went to order a replacement and I found this one. When it came in though, low and behold it was a new Andis trimmer ([[ASIN:B000RFS118 Andis Professional Outliner II Personal Trimmer]]), not just a blade like I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best replacement ever.</li>
    <li> This product is the entire blade assembly.  It is both the stationary part and the part that moves back and forth together in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is easy.  Just unscrew the two screws then put the new blade where the old one was and put the screws back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone could misalign the moving parts but only if they were not paying attention.</li>
    <li> Purchased this blade for my OUTLINER II trimmer and is a great replacement blade. My blade from before was dull, while this one is sharper.</li>
    <li> Was half the price here than Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> Great replacement t part</li>
    <li> Loved it. It&#x27;s cut very well and smooth. I would definitely buy it again once I need another replace.  I would definitely recommend on buying it.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace my original blade. Outstanding. Can tell no difference from the original. Searched other websites and found here at a reasonable price. Will Purchased from seller again.</li>
    <li> Did pretty much what i expected them to do and that&#x27;s to cut with precision.</li>
    <li> @industry_barber. Best for erasing lines from skin or bald fades, last long time... I replace them every year to year and half although doesnt necessarily need it.</li>
    <li> It took about 1 minute to put together and the blade is fantastic. Well worth the purchase versus buying a new machine.</li>
    <li> Great replacement blade,</li>
    <li> Thanks, awesome product</li>
    <li> This is awesome can&#x27;t say much more exactly what was described.I would recommend it replace blade every 3 months depending on use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cut very well and smooth. I would definitely buy it again once I need another replace. best trimmer clipper</li>
    <li> This blade snags less than the t blade, and byple ships pretty fast! This will fit t outliner and outliner 2</li>
    <li> These are good blades but like others have mentioned, I think they are refurbished and resold.</li>
    <li> I was suppose to order the t-blade, but this one still works very well.</li>
    <li> The product shipped, arrived and performed as expected, however they were not the same as my current blade. My original blades had a slightly larger head and a longer tooth configuration. As a side note... I also order another set of the Outliner II since the ones I currently have performed wonderfully for me, but they came with the same blade configuration as the Andis Outliner II Trimmer Replacement Blade Set, which I do not like. They do not cut as cleanly or as close.</li>
    <li> great product...definitely recommend...do not by the knock off brands for andis</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these razors .</li>
    <li> not sharp enough and poor quality</li>
    <li> The blades worked great!</li>
    <li> Great transaction.&lt;br /&gt;Installing is simple, if you need tips go to youtube and search the andis blade you have and boom bang boom there it is!&lt;br /&gt;Stay fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> I trusted that these blades were brand new but they were not. My existing blades were starting to get dull and THIS &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; set cuts 10x&#x27;s worse than my dull set, if it&#x27;s peach fuzzy neck hair-forget it!!!! Clearly they aren&#x27;t true Andis blades, I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on them from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; it worked as well as expected, I would buy it again if I needed to &amp; the price was excellent</li>
    <li> Clippers work just like they did the day I bought them. Good solid clean cut and at a respectable price.</li>
    <li> Very good blade. It took sometime for me to get it working the right way. Once you play with it for a little while you will see that it cuts very close. The last blade I had would take me about 45 mins to cut my hair now it only takes 25 - 30 mins.</li>
    <li> Live in Canada and this blade was selling for 40 USD with tax so very happy to buy it at this price , works great only wish I purchased more.</li>
    <li> My blade was feeling dull for some time so I bought this replacement blade that was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately I messed up on the installation (removed the screws on the blade itself) but since I bought two that was not a problem. Maybe a caution to buyer would have helped though I hardly read instructions anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these multiple times.  Sharp, long lasting and easy replacement.</li>
    <li> Very good blades and I received it very fast. I applied them to my trimmer and it made them feel brand new again</li>
    <li> can you add one andis clipper oil  4 oz together how one andis outliner  ll in one same orden.. l need receive all together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tu puedes agregarme un aceite de 4 oz junto con una cuchilla andis outliner ll en una misma orden junto..</li>
    <li> I bought this for personal use and I am not a barber.  My stock outliner2 blade chipped when I dropped my trimmers on the tile.  Excellent replacement for andis outliners/trimmers.  Just be sure to adjust the blade when you oil it for the first time before installing, the setting straight out of the package was a little wide and left the hair longer than I liked. Once I adjusted the gap it worked well for shaping/shaving/outlining. Im white with straight hair but my black roommate has used this blade on his hairline frequently and says its awesome.</li>
    <li> very good and sen me in time thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement cheaper than the retail price,came oiled and ready to do its job...</li>
    <li> Everything great.... Thanks</li>
    <li> Exactly what I paid for, and great service. Will do biz again. Product was brand new as described, packed good and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> Horrible! I&#x27;m still confused, I feel as if I am one out of many thousands who&#x27;s replacement blade was dull and does not perform like my replacement blade I ordered before!!!</li>
    <li> Usually purchase this product at our local Sally&#x27;s.  Found it for 1/4 of the price here!  Even received the blade within 4 days!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> U know what to expect from the Andis liners. I have been getting my haircut with their product for 30+ years</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying my trimmer replacement set. Thanks</li>
    <li> delivery was fast. this blade fits perfectly on my machine and i do get a smooth shave from it.. the original blad that i had when i bought the machine was not as good as what i purchased from this seller. i am happy and you really cant beat the price. definitely 5 stars</li>
    <li> Good Product, good price.</li>
    <li> the first one I received was used when it said it was new. But not saying the blade is not a good choice. I bought it cause it said new, I didn&#x27;t want a used one!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, razor sharp, perfect replacement feel the same as when I first purchased them.  Highly recommended to all!!!</li>
    <li> close shave without the burn. cheap alternative to buying a new outliner 2. I shave my face and head . no prob</li>
    <li> I use this for daily shaving. As an African American man I was prone to bumps every now and then. Since I started using this about a year ago I have not had any problems with my skin. They do cut close enough to pass military shave inspection. Great product and replacement blades are cheap. (I dropped and chipped my original set.)</li>
    <li> I just replaced my blade which I have been using for about a year. This works really good as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i ordered &amp; wanted</li>
    <li> These are sharp out of the package. I used it to line myself up and was impressed, as my original blades weren&#x27;t sharp like these! I will definitely keep another on spare.</li>
    <li> great replacement blade, had orignial blade on for over a year and needed new one, very sharp!  would recommend</li>
    <li> I have bought this replacement blade twice already. It is what you need for when you shaver gets dull. Hopefully people realize they have to change their blade when it gets dull. It will prevent getting bumps or itch or your skin.</li>
    <li> This item has met all of my exspectations. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. I should have been notified that my item was going to be delayed due to snow in the north east. I was notified.</li>
    <li> My kid dropped my Andis Outliner II trimmer and chipped the corner of the blade off.  Bought a new blade set for thirteen. thirty nine and now it works fine.  It comes with instructions on how to replace the blade.  Its a little tricky lining up the 2 blades and screwing down the 2 screws straight and aligning the blades. If you can use a phillips head screw driver and follow directions you can swap out the blade set.</li>
    <li> This is really good blade. I replaced my T- Liner blade for this one just to try something different.</li>
