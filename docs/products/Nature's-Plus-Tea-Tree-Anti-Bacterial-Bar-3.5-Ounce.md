    <li> I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SOAPS EVER, I USED THE SOAP FOR 15 YRS OR MORE  AND IT  HELPED ME MORE WAYS THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. THIS IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS SOAP,  IT REALLY CURES ALL OF THE THINGS  I&#x27;M ABOUT TO  TELL YOU  (SMELLY FEET,  DISCOLORATION OF TOE NAILS,  ACNE,  BLEMISHES,  RAZOR BUMPS AND ITCHY FEELINGS  AFTER SHAVING.  ONE MORE THING I WAS SENSITIVE TO EVERY SOAP,  IT WOULD GIVE ME A YEAST INFECTION OVER AND OVER EVEN THE MILD SOAPS  AND SOAPS THAT WHERE FRAGRANCE FREE OR ANY FRAGRANCE BATH OILS SO I TIRED THIS AN IT CURED THE YEAST INFECTION PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING MANY YEARS AGO AND I&#x27;VE BEEN YEAST FREE FOR YEARS. I CAN&#x27;T REMEMBER MY LAST YEAST PROBLEM, IT&#x27;S BEEN SO LONG.TO THE PEOPLE WITH THESE ISSUES  USE THIS SOAP ON A REGULAR BASIS AND YOU WILL SEE A CHANGE.</li>
    <li> Love the products this company makes. Love the Tea Tree in the summer time, especially if it&#x27;s humid. Makes you feel clean and fresh. Nice for oily skin types. I would not use the Tea Tree if you tend to have dry skin. Use the Cucumber one instead.</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive but worth it. Lasts long, since it&#x27;s quite solid, but non drying either and that&#x27;s the thing you really want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree is tea tree, you know the qualities (antibacterial etc). However not all tea tree soaps worth the money, I think this one actually does.</li>
    <li> I truley love this soap I bought it because I had some toe fungus started and wanted to get rid of it. It seems to be working and also its wonderful to wash your face with because it helps with acne breakouts. Smells so good and dosen&#x27;t have that overpowering tea tree smell.</li>

    <li> Awesome exactly what I was looking for</li>
