<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it too long but long the way it feels on my face. I will update later :)</li>
    <li> Love love love this vitamin C cream all natural works amazing and affordable!!!</li>
    <li> As a Doctor I can say that this product delivers!!! They DO NOT exaggerate this product at all!! I&#x27;m a cancer patient so allow me to say that a product that actually makes me look so healthy, that people have commented on it is GREAT!!!!! As a bonus, this company stands behind this product with a generous 30 day return policy!! Very rare these days.</li>
    <li> Smells great and offers lightweight moisture. My skin looks good too.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have sensitive skin and have been using it with no bad reaction. Smells great and I notice it actually works on diminishing wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my face feel good!  It has a great mixture of oils and butters with clementine essential oil mixed in.  After several days of use I can tell a difference.  It comes in a box with the bottle plastic sealed so that leakage and safety are not an issue.  It smells wonderful like fresh oranges.  I have used it in the pm after washing my face and it absorbs nicely without leaving a greasy residue.  It has helped to soften the crows feet around my eyes.  I would purchase this one again.  It also only takes a small amount to cover my face so it will last me a while.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.from the second I started using  it.it goes on so smooth and absorbs very well.leaves your face so soft even my husband says time your skin looks so soft and smooth,and this is only.for using it a couple of days.I will definitely buy this prod again can&#x27;t  wait to see what happens after a couple weeks.this even.works better then some moisturizers I spent an easy $100 for,can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> This moisturizer packs a big punch! I love the fresh citrus scent, and the consistency is so smooth! It only takes a tiny squirt or two to cover your entire face and neck area, so do not let the size of the tube fool you!  I foresee this lasting me upwards of 4 months, easily! The packaging is high quality, and so are the ingredients. I&#x27;m thrilled to add this to my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have eczema as many of you know and the patches I get on my face are totally annoying. They look like patches of broken out skin and nobody like that! This moisturizer is great for my skin, I can feel it working like it is feeding my skin what it is missing. My face is so soft after I use it and my patches are starting to clear up. Thank you, Body Merry</li>
    <li> I have been using this Moisturizer for over 2 weeks now. I have used many moisturizers and I honestly love the way this one smells the best. I looked over the ingredients to see what it was (besides the VitaminC) and I believe its the Clementine Essential Oil that is listed. It is citrus but not the traditional lemon, lime, orange scent that we are all familiar with. It is super yummy. This is 22% vitamin C and thats a pretty high percent. Its also 20% Hyaluronic acid. The main ingredient is Aloe Vera which makes me happy because I love natural ingredients and to see it as the main ingredient is awesome. I applied it right out of the shower because my skin is always dry after washing. It moisturized, soothed, and smelled great. The consistency of the actual moisturizer is perfect and a little bit goes a long way.  It spreads easily onto the skin and absorbs quickly. I had no issues applying makeup after application. I also have pretty sensitive skin and I Had no reactions hives, rashes or other issues from using this product.  I did receive a sample of this product in order to write this review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Love this super C-22 moisturizer! It&#x27;s so unique that it contains not only vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide but also CoQ10. Most my vitamin C moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have CoQ10, which is also important to diminish the wrinkles and fine lines. I share this product with my husband, it&#x27;s no artificial fragrances which is more acceptable for him. He likes it very much, and he sees the difference after 2 weeks of uses.</li>
    <li> It feels light, really evens skin texture and smells great. I will definitely be buying this in the future .</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review Body Merry &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; loaded new moisturizer with ingredients highly touted to provide natural skin care to fight the aging skin process. I really like that these products are made of natural and organic ingredients and that they are made in the USA in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility. It is great that it is not tested on animals, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the Body Merry Super C-22 Moisturizer. At first I used two pumps of this moisturizer. It was too much. I found that one pump was adequate. I spread this over my face and neck using upward, sweeping motions. This moisturizer has a definite citrus fragrance that I found o.k. I have not noticed any fantastic improvements in my skin during this trial period, nor have I seen any problems. I like that this product is suitable for men or women to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that anyone who desires the best for their skin apply a good moisturizer daily. Twice a day is even better. Body Merry creates several good good products. This new product - Super C-22 Moisturizer might be just the right product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are mine. I was not compensated for the review.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. There is this citrus scent that just gives me a burst of energy in the morning. It makes my face look so even and leaves no filmy residue. Awesome buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I was provided this product through Amazon Review Trader for honest Review.*****</li>
    <li> It is always hard to rank the products on the effectiveness of some of the claims...  but the moisturizer smells really good and has a slight orange/citrus smell  I don&#x27;t find it overpowering.  While it has a long ingredient list, none of the ingredients seem to bother my somewhat sensitive skin.  Did I mention that it smells really good?</li>
    <li> Love this! This makes my skin feel great and I love the citrus scent. Good moisturizer without that heavy, greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Being a fan and user of Vitamin C serum, this is the first thing I put on my face after cleansing and toning. This Vitamin C serum by Body Merry not only has 20% Vitamin C, but also contain Hyaluronic acid, Niacinamide and CoQ10. These ingrdients fight the sign of aging, even out the skin tone and protect against the antioxidant. It also has all natural and organic ingredients and doesn&#x27;t have artificial fragrance. I love using it in the morning, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft and smooth. I have another product from Body Merry and alternate between the two since I love them both. Great product with great ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this moisturizer!  I have been using it for a few days now and notice my skin is super soft.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell. Glad I found this!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It doesn&#x27;t take much to make your skin feel very moisturized.  The dispenser bottle is very easy to use, not messy.  It absorbs quickly with no sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> Great, non greasy, facial moisturizer. This is perfect for daily wear. This cream has aloe vera; sunflower, palm, clementine and jojoba oils; and shea butter. It goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, it&#x27;s helping to fade some of my age spots . Very light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky , will buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. It worked well on my face when it was dryer a few weeks ago (still cold up here in NY) and now that my skin is slowly becoming oilier (warmer weather), it&#x27;s not making it look greasy which I really like. The ingredients seem to work well with each other &amp; I love anything that&#x27;s made with vitamin C and of course made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat sensitive combination skin so I’m always careful with the products that I choose to use. Body Merry is one of my favorite skincare companies &amp; I am always happy to get to test &amp; review another of their products. I trust this company &amp; have never had a problem with any product that I’ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed about this silky light moisturizer is the wonderful citrus scent! It contains clementine essential oil which makes it smell so good &amp; very refreshing. But it’s a subtle scent, not overpowering. The moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin &amp; does not leave any oily or greasy feeling. I have not experienced any redness or irritation while using this moisturizer. I use it twice each day after a toner &amp; a serum.&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump container so that I can control the amount of product that I use &amp; not waste any. And I’m happy with the way my skin looks &amp; feels.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer!  It applies nicely, without leaving a greasy or oily feel.  The smell is pleasant.  I have not had any issues with my skin breaking out as I do with so many other moisturizers.  This product contains all natural ingredients also.  My skin feels amazing after using it for only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Smells like rubbing an orange on your face. A great morning pick me up. It helps my face stay less oily throughout the day.</li>
    <li> feels great, you can see a difference, try it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Nice creamy moisturizer. Pleasant Citrus fragrance. I have fairly sensitive skin and can  tolerate twice daily usage. Smooth supple skin after use!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin so sometimes I struggle to find the right moisturizer. This is perfect! It leaves my skin feeling awesome and looking healthy without looking greasy!</li>
    <li> My wife tried several of the products from this line.  They are very inexpensive (relatively speaking) and are allegedly all natural ingredients.  They did not clog my wife&#x27;s pores or break out her skin.  This cream has a wonderful orange scent and is a nice light moisturizer.  4 stars because my wife, who is 53, prefers a much heavier cream. It does not plump or hydrate her skin like some other products do.  This would be great for women in their 20s or 30s.  Overall nice product.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly hesitant to try facial moisturizers because my skin is not only a combination of oily and dry, but it is also very sensitive. I break out easily from products, so I usually don&#x27;t use anything! I was pleased as punch to try Body Merry&#x27;s C-22 Super Moisturizer as it feels incredible on my skin. This is some of the best moisturizer I have ever tried. It goes on nicely, it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird coating, and absorbs quickly. It smells great, but it smells natural, so it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose! My skin is glowing for the entire day and while I can feel it ever so slightly if I rub my face, it just feels nice and clean, not oily or gritty. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! Really works. Makes my face smooth and glow.</li>
    <li> This product has a beautiful scent, goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  I cannot say how effective it is, since I am in my late 60&#x27;s and I use a combinationl of products. However, I believe in using Vitamin C, and I will order this again.</li>
    <li> My skin feels moisturized all day long. No weird scent ia plus. This plus spf30 would make the perfect moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Yeah this is a great cream. Goes on so nicely.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. It makes me feel refreshed and my skin feels like satin!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a product containing 22% vitamin C and found this. I really like all the ingredients and it smells nice too. I have only been using it for a week so it may take longer to see clearer results.</li>
    <li> i like this product i smoke so i feel that my skin is better, also i had some spots after pregnancy which is disappearing at the moment now its been couple of months im using so good</li>
    <li> Even if there were no other reason, the smell of this cream is wonderful. It isn&#x27;t tacky and I am liking it very much.</li>
    <li> I am simply amazed with this product and it delivers. I am 62 years young and can attest that this moisturizer gave me results after the first use. I can only believe it will continue to help improve my skin!</li>
    <li> I wish I loved this stuff as much as I love their vitamin C serum.  I&#x27;m really funny about moisturizers. I love a dewy feel after a moisturizer. My skin is more on the dry side and when I apply this moisturizer it seems to almost come on waxy like and doesn&#x27;t exactly smoothly spread evenly over the skin without it  balling up...and trust me I don&#x27;t over do it, because this stuff isn&#x27;t typically cheap for how small the bottle is.  This would probably be good for those who have oily skin maybe. It&#x27;s very drying feeling to my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this cream since it helped me a lot with my acne scars. After using this for 1 1/2 months i am not so ashamed to not wear any make up at all!!! My skin feels smoother, and my scars are lighter and it smells really good.. I just wish this have SPF. But overall I&#x27;m happy with my  purchase &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be very stubborn with combination of oily and dry and add in the fact that I have sensitive skin and that makes applying products to my face a little bit of a nightmare. I&#x27;ve been wanting a really good moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t bother my skin issues and this vitamin C moisturizer is definitely the product I needed! It comes in a nice sized bottle and the fact that you only need a little bit to cover your face and neck means that it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile before having to reorder. The smell is really nice nothing too strong. The moisturizer absorbs pretty quick and evenly. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel sticky or greasy but makes it feel soft,clean,and refreshed! I really like this moisturizer and would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Smells great! Much better than other face creams I&#x27;ve tried.  I love that its not sticky. I also use this with a derma roller.</li>
    <li> I like using this Vitamin C moisturizer especially before and after going outside in the hot Florida sun. I do mix it with my sunblock for added spf coverage. I love how moisturized it keeps my face. I don&#x27;t want wrinkles when I get older so I am taking care of my face now to prevent them. I love the natural and organic ingredients in this I like knowing I am not putting chemicals on my face. It has a light citrus smell that is amazing it&#x27;s not overpowering either. The moisturizer is nice and creamy and applies easily. I like adding this into my daily routine. I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Really good everyday moisturizer. This has a lovely orangey scent and is a really good moisturizer. Very nice for a warm day when you want a lighter, refreshing moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it as my &#x27;go-to&#x27; for a quick application before I go out the door. It also has skin-improving ingredients so your skin doesn&#x27;t just look better, it really is improved. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love that this moisturizer has a pleasant light citrus scent. My skin feels so smooth and I feel like it is working well.  It does not irritate my skin and it goes on light as opposed to thick and creamy.</li>
    <li> This is a highly recommended product.  The balance of the hylarounic acid and vitamin C truly do work .  Not a miracle worker ( nothing is) but it will keep wrinkles away if used on a regular basis.  Dr oz mentioned this combo on his show which is why I ordered it and I am very pleased.  Not much is needed and I use it twice a day so the container should last me 2 to 3 months.  As said, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer that is easily absorbed leaving the skin soft and plump to the touch. I bought the product as a trial. i like the high C content and will definitely be buying more. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I can&#x27;t see how much moisturizer is left in the bottle. The pump dispenser works very well but the solid outside of the container doesn&#x27;t allow the user to see what&#x27;s left or know when to reorder.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;ve noticed some wrinkles starting around my tired eyes. So I did some research and came across this product that had everything I needed in one bottle. It came very quickly, was packaged very well. Sealed tightly. I was curious about it so I decided to try it that night.&lt;br /&gt;Washed my face first, removed all of my makeup, Pumped a small amount on my finger tapped it around my eyes ( be careful not to get too close to your eyes).Then all over my face, keep in mind it does not take a lot. After using it for a few days, my skin feels softer and the lines look less visible, I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Four stars for now, have not used long enough to see long term results.  Very creamy, soft fragrance of orange, very nice</li>
    <li> I was looking for something at a reasonable cost that works...this product has met my expectations, very happy with it!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I has a beautiful citrus fragrance and the the texture is smooth and creamy.  I use it under my foundation in the morning and as a moisturizer at night.  I really like it and plan on re ordering.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Really great and light moisturizer !</li>
    <li> My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first moisturizers I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with. After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. After my last facial, the technician remarked how hydrated my skin is for a 60-something. Great product at a reasonable price. Try it!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I use it at night and makes my face feel so soft.  I have very dry skin and this really does the trick.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice light, fast-absorbing moisturizer for summertime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer for a few days and so far I just love it! The fragrance is not overwhelming and the scent quickly dissipates after application. My skin feels super soft but not greasy. I have combination skin so this is quite the accomplishment. The pump sometimes gets stuck but this is a very minor issue and a few extra pumps gets the lotion flowing again. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product that isn&#x27;t too terribly expensive. Also, I had communications with the owner/customer service and she was very pleasant and responded to emails right away which is a rarity these days!</li>
    <li> I bought the cream for my face, but I read that I could use it on my hands.  People say your hands don&#x27;t lie about your age, but I want mine to look as young as possible, so I started using this as my primary hand lotion.  I bought an extra bottle for the office. It absorbs quickly and has a light citrus fragrance.  The applicator allocates the correct amount of cream so none is wasted and I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time rubbing it in.  Perfect for home and office. I am pleased with this product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> I really love the Super C-22 moisturizer. I usually use the Skinceuticals vitamin C serum - but I prefer this; its just easier to apply, and packed with ingredients that are great for your skin. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for three weeks now and I like that it adds just the right amount of moisture to my combo oily skin. My face looks brighter and even toned. One pump is all I need to cover my face/neck so even though the bottle looks small I think it will last me awhile.  I live in Canada so I order directly from the Body Merry website by contacting the owner and getting a shipping/payment quote but I&#x27;m hopeful that the Body Merry products will be available on Amazon.ca. Good news - since the Super C-22 and the Cellulite Defense gel-cream will be repeats orders for me. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is a fresh smelling moisturizer that I use under my makeup. It absorbs completely and is non greasy. My skin looks brighter and dewy! I love hyaluronic acid and what it does for my skin. Add 22% vitamin C and my skin looks amazing!</li>
    <li> This product has allready made a difference in my skin. I have used many other products over the years and this is a very good one. I love the light orange fragerance and the soft silk like feel of lotion. The packaging and the pump are very nice as well. thank you.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is amazing! It does not work great on oily skin. It made mine oilier. Highly recommend for aging skin with a normal to dry complexion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a week since I started using this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied. I have notice my skin is smoother and clear.</li>
    <li> I really love this face cream.  It&#x27;s so light and velvety.  It sinks into your skin really nicely.  It has a wonderful refreshing very light orange fragrance that is not overpowering and that disappears quickly.  Makes my skin feel smooth and very soft and well hydrated without feeling oily or greasy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and have never had any break outs.  I have oily/combo skin and I think it&#x27;s been helping to prevent whiteheads.  Also love all the natural organic ingredients.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am used to Vitamin C serum as a daily routin. According to many positive reviews, I decided to try this moisturizer. After the first application, the skin on my face began to itch and multiple grain-like spots covered my face. The skin was red for two days. Now it&#x27;s a dry old looking face with red grain-like areas including my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Three days after, my skin began to peel being irritated still and multiple tiny acne appeared mostly under the lips area. After almost a week I still have my skin peeling, but the overage look has changed. Skin looks more even than before this product application due to natural treatment applied or just a strong product penetration, I really can&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;Now, a week after, I still can&#x27;t tell was this product working like a strong peel on my skin or just an extremely hard allergen.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very attentive providing me with multiple emails, tips and suggetions, and double compensation at the end.</li>
    <li> The vitamin C face moisturizer is great.</li>
    <li> i was happy to try this face cream but it just broke me out in very bad acne.</li>
    <li> Nice, easy absorbing, pleasant smell- I like it!</li>
    <li> Very nice texture and fragrance.  I use it as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really love this vitamin C because it is creamy and really seems to work. I highly recommend. The smell is wonderful and I love this brand!</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best moisturizer I have ever used! For a bit of background, I&#x27;m 20 years old, but due to medications, my skin is dry, dull, and sensitive. I&#x27;ve tried many department store products, and nothing has worked like this one! One of the first things you&#x27;ll notice about this product is the great citrus scent. This made applying the product so pleasant that I actually looked forward to it! In the first few days of using, I noticed my skin was hydrated and was staying that way all day, instead of flaking like usual. After a few weeks, I started seeing a huge difference in brightness; my skin just seemed to glow! I&#x27;ve just bought another bottle of this amazing product because my skin improves every day. For me, the fun scent combined with visible results makes this product fun to use and worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I purchased the product at full price, and I was not compensated for this review.</li>
    <li> Such a nice moisturizer for daily uses. It has a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; natural scent to it, like a orange scent. It goes on nice and absorbs nice with no nasty oily,greasy residue. It hasnt clogged my pores but instead has left my face so smooth and healthy. Would I buy this again? You better believe it, the benefits are to hard to just past by!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever. I have to admit that I purchase my beauty products based on quality reviews, and this method hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. After using this product for about a month, I have noticed a very obvious difference in two things: Skin softness and &amp;#34;youthfulness.&amp;#34; My skin is way plumper, more velvety, and just super smooth. I did start using an AHA at the same time, but they seemed to work together beautifully. I&#x27;m relatively young but still I have noticed that my skin looks more like that of a child than before, when I had issues with dullness. It just seems fresher and more &amp;#34;glowy.&amp;#34; Now, it&#x27;s not a miracle (what really is?) but I got results!!  I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference until about three weeks into using it. I just thought &amp;#34;well at least it&#x27;s somewhat moisturizing.&amp;#34; During this time it didn&#x27;t particularly stand out as a moisturizer. One night I realized &amp;#34;wow this feels DIFFERENT.&amp;#34; My skin just seemed a lot healthier and softer all of a sudden. It didn&#x27;t fade all of my unevenness, but it&#x27;s slowly improving. Mostly I&#x27;m just blown away by the uber soft, plump texture. As odd as this probably sounds, it reminds me of the unreal smoothness of silicon. I&#x27;m happy. I wish the price weren&#x27;t as high, but given all of the high quality ingredients I don&#x27;t think it is an unfair price. I think it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight. Smells amazing, which makes it addictive to use. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks so i haven&#x27;t seen a difference in skintone yet but I will continue using.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this moisturizer.  The consistency is light, it smells like oranges, and a little goes a long way.  I use this in conjunction with the C-22 toner and the Super 6 Serum and my skin has never looked better.  I am 62, with &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin, and always looking for a way to improve skin tone and appearance.  This product does just that!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product nightly for a few weeks in conjunction with the serum. I think this is a good product for the price and have noticed an improvement in skin tone</li>
    <li> this lotion (more of a lotion than a cream) smells wonderful, like citrus, and soaks in quickly. I use in conjunction with the eye cream from Body Merry and my crinkles are slowly becoming less noticeable. PS:just found out that Body Merry is coming out with a facial cleanser!! so excited!!</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel fresh and clean. ..love the smell</li>
    <li> Very light and non greasy. Smells amazing!! The serum is wonderful too! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a great under makeup moisturizer. I was wrong. If you have dry skin at all, it&#x27;s too lightweight to use alone. I had to buy another, thicker moisturizer to layer on top of this. I&#x27;ve only been using this a week so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s too soon to see any kind of real results but it does smell great!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the performance of this product.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I hope to see great results with time!</li>
    <li> Love it- mostly bc I haven&#x27;t had any problems no more break outs never to greasy and I always feel properly moisturized.  I have been using it along side a few other products when I decided my skin regime needed an overhaul- I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to order it again-</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! Soaks right into my skin for a flawless makeup application.  I have seen a definite it improvement  in my skin. Love it.!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  So far has been a good moisturizer.  No breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, highly-effective and economical solution for anyone troubled by dry and flecking skin on face and neck. After a long and hard winter, I knew I had to do something about the condition of my face. I was plagued by scaly patches and cracking. It hurt to frown (my life is unpleasant, so I frown often). As a male in my sixties, I had no idea about what to do. I chose Body Merry’s Super C-22 Moisturizer because I have had tremendous satisfaction with their Anti-Aging Eye Cream. After less than 2 weeks of use, Super C-22 has made a difference that is, in short, remarkable. All of the dry patches have disappeared, as well as the itching and tightness. It seems that some of my wrinkles have smoothed out too! The relief is marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;Super C-22 is non-greasy, absorbs immediately and has a pleasant citrus scent. It makes a fabulous after-shave balm and does not stain dress shirt collars! I cannot say enough about this product and I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> I dont normally review products, but I had to write a review for Body Merry.  While the product wasn&#x27;t good for my skin, I.e. I had more breakouts (I have sensitive skin) and I just didn&#x27;t notice any benefits, the company stood by their warranty and gave the full refund.  Customer service was outstanding.</li>
    <li> A small amount of moisturizer will cover a lot of skin area. I&#x27;ve tried several types of moisturizers and this is the best one by far.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and the way my skin feels! Looking forward to future results!</li>
    <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this moisturizer since buying it about a month ago. It makes my dry, sensitive skin feel nourished and a lot less tight. I enjoy the citrusy scent and it&#x27;s not too overwhelming (I&#x27;m not a big scented lotion fan). Even my hubby likes it, we may have to order more soon!</li>
    <li> I like it, it makes my skin look great!</li>
    <li> Liking the way my face feels.  A tiny bit goes a long way. Need more time to make a comment on how it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Used a lot of other moisturizing creams for men and I like this Vitamin C moisturizer the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day since receiving it and it is really nice.  It is so easy to use and is not drying as vitamin C products often are. I am beginning to see a difference in the brightness  of my skin.  I would recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for the greatest skincare, so, when I stumbled upon this vitamin C moisturizer, I had to give it a try. Although, I have only been using the serum about one week now, I have seen a difference in my skin. It improved the overall clarity of my skin making it look smoother and healthier. Also my skin is firm and have better tone now. Love this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference after just one use. I have recently had a bit of dry skin issues around my nose and this has really helped it.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I haven&#x27;t felt much improvement. For the price I would recommend Aqua Glycolic instead. I also got a drop of it on my shirt and it completely bleached it out so be careful when putting it on!</li>
    <li> This product was tested by me. I love it! Vitamin c is very nourishing for the skin. I&#x27;ve used it daily on my face and my complexion glows. No more little patches of dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  It does have a scent but the scent is a light citrusy scent and was not heavy at all.  I also liked the fact that it was not oily, gritty or heavy feeling.  Instead it went on light and easy and felt good afterwards.</li>
    <li> First off this stuff smells amazing! I love it as a lighter moisturizer at night. I saw brighter clearer skin with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to be a new favorite in my routine.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great. And the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, oily residue on my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for one of my girlfriends. She&#x27;s always complaining about her freckles and sun-aged skin. I told her about using Vitamin C products to help diminish the dark spots and lines. This moisturizer was perfect for her sun damaged skin. While most moisturizers only contain 10% Vitamin C, this one contains 22%, plus it has added ingredients such as Aloe Vera, Organic Sunflower Oil, Palm Oil, Clementine Essential Oil, Shea Butter and Jojoba Oil. These are all great in fighting the signs of aging and keeping the skin looking and feeling healthy. This moisturizer is light and does not leave any heavy oil residue. My friend loves it and swears by it now. I purchased this on promo. Knowing the benefits of the key ingredients in this moisturizer, I knew it was something that my friend would love and use on a daily basis. She swears by this moisturizer now.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. I am using their under eye cream as well. You can feel all natural, no harsh chemicals in it. I use it at night before bed time. My face looks wonderful in the morning.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Face is looking much nicer, dry patches are disappearing.</li>
    <li> Love both products and service was excellent!</li>
    <li> Excellent.. This is a must to try. Works wonders</li>
    <li> I love it!  It has helped with my red spots and particularly after I had some laser done on these.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Honestly this is the best face and neck cream I&#x27;ve found. I used to use a vitamin C serum, which I liked, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize like this cream by Body Merry does. My face and neck are noticeably firmer since I started using it. I absolutely LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> This light weight moisturizer is incredibly moisturizing without being greasy! I love the delicious citrus-y scent. This moisturizer is perfect for the summer time heat.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice moisturizer and smells good.  I&#x27;ll certainly order again.</li>
    <li> What a great find!  This is a great moisturizer, with a very pleasant, natural mild scent.  The pump is precise for delivering small amounts, which is all you need of this product.  I find it very soothing as an aftershave as well, zero burn.  The ingredients are excellent too; no artificial chemicals that I recall. I hope they make this product for the next 50 years so I don&#x27;t have to be looking around for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Very. Pleased with this moisturizer. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Love it !! Smoother skin &amp;amp; plumper - all I could ask for !! I too read reviews &amp;amp; that sold me to buy - so happy I did !!! Bottle 2 now !!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin supple, I use it daily, morning and night.  I believe its improved my skin texture.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product is guaranteed money back if you do not like it or it does not work for you and any company that stands beside their products nowadays is rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am a product tester and reviewer and I give unbiased opinions on products for the consumer and companies I provide feedback for.  I am 42 years old with skin that runs combination to dry. I do have pigmentation problems arising from the onset of menopause.  First impressions are:  This product is non greasy, has no mineral oil and performed well on daily use under makeup.  I would not use this product in the night time alone without additional moisturizer but, during the day it is good.  There is no SPF so if that is a concern of yours, you will have to provide your own.  The quality of ingredients and size you receive in this product are at a good price point, comparable to natural/national brands you will find in a drug/natural food store.  In fact, in my opinion this is better than them.  This has a nice orange scent without the addition of perfumes (when perfumes are added, be suspicious)  In time, with use, I am hoping that I will see a reduction of spots and pigmentation deposits.</li>
    <li> I have a mild case of exzema and I have been trying to find something to take the discomfort away. When I received this product I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try it. And although you can see the spots on my arms from the exzema I didn&#x27;t feel any discomfort for about 6 hrs.</li>
    <li> Feels like it melts into skin leaving it so soft. I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-aging part yet because I have only used for a week. Bonus....this has not caused me to breakout like many other lotions.</li>
    <li> Really work! Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> This cream smells wonderful and feels great.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  i don;t use makeup but wanted something natural and good for my face. thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a month now and so far, so good. I use it after their serum 6 and my face is so soft and more even toned. I am 60 years old, fair-skinned redhead with some broken capillaries and this moisturizer provides the right balance of moisture, but not overly greasy, does not cause breakouts or problems.... and does not interfere with my makeup.....in fact, it enhances it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price......excellent product and really nice company to do business with. If you ever email or contact them, they are courteous and helpful. I will continue to use, along with their other wonderful products for as along as they are making them!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful with trying new ones. I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a try. It&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;ll be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love.  I can see why everyone loves this moisturizer. Lush, yet light. Really, just right. And it smells great. The ingredients list is impressive. Yay!</li>
    <li> I have been using this a few days now. So far so good. I have already started noticing the difference!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very sensitive skin and many products I have tried in the past have caused redness in my face. This one does not. It has a wonderful, light citrus scent and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Pleasant orange smell, very easy  to dispense and control the small amount that you need and an excellent moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is a Great moisturizer. It is a nice size bottle also. It really leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Makes my skin feel smooth. Makeup application is a breeze. Does not help with my breakouts, but does not make them worse. I  so impressed with the price and quality of the products from this company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve on my second bottle of this moisturizer and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It goes on smoothly, leaves no shiny finish, absorbs easily and leaves my face and neck feeling nicely moisturized. It also smells wonderful, with a nice orange scent. The only thing that would make me like it more is if it had SPF, but I&#x27;ve been able to find a mineral SPF I can apply.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Smells awesome,not greasy and hydrates very well. I notice a difference in my skin. I am sensitive to many products,not this one. Just perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and even better when combined with Body Merry&#x27;s 22% Vitamin C serum! Within a few days of using this moisturizer in the morning and at night my face already showed improvement. My skin is so soft I notice myself touching my face occasionally. I&#x27;m always hesitant when I try new skincare products because I have sensitive acne prone skin. Thankfully this stuff didn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts even at the beginning of using it. This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have any artificial fragrances or harsh chemicals in it and it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin. Also, it&#x27;s made in the USA and not tested on animals. This is a quality moisturizer and a great purchase! Highly recommended. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is wonderful!  It feels so soothing when I apply it and after using for over a month, my face feels so much softer and moisturized...plus my face looks brighter and even toned!&lt;br /&gt;I  will definitely keep using ever day...thanks for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!! Will continue to buy over and over again! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what all the hype was about. I liked the smell (very fresh) and I liked how light it was, no greasiness on my face, but I wasn&#x27;t sure why people were so madly in love with this product. Then after a few weeks I noticed that my nose had quit peeling. My nose in particular is very dry and has peeled regularly for years. I&#x27;ve used super thick moisturizers and night creams, lotions, oils, etc. and nothing would completely keep it from being flaky. Somehow this product did it though. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, so I didn&#x27;t even realize it at first, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, through different seasons/weather, and still no peeling. Apparently this is very good for dry flaky skin.</li>
    <li> Love it ! And it smells yummy</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well and smells great. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and even better when combined with Body Merry&#x27;s 22% Vitamin C serum!

    <li> My skin is glowing. My skin has never felt better or looked better. I am in my 30&amp;#34;s and am starting to worry about aging. I feel that if I continue to use this product that I would not have to worry to much about aging.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of oranges that this product has.  Moisturizes and feels great.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Even though i don&#x27;t see a change in my wrinkles the moisturizer hasn&#x27;t given me blemishes and isn&#x27;t super greasy. I would buy this again just for that.</li>
    <li> I do like its absorbency and smell. It melts right in and no greasy. I do apply again over the night after shower cause it does smelly really good in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;It does repair in winter skin. I tried it on my hands first. My hands a extremely dry to the point it&#x27;s flaky and I feel uncomfortable. This cream fixed the problem after 3 days of using. Skin is back to its normal condition.&lt;br /&gt;This is a big bottle for face and neck use. I like the pump as well. Easy to use</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this serum on my skin!</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell very nice (like oranges, but it&#x27;s subtle and not overwhelming), this is definitely a great moisturizer.  I use it at night in conjunction with the BodyMerry Best Vitamin C Serum.  I have combination skin and hormonal acne so I have to be careful about the facial products I select, but my skin is much clearer and healthier looking since I started using these products.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Great face moisturizer- I use twice daily in am and pm, smooth texture which is difficult to find in some expensive moisturizers (not too heavy and not too watered down). Noticeably improved skin! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  I&#x27;ve tried serums before and although they are supposed to be good they dry on my skin immediately and I don&#x27;t know how they sink into the skin.  This cream, however, is great and I leave on for a few minutes before applying my makeup and it seems to sink in and do the job.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I use this with the rest of the Body Merry line and love it. I love the light orange scent.  I am over 50 so the vitamin C is perfect. Lightens and brightens my face.</li>
    <li> used this moisturizer associated with the Body Merry Pro-A serum over a month now, skin feels more supple &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer and help bleach out sun damage.  Used after a TCA peel.</li>
    <li> Nice product, I just started using it so no noticeable results yet but the texture is good and the smell is nice, although it is a bit like putting orange juice on my face. Excellent customer service and no complaints.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product so far. My skin soaks up the moisturizer - easy to apply with pump dispenser and goes on smoothly. Experience with seller was very positive. Excited to see the long term results using this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I had long heard about the benefits of Vitamin C-based moistuizer and creams, and this is perhaps one of the best moisturizers I have ever used! This is a fantastic product. The moistuizer itself is light and has a fresh, organic orange scent. A little goes a long way for this because a couple of pumps is enough to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a moistuizer that would brighten my complexion but isn&#x27;t oily or irritates my skin. I am happy to say that it leaves your skin brightened and evens out the tone and texture. You end up with a nice glow and I am more than satisfied! I will definitely purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of Super C moisturizer cream.  I apply this after I first apply a Vitamin C serum.  I think they work well together.  It does not make my skin feel greasy at all and gives it a nice glow.  I will continue to use this product.  My 19 year old daughter had been using this without my knowledge.  I was talking to her the other day and noticed that her face had a pretty glow to it.  I told her that she has really nice/healthy looking skin and that&#x27;s when she admitted shes been using my Vitamin C moisturizer lol.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful Vitamin C Moisturizer for the face. It does not irritate my skin, in fact it hydrates it quite nicely without feeling greasy.  and a little bit of this goes a long way.It goes onto your face easily and soaks right in. Your face feels light and airy. No heavy weighed down feeling you get with some facial lotions. The scent of this lotion is very nice and pleasant. It makes my skin feel moisturized and soft as well. I love all the natural and organic ingredients in this lotion, including, Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Sunflower Oil, Palm Oil, Clementine Essential Oil, Shea Butter and Jojoba Oil.</li>
    <li> Definite improvement in skin tone in just 2 weeks! I have a lot of redness in my cheeks and between my brows (not rosacea or acne, just redness) and it is greatly reduced. Be warned that the bottle looks really small when you receive it, but you don&#x27;t need to use much so don&#x27;t panic. Spreads easy and has a pleasant citrus scent that is not overpowering. I will say that if you use this along with the Super 6 serum (also by Body Merry) that if you don&#x27;t allow the serum to dry completely it can lather the moisturizer. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results at 8 weeks!</li>
    <li> I love the smell but after several weeks of using it twice a day I have not seen any results as for as condition of my skin.  Still have the normal dry/ wrinkles at 55. Will continue with this bottle.</li>
    <li> Wow! I really like this moisturizer. Overtime it&#x27;s removing the melasma on the sides of my face. I have used so many expensive products like meladerm, clinique smart, clinique even better and many other ones trying to clear it up but only managed to clear only acne spots but not the melasma until I got this moisturizer. It&#x27;s really awesome but requires patient if u&#x27;re treating something like melasma. Anyway, I use it once a day instead of two and it&#x27;s working for me. I guess if I&#x27;m using it twice daily, melasma would have become a history to me. I&#x27;m still using my first bottle and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This cream smells so good ( like oranges) any time I put it on my face I want to eat&lt;br /&gt;it. I love this cream. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I use after the Body Merry hyaluronic acid serum.  This moisturizer smells like oranges so confident it is full of Vitamin C that is active.  Light but very effective.  My skin is clear and glowing.  Love Body Merry products.  Love this company.  I feel this has taken years off of my face.  Could not be happier and have ordered again and again.  Loyal customer!</li>
    <li> First off-I could take a bath in this!  The scent is my favorite-a light soft orange-Yum!! As if that isn&#x27;t enough, this light cream soaks in my skin &amp; makes it happy.  I can also use it on my chest without breaking out- usually I get little bumps on my chest when I use any serum or cream on it.  I am thoroughly satisfied with this Vitamin C from Body Merry.  I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  This a keeper! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Love it, smells divine!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that in my opinion is really worth the money. I love how soft my face feels and the smell is also nice. I plan to reorder again.</li>
    <li> I am sooo impressed with this lotion, really. I have very dry, red, irritated, oily acne prone skin and was nervous to try anything new for fear of breaking out. I am SO glad I just decided to try it. I am oily on my T zone and very dry everywhere else. With this cream my skin stayed hydrated and soft the next morning after forgetting to pack my cream at an overnight stay. I am already on my second bottle, and my 90 year old grandma asked what I&#x27;ve been using on my skin because it no longer looks red,  irritated and dry. I bought some for her an she loves it. I wish I would have taken before pictures</li>
    <li> This caused my face to peel. There was no other difference when using this.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It feels wonderful on my skin. This company&#x27;s products deliver!  I&#x27;m using this as well as their neck firming cream (see that review), and am thrilled with both. Thank you, Body Merry!</li>
    <li> Smells like tangerines, so delightful and feels especially silky going on.  At my age, I am not expecting miracles, but just hoping not to lose any more ground.  I love this product.  Actually got an email from the body merry folks wishing me well and and thanking me for purchasing their product.  You  could have knocked  me over with a feather!.  Very reasonably priced, wonderful product that does  exactly what it promises.  Doesn&#x27;t get any better, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer has a pleasant light citrus scent. It does not irritate my skin and I&#x27;m sensitive to some sun screens and make-up. So, I was glad that this moisturizer did not cause issues for me. It is not greasy or heavy on my skin. So far, after 2 weeks, the results are very good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! When you use this first thing in the morning as a regime to moisturize your skin its so refreshing. I wake up and first thing I do is put this on.  The fresh smell of oranges is just so nice in the mornings. I use this with the Super 6 Serum which is a different review you will have to read. This leaves my face feeling so nourished and hydrated. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Received the goods too good product is also very good condition. I think I called Fantastic and good products.</li>
    <li> exelent! My skin look&#x27;s much better in every way after 2 weeks used.I recommended highly this product to everybody,no matter what is your ages. I LOVE IT!  GEORGINA  ( I over 60 ages)</li>
    <li> i purchased this a few weeks ago and i&#x27;m very pleased with it. 1. the smell is amazing 2. it goes on perfectly and gives my face a vibrant look 3. it will not make your face look greased, even if you apply too much. 4. that smell!!!</li>
    <li> Light-weight but very moisturizing  on my normal to dry skin. Melts into my skin.  Very light citrus fragrance is nice, disappears quickly.  Really like the air-tight dispenser, keeps vitamin C from being affected by the air.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing, light weight moisturizer that makes my skin so soft and it feels so healthy.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer with a lot of great vitamins and antioxidants for youthful skin.  It goes on very light and sheer while also spreading nicely.  It absorbs well and has a great feel.</li>
    <li> Convenient to use.  Seems to be an effective product.  I have been looking for a good affordable source of topical vitamin C.  Combined with a moisturizer......perfect.</li>
    <li> i like it .. thanks got this at discounted price</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have used from this company and I am so happy with the results thus far! It goes on smoothly and helps keep my skin nourished without the oily feeling that some other moisturizers leave. I have recommended it to several friends and so far they are pleased as well!</li>
    <li> This was a very light lotion that made my skin feel nice and smooth after I applied it. I swear my skin seems brighter and clearer in the mornings after I use this at night.</li>
    <li> Body Merry has fantastic products and great customer service! I love everything I&#x27;ve tried from them so far, including the super C moisturizer. It&#x27;s lightweight, but very hydrating. I turned 30 last year and have some fine lines and dark spots I hate and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. Body Merry has made a huge difference in my skin. I will be a customer for ever!!</li>
    <li> Great I use it every day.  Wish it came with a tint and spf of 30 or more.  Makes my face feel soft.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to notice long term benefits, but I certainly like the ingredients, the ease with which it soaks into my skin, and the way it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.  Even though the product size is generous in comparison with most other industry competitors, all of the benefits I mentioned previously are gained by using just a very small amount of the product. I have added this to my daily moisturizing regiment and plan or many future repurchases.  MANY THANKSFOR A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you! My wife loves using this! Works great</li>
    <li> Has a nice pleasant citrus scent, and keeps my face moisturized, also you only need a small dap to cover face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It is non-greasy &amp; absorbs well into the skin. I am so happy that I found the Body Merry line. Their products are a nice quality.</li>
    <li> it stings a little when I put it on. My skin is very dry. I am not sure it&#x27;s good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I saw this Vitamin C.moisturizer  so I read why it was touted to be so good. I had 3 areas that I wanted to tone up.  I had hip surgery last year and my leg swelled terribly. I decided to give this a try. Well I was so amazed at how well it worked I used it on my face and neck.  Along with a light exercise routine the skin on my thigh it started looking normal within a few weeks.  My face and neck were no where near the condition of my leg but my skin is toned, supple, and glowing. Unless you knew me you would never guess my age.  I love the Vita C 22% moisturizer with and CoQ10 niacinamide and hyaluronic acid .  A combination made  by the Gods. I am going to use this for the rest of my life. I&#x27;ll bet they come up with more products, but for now this is perfection. This is the best cream with the best price that does everything you want it to do. In a small metered pump it tightens and tones and fades brown spots. You get nearly 2 ounces and a small amt. will cover a lot of area.  The aroma is a fresh tangy orange scent and I love it. I cannot find one thing wrong with this moisturizer. I completely recommend this to anyone at any age who want skin that is stunning to look at and to touch.</li>
    <li> my skin looks and feels better!</li>
    <li> Early to review this, but it feels and smells great.  Very nice company too.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome like oranges</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this product so far on my skin. Experienced mild brightening in just a few weeks, better overall skin feel, and smoother skin as well. Using it in combination with hylauronic acid compound on my face and neck area and have had nothing but excellent results.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with this cream. It smells delicious and you can feel the very light burn/sting of high vitamin c content after you apply which tells me this product is the real deal. I don&#x27;t feel this is a product that will give instant results but rather wil over time. I also use it more as a serum, with a seperate moisturizer on top, since it can be a little drying.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love this moisturizer..</li>
    <li> Love the product. ..service exceptional and I will order again for sure!</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer!! It&#x27;s light and smells delicious!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Face feels great for an old guy!</li>
    <li> I like this product so far.  Light citrus scent.  It goes on slightly sticky so I personally only use it at night.  Skin feels softer and appears brighter.  Overall, satisfied.</li>
    <li> Smell just like an orange, and creamy and hydrated feel. So much smoother after putting it on. it works so well with putting makeup on, makes the power blend so much better. The skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all, just like magic, dry and then all hydrated. Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> I used the product for nearly a month. I have very sensitive skin so I followed the sensitive skin directions. It was wonderful. No irritation and very fresh smelling. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my face, and the orange smell is great!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
