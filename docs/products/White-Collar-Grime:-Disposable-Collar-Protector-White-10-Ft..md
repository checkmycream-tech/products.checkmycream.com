      <li>It has helped me get more use out of my shirts.</li>

      <li>wonderful, no stains on my precious white shirt.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>That works well on most fabrics, although it doesn&#x27;t hold as well on fuzzy fabrics.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product, as I have searched for quite a while for something that can keep my shirt collars, bright and clean.</li>
      <li>here, first it does not stick too good and it curls up on edge of tape.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Sticks and stays on well, but easy to remove at end of day.</li>
      <li>It would be helpful if there was a easy peel system.  </li>
      <li>I am easily bothered by garment tags.</li>
      <li>This item arrived very quickly (before the anticipated date.</li>

      <li>Struck to collar easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve realize the best way is to rip it a little bit to expose the backing and then go from there.  </li>
      <li>Feels plenty comfortable.</li>
      <li>Comfortable.  </li>
      <li>adhesive is a tad on the light side, but I suspect that was by design.</li>
      <li>I have been using them for a long time now and happy to see them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This protector keeps the collar clean.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice soft exterior that wont irritate your neck!  </li>
      <li>would love to keep buying more when i run out soon enough</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it took me so long to locate this product, and I will be buying many more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only a roll of fabric tape, however, and while it&#x27;s good quality, it&#x27;s not unnoticeable when you apply it, so that you cannot apply it to the higher portion of your collar.</li>
      <li>The cotton makes for a very breathable and comfortable feel.</li>
      <li>Alas, this is still the best solution out there in the market.  </li>
      <li>The idea behind this is excellent.</li>
      <li>Useful product, thanks Amazon for carrying such variety of good products.</li>
      <li>Super soft and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Kept the collar on my white jean jacket clean and allowed me to get more than one wearing out of it before having to launder.</li>
      <li>Breathable, soft cotton makes it comfortable and, if stuck on correctly, will work as advertised.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly when wearing white shirts, and in the inside of my Panama hat on hot days.</li>
      <li>but I suggest you try the tape first</li>
      <li>These white collar grime protectors are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This product really saves me a lot of time.  </li>
      <li>Although we&#x27;d like to wash our shirts immediately, sometimes you may in a situation where they aren&#x27;t very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>We really like this product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s much easier to treat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough to toss or repurpose.</li>
      <li>, this is very functional with the exception of how you take the backing off the disposable collar.</li>
      <li>it really does what it says....</li>
      <li>There are two main problems:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>After trying this product several times, I was only mildly satisfied.</li>
      <li>This has saved many of my shirts, especialy the white ones from that permanent and gross sweat stains during the humid summer months.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The major problem I encountered, is that it does not sufficiently cover the higher portion of the collar.</li>
      <li>Was hoping it&#x27;d be reusable for a few more times</li>
      <li>The texture of this protector feels exactly like cotton, making it unnoticeable around your neck for the whole entire day.  </li>
      <li>Since I live in the Florida heat, I suffer with ring around the collar.</li>
      <li>The adhesive will not work well on a brand new unwashed or undrycleaned shirt.</li>
      <li>Since I have discovered it I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>So while it does protect the middle of the collar, the higher portion of the collar is still prone to the dirt, and oil, that gathers on the collar.</li>
      <li>I would suggest that maybe the company could design a CONTOURED design, that adheres to the natural shape of the collar, in order to provide maximum coverage.</li>
      <li>and i dont really need to brush and wash my white shirt collar again!</li>
      <li>It made out of some soft cotton, so no irritation on neck.</li>
      <li>Simple idea, works very well.  </li>
      <li>The result is that the material doesn&#x27;t really protect the shirt entirely.  </li>
      <li>Husband likes them, they are soft and don&#x27;t irritate his neck.</li>
      <li>The workaround is easy enough: once you&#x27;ve stuck the protector on, give it a few minutes for the glue to bond.</li>
      <li>second, the tape is not wide enough to lap over the collar a little because that is where the dirt settle on top where the  collar folds over.</li>
      <li>A bit expensive, but there really aren&#x27;t too many (if any) alternates out there.</li>
      <li>The cloth-like material of the strip blends in well with the general material of a shirt collar.</li>
      <li>Soft enough to reduce the chafing on your neck.  </li>
      <li>Soft white linen with adhesive backing.  </li>
      <li>Kind of expensive in my opinion but just wanted to try it out.</li>
      <li>They work really well to keep your shirt neck line from browning due to sweat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You simply need to measure, cut, and apply it directly to your inner collar.  </li>
      <li>Because of the way a collar curves, your first few applications might be off</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply to firm, stationary internal hat bands, but a little difficult to position correctly to the more flexible ones.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made in keeping my shirt collars grime free. Everyone who owns a button down shirt should buy this. NOW!</li>
    <li> if you wear white collars daily especially lab coats, yellow collars are inevitable---this product solves it. cover the  the inside collar with this tape and easily peel it off at the end of the day saves a lot of pre treating that doesn&#x27;t always work well .it&#x27;s soft and comfortable and less expensive the whites if collar stains are a problem .</li>
    <li> I regularly wear collared shirts. Since I live in the Florida heat, I suffer with ring around the collar. However, this product has worked to protect my shirt&#x27;s collar. The cotton makes for a very breathable and comfortable feel. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent below the crease, but has not solved the grime problem at the crease.</li>
    <li> Definitely protects the collar from neck grime. When you peel it off, the collar is completely white. The adhesive will not work well on a brand new unwashed or undrycleaned shirt. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> one time purchase. as advertised.</li>
    <li> very disappointed by the product. it really does what it says.... however, to get the paper-backing off the adhesive is the most annoying process.  very very very difficult to do. the adhesive is a very thin glue, which is topped by a very thin cotton cloth.  i usually ended up splitting the glue from the cloth, rather than the glue from the backing.     ALSO, they are not re-usable.  this may seem obvious, and it probably is.  but after you apply it, definitely take it off before washing.  it will leave a bad glue residue on your shirts.    ultimately, i think the product is not very good, and not worth it.  if you get collar rings, what i suggest is lightly scrubbing the collar with warm water and soap before taking it to the cleaners.</li>
    <li> This is an item that comes in very handy at times. I use it mostly when wearing white shirts, and in the inside of my Panama hat on hot days. The only down side is that it only last for a few hours and cannot be reused. These disposable collar protectors would have been more attractive if offered at a lower price.</li>
    <li> I wish it was stickier</li>
    <li> Really handy product. Good at what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
    <li> The idea behind this is excellent. You can protect your expensive shirts from collar grime. It&#x27;s only a roll of fabric tape, however, and while it&#x27;s good quality, it&#x27;s not unnoticeable when you apply it, so that you cannot apply it to the higher portion of your collar.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok. Kind of expensive in my opinion but just wanted to try it out. Does its job but you might still get some dirt on the top bend of the collar. Was hoping it&#x27;d be reusable for a few more times but it doesn&#x27;t re-stick.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that prevents stain around your dress shirt collar to prolong the life of your shirt, this is it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply need to measure, cut, and apply it directly to your inner collar.  The texture of this protector feels exactly like cotton, making it unnoticeable around your neck for the whole entire day.  I no longer have to scrub the collar before washing my shirts, simply peel of the sticker and into the washer they go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prolong your dress shirt and increase your washing time with this great product!!</li>
    <li> Annoyed me but my husband &amp;#34;Didn&#x27;t think it was bad at all&amp;#34;.  Guess you should just try it for yourself.  It&#x27;s cheap enough to toss or repurpose.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use the product because it&#x27;s so hard to separate it from the sticky tape backing. I spent several minutes trying to get the tape off, but no luck! Can&#x27;t do this in the a.m.</li>
    <li> What a nice product. Protects the collar as advertised. Sticks and stays on well, but easy to remove at end of day.</li>
    <li> These are good idea that needs improvement. They don&#x27;t stick well to fabric. Had to toss them out. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> This thing is really awesome. I just stick the tape on the collar and i dont really need to brush and wash my white shirt collar again!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, as I have searched for quite a while for something that can keep my shirt collars, bright and clean. After trying this product several times, I was only mildly satisfied. The major problem I encountered, is that it does not sufficiently cover the higher portion of the collar.

I would suggest that maybe the company could design a CONTOURED design, that adheres to the natural shape of the collar, in order to provide maximum coverage.</li>
    <li> I have to wear white shirts for work everyday and I use these to protect my collars. I have been using them for a long time now and happy to see them on Amazon. They work really well to keep your shirt neck line from browning due to sweat. I don&#x27;t think there is a perfect solution but this is about as close as you can get.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Kept the collar on my white jean jacket clean and allowed me to get more than one wearing out of it before having to launder. Super soft and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Good product, wore my shirt about 5 times before changing the strip.  Strip stays in place.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply to firm, stationary internal hat bands, but a little difficult to position correctly to the more flexible ones.  Since I haven&#x27;t worn a hat with it in place yet, time will tell how well it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Soft white linen with adhesive backing.  Struck to collar easily.  No problems pulling adhesive covers off.  This should eliminate the ring around the collar that dry cleaning does not seem to get rid off.</li>
    <li> Since I have discovered it I can&#x27;t live without. It has helped me get more use out of my shirts. My collars don&#x27;t wear out like before.</li>
    <li> These strips are advertised for shirt collars but I use it on the inside sweatband of my baseball caps. It keeps the sweatband from getting dirty and the soft cotton is comfortable against my forehead.  When the strip gets dirty I just replace it with a clean one and keep my hats in new condition.  I haven&#x27;t gone through the box yet but I&#x27;d guess it will cover about 20 hats.</li>
    <li> Honestly, these are the best. I hate the dirt rim around my collar after a day at work. I can wear a shirt two, maybe three times (of course with an undershirt) before I have to take them to get dry cleaned and the collars are stained. Give them a shot</li>
    <li> Amazing Product, and speedy delivery. I don&#x27;t know how it took me so long to locate this product, and I will be buying many more. Thanks</li>
    <li> excellent product for someone who sweats alot</li>
    <li> Useful product, thanks Amazon for carrying such variety of good products.</li>
    <li> I am usually in air conditioned areas so the only part of my shirt which gets dirty are the cuffs and collars.  This protector keeps the collar clean.  You can wear the shirt with the protector a few times till it gets dirty then wear the shirt without! Feels plenty comfortable.</li>
    <li> Breathable, soft cotton makes it comfortable and, if stuck on correctly, will work as advertised. Because of the way a collar curves, your first few applications might be off but that&#x27;s hardly the manufacturer&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive is a tad on the light side, but I suspect that was by design. A stronger glue might have left some of itself on the garment. Not a good thing for a product intended to protect. The workaround is easy enough: once you&#x27;ve stuck the protector on, give it a few minutes for the glue to bond. It&#x27;ll be good for the rest of the day, even if you leave that top button undone.</li>
    <li> We really like this product.</li>
    <li> This product really saves me a lot of time.  Sometimes I only wear a dress shirt for a short period of 3-4 hours.  This really saves me time in not having to worry about a dirty collar.  Although not reusable and you do need to remove before washing.  As for those complaining about it not being reusable.  It does state disposable on the packaging which I took to mean when you are done with it and need to wash the shirt remove and throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to peel (not sure what others complaining about this are talking about) the center of the backing is cut down the middle making peeling it a breeze.</li>
    <li> I am easily bothered by garment tags. I cut off a strip of this and put it over the tag. That works well on most fabrics, although it doesn&#x27;t hold as well on fuzzy fabrics. I remove the strip when I launder the garment, then reapply before next wearing.  One roll has lasted me for several years. Now I&#x27;m back to buy another roll.</li>
    <li> The disposable collar is one of those accessories that enhance the suit and tie experience similar to collar stays and a tie bar.  This has saved many of my shirts, especialy the white ones from that permanent and gross sweat stains during the humid summer months.  Although we&#x27;d like to wash our shirts immediately, sometimes you may in a situation where they aren&#x27;t very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In concept, this is very functional with the exception of how you take the backing off the disposable collar. I&#x27;ve torn it at 45 degrees, cut it with scissors and it is just painful to use because of the difficulty.  I&#x27;ve realize the best way is to rip it a little bit to expose the backing and then go from there.  It would be helpful if there was a easy peel system.  Additionally, since this company has the monopoly, it is overpriced for a piece of tape and cloth on it.  Maybe when other versions come out, the price will come down.  Alas, this is still the best solution out there in the market.  I would give 5 stars but in frustration I have thrown this box at the wall at least a couple of times - so 4 for now.  I&#x27;ve used this product for two years and I like it, but want to love it.</li>
    <li> It has a nice soft exterior that wont irritate your neck!  A little bit on the pricey side but if it prolongs the life of my shirts and prevents ring around the collar....  I am happy!  This item arrived very quickly (before the anticipated date.</li>
    <li> These white collar grime protectors are easy to use.  These protect the shirt collars from sweat and don&#x27;t mark the collar.</li>
    <li> This is nearly unusable because the paper backing is extremely difficult to remove.  At least one other reviewer pointed this out, and my experience was the same.  It essentially makes it a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Eh you might just get away with using medical tape and call it a day for cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;This one is softer than medical tape but I suggest you try the tape first and it doesn&#x27;t work for you&lt;br /&gt;buy this one.</li>
    <li> wonderful, no stains on my precious white shirt. would love to keep buying more when i run out soon enough</li>
    <li> It keeps the grime from sticking to my white shirt collars. That is what I bought it for. I like it!</li>
    <li> Solid product.  Does as advertised.  Comfortable.  Easy to use.  But a bit too expensive to make me a committed customer.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. You just have to cut the length, peel and stick. Voila, now all these nasty stuffs only goes on the tape. It made out of some soft cotton, so no irritation on neck. Great for summer! The down side is, these runs out fairly quick and they are expensive.</li>
    <li> The strip adheres well to the shirt when firmly applied. The cloth-like material of the strip blends in well with the general material of a shirt collar. Consequently, the strip does not look too gaudy when the color of the strip does not match the color pattern of the shirt. But the advertised absorbent nature of the strip may be undesirable to users who want to periodically wipe excessive stains off the collar during the course of a day.</li>
    <li> Very nice product that is just as described in narrative!!</li>
    <li> I like the product and so does my wife.  You still have some staining around the edge of the collar but it&#x27;s not as bad and it&#x27;s much easier to treat.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea in concept but not in execution.  There are two main problems:&lt;br /&gt;1. you can&#x27;t re-use the protectors.  Once you put it on a shirt, that&#x27;s it.  You either have to re-wear the shirt without washing it or peel and throw away the protector.  Perhaps you&#x27;ll get through 1-2 weeks before running out of material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The white color is too noticeable, even on a white shirt.  To conceal the protector, you have to apply it lower on the collar than you might want. The result is that the material doesn&#x27;t really protect the shirt entirely.  You still wind up with ring around the collar.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these!</li>
    <li> 2-reason here, first it does not stick too good and it curls up on edge of tape. second, the tape is not wide enough to lap over the collar a little because that is where the dirt settle on top where the  collar folds over.</li>
    <li> Husband likes them, they are soft and don&#x27;t irritate his neck. He just wishes the roll was longer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear a shirt without this collar guard. Great product. Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Simple idea, works very well.  Keeps your collars from collecting skin oils and getting &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;.  Soft enough to reduce the chafing on your neck.  A bit expensive, but there really aren&#x27;t too many (if any) alternates out there.</li>
    <li> Great. No complaints.</li>
