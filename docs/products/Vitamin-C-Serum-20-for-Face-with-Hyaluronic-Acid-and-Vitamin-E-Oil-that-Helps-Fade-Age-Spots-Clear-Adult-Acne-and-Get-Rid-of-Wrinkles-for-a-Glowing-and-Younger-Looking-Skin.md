<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing! My skin looks so bright and healthy now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kleem&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for a little over a month.  As a beauty blogger, I receive ton of products that work (some that don&#x27;t) so when I receive a product I am totally critical.  I must say Kleem is one of the best Vitamin C Serums I have tried.  The serum has a great consistency, it is easy to spread on, dries quickly and is not greasy nor feels like it has left a residue.  It works great under moisturizers and regular makeup applications.  As far as results, the results are amazing.  My dark marks are fading, my pores seem smaller, and my overall skin just looks healthier and clear!  I seriously recommend this product and it has become a staple in my beauty regimen, and I recommend it to all my clients.</li>
    <li> I am very big on buying products for my face,but this one is far my favorite. I have shopped around looking for a skin tighting cream and this one so far has been my best  one. It leaves your skin really soft and you can feel and see the difference. I absolutely love this product and anyone who tries it is going to absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle of this amazing serum and will soon place an order for two more! It&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve come across and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Definitely a must-have in my daily routine. It has a silky texture, it&#x27;s fast-absorbing and non-sticky and most importantly, does not leave my face with a greasy looking film. I use it morning and night and have experienced an overall improvement in skin tone clarity and firmness. Some stubborn age spots have started fading. It layers very well under light moisturizers or makeup. I also like the packaging - it&#x27;s housed in a airtight pump bottle (no dropper, which would expose the product to air) and each pump dispenses the right amount to cover the whole face. This miracle in a bottle is a winner in my book and I hope it never gets discontinued. Thank you Kleem Organics for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C has become my past friend for the past few years, I never cared so much about my appearance but when I turned the corner of 45 I realized how much the fine lines are bothering me. So when I saw this serum at a great deal to share my honest opinion I ordered right away. I wanted to give it at least a couple of weeks to see results but was surprised after a week only when I noticed  that my skin texture and tone had improve  , looking  tighter  an the  pore size looked smaller to me .It is very fluid and the container is a pump so you can dispense just enough, also is quick absorbed by the skin with a citrus very light smell . Because I live in Hawaii and have a constant sun exposure I am counting on this awesome serum to renew and protect my skin from further damage.</li>
    <li> I am 52 years young soon to be 53 in a couple of days and I have tried so many creams, and serums and the like in my life looking for the best one. Well I think I have found it. It is the Jeunesse Intensive Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum by Kleem Organics. I have not had the results in my skin as I have had with this Vitamin C Serum. I have had it for only a few days but I feel a slight difference in my skin after applying the serum. I have very sensitive skin and do not experience any burning, stinging or any irritation with this serum. There is a slight tightening feeling which is normal. The serum is organic for inducing a natural collagen stimulation enhancing skin elasticity, is 98% natural and does not test on animals which helped greatly in my decision to try the serum. My face feels so soft. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results when using over a longer period of time. This is my honest opinion after trying this product</li>
    <li> I have major sun damage on my face and upper chest and neck area. I&#x27;ve heard about using vitamin c serum to help with  fading them and tightening the skin. So when I was offered this Intensive Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum from Kleem Organics for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week or so and I definitely feel a difference in the tightness of my skin. I haven&#x27;t seen to much fading in my dark spots but its only been a week. I definitely recommend this Intensive Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum from Kleem Organics!</li>
    <li> I really try to put products that called themselves organic through the test.  First, if is really organic I should be able to read the ingredients without any problem. Second, my very streamed sensitive skin should no break out if you are truly organic.  It is my great pleasure to give KLEEM ORGANIC A++++++++ My face feel rejuvenated.  The softness, the pores are tiny, and the skin elasticity is great. Ladies I am glad to see I am 50+ years old and you can look at the pictures I am not the best picture taker but you can judge for yourselves.</li>
    <li> I have been only using it for 3 weeks and I can see a finer &amp; clearer complexion.  It is so light but effective on my skin. I&#x27;m waiting for my dark spots to disappear.</li>
    <li> I tried this product to help with my aging skin.  I like the smell of this, as many other products I have used haven&#x27;t been so pleasant.  I also allowed my daughter to try this.  She has extremely sensitive skin, so I was worried about her using it.  Many products burn her skin when she tries them, but this was sensitive enough for her to use also.  Her acne improved after using this for 2 days, which is great since other acne products makes her face worse.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I just got the Vitamin C Serum , it feels so good over the skin and the smell is fresh lemon aroma the first day my skin glowed, everybody in my office asked what i was wearing. I will post more information as i see more results\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I am a 63 year old female and I am using this Kleem Intensive Vitamin C Serum now for over two weeks, mornings and nights.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. I feel very comfortable putting it on my face. It goes on smooth and has a natural smell. I feel good using it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels good and looks good. I would definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this because I wanted to fade my sun spots and I&#x27;m all for anything anti aging. Well, 6 weeks later, the sun spots I was fading are all gone or 90% faded and still fading. My skin looks healthier, and it&#x27;s smoother. I love the difference this has made for my face! I didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is for those, but it would be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend trying this! I especially love that it&#x27;s organic and cruelty free. Did I mention it also has an airless pump?! This is especially great since Vitamin C loses potency each time it&#x27;s exposed to air, and this one is NEVER exposed to air!</li>
    <li> Great Product sold on the Market!</li>
    <li> I got this item for reviewing purposes because I&#x27;ve tried it in the past and really like the smell. It seem&#x27;s really watery but it smell&#x27;s really good, I&#x27;m exited to see how it work&#x27;s. It came fast and easy to use. It is what it says it is. I put it on my face and that&#x27;s about all you can do really. I just have to wait to see how it does over time. I see kinda some tightness of my skin but nothing to fastly yet. I can&#x27;t wait to see what this product can do as ive seen other say it works wonders for them.</li>
    <li> I love that the instant you put it on your skin you get a wonderful glow. It&#x27;s not moisturizing (for me) but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s suppose to be. Good to put a lotion on your skin additionally. Overall, I would buy it again for sure!</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference in just a couple of uses! My face felt tighter and my pores actually looked smaller, making my overall look much more appealing</li>
    <li> I just received this serum in the mail last week. Since then I have been using in twice a day.  So far I see very little difference. I have plenty of freckles so I&#x27;m looking for something to either take away my freckles or fade them. I see a little fading not a major difference. I like that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It dries really quickly so you can put makeup or moisturizer right after. I will keep using this serum and will update you if removed or faded my freckles.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Packaging was ok. My first complaint is the directions  so tiny I had to have a magnifying glass to read it and then the wording is like broken english.  You must pump quickly to let is shoot into your hand, if you pump slowly it oozes down the side of the bottle. The smell is not bad and goes away quickly. I have used it once a day for a week and have not seen any improvement or tightening - I can feel a slight tightening but do not see any difference. Perhaps I should use it longer - I will report back in another two weeks</li>
    <li> vitamin C is good for your skin i have begun using it daily and have already started to see a change. i have less bags or darkness under my eyes, it helps me to keep that youthful glow to my skin and keep me looking fresh and it helps from getting over dried out from all the makeup and cleaners i use on my face while it also leave your skin wrinkle free and also preventing them before they appear. this 1 oz bottle is enough for about 2 months so its a very good value.</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit odd and it seem really liquid like when you pump it into your hands but this really works.  My dark spots have fade as have my freckles. I have reordered.  I use this under my lotion every day.  After a few weeks really noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Its good stuff I like it.</li>
    <li> This is helpful. I feel my skin is healthier. I use as part of a daily routine.</li>
    <li> I use this on my neck and face and felt immediate results</li>
    <li> I did a patch test with this for a while and I finally found a product that won&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m excited to see some results with the HA serum. Hopefully it&#x27;ll do some good with old hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;ll update my review in a few weeks on whether my face is showing results. I&#x27;m just glad I can use it on sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I wrote a review a few weeks back when I first received this Kleem serum. Since then, I have ordered two bottles so as not to run out. I absolutely love this Kleem serum. It not only helps reduce the facial lines but the feel of the serum after applying makes this a 5-star product. You actually feel the tightening on your skin. It is important to let the serum dry completely before applying other skincare products. A top notch product</li>
    <li> I really like this tightening serum. Makes my face feel clean and tight, Def recommend this!</li>
    <li> Going on two weeks of using this serum and every morning my skin is brighter and glowing more and more. I&#x27;m 29 years old and after my son was born I noticed I was getting a few sunspots. Those sunspots are already much lighter. Very happy about that. And I love it has hyaluronic acid. I love the combination of ingredients and smells amazing. Extra plus that it&#x27;s organic and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> This product is full of nourishing ingredients&lt;br /&gt;minus the toxic fillers.  Most importantly, is&lt;br /&gt;that it contains vitamin C at the right concen-&lt;br /&gt;tration for corrective purposes.  I have been&lt;br /&gt;using this product for a little over 4 weeks now&lt;br /&gt;and it has done wonders for my sun-damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;My pores look smaller and my skin looks more even&lt;br /&gt;toned.  Another good thing about this product is that it&lt;br /&gt;gently yet effectively exfoliates your skin with each&lt;br /&gt;application.  So you don&#x27;t need to use manual scrubs&lt;br /&gt;or any type of chemical exfoliators so often.  The light&lt;br /&gt;citrus scent also makes it appealing to use. While the pump&lt;br /&gt;dispenser helps to protect the product from oxidation.</li>
    <li> i really love this serum, make my skin really smooth and less acne, my skin&#x27;s so happy with it. so after done with the first bottle i immediately order another one. the second one came with different color, smell and consistency. it looks cloudy white (like milk), smell like lemon and the consistency kind of thick. it makes me so confused while the first one i received the consistency kind of thin, light yellow color and the smell like orange. i have no idea. im using the second bottle few days already, so far so good. hopefully it will good as same as the first one</li>
    <li> Kleem Organics has a great multi-purpose facial product.  I love that a single product can take care of so many different issues I&#x27;m facing in my early 40s.  It smells and feels great going on my face and neck.  There is no sticky, icky feeling left behind, it absorbs quickly.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works for me on a long-term basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve notice a little difference with fine lines, but not with my freckles or sun spots. I&#x27;ll update if a see a difference.</li>
    <li> i was slightly disappointed when I received my package in the mail and saw the small size of the bottle. In trying it however, I realize the 1 oz will go a very long way. 1 pump is plenty for the areas where I have dark spots. One of the things l really like in comparison to others is how the foamy texture dries fast with no sticky residue left afterwards. I have only used this product for 3 days, but already have noticed some minor fading in the dark spots around the lip and cheek area on my face.</li>
    <li> The smell of this serum is amazing. Fresh oranges make their way to your nose every time you use this. After using it even for just a couple days, my skin felt better and looked better too! I would definitely recommend this product to those looking for a good face serum!</li>
    <li> In all honesty, I didn&#x27;t think this would work at all. But I noticed a more even skin tone and acne scars fading extremely fast. Plus, I love the orange citrus scent( it goes away after a short while).  Definitely worth it. I just wish it did something about wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice! I am not loving it but I do like it. I like how it tightens my skin and you can feel it working in about 5 minutes. I love how my face is already feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. This product is perfect for sensitive skin as it didn&#x27;t leave my face breaking out of extremely dry like in some products I have tried. I really love how it makes me feel better about my skin with less and less wrinkles and fine liines</li>
    <li> I love the product and has helped me to make my skin softer and color even. I like it alot, I wish the packaging would be bigger.</li>
    <li> I have never before tried a Vitamin c Serum but this was highly rated and not terribly expensive so I took a chance.  It does help with dry skin, it lasts longer than expected (the bottle is small but it does not use much daily).  The seller is excellent with communication and follow-up even sending out email suggestions on ways to improve product use or general health ideas.  It smells clean, goes on fresh without any oily feel and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my friend Enzie, I found out how good your product is. It makes the skin very smooth. But when I press the bottom  too much comes out at once. It would be better if the product would be thicker so it does not squirt out too much. I am thankful, that I could try your Product and consider to buy it later.</li>
    <li> Huge phenomenal bottle of Vitamin C Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this hyaluronic serum. It&#x27;s very lightweight, and absorbs in quickly. All I need is two squirts, for my face, and neck. On contact it immediately hydrates my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it under my make-up, as well as, without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent that&#x27;s not over-powering, yet refreshing. It only lasts a few minutes, but it&#x27;s a nice while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan on using this serum on a daily basis, as well as a bed-time.</li>
    <li> It is soft going on and feels good on my fair 68 yr old skin. No real smell and does not not dry my skin out. I have some age spots that I brought this for and only time will tell if it will lighten them. Not many products work to soften my deep adventure lines on my face I will wait and see what this does..</li>
    <li> Took before pictures. Can&#x27;t wait to do after pictures for results. Feels good going on and I feel confident in product. Smells great and you can feel the moisture and tightening. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily for a week and love it. My skin is softer and smoother. Even shiner I think. The smell is a light citrus smell and doesnt linger. It rubs in smooth into your skin and absorbs quickly. You cant go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It absorbs very quickly.  I really like the slight citrus fragrance.  My skin is extremely dry, so I find I need to use several pumps worth to cover my face.  It makes my face feel refreshed, but it is not enough moisture for me.  I apply this serum and then follow with moisturizer and my face has never looked better.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any firming or tightening in areas of my face that are getting a little lax appearing, but the fine lines I was beginning to see with just moisturizer alone are now almost non-existent after several weeks of use.  I also have extremely sensitive skin.  I have gone through hundreds of dollars worth of drug store and department store products trying to find one that does not irritate my skin, causing redness, burning and sometimes even welts despite claims of &amp;#34;for sensitive skin.&amp;#34;  I am thrilled to say this product does NOT cause any negative skin reaction on my face.  I only wish it were more moisturizing for me, as the only moisturizer I have found that doesn&#x27;t not irritate my skin costs around $50 a jar.  That said, this is a nice addition to my face care.</li>
    <li> O.M.G I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! This toner/serum works wonders. I love everything about it. I love that this product is orgainic AND smells fruity like oranges, not like alcohol and or like other chemicals that other products have. I feel the difference in my skin. Leaves my face and neck feeling clean, tight, and smooth. This product is perfect for me because I have sensitive skin. This serum won&#x27;t dry out the skin. It hasn&#x27;t caused nasty breakouts to my skin like other products and since I have freckles and sun damaged skin, I can see and feel the difference. I highly recommend if you are looking for a great product, great results, and great prices :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Vitamin C serum for my skin and this product does not disappoint. Made my skin so soft even the first time I used it. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, can see instant firming results. Has nice light scent that dissipates quickly and goes on very smoothly. Love that so much of it is organic and/or organic. It&#x27;s is not sticky either which I sometimes find with vitamin c products. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I do not have aged skin since I am only 20, but I tried it before I gave it to my grandma and my skin really felt softer and firm. The smell of oranges was a plus. The main ingredient is vitamin C so it shouldn&#x27;t be too bad for problematic skin, such as acne. I&#x27;d use it as a moisturizer if my grandma didn&#x27;t have it...</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Citrus-cinnamon scent. No added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Wet and smooth. This has the texture of a very thick serum or uber-light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Soft, no film or greasy feeling left behind.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Should be okay for all. No problems with my sensitive, oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 1oz airless pump, pump is precise and easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Skin looks slightly smoother and moister.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Has several good active ingredients for wrinkles and inflammation. I would not rely on this as your only active anti-aging product, but it’s one of the more pleasing vitamin C/hyaluronic acid formulations I’ve used in terms of how it feels on the skin. It&#x27;s free of silicone fillers and contains almost all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my skin look younger!</li>
    <li> It is very light almost watery going on.  But within less than 60 seconds, it drys and my skin felt softer and tighter immediately.  It seems to have a light citrus smell.  I use it on my face and hands.  So far so good.  I didn&#x27;t give it five because I don&#x27;t know if it will do what it says in the long run.  But if you want to feel refreshed, soft, yet tight skin, then give it a try.</li>
    <li> Love the soft scent great product</li>
    <li> just started using this few days, and can really feel softer skin and more life to, have used other products which always stung or irritated , and living in Florida heat does not irritate it, happy I tried it</li>
    <li> Update 1-18-2016&lt;br /&gt;This has become my absolute favorite serum after the gym visit. It is a bit sticky, so I tend to just put this on and leave my face alone to rest, no makeup, no other creams or serums. From all the serums I use, I have bought this one probably 4 times now since the beginning of last year. I love the smell and the rate it absorbs into my skin. My pores tighten and my skin feels so soft and smooth. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last review:&lt;br /&gt;I truly like this serum, it is very fast absorbed into the skin and with 20% Vitamin C with the pH 3.0 it is perfect for me after I use my derma roller. It is very easy to use, no messy droppers needed, it has a pump and at least for me it always squirts the right amount to cover my face and neck. The smell is a strong orange. I do wonder if they added any perfume in it or is it truly all natural and organic. But I haven&#x27;t broken out from it, so if there is even something to boost the smell, its not harmful.&lt;br /&gt;I love that they included which hazel into the formula, after derma rolling, it is all in one - antiseptic, moisturizing and collagen boosting. I have tried some other serums from Satin Smooth and I have to say, Keem Organic serum is much better, with all great ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple weeks I can say that it has balanced my complexion, my skin feels firmer and the fine lines I had are still there, but I don&#x27;t have any so called hashtags around them. Hashtags indicate dry skin in the beauty business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I loved this product&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the processing of giving this a long term review, but I want to put a review for now and state how fabulous this product smells and how great my skin feels after I use it. I could smell the oranges before I even got it out the packaging. I have been putting it on before bed and my face feels silky smooth. It&#x27;s comparable to the fabulous feeling you get when you get in a bed with freshly clean sheets, except its on your face! I have high hopes that it will continue to work wonders and keeps my face looking fresh and young. I would like to add that is leaves ZERO percent of oily residue on your face, which is AMAZING. Most facial creams or oils leave a really oily feeling after you have applied it. Not this one! I love it and I will definitely continue to buy it! 100% would suggest to other buyers.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it works well.  Glides across my skin and absorbs within a few seconds.  Not sticky.  I like that it leaves my skin soft and ready for moisturizer.  It does have a water consistency, so need to apply quickly or use small amounts at one time.  Great citrus scent.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted me to get this for her and I did &#x27;cause I&#x27;m a good husband! (wink wink) So I know she likes the scent of the cream and that she thinks it feels good when she puts it on.  Not sure what else to say, but she&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I like it works very good just love it</li>
    <li> On the second use I could see a difference. Helping to tighten the skin around my eyes. Apply after cleansing face before using daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Love this, have started using it on my face, and hope the results get better and better.</li>
    <li> Kleem is one of my favorite product. My face is really sensitive but this one makes my face so smooth and make me feel so confident. All my dark spot and acne is gone now.  I absolute continue this product to maintain my face smooth at healthy. You must try and see the difference to other product.</li>
    <li> First, this stuff smells SO good! It goes on a bit sticky but leaves your face feeling so smooth. It takes about two, to two and a half pumps to cover your entire face and neck. It is not so much a serum as it is comes out as a slightly thinner liquid version of a serum. It smells so good, did I say that? You can feel your skin tightening as it dries, which takes about a minute or two. It does not dry your skin out, but you will definitely need a moisturizer to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two days I noticed that my pores appeared smaller. I had a little bit of acne and this stuff helped clear it up right away. I have a lot of sun spots and they are fading as well. My face feels more tone and it appears more even in color. I have certain red spots (under my nose, cheeks, under my eyes, chin) that are greatly diminished when using this product. My skin feels firmer and it looks better. I am very happy with this product and am going to keep using it—I even bought some for my mom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not a miracle in a bottle, but it’s definitely something you can add to your beauty routine to get your face feeling a lot nicer.</li>
    <li> Finally a Vit C serum that does what it says without irritating sensitive skin! My lines are much less noticeable  after just a couple of weeks with no breaking out or burning!Had tried numerous organic Vit C serums and none worked for me until this one! Company is very caring and wants customer satisfaction also.</li>
    <li> nice plump energized skin when using this product exactly what i wanted plump skin means youthful looking skin. absolutely love my results here i added a bit to my hips and buns to get it youthful as well ;)</li>
    <li> The Kleem serum was delivered sealed and nicely packaged and was exactly as described on product page.  We purchased in a promotion for testing and review.  This brand of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid Serum uses organic and all natural ingredients.  Since we all use Vitamin C serum in this household, we like to use the best quality and focus on the brands that can increase collagen cell formation and help you get younger and smoother looking skin.  After purchase, we received a complementary Beauty e-book, via email.</li>
    <li> I am an extreme skeptic when it comes to anti aging and wrinkle creams and serums. So of coarse I was also a skeptic of this one, until I used it. I have a few smile lines, due to having a massive smile my whole life. I have now used this product for almost a month and as you can see there was a nice amount of change. The fine smile lines are way more faint and the darkness around my eyes is going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use it (please excuse the look on my face lol) I am 34 and I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but to keep my youthful appearance this will continue to be a part  of my daily routine. It only takes a small amount so the bottle lasts a long time. To apply I just take a dab and apply to my problem areas. It is also very affordable!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past week and the minute I put it on I can feel a difference.  It makes my face feel so soft and moisturized.  It comes out really watery and it feels like you&#x27;re just rubbing a little water on your face but man does it make difference. At first I thought the price was a little crazy and thought that if I didn&#x27;t receive this with a discount(so that I would review it for BuView) I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  But I realized once I started using it that this is going to last a very very long time.  I have been using it multiple times a day and not only on my face but I&#x27;ve used it on my dry hands(Its Vitamin C why not!)  So I&#x27;ve decided that for how well it works and how long it will last that it is well worth the price.  I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. Been using it for two weeks and acne scar redness is near gone and my skin just looks better. Make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
    <li> It’s very good product and 5 stars all the way.&lt;br /&gt;*  This works on my sensitive combination skin, it will work on any type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;*  It’s top quality serum.&lt;br /&gt;*  The airless pump bottle for serum, so there is no waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and my skin type is combination; some part of my face is very oily and other parts of the face seem really dry.  My skin is easily breakout in rashes and once my skin shows bad reaction, it takes long time to heal.  Because of this problem, I usually stick with the product that I know it is safe to use.  Though I hesitate to use new products that I haven’t tried before, I also know that I have to try new items for my aging skin.  What worked great last few years doesn’t seem to help my skin anymore.  I was asked to try Kleem Organics Anti-Aging serum recently, I wasn’t sure if I am willing to try this one. Especially for the Vit C serum, since I had really bad reaction to similar product in the past.  I knew either it would be a total mess or total success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this first day, I did patch test on my neck and chin at night. Next morning, I found out not only my skin looks ok (no rashes or itches), the area that I apply feel moist.  I can feel the difference between where I apply this serum and the area that I didn’t.  I would never thought Kleem organics Anti-Aging serum makes this much difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been a week since I have used Kleem Organics Anti-Aging Serum.  I am very happy to report that  my skin feels so soft, no dry or oily patches like before.  Some of people may be able to use just couple of drops of this serum to cover entire face, but my skins soaks up this serum like sponge and I found myself applying multiple pumps per application.  But, it is pretty big bottle and should last long time.  It’s only been very short period of time since I start using this serum, but my skin feels and looks vastly different before and after.  This Kleem Organics Anti-Aging serum comes in airless pump bottle, so I’ll be able to use the serum till last drop.g serum comes in airless pump bottle, so I’ll be able to use the serum till last drop.</li>
    <li> love this product! washed my face then dabbed this product all over and applied with an electric sponge. it feels amazing anf really makes a huge difference in your skin! my face looks clean, refreshed and YOUNG again!</li>
    <li> Mi pure vitamin C serum came on time, well package. The product itself it s good, hidrate your skin, you can combine with other products of your night routine, non dry your skin. My skin is more brighter and have a more even tone.</li>
    <li> This Product has definitely made me think tiwce about buying other vitamin products for my skin. I have very sensitive Skin and the 2nd day, I seen a visual difference with my face. My red spots where diminishing and the feel of my skin felt just right finally. I will continue to definitely use this product. I wish Kleem Organics had a before face or clens wash to go with it.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away after applying twice a day. My pores appear smallwe and my face really does have a nice glow. I love the way it absorbs so quickly and the the faint citrus smell is lovely. I am hoping to see an&#x27;improvement in some slight discoloration a on one cheek but too early to tell yet. But, I am very Impressed with what I see so far!</li>
    <li> This has a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent - I can&#x27;t describe it, it&#x27;s not citrusy, it&#x27;s has a remote whiff of limes, but that isn&#x27;t the scent - it&#x27;s like the smell when you first walk into a 5 star hotel room after a long day in the car, and drop face down on the pillows.  Also it is a non-greasy super concentrated lotion for even the most sensitive skin.  I was gifted with a sample for a reduced price for a review.  I can tell from the get-go this is a good way to make my skin look and feel younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  saw where Dr. Oz claims Vitamin C can help drop a decade from your face - I wouldn&#x27;t go that far, but from what I&#x27;ve read, Vitamin C is the primary ingredient in collagen which is what binds the cells together.  Hence the reasonable assumption that it would help &#x27;tighten&#x27; up wrinkles.  I like the idea of the V C helping my immune system while contributing to my skin care regime in a positive way.</li>
    <li> Customer service is excellent!! They respond with care. Stable vitamin c. I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I only have a few minor wrinkles on my face right around the eye area, which is exactly where I use this serum. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really and truly be able to comment on actual results, but what I can say is that this really is a beautiful, terrific little serum! It immediately makes my skin feel tighter, which tells me this is a great quality product that is more than likely really going to live up to its reputation. I look forward to using this serum after my shower everyday because it feels really good to know something is working so well!</li>
    <li> I have been applying this serum on my face for about a week now, and I can honestly say I am hooked. I love everything about it. I have tried a few Vitamin C facial Serums but i have never been satisfied as much as i am with this product. My face is so soft, radiant, and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily which i really appreciate because most products I have tried do. It is light weight, and scent free. I have contact Dermatitis, so I am really picky with skin products. so when I accepted the offer for a free sample of this product, I loved that it was organic and is all natural which was very appealing because all my skin products are organic, and seem to have better luck with. but I had my doubts because most products I try make my skin flare up. With this product I have not had any issues. If anything I think it has actually helped my skin from frequent flare ups on my hands. I love this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for a few weeks now and I know it is helping my skin. It absorbs in to the skin perfectly and I love the pump feature.&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked and will keep using this product for a long time!!!</li>
    <li> REPEAT CUSTOMER ,I  NOTICED  RESULTS AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF USE ,WILL PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> I have received this item three times and each time it was a different color. The first time, the product was clear it worked great and I loved it. The second time it was a translucent orange and it broke my face out. The third time it looked like milk and the pump was broke amd I couldn&#x27;t pump it but was afraid to put it on my skin in fear of a terrible breakout. I don&#x27;t know what color the product should be but I am guessing the clear one was the best. I will not be purchasing again and am currently looking for another skin care product.</li>
    <li> This product seems very good at first when you put it on, as to the feel of your skin but turned out to be not too good for my skin and I continued to retry it over and over again but it causes me break outs and yes even at a mature age.  If you make this product too, specifically for oily mature skin then you will have a customer for life. I will try a sample first because I am disappointed  of buying skin care products thinking this will be the one and it is not because it gives me acne so the money goes down the drain. If I didn&#x27;t have oily skin, I think this product would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Amazing serum!  I am so thrilled with this product I don&#x27;t even know where to begin!  I work a lot and the lack of sleep shows, especially through my eyes with dark circles, puffiness, etc.  I don&#x27;t know if I would label my skin as sensitive because I put it through a lot...make-up, tanning; I&#x27;ve tried quiet a few serums in the past which have been oily looking or I see breakouts within a day or they don&#x27;t have a pleasant smell.  I just wasn&#x27;t sure what to try next but I needed to try something.  Upon looking more into your product, the first thing that appealed to me was that it was organic - no chemicals!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to start using it when it arrived (thank you for the quick ship!).  I was immediately taken to the soft orange citrus smell and it covered my skin beautifully!  No oily shine, just a beautiful radiant glow!  After a couple days using the product it was such a noticeable change, especially around my eyes and for that I can&#x27;t thank you enough!  I look well rested, no dark circles or puffiness and another perk...I haven&#x27;t worn hardly ANY makeup, just a little liner and mascara!  I only wish I would have taken a photo to show you!  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what it continues to do for my skin!  Thank you KLEEM, I am a very happy customer and thank you for introducing a great product!!</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old male, that has overly sensitive skin, and this is one of the first creams I have used that does not cause massive irritation.  Excellent application and excellent product!  Huge plus is it is a certified organic cream and not tested on animals in a lab!</li>
    <li> I love that this product is natural and very soft on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This Kleem Organics Intensive Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum comes in a handy pump bottle making it easy to use.  Has a great citrus scent and feels cool and refreshing.  Needs a few minutes to be absorbed but once it is you have a nice smooth feeling skin.  I use mine for face and hands.  Contains awesome organic herbs as well which I realy like.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and just love it.</li>
    <li> I just got this serum by Kleem Organics and I am very impressed with the serum. I loved the smell of the orange citrus in it. The scent was really refreshing using it. All you need is a pump to cover the face. I suffer from dry skin and this has given the moisture back. Also, my skin was silky smooth after using it. I am 31 and this stuff is awesome! I just love how my skin feels! Besides all of this I have been in contact with the company and they have given me emails that were wonderful! The customer service has been 100% nice and have answered every question for me fast! That means a lot to me! Customer service is huge! I am happy to say that I will be getting more products from them! I did receive this product at discount to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I have to go middle of the road in my rating of this product. After several applications, made over a month&#x27;s period of time, I didn&#x27;t see anything positive going on with my skin. In fact, after every application I felt my skin looked worse, dry and wrinkly. But I kept trying and also tried a moisturizer over it to see if that helped but it didn&#x27;t. This product has good ingredients in it, but it did not work for me, perhaps because I already have wrinkles. Maybe it is better as a preventative on younger skin.</li>
    <li> i love how the skin feels after i apply it, leves ur skin so soft and fresh  like baby and i also love that it has a very light sweet and clean smell like  orange soap and love the bottle its so easy looks really nice and dissolve really good in skin</li>
    <li> My skin looks great after using this product. I really feel like it has made a noticeable difference and people have actually been commenting on my appearance! I have smoother, dewy looking skin. I highly recommend trying this out!</li>
    <li> My skin felt more firm immediately and after a week I could see a nice glow from the Vitamin C.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I like the bottle, sleek and cool.  Clear to see how much has been used in the bottle. Great smell, feels great, and no stickiness. I like it so far....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.  My skin tone is even and glowing.  Took the dullness away and definitely helping with bags and fine lines.  I literally got carded twice this week for the first time in years lol it was an awesome feeling! Great product I highly recommend it! Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Kleem Organics combines my 2 favorite serums, Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C, in one very nice preparation. It goes on cleanly, is absorbed almost instantly and leaves my 61-yr-old skin feeling soft, supple and quite simply, lovely to touch. I&#x27;ve been using it daily, morning and night, for about a week, and have been entirely pleased with the results. It evens out my blotchy skin tones thanks to Vitamin C, while the Hyaluronic does it&#x27;s thing, making my skin soft and plump. It feels and looks like younger skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry and sensitive, prone to flaking and to top it off, I&#x27;m allergic to roses. Many serums include rosehips in their formula and cause itching and redness. I&#x27;ve had none since using the Kleem serum. Nor have I had even the slightest tingling, as I have with other formulations. This is very gentle, yet highly effective. It&#x27;s also packaged in a light-proof bottle for long shelf life and has a pump to make sure it remains free of contamination. Kelley lists every ingredient on the products Amazon listing. I give it my strongest recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample provided for review**</li>
    <li> Turning 50 wasn&#x27;t easy!  I&#x27;m always looking for products that are natural and will preserve my skin for the next 50!  Kleem organics is fast acting and tightens my skin.  I&#x27;m noticing a bright looking face and tighter neck in just a few applications. This product has a very clean, and fresh scent, and starts off my day right!  If you are looking for natural products that will decrease lines on your face and neck, and improve the appearance of your aging skin, try this product.  I received a sample of tho item for my honey review.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it twice a day. It smells good. It keeps my skin moisturized. I almost finished my first bottle. I&#x27;m  gonna order more.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin hydrated all day.  Really like this product.</li>
    <li> Yup, I&#x27;m reviewing another Vitamin C serum. The good thing about this is you get your moneys worth. It pumps out  the right amount every time, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, you&#x27;ll notice a difference. But after that, it tends to work a lot like a lot of other serums I&#x27;ve tried. The product is worth trying and it will do what it says. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve tested few serums, but it didn&#x27;t too much after a while. But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll have better effects on those who haven&#x27;t used a serum yet.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks of using it daily, I&#x27;m ready to say that I quite like this product. The scent is fresh and citrusy, but not overpowering. I have very fair, sensitive skin and I notice that it feels very smooth and soft after use.</li>
    <li> This product first caught my eye since I have heard so many good things about using Vitamin C on your skin. The serum has a nice, light orange scent to it, which I love. After applying it to my face, my skin felt silky smooth. The serum is not heavy or greasy at all. For being a serum, it was a little bit more water-y than I expected, but that also could be due to the hot weather we are having. I have oily skin, and so far this serum has helped to balance that out. I hope to see more positive results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I love it, since i started using this i noticed a big difference to my skin, dark spots started to disappear, my skin feels so smooth and i feel younger. The product is totally safe for a sensitive skin like mine. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all unlike what i used to have for my skin. If i were you guys who are looking for a perfect product to takecare of your skin i would diffenitely try this. I got this discounted item for product testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Purchased to review product.  I have been using this product for about two weeks now.  I like to give products the opportunity to be effective on my skin.  I have had problematic skin in the past and have to be extremely careful with the products I use.  I have been using this product after cleansing my face twice a day.  I really like the scent and texture of the product.  It moisturizes my skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it looking oily.  My skin appears to look healthier because of this product.</li>
    <li> Have use this one time and could see results . the price is about 1/3 cheaper then anywhere i have bought it .</li>
    <li> As of right now, i like this product,  It smells great, light and citrusy.  My skin feel different after I apply it.  I like that tis is light and I can put my moisturizer over it.  So far i have not broken out from this, but that normally comes at about a week.  I will update the post if that happens.  The only thing wish was different, i wish it was a little bit thicker so i would stay on my fingers longer so i could get it to my face!  I have so squirt it in my hand and the bring it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Kleem Organics - Vitamin C Serum, I have some dark spots on my skin, I tried this product after having tried other products that did not seem to work. It is a very fine serum, good texture and easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its bottle is very handy, with a pump reducing wastage of the product. It has got a very stylish and luxurious design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kleem is a Vitamin C based serum, so it helps you alleviate wrinkles, bags and dark circles, it&#x27;s the perfect alleviator for aging.&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin c serum is a concentrated form of active bio available Vitamin C combined with the moisturizing power of Hyaluronic Acid, the tightening and moisture retention power of Witch Hazel and the collagen boosting properties of Arginine, this serum works wonders to repair the effects from sun damage,lighten sun and age spots and smooths and brightens for a more youthful skin No more worrying about crow&#x27;s feet, age spots, or freckles! After almost 2 weeks of use, I begin to notice softer, smoother skin,  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now. While I have not noticed a major change in my face, I can feel the tightness around my eyes once I have applied it. The smell is amazing pure orange that you can smell for awhile. You must apply this product in small amounts or it will run all over your fingers. I put a little squirt for one eye and rub then proceed to the other eye ending my cycle with around my lips. They are tiny squirts so I have not used hardly any of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face does feel smoother. I can see with continued use how this product will help my aging skin. I have not taken care of my skin in the past so this product and any others I use are up against a major battle. At the end of one month I will post before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> Love it have seen great difference will be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a great price on Amazon.  This product contains the ingredients i want in a skin serum and is organic. I like the way it feels when applied.  I have noticed a marked improvement&lt;br /&gt;in the texture of my skin but not so much with dark spots. I believe that with continued&lt;br /&gt;that will improve. Great for neck area. This is a product I will continue to use everyday.  I have already reordered.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom. She&#x27;s used it a handful of times but not daily. It leaves her face feeling smooth. The product is watery so you don&#x27;t want to pump it too hard. Once she starts using it consistently I&#x27;m sure she will see more results.</li>
    <li> Fresh citrus fragrance, non-greasy, and fast absorbing, but don&#x27;t expect instant results.  Give it several weeks to see noticeable results.  It is quite watery, so you have to be careful not to press the pump down too hard or fast.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Packaging &#x3D; I received my product wow it came in a sleek and very impressive bottle with a silver top It was sealed unlike I few other beauty products I have purchased before I like the way it is packaged a lot .&lt;br /&gt;Price&#x3D; 79.99 unless on sale for 28.99 for 1oz. Bottle&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients &#x3D; I like that it is certified Organic and not tested on animals .it contains Vitamin C and E also witch Hazel that is a great skin tightening agent . All other ingredients are simple and natural .  You may check on Amazon or Kleem sites for an entire list .&lt;br /&gt;Use and Results &#x3D; The first application I could feel it working and tightening my skin . The pump is great but may come out a bit fast so use care when you dispense the serum I am on Day 12 of use now The smell is like a very light orange juice scent . I like it too I applied it on a clean face every morning and in the evening . I see a lot more brighter and tighter skin .Being 54 this seems to work so well. I can see my fine lines and some sagging gone .I also see a bit of my Dark spots a little Lighter . Just what I was looking for 5 stars thanks</li>
    <li> If I could rate this item with more than five stars rest assured I would. I was not expecting to love let alone adore this product. I cannot tell you exactly what it is about this serum that has got me all in awe over it other than to tell you everything. I keep finding myself wanting to apply it on my face. I have been using it for less than a week and already I have seen a noticible difference not to mention my boyfirend also commented so it must be quite visible. Kleem Organics did tell me that I was going to love it and darn it if they were not right.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of product you can fake a good night&#x27;s sleep with!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with it after my first use, and this will be my morning routine weapon of choice. Though I was given this product to review, I do not give 5 stars unless a product deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this serum deserves it because...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1) It leaves your skin glowing, supple and energized.&lt;br /&gt;  2) It quickly absorbs into your skin, leaving a weightless finish, but powerful and light enough to&lt;br /&gt;  use with your favorite moisturizer afterward.&lt;br /&gt;  3) The citrus-like fragrance is amazinggg. Close your eyes while you massage this is in. It is so relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;  4) I had a terrible nights sleep last night (up with my children, usually am), and I probably haven&#x27;t slept a full night&#x27;s sleep in years, but this serum  alone revitalized my skin so much, I went makeup-less. I looked completely revitalized and had a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;  5) A natural ingredient based product, mostly organic. I was able to understand where the ingredients came&lt;br /&gt;  from that is absorbing into my skin. Which, is becoming more important to me as I get...wiser, not older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; NONE. This product is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I attached a pic of my 33-year-old, haven&#x27;t slept face, unaltered, after using a light exfoliator and simply applying this serum. I did not use any foundation and chose natural lighting to take the picture. Which, is any face&#x27;s enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars product across the board.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i got this for product testing and it gives me a good result , beautiful package.</li>
    <li> I love how this product made my skin feel. It was so smooth on my face and the product did not leave any oily residue, it was quick to dry and it smelled of citrus. So it was an over all clean smell. I used it in the morning and evening after a good washing of my face! I wore it out alone and even with make up it did not bother the make up that I applied after I used it, so that&#x27;s a plus. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> LOVE this serum. I have already seen a reduction in the lines around my eyes and mouth. It is goes on smoothly without a strong smell. It is a great product at a great price. I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this serum. Usually these types of items I zoom on past and don&#x27;t order. I find most of them to not work or you here bad stories about. Not with this serum. I love how it has helped my dark circles under my eyes. It leaves my face feeling nice and soft as well. I am amazed with this product. I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or heavy on my face. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. And it applies easily and dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in myself in a week. My husband as well as friends have also noticed and asked about what I am currently using. So obviously the product does work and make sure you are using it daily to see results.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it&#x27;s a buy it now product.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum, goes well inthe skin, very light observe quickly, leave skin smooth silky soft!! it goes a long takes very little!!&lt;br /&gt;i have a dry skin but works wonder on my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at special price to review! But opinion is my own!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It absorbs quickly and I cannot be without it because it really does help. We &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; women need all the help we can get!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product going on two weeks now and I can absolutely see a difference in my skin. The product truly works and my skin looks more radiant and fresh. My skin is not dull any longer after using this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and I have had fine wrinkles and some spots on my skin and some age related discolorations in my skin. I tried this product after having tried everything else on my skin and did not seem to work. It is a very fine serum, good texture and easily absorbed. Its bottle is very handy, airless and with a pump reducing wastage of the product. It has got a very stylish and luxurious design and it is a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I applied it the first time, it felt fresh and soothing and my skin felt soft and had a glowing look afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many of its competitors, it&#x27;s got a lot offered in terms of ingredients and packing and I can say I am delighted with the value for money this product offers.&lt;br /&gt;I must say this product truly deserves a 5 star review, as I can&#x27;t fault it in any way. I recommend it to anyone with a sensitive skin like mine and those who would like to see a positive improvement in their skin after only a few applications.</li>
    <li> Work great at a very great price will bye more</li>
    <li> I love using this Vitamin C Serum and was able to get it at an awesome price. It smells really good and applies easily. This is one product that I will continue to use.... :)</li>
    <li> This product in two words simply amazing. It smells great very citrusy which I love , and when you are applying something to your face you want something that smells good. I have been using this product for about a week now and I am already noticing a great improvement in my skin. Which two MAJOR important ingredients for me Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that slows the rate of free-radical damage -free radicals are unstable molecules that damage collagen and cause skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles. Research suggests that vitamin C may also reduce sunburn caused by exposure to ultraviolet B radiation and prevent the consequences of long-term sun exposure, which can lead to skin cancer. This doesn&#x27;t mean you can take vitamins or apply topical vitamin C and then bake safely in the sun, but you can help keep your skin healthy and supple by making sure you get enough of this antioxidant vitamin. Hyaluronic acid isn’t harsh or skin-stripping at all. In fact, it’s the exact opposite—a powerful humectant (aka moisture-binding ingredient) that keeps skin plump and hydrated and, yes, young-looking.As we age, skin moisture can drop significantly, which makes the skin lose elasticity and expose the signs of aging on the skin. Hyaluronic acid plays a critical role in skin health with its unique ability to hold in moisture. Hyaluronic acid is also a “smart nutrient” as it can adjust its moisture absorption rate based on the humidity—relative to the season and the climate. I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome. It has a slight scent that is fantastic. My skin loves this serum it just soaks it up. I use it twice a day after washing my face. It has gotten rid of a few wrinkles and it makes my face nice and smooth. It also works great for the neck area, it has tightened it up a bit. I will definitely be getting more of this.</li>
    <li> I like the the cinnamon smell and it had a tightening feeling right away. I can notice a difference and it&#x27;s only been three days. I like it a lot. They also sent me a nice email telling me how to use it and ask how I like it. Very nice size. Works for all different phones not just the iPhone. Good thing to have around, comes in handy. Bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love vitamin c serum. This company has took that old liquid runny serum and made it into a very easy to work with cream type serum. It is in a covenant pump bottle so no more eye dropper. The serum its self absorbs quickly and has the same dramatic results as most vitamin c serums. The thing that I noticed that put this above all others is that it moisturized as well as provided the tightening effect.  I also noticed those bags under my eyes were diminishing and the dark spots lightened up within the first week. the longer I use it the better my skin feels and looks. I was blessed to be able to purchase this during a promotion.</li>
    <li> Very good serum that removes dark circles. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love being outdoors in the summer months, but my skin is showing signs of the damage as a result.  The scent of the toner is light and refreshing.  That was important to me since I am very sensitive to different scents so close to my nose.  The nozzle of the bottle is easy to use, but I prefer removing the top nozzle to put the toner directly on my finger for better control.  Many bottles do not give you this option and I like the option of using my finger instead.  I was a little worried that a serum would leave my skin sticky, but it was the opposite.  My skin felt smooth and refreshed after using the Kleem Facial Toner.  I look forward to continuing to get this product to help with the damage of the summer&#x27;s sun.  Two Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to purchase this Vitamin C Serum at a very deep discount for testing purposes. That does not affect my opinion in any way. My review is my own and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly – this may not have been the past purchase for me. I recently turned 30 and do not suffer from fine lines or wrinkles. Well maybe I do, but I just don’t care enough about them to be concerned and need a product to correct them. I used this serum for a few weeks and did not notice any significant changes in my facial skin. That isn’t a negative thing – there is just nothing that I noticed which had changed. So I am neutral as to the visual effects of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the texture and consistency of the product – it was a really a great product. It was not too oily and it had a really good consistency. It did not dry out my skin at all. I have very sensitive skin, especially on my face, so I am always nervous about trying new products. This serum was a good for my skin and did not cause any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this product just wasn’t for me at this time in my life. It’s a great product, but just not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product a few times, so I don&#x27;t know if has improved my skin at this point.  It was well packaged, arrived quickly and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> This product absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft. It is not sticky and my other facial products f&#x3D;go on well over it. I have been using Vitamin C &amp; E, Hyaluronic Acid products with great results, lessened lines and wrinkles and discoloration diminished.  This serum contains Arginine plus other quality natural ingredients. so I expect even better results from this product . I have to say that the &#x27;better than money back guarantee&#x27; sold me: If I dont like it for any reason they will refund my money and send another bottle for free...that&#x27;s a strong belief in their product.  It is well packaged and the seller offers good customer service.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for outstanding. Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I have found Vernal to be more effective.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a month and it has already made a huge difference.  It has made my skin look and feel younger!  I love it.</li>
    <li> Product ok, but the pump shoots the product out and is wasteful</li>
    <li> I can say without reservation that I love this product. I&#x27;ve been a champion of chemical-free, healthy skincare products for years (having created the Beauty With a Conscience awards almost ten years ago) so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that allow women to look and feel beautiful without compromising their health. I particularly love that the serum goes on more like a toner (it&#x27;s pretty watery) than a light lotion, especially now that the warmer weather is upon us. A quick splash refreshes my skin, dries more quickly and allows my my skin to absorb it better. But I really love this product because it makes my skin look amazing! As I move into my 6th decade, I want a natural, organic product that smoothes, tightens, and protects, and ensures that I don&#x27;t look puffy! I mean, really, who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> I have received this product for free in exchange of my honest feedback about it and here are my experience using it. I have a sensitive skin and lately i got a really bad acne problems. I have use some product for my acne but it leaves me a darkspot so after I have tried this it makes the darkspot getting lighter and my skintone become brighter and smooth. In the morning after I put it on my face it feel so fresh. It is easy to apply cause it&#x27;s easy to absorb on your skin and you would not worry if it makes your face looking oily or not cause it&#x27;s not. The bottle looks so great. And oh the smell is so good. I also used it at night and when I wake up in the morning it seems like I just took a bath cause of its freshness on my skin. Thank you for Kleem Oragnics for giving me this opportunity to experience using your product.</li>
    <li> I should have started a long time ago, but now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s I am trying to take better care of my skin to prevent future signs of aging.  My skin is on the oily side, and I have a lot of freckles and a few &#x27;age spots&#x27; that become more pronounced in the summer when I&#x27;m out in the sun often.  I have sensitive skin and sometimes get allergic to scents, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to find beauty serums and creams that are okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because of what is not in it - the ingredients are more natural than other products and gentle on my skin.  I strongly believe in choosing natural products when possible and avoiding the use of chemicals in or on my body as often as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this serum on my face, neck and upper chest. I did notice my skin softened a bit and had a slight glow.  The sun spots seemed to fade slightly.  I&#x27;m sure with daily use I will see even more improvement and hopefully prevent some aging of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like there is a lot of product inside this bottle and it seems to be a good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received a sample of this product for review purposes.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5, because I noticed subtle improvement instead of the drastic improvement in the Amazon description. But I am satisfied with this product. Sometimes, when you choose natural products/ingredients, it takes a while to see bigger results. I also hope that with continued use of this product, I will avoid some of the signs of aging on my face.</li>
    <li> its okay..fast shipment...don&#x27;t see any difference at all</li>
    <li> This is a serum that my skin just love! It hydrate, makes my skin look healthier and younger (I guess because of the blood circulation). I definately recommend it, and will buy it again myself. It&#x60;s just so good! .I got an discount from Amazon on this one, for a review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now.  I had been using a serum made by a different manufacturer but since it was so expensive I decided to look for another product.  I do like the Kleem Serum and am pleased with the results.  So far it seems to be at least as good as the expensive serum that I had been using.  It has a nice pump dispenser and I like the way it feels when applied on my face.  I have very dry skin so a little while after I&#x27;ve applied the serum I then apply a light moisturizing lotion.  The serum has a pleasant light citrus scent.  I am very sensitive to odors and the scent in this serum is so very slight that it is not offensive at all.  (Wife of Gary Z)</li>
    <li> Excellent Vitamin C Serum. I have tried a few as a beauty + health writer. This one is the best thus far. Leaves a nice, complexion glow. Balances my oily skin nicely. Absorbs almost instantly. Did not receive any stinging, redness or break-outs from this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff and the price is amazing-- 20% Vitamin C for $20! Plus, the airless bottle ensures sterility and freshness,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft and a bit plumper. I use Retin-A at opposite times of the day. Do not mix Vitamin C and retinoids together. In other words, Kleem Organics Vitamin C (AM) and Retin-A (PM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;http://BeautyTipToday.com</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. I have used this for about four weeks now and my skin looks radiant. I also love the citrus/spicy scent.</li>
    <li> Have not had it that long. It is  a lot more watery than what I thought it would be! I still have to give I more time though. Processing  and the time it got here was very quick!!</li>
    <li> Thats all I can say is wow !!</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer and more moist after using this serum. My deeper wrinkles have not vanished - but I do think it has helped the overall tone and definitely has acted as a moisturizer. It comes out of the bottle via pump, so is easy to use and apply without waste.  The product feels good on the skin and you immediately feel your skin is hydrated and it does not burn or have any unpleasant sensations while applying it.  Vitamin C is needed to make collagen, and as we age so does our collagen level. Collagen is needed to keep us young looking (no wrinkles, etc.). Therefore if Vitamin C is needed to make Collagen and we need Collagen -then this product is definitely worth a try.  I use it under my moisturizer - seems to give the best effect that way. It does have a mild smell when applied, can&#x27;t put my finger on what the scent is, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant and vanishes fairly quickly. A free sample was provided for evaluation.

    <li> I really liked this products. It made my skin nice and soft. Being 24, I don&#x27;t have many fine lines or wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t say how much it helps with those. I only had one issue with this product... it made me break out a little bit, but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Finding great anti-aging products that work for YOU can often be a hit or miss situation as we all know.  However, I am so excited because I discovered another winner with Kleem Organics Jeunesse Vitamin C Serum for what it did for me on all fronts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has 20% of potent natural vitamin C for intensive complexion repair from its ability to promote collagen.  Yet, this is only part of this amazing rejuvenating formula that utilizes plant-based hyaluronic acid, arginine, aloe vera, vitamin E, and a host of organic ingredients that can help encourage the rebirth of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think that I am exaggerating, but I do love this lightweight serum for the beautiful reawakening of my complexion, but also for so many different reasons.  It is wonderful for sensitive skin, feels soothing once applied, has a sanitary pump to dispense it, and leaves your complexion adequately moisturized without being overly sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I have been using it only for about two weeks, I saw my complexion change fairly rapidly in tone, texture, and firmness almost before my eyes.  Now I am watching a small spot diminish in color and size that I have been trying to get rid after a harsh experience with a fruit peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping my skin this gorgeous won’t destroy my budget either because this stuff costs only $19.99!  Check out Kleem Organics Jeunesse Vitamin C Serum because you’re going to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: Free product was provided to facilitate this review on--not my opinion even though it contains affiliate links on&lt;br /&gt;Nuts 4 Stuff Blog-- http://nuts4stuff.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Made my face itch real bad , I must be alergic</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my cousin. I can already see a difference in her skin. She is always out in the sun so her skin wasnt very happy. But a couple weeks of using this and her skin looks happier. It is brighter and healthy look. She also has an amazing glow</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;m 62 and was trying too many products and getting nowhere.  Now I use a very mild cleanser, Vitamin C serum on face and throat and a simple moisturizer twice a day. Skin is best shape ever! Dark spots disappeared, skin tone is fabulous. And a little bit of the serum goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The bottle is nice . the cream is soft and has rich texture that glads right on. Not greasey</li>
    <li> I bought a vitamin C serum from another company and it was too sticky-I felt like wearing a mask after applied it. So I returned it the next day and ordered the Kleem Organics. I didn&#x27;t have many choices since I only wanted the air tight bottle-not the dropping bottles. The Second when I tried it I decided to order it again! The Smell was very freshly pleasant just like squeezing an orange onto your face! And it&#x27;s not sticky on the face. It was absorbed immediately! I&#x27;ve only started to use it since last week so not seen much changes on my skin. But so far it was a great experience and I&#x27;m in love with it already.</li>
    <li> great product... all natural, excellent packaging.  I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I got this one for my husband and me today.  I didn&#x27;t use it yet but tested it on back of my hand. Its smell is good and fresh, but it is so watery. it is gone and dried fast on back of my hand as if a dropped water is dried by heating. I don&#x27;t feel it can moisturize my face all night. I am so disappointed by buying it, and I think I wasted my money( did a bad choice at this time) ....I know this review posted too early, but I don&#x27;t think this product is good. I ordered this with good reviews, but I am doubting that most reviews could be fake...I will update my review again how it works on my face. if it works well, I will change my review and give more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:After I have used this, I see my face is brighter. However, I can&#x27;t use this without face cream because it makes my face so dry. For example, one day, I was lazy to wash my face because I have a baby. I just wanted to put the vitamin c serum on face used facial cream by late day before I went to bed. As soon as, I put the serum, I felt shrunk my face skin rapidly. I got several emails from this company. They said they are confident with this product, and the serum is not a moisturizer. However, it would be moisturize a face on somehow. Without some face cream, I can&#x27;t use this. Here is my suggestion that the product would be better if adding some moisturizing( glycerine). Will I buy this product again? My answer is NO.</li>
    <li> I have not had much luck with Vitamin C serums.  My skin is very sensitive, and every type of serum I’ve tried in the past has made it itch and become inflamed.  So when I received a free sample of Kleem Jeunesse, my expectations were low.  I doubted it would be any different from the others I’ve abandoned after a couple of tries.  I’m pleased to report that I was wrong.  I’ve had no adverse effects from this product – no itching, no redness, no dryness – even after using it daily for several weeks.  It’s too soon to predict what the long-term results will be, but I am thrilled to have finally found a Vitamin C product I can use.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT!!!! THE PRODUCT HAS A WONDERFUL SCENT ,IS ORGANIC</li>
    <li> Works as promised! I bought this for my aunt and she loves it.  Her skin does look much better.  She loves that her skin is much smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It absorbs quickly and makes your skin feel amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this solution now for several weeks and it really feels great to rub onto my skin. I have been using it on my face, and it seems to be smoothing out my aged skin. It really works. I don&#x27;t know if it is the massaging action or the solution or both.  Nonetheless, I&#x27;ll keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Pure vitamin c + e serum is amazing! This is one of my favorite purchases for skincare in a very long time! This amazing product does wonders to my skin! I gave very sensitive skin, and many products cause irritation, but this stuff has truly improved the texture and natural glow of my face! My skin is so much softer, firmer, and overall healthier looking! I have used this for 3 days, and over 10 of my friends and family commented on how pretty my skin looks. My aunt even commented that I looked healthier because my skin was much clearer! I love the texture and the refreshing scent, and how fast it dries on your skin. If your looking for an affordable yet very effective skincare product, this is definitely it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic serum. I have been using Kleem Organics serum for several weeks and have noticed a tremendous improvement in the fine lines between my brows, around my mouth and on my neck. My skin feels nourished and soft. It&#x27;s very concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use much. Very pleased with the customer support. Love the video and the ebook they provide you. Both are educational and reminded me of how important it is to moisturize your face appropriately. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Came in time and makes my skin feel tighter love this</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I like how it come in a pump container which gives you just the right amount and not wasteful like other products out there. With only a few uses my skin is silkier, smooth and ample. The product does not feel greasy and leaves it definitely softer.Of all the products i have tried this is the only one that really made a difference after only a few usage and would recommend to all that have blemishes or uneven skin tones as it will make it disappear.i love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I love the container it comes in, it pumps out the perfect amount with one pump and as I use it the bottom rises so I won&#x27;t have that issue of not being able to reach what&#x27;s left at the bottom. (My only complaint is that the writing is small and a little hard to read). As for the product itself, my skin is definitely smoother and softer. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big reduction in brown spots but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is a pleasure to use this mousturiser</li>
    <li> Great quality product. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again and again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not anything close to what the description gives of how it should help the skin town etc. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few weeks now and I really love it. I put it on after showering and washing my face and it&#x27;s really helped in making my skin appear healthier. I&#x27;ve had less breakouts and my skin just feels tighter and healthier after using it. I had some discoloration from acne breakouts as a teenager and I can already see some positive results in that area as well. Highly recommended just based on what I&#x27;m seeing so far.</li>
    <li> i tried the product because of some of the really good reviews it had and I find I agree! After using it for about 2-3 weeks I find my skin is much bright a be softer than before. As you put it on the smell is very citrus and refreshing and you can feel your skin start to tighten right away. I haven&#x27;t used it as long but by a coUple weeks you can definitely start to feel and see the results.</li>
    <li> Not being a dermatologist, I can&#x27;t really say how well the product works. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation for me.</li>
    <li> Using this serum for about two weeks. It has lighten my dark spots. I have heard so much about this serum and really wanted to try it. Then I came across the opprotunity to get it free , try it and give honest opinion. Very easy to apply, no smell, no burning skin, no redness or itchy skin after use. I can say it is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Nice serum for your face.  I love the bottle packaging it is very beautiful.  The ingredients are well made also.  Its not sticky or stinky.  it has a pleasant smell and feel against my skin.  Ive only been using it for a few days so I do not know if it really improved my skin or not. but after a few minutes of application, my skin does feel lighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple weeks. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is one of the newer forms of Vitamin C, more gentle but it still makes my face a little dry - I&#x27;d assume then this would be a wonderful serum for those of you with normal or oily skin. The pump bottle is more convenient over using a dropper. As far as seeing any difference - it&#x27;s too soon to tell, it takes longer than 2 weeks to see any benefits in my case. I don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s a little earthy but so slight most people won&#x27;t even notice, but since I&#x27;m highly sensitive to odors it bothers me for a few minutes before it goes away.  [review sample sent for testing]</li>
    <li> I love this product I used this for 3 days now it&#x27;s my holy grail! The packaging is so awesome and classy plus the product it self it&#x27;s working great. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> We have tried several anti-aging serums and the Kleem Jeunesse is the most recent we had the opportunity to try on.  The bottle is 1 oz/30ml which should probably last around 45 days using a couple of pumps for every day.  It is easy to apply, you get the smooth feeling after you spread it evenly.  Although it didn&#x27;t say clearly, this Vitamin serum has hyaluronic acid which is an important ingredients in anti-aging.  I just have to be careful pumping this bottle because this serum is very watery/thin and thus difficult to control.  One single pump and it squirted all over my hand.  So make sure you catch everything in your palm.  Other than that, the serum feels great., without the plastic feeling effect on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided for this review.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!  I&#x27;ve only been using for about a week now and I can honestly say that I can already tell a difference in the texture of my skin.  My face feels smoother and firmer...and, it has such a pleasant citrus smell.  I can&#x27;t wait to see and feel the difference in my skin after using for an extended amount of time.  Highly recommend you try this product!</li>
    <li> I have been applying this serum on my face for about a week now, and I can honestly say I am hooked. I love everything about it. I have tried a few Vitamin C facial Serums but i have never been satisfied as much as i am with this product. My face is so soft, radiant, and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily which i really appreciate because most products I have tried do. It is light weight, and scent free. I have contact Dermatitis, so I am really picky with skin products. so when I accepted the offer for a free sample of this product, I loved that it was organic and is all natural which was very appealing because all my skin products are organic, and seem to have better luck with. but I had my doubts because most products I try make my skin flare up. With this product I have not had any issues. If anything I think it has actually helped my skin from frequent flare ups on my hands.  I love this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried several Vitamin C serums in the past and wanted to share my observations about the Kleem 20% Vitamin C serum after having used it for a couple of weeks. The clear colored serum comes in an airless bottle and is dispensed through a push down dispenser that ensured product freshness and sterility.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C has to be stored in a dark place as to not loose it&#x27;s potency and thus this stylish design accomplishes that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have used Kleem twice a day my face continues to look hydrated and smooth. The Vitamin C Serum glides on smoothly and is absorbed quickly into the skin. The serum has a very faint smell, probably from the ingredients and could almost be considered odor-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in California were the sun takes it&#x27;s toll on my skin. Finding a product that keeps my face hydrated and which can combat the effects of sun damage is always on my mind. Kleem organics includes a number of naturally derived ingredients that are gentle, yet powerful enough to rejuvenate my skin. The serum comes with a 54 page eBook &amp;#34; A practical Guide to Skin Care&amp;#34; that is very informative and a good read for anyone concerned about reversing the signs of aging and damage caused by pollutants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin looses it&#x27;s elasticity, due to the loss of collagen and lack of moisture. Vitamin C and Arginine  (both ingredients in the serum) help restore collagen production making skin feel and look more youthful. Kleem Organics have combined Vitamin C with other antioxidants such as Vitamin E, Aloe Vera and Witch Hazel with moisturizers for the skin such as Hyaluronic Acid, Jojoba Oil and Geranium to help the skin retain its moisture and increase skin hydration in skin types which lack the necessary amount of water The long list of natural/organic ingredients pack a lot of punch in this fairly priced beauty product. I can&#x27;t comment on wrinkle reduction or sun spots fading quiet yet, since I have not used the product long enough. However I am happy with the results thus far.I am happy with the results thus far.</li>
    <li> While Kleem Organics Anti Aging serum is not a miracle product, it does provide benefits to aging skin and works well under make-up.  One pump provides enough serum for my entire face, although sometimes I need a little more to include my neck.  It absorbs quickly enough for me to apply moisturizer over it in less than a minute.  And the astringent nature of witch hazel instantly tightens my skin.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent -- it smells unpleasant, like chemicals, even though it&#x27;s a natural organic product.  I have no idea which natural ingredient gives it that scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just two weeks of using this in addition to my usual moisturizer, my skin feels smoother and softer.  I can&#x27;t say that it makes my skin look younger, or that it has repaired fine wrinkles, but at least it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, as some products do.  Overall, the effects are definitely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle is a bit of a pain because the serum is so thin (as serums are) and the pump so forceful.  I sometimes splatter the product everywhere.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, so, unless I&#x27;m distracted, I am now careful to make sure that it ends up on my fingertips only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Kleem serum is a nice product, as long as you can block out or ignore the scent.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I have a identical tween brother and we just celebrated our 50th birthday this past January (2015). I have not told anyone of my relatives that I have been using this Vitamin C serum for several months, and to my surprise everyone kept asking me why do I look so young compared to my Brother... This is definitively working.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion for your face.  Dries fast and the more you use the smoother your face starts to look.  Wrinkles seem to start to get smaller and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Just Start using and I like it.</li>
    <li> Love the product, love the results...but (there&#x27;s always a but) I find that the pump squirts the product a little too far and gives me a little too much at one time. I find that I don&#x27;t need nearly as much product as the companies want to give me. I don&#x27;t know if they want to give out more so you&#x27;ll buy more (which you&#x27;ll want to do) or if they think I have a big head. I hope that is not the one. Make sure your toner has a chance to dry all the way, don&#x27;t be impatient like I am and try to put it on while it&#x27;s a little wet it tends to make the product feel a tad tacky.</li>
    <li> I am noiticing a difference in redness (rocacea).</li>
    <li> It goes on very well and absorbs immediately.  Some serums in the summer heat drip off outside.  My face was dry, which means that it absorbed completely in.  I havens used it long enough to see any change, but so far I really like the product and it does leave my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a week and it works!!!  My skin is softer, plus it is lightening the discolorations too!  Definitely an outstanding product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ordered on the 5th, received on the 7th, Amazon shipping impressive as usual, used it the very First night. Immediately after use I started to feel that my skin was tightening and feeling better right away. The serum is thin and moisturizing, not tacky or greasy. The smell is great.  I am 43 years old and my skin is sensitive, I have a regular routine and with the addition of this I find that it is even better to fight aging. Highly recommend this product.  I will give it to my sister to try and am sure she will love it as much as I do.  Had a discount code, same opinion.</li>
    <li> Upon arrival I was very impressed with the bottle itself. Very sleek looking bottle that it comes in. Once I opened it I apply a small amount, very little and it covered my whole face.  I can tell the product will last long. I used it for a few days on my 50+ years old face. Within three days I noticed a difference. Before I get to that let me tell you this much. When I applied it it was very smooth  Application, nongreasy.  It has taken my very rough dry out skin and made it look youthful again. And this is just within days. I&#x27;ve bought many other products that you had to do it for 30 days before you saw the results.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results using this daily for months it&#x27;s going to be wonderful I can already tell.  I plan to come back and do a before and after picture but I want to do that after 30 days.  The container itself will be easy to fit into your make up bag.  I recommend if you&#x27;re thinking of an anti-wrinkle cream of trying this product. I did get this product and a free/heavily reduced price to review it and give my honest opinion on it, and this is honest.</li>
    <li> I have used the Vitamin C Serum as directed.  I cleanse my face with a natural soap that I purchase from Australia. It is Lemon Grass &amp; Lemon Myrtle with Pure Plant Oil and I use a soft Buf Puff and rinse with tepid water.  After pat drying my skin I apply the Vitamin C Serum as directed.  However I have found that my skin has now become drier and looks parched.  The lines around my mouth are becoming deeper.  I also do not see any increased firmness.  Realizing that I am 81 years old I know I cannot expect a miracle but hoped for smoother, brighter result.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feels plus, I had some dark spots from the sun that started to fade away so that my complexion looks cleaner.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints except I hope I never run out of it.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic since I don&#x27;t like chemicals on my skin.  I&#x27;m 63 years old and when I tell other seniors, they don&#x27;t believe me.  While it is true that genetics helps, I heard that it makes up 1/3 of the solution.  The other 2/3 is what you eat, and what you put on your skin.  I was always into health when I was younger, and I guess it paid off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It rejuvenates my skin and noticeably reduced my fines lines and sagging. I love it:)))</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this product.  While I have LAUGH LINES, they are not as noticeable after using Kleem Organics!  I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month and so far around my eyes I have not seen a difference but I can feel one.  My face feels tighter.  This is an important thing to me as I have an autoimmune disease that makes me feel puffy from time to time.  While using Kleem Organics, I have not felt puffy!  Not one day!</li>
    <li> This product goes a long way.  I live in the High Desert where the moisture in your skin cells is basically sucked out by the arid climate.  This serum does lock in moisture and give those tiny lines a very good dose of the ever so healthy vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I love that its mostly natural and organic and contains Vitamin C &amp; E and Witch Hazel that is a great  for skin tightening. Has a really pleasant scent  A nicely designed bottle with a unique airless pump. Goes on so easy and absorbs quickly, non-greasy.  Made my skn feel better after just a few applications.  My skin feels and looked healthier each time I use it. You only need a little bit as it goes a long way.  I have noticed that my fine lines are less visable. I have recommended this to some of my family and friends,  This is one I will keep using.  I receive this product for testing and unbiased evaluation</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and leaves no oil which very easily leads to acne.  Left skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> This will make your skin look tighter and give it a glow.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  I like it.</li>
    <li> This product smells like an orange creamsicle but there is a slight chemical smell at times. It is also more watery than I thought it would be. I have used this product once and so far upon first impression I like the way it made my skin feel at first because it smoothed it out.</li>
    <li> Kleem provides a lot of tips, FAQs, etc.I am following the great suggestion to  gentle exfoliate the top layer of skin before applying!  The product is thinner than the other serums I have used; likely because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of extra unnecessary ingredients.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for my sensitive skin. I do like the feel of it as I use this for my face and I can see the difference with the dark spots also. Terrific product.</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of using the Kleem Organics Intensive Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum for a full month. This is the first serum that I have incorporated into my skincare regimen and I consider myself to have pretty decent skin but I am trying to find ways to slowly add in anti-aging skincare products. In order to do a fair review of the product, I made sure that I had been using other components of my skincare regimen for a while before using the serum (to make sure that any change I observe is due to the serum and not other products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used the serum during 2 types of regimens. Twice a week at night (since this has vitamin C, it can make the skin sensitive to sun exposure so I used the serum at night only and avoided direct sun without sunscreen), I would use a microdermabrasion brush with the gentle foaming cleanser that I have been using for the past 4 months. After cleansing, I would use a toner (one that I also have been using for the past 6 months) and let the toner mostly dry. After toning, I would apply the serum. I gave the bottle a gentle shake or inversion just in case anything settled and would use a total of 3 pumps to apply the serum all over the face and neck by using my fingertips. The serum did feel sticky as expected. It did not take long for the serum to absorb and afterwards, I applied the moisturizer that I had been using for the past 2 months. For the other 5 nights of the week, I would use the gentle foaming cleanser with my hands only and without the microdermabrasion brush, skip the toner and continue with the serum and moisturizer. I generally do not use toner and microdermabrasion brushes daily since As I work indoors, I do not expose my skin to much environmental factors. However, if I happened to have a hard workout at the gym, I would use toner and if it was an outdoor workout, also the microdermabrasion brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a deep skintone so I cannot speak to the brightening effects of the serum but indefinitely noticed firmer skin, especially in the under eye area. I was really excited to see this, particularly on days when I had not gotten a lot of sleep and I typically would have baggy eyes. I also noticed an overall glow to the skin that I had not seen before. My skin did not have any bad reactions to the product. In addition to overall improvements to my skin, I am very happy that a little of this product goes a long way - if you see the great effects like others have from this product, you won&#x27;t have to worry about breaking the bank. From my use of the product daily, it seems like the bottle will last about 3 months! I am very pleased with this product that I received complimentary for review purposes and although it is the first serum that I have fully incorporated into my skincare regimen, I am sure that it will rank high on my list as I try other products.ed firmer skin, especially in the under eye area.

    <li> My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first moisturizers I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with. After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> After trying out this product for about a month, this product is amazing! I did lighten my skin color! I love it!  It will feel sticky after put it on, but it&#x27;s gone after a minutes. I will definitely purchase this product again! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product. It makes my face feel great! I also use it as after shave and it works wonders to calm down any skin irritation. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality rejuvenation vitamin C serum. The serum itself is not thick at all and it very light. It rubs in quickly And smoothly and leaves my face feeling fresh and rejuvimated. I also love the look of this bottle and how easy it is to use. The pump makes it great to get the right amount without wasting any, and a little seems to go a long way with this stuff.  Product was purchased for the intent of review. Overall I am very happy with this rejuvenating serum and I can feel a diffrrnce in my skin after just one use. I have no doubt that within a week of use I will have a noticble difference in the color and smoothness of my skin.</li>
    <li> my face has never looked better! I usually don&#x27;t put stuff on my face because of it being so sensitive but it didn&#x27;t irritate my face like normal face creams would. Very happy with the results and very happy I got picked to review this amazing product! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This product feels amazing. It is light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin, absorbs quickly and smells delicious. Only need a small amount to apply to your entire face and feels absolutely refreshing. Love it</li>
    <li> This Kleem Organics 20% Pure Vitamin C + E Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face Rejuvenation is definitely a must have product for your face. I have acne scars,loose skin,lines,and combination skin. Not to mention my skin is pretty sensitive so using new products can be a little bothersome. However Kleem Organics has definitely been a great addition to my skin care routine! My skin doesn&#x27;t break out with this serum meaning no acne and no red skin from the sensitivity. My acne scars are actually a lot lighter then they have ever been and with continued use I have no doubt that they will disappear. My combination skin is neither dry nor oily with this serum because this serum hydrates your skin (keeping it from being dry) and absorbs evenly (keeping it from being oily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this serum comes in a pump bottle because it makes it so much easier to get the amount that you need without wasting because with this serum a little goes a long way. The bottle actually looks pretty and elegant. I love how this serum tightens and softens my skin. There is also a scent to it which isn&#x27;t overly strong and I actually like the smell. I would definitely recommend this Kleem Organics 20% Pure Vitamin C + E Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face Rejuvenation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Every woman desiring what is best for us ,the way we dress, the way how we looks ,.Thats why we never stop trying ,testing,discovering different products that fulfill our satisfaction weather it is apparel or beauty products.Me as woman taking care of my self ,enhancing my natural beauty is one of my priority.I have sensitive skin so Im very careful buying beauty products specially facial cream but it never stop me to try/discover new products .And I condiser of course affordabe,and have multiple benefits for my skin till I heard about The Kleem Organics Serum .&lt;br /&gt;1st day Im using it I know  the difference from my face,its smooth ,radiant all day .In several days continueing  using&lt;br /&gt;my dark spot area in my face starting to light specially the blemishes got from pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Its like a jackpot having this product saving me a lot of money for any treatment at the skin care centers,or spa.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this Kleem Serum even my husband notice the difference  that Im always blooming.I definitely recommend this. 👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> This has a nice, citrus smell.  Because it smoothes onto the skin easily, a small (half a pea sized) bit will do per application.  I try to take care of my skin and avoid overexposure to sunlight, so trying out this product was one more thing I was willing to try out.  I&#x27;m pleased with how it makes my skin feel after applying:...soaks in well, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.  I use it rather sporadically (once or twice a day every few days) when I haven&#x27;t already put on my facial moisturizer.  Overall, I like this product and have been happy to try it out!  :)</li>
    <li> I have tried &amp;#34;Many&amp;#34; serums and had no luck on results. Until I bought this product!!! I seen results immediately!!! I am so happy with this product! I am 51 years old, and have dark spots, this product actually makes them less apparent and I love the results!!! This product is amazing!!! I will be buying more!!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft, it&#x27;s more smooth and even and the dark spots are disappearing!!! This is like gold to me!!!&lt;br /&gt;All you need is a little for your face, I even put some on my neck, since I have a scar from surgery, and even that is looking better!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I have no problems with this product!</li>
    <li> Wow.  I really like the way this feels on my face.  I&#x27;ve been reading about this type of product and feel I have received a good quality product.  My face tingles when I use it.  The instructions for use are great.  I received this serum at a reduced price for my unbiased and honest opinion.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This lovely serum was purchased after reading about it on a beauty blog. Kleem Organics Vitamin C Serum is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for anti-aging of my skin. I use this serum in conjunction with tretinoin. I recommend it to anyone who wants to turn back the hands of time that the sun, age, &amp; free radicals have done to our skin. It has a natural citrus smell &amp; comes in an airtight bottle so it doesn&#x27;t quickly oxidize. It works well on any skin type &amp; the results are amazing! It gives instant luminosity and you&#x27;ll see exceptional results within 6 weeks of continual usage. Thank you again Kleem Organics for making an affordable product that works so well!!!</li>
    <li> I was actually looking online for a DIY recipe for Vitamin C serum when I ran across Kleem Intense Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum. I read everything I could &amp; realized this was exactly what I was looking for.  Joseph and Matteo did all the leg work and came up with an amazing product.  I can already see the difference in the texture and clarity of my skin.  My fine lines around my eyes are softer and my skin in general is more hydrated.  I will keep a look out for future products from them.  I highly recommend this product to women and men of all ages.</li>
    <li> Ive used this for a couple weeks now and I Absolutely love he results. I look 10 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;My friends have asked me what I am using so I got them to buy it too. Everyone who wants&lt;br /&gt;a younger less wrinkly face should really get this</li>
    <li> Because of needing to use acne products (on my middle aged face) my face and neck get super dry (living in the desert doesn&#x27;t help either). This product is very lightweight and it smells amazing. As soon as I massaged the serum onto my face it was like I could see the instant hydration. My face seemed brighter too. I&#x27;m a believer and in love with this product</li>
    <li> I have waited a few weeks to write this review to make sure I was providing a good review. So at first I wasn&#x27;t so sure because a lot of people were saying they saw immediate affects and I didn&#x27;t so I gave it some time since everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently. I am so glad I held off on my review. I must say I do like this product. After a few weeks of using this serum 2x a day I can feel a consistent softness to my skin. Thankfully I do not have issues with wrinkles, but I can see where my skin tone looks more even and it gives just enjoy skin tightening to tell the product works without over drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of products that tout vitamin C because I know it breaks down easily that is why I create my own vitamin C serum (there are tons of YT videos showing you how to do it and you can buy the ingredients right here on Amazon). With that being said I am impressed with this product because of the container - it helps to keep the vitamin C from oxidizing before it&#x27;s used. That is a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kleem Organics provided this product for my review and feedback.</li>
    <li> Smells just like oranges! I could feel a difference in my skin after first use</li>
    <li> First off I love anything that has Vitamin C and anti-aging properties. There is many great ingredients that is good for your skin. I apply the serum twice a day as recommended on the bottle. Every morning I wash my face with my personal face soap, apply a toner, and then I put the serum. I do the act same thing at night. I just love how it smells. My face feel so soft and it really hydrate my dry skin. It doesn’t make your skin feel oily at all. What so great about this serum is that there is a good amount that will last a month to two, or even more. I guess it really depend on how much you use. I recommended not going over board because a little goes a long way. I am very happy with this product and will look forwarding in purchasing more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product is for an exchange for an unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I just ordered from Amazon! And this product is truly amazing! I will be ordering again and even for my mom. I have rosacea and it has done wonders for my skin! I highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> Loving this product already! Leaves skin feeling tighter, truly gives a healthy glow, and makes me look years younger. A little goes a long way, &amp; absolutely can&#x27;t beat the results for the money.  Also makes me feel good knowing what I&#x27;m putting on my skin. I don&#x27;t give 5 star reviews easily, but this product truly deserves it!</li>
    <li> I received the product within a few days which was amazing!  I&#x27;ve never used a serum before and am getting used to it. I also appreciated the low price. It cost me more to ship then the low .20 cents for the product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well and feel great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 68. Been using this stuff for several months. Is it helping? I don&#x27;t know. But I do know that I like how it makes my skin feel. I get compliments on nice skin. Soaks right in, face feels clean, price is right.  Will keep on buying it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for 3 weeks as part of a new skin care regimen to minimize wrinkles and tighten the skin.  I use this every morning along with a retinol product both mornings and evenings, and I use a galvanic spa device twice weekly.  After 3 weeks, I am seeing very nice results.  My crows feet, worry and lipstick lines are almost gone.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using Kleem serum I can see a big difference in my skin! Other people have noticed too. My daughter even asked me what I was doing, she said my skin was&lt;br /&gt;Looking younger! I am on my third bottle, and plan to continue using the serum.</li>
    <li> Just started using 4-5 days ago. So far, so good, no complaints.  No skin sensitivity.  Would like to see a serum made like this for head to toe body lotion.</li>
    <li> They want words, words, words.....Too soon to tell but does seem to help better skin.......blah blah blah blah blah blah</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s with lines just starting to show on my face.  I use this in the morning just before putting on my daily moisturizer.  This serum makes my skin feel nice and tight.  I can&#x27;t say I notice any great change or improvement however (although how is one really supposed to tell with no basis for comparison?), but I like the idea of using an organic vitamin C serum rather than lots of chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial serum. The serum is a thin liquid. It feels good on my skin and leaves it smooth and soft. I need to be careful applying this; a little goes a long way. Use it mostly on forehead, cheeks, and neck. Avoid the area around your eyes, I got some a little close the other morning and I started tearing up. It works on delicate body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some science behind hyaluronic acid and how it does reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It isn&#x27;t the fountain of youth, but it does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this as an undercoat for a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the packaging of this lotion. The sliver cap and bottom are elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular Vitamin C serum for almost a month, and I really love it.  I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C sera and liked the results that they provided, but this particular product gets 5+ stars from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the package arrived quickly, and the product itself is presented in an attractive, high-quality bottle that uses a pump to dispense the serum.  One pump provides the perfect amount of product for my face, which eliminates waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself is thin and absorbs quickly, leaving my face feeling clean and very refreshed.  Since my skin can be a bit on the dry side, I always moisturize after it&#x27;s completely absorbed and my skin will stay soft and supple for the rest of the day.  I haven&#x27;t had any type of miracle wrinkle disappearances or skin repair, but there is change for the positive and I have noticed a brightening of tone as well as a difference in the skin under my eyes -- there is definitely a fresher appearance, which is a vast improvement since I struggle with insomnia and can get bags and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample of this product for review, and definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Skin care and make up are really not my thing and never have been.  However I&#x27;ve crossed over into my 40&#x27;s and am starting to notice I&#x27;m getting and looking older.  Although I still feel young at heart wrinkles are starting to appear.  So when I was offered a bottle of Kleem  Organics Vitamin C Serum I accepted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has been sitting at my computer for the past couple weeks and I have applied it a couple times a day.  This is not a miracle product but I have noticed subtle differences.  I like the way it makes the skin on my face feel.  My skin feels soft and smoother than it did.  I typically have dry skin but I no longer notice the dryness in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is really thin and runny, basically like water.  The pump shoots the serum out too fast and it took some practice so I wasn&#x27;t wasting the serum by getting it everywhere. The first couple of times I used this I didn&#x27;t realize I needed to compensate for how quickly the liquid comes out of the bottle.  I&#x27;ve figured out the angle to hold the bottle and right amount of pressure to apply and this now works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product dries quickly and does not feel sticky once rubbed in.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to wash my hands after applying it. When looking in the mirror I can see that my skin looks better than it did a couple weeks ago. Nothing anyone else might notice but I can tell a difference mainly under my eyes and that certainly isn&#x27;t from getting sleep because I&#x27;ve had much less sleep than usual the past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned about wrinkles give this product a try.  They do have a money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I’m not financially compensated for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kleem Organics Intensive Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum for more than a month. I&#x27;m a big fan of vitamin C serums, and Kleem Organics Vitamin C Serum has made it into my top tier. Importantly, the airless pump bottle is fabulous for maintaining the efficacy of the ingredients, and none of the other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried previously have used this more expensive and more effective packaging. Although you must pump it into your cupped hand so it doesn&#x27;t splatter (about 2 pumps is enough to cover my face and neck), I definitely prefer the pump to the traditional dropper and glass bottle. Kleem&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is a lightweight formula that will work for anyone, but I think it is perfect for those with oilier skin. Kleem Vitamin C Serum currently has an &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; scent that the owner explained was due to the combination of key ingredients witch hazel and ferulic acid as well as the fact that they are committed to maintaining a natural and high percentage of organic ingredients so it doesn&#x27;t have any masking chemicals. The scent fades immediately so it is not a deal breaker. Nevertheless, when I asked about it, the owners told me they are adding sweet orange oil to the next batch of product. Yay! I love a brand that is responsive to its consumers!! Kleem has helped hydrate and brighten my skin. I think it&#x27;s a good value, and the fact that it is not tested on animals is important to me.</li>
    <li> Been Using this for about 2 weeks, turkey neck seems to be improving. Skin seems brighter</li>
    <li> I hope this works. I have received this in return of my review. I just got this so haven;t tried it but when I do I will update my review with more info and if any issues. I am very excited to try it</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my face since I moved here in alaska.My face gets dry and oily..I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products but nothing changed at all..but when I tried this product,I noticed the improvement in just few days..My face is now dry and oil free..It doesn&#x27;t smell bad,and not itchy when I first tried it.I will recommend this to my friends..thanks for this great product and for the quick shipping..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I love how it makes your face feel soft, renewed and refreshed. I highly would recommend it for your wife, sister or mother. It comes in a nice elegant pump bottle. Well done!! Defiantly have a long time customer here :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. I only use it once a day and have seen a little bit of redness reduction and maybe a little a reduction in pore size. It&#x27;s not a huge difference but I&#x27;ll probably purchase it again. I have extremely sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it reduces the fine lines and wrinkles, age spots and discoloration of my face. This product has made my skin tone better. My skin used to be so dry and now it looks so much better. My husband has noticed that my face has cleared up and he said I look younger than I have in a long time. I really love this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice smooth even toned face.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got this at a free or discounted rate.</li>
    <li> Sorry! I have not seen any improvement to my face/neck area! this bottle is almost gone and it has not done what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> I received this Kleem Organics for honest unbiase reviews! the packaging itself is definitely neat. I&#x27;m still young and don&#x27;t have a wrinkles yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s perfect for my mom! I like the product since it&#x27;s organic. Can&#x27;t wait to give it to her and try. I&#x27;ll order again when she would absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> Wow! Within 1/2 hr of application my pores are much smaller and skin tighter.  I will definitely continue using and will try to update this review after a week or so.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is amazing. Tones, Tightens and Smells great. It reduces fine fines, wrinkles and revitalizes and hydrates your skin with tons of vitamins and antioxidants. This product is cruelty free and contains sun protection which is different from many other products. I love that it contains all natural and mostly organic ingredients. It also contains no harmful chemicals, why? because my skin doesn&#x27;t need those. I did receive this product free for review purposes, you can view my blog simplysamples on blogger #simplysamples to view other similar products that I have reviewed.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C skin serum is slightly milky with the clean scent of witch hazel. The slim, attractive bottle has a pump dispenser and a lid that fits tightly so it won&#x27;t come off when carried in a bag. It also can be kept in the refrigerator for a tingling sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells. It also minimizes the appearance of enlarged pores and decreases shininess in oily areas. It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mostly botanical formula has ingredients known to benefit the skin such as vitamin C, vegetarian hyaluronic acid, aloe, jojoba oil, and glycerin, many of organic source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months. The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kleem Organics provided a bottle of Jeunesse Intensive Rejuvenating Vitamin C Serum for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> KLEEM ORGANICS has a lot going for it as a company. Aside from the fact that their products are made under the strictest of lab conditions assuring the customer of a product that is totally trustworthy contents wise, they have boosted the effect of the usual Hyaluronic Acid formula with Vitamins C and E and Arginine to stimulate collagen formation. Their components are al natural form plant sources and the manner in which the product is packaged is one of the most secure on the playing table - a fine little pump that delivers the serum in one pump without wasting any and without requiring the applicator to be contaminated as it is &#x60;put back in the bottle the way so many other sera if his type are delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But an important aspect in their promotion of their product is that they include men in their advertising. Everyone knows men use anti-aging cosmetics, but few companies advertise that the collagen enhancer is for men as well as women. And that is a nice (and much appreciated) innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But down to the meaningful information. Does it work? Yes. It most assuredly does. Even after one application the very fine lines improve if not totally disappear. The deeper lines (aka wrinkles) will take longer, but follow the simple instructions offered by the company and you WILL notice improvement. They offer a 100% money back guarantee. This is a very fine product made by a strong new company that has a major future in the anti-aging industry! It is just the best product and the company support is the finest i have encountered.

    <li> So far I am really liking this product. I especially appreciate that it is organic. Serums can be a really powerful tool if used correctly. I always make sure to wash my face really well before use and to finish with a moisturizer.  I had an opportunity to try this for review purposes and it has a few advantages over other serums I&#x27;ve tried.  The first thing I noticed is that the bottle seems more high-end. Every other serum I&#x27;ve tried has came in the exact same glass bottle with a label slapped on. This has a pleasant cooling sensation and makes the skin feel tighter (this is thanks to the witch hazel, I believe.) It&#x27;s been FDA certified, so I felt safe using it. But the absolute most important thing is that it is not tested on animals.  If you Google cosmetic testing on animals you would see immediately why cruelty-free is the way to be. Even the hyaluronic acid is vegan. An added bonus I&#x27;ve noticed is that it&#x27;s starting to lighten some of my acne spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really the only thing I&#x27;m unsure about is the smell. It seems a little strange, slightly medicinal. Others have posted that they love the smell, so this could just be my personal interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really impressive.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and my mom really loves how it evens out her skin</li>
    <li> Love the Kleem Organics. Feels great and great substite to home made DIY Vitamin C serum I was using. Had no side effects and felt great. A sample was sent to me and since I was already using Vitamin C serum, I told yes! It has not failed me.</li>
    <li> I have done some research about the importance of Vitamin A, C and E to the skin. And I am so happy with this product. As a 40 years old woman, my skin is aging faster than ever. Pigmentation spots are all over my face. I have been using this Vitamin C serum about 3 weeks. I especially love to use it after micro-needles roll treatment, which helps my skin absorb better.  After 3 weeks using this serum, I noticed my skin has some glows and dark spots are lightened. Overall my skin looks a lot healthier than used to be. This serum is scentless and very easy to apply. I will continue to use it and I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a very excellent Vitamin C serum. I have used a few and can recognize the difference between the good and the imitators. A good Vita-C serum will apply easily, feel weightless, and (most importantly) absorb completely and quickly so I can apply my moisturizer. It basically should feel as if you haven&#x27;t applied a thing once absorbed, though I assure you it&#x27;s working! Most importantly, it does not feel gummy or pill up under moisturizer and makeup! Kleem has done it all, this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;My skin has a radiant glow (noticeable after 3rd use)&lt;br /&gt;My skin is noticeably smoother (within 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;A few sunspots on my cheeks are less noticeable and beginning to fade (within 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to note:&lt;br /&gt;-I have sensitive skin, so I always feel a little tingle when I apply it after washing my face both morning and night. This assures me that it is working! Once it has absorbed (within 30 seconds), the tingle subsides. It does not produce any redness of any sort on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is unobtrusive and basically non-existent, I often get headaches from the odors in beauty products so I am thankful for this.&lt;br /&gt;-The airless bottle is a fantastic concept. My first reaction was that the bottle is very nice looking! (Not that this matters much, but it never hurts to add a little style to the bathroom lol) There is actually a very important reason behind this nice-looking bottle and it is the first time I have ever seen it with a Vita-C serum - the serum is dispensed via pump. No air reaches the product reservoir, so it maintains it&#x27;s freshness and reduces product waste per use. I will admit the pump takes a little getting used to, the product comes out rather forcefully - once I figured out how to place my hand when dispensing it, I&#x27;ve been happy with this method!</li>
    <li> I have used the \\&quot;Best Anti Aging Vitamin C Serum\\&quot; I am 54 years old and for almost a month now and I must say I am shocked at how wonderful my face feels.  I live on a Ranch in Texas and with the heat and wind that we have to deal with my skin has really needed something extra and this product is perfect.  I apply it after cleansing my face every night and morning and then I apply my moisturizer after my face dries.  It is a clear liquid and absorbs well with a bit of water left on my face.  I have sun spots from being out in the sun and fine lines around my eyes and my husband noticed the difference he also stated that my face felt really soft and asked me what I was doing different.  I have also been putting it on my hands, they have red splotches on them from not wearing gloves in the garden and working with our livestock her on the ranch, and several scars from rose bushes, in other words my hands looked horrible, I knew if the Vitamin C Serum would work on my hands then it would be great for my face.  The results are amazing, my hands have smoothed out, the red spots have lightened and I believe with continued use they will completely fade.  I could not be happier with a product and I have tried several Serums and this is my favorite!  For the cost of this item you can&#x27;t go wrong, If it worked for my weathered skin it will work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-22-15 I wanted to update my review, since I can only review an item one time, I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for MONTHS now and I have used 2 bottles and my daughter has used 1 bottle and we are both very happy with this product, I have reduced using it on my face by applying it every 2 to 3 days however I apply it to the tops of my hands, and to the heels of my feet and to some small stretch marks that have almost disappeared from using this product.  What a wonderful product and I will update here if anything changes but as of today we both ages 54 and 30 will continue to use this product by KLEEM ORGANICS.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  Wish it went on sale again.</li>
    <li> great stuff..brightens up your skin noticeably</li>
    <li> As always when I buy a product I look for the verified purchases to be sure about the product before buying and I advise users to do the same. I have checked this and this product has great reviews from verified purchasers because it is great. I was given a sample to review and am always happy when the product is good so I can leave a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing to point out is that when you do use the pump spray, quite a bit comes out and it may require trial and error to find the exact pressure to apply and how many pumps you require for your face. In my case, two careful pumps cover my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, you will feel its effect right away, but it may take a couple of weeks before you can actually see the results. But this product does work and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels more like a moisturizer than a serum but that is not a bad thing. I actually prefer this.</li>
    <li> good product, great company!</li>
