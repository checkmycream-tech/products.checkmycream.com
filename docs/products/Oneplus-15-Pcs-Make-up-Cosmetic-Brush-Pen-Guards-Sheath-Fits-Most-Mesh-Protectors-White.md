<li> Plus they are a really good price compared to the horrible ones that Mac sells.</li>
<li> and I put them upside down</li>
<li> However, the fact is that the bristles will be squeezed together so it will be very difficult for the water remained on the bristles to evaporate properly!!</li>

    <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say here - I got exactly what I wanted so of course i&#x27;m happy.  This product is a low design that does a good job holding makeup brushes in its shape.  Do know that shipping does take time since it ships from China but it did arrive within the time frame listed.</li>
    <li> I have used these mesh guards on my brushes after I washed them. They retain their shape afterwards even from guarding a fat brush. Great product for the amount. I will buy again for my daughter.</li>

    <li> Perfect for my brushes.</li>
    <li> Great to have different thread-patterns for different brushes. Will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Does what they were bought for and my daughter thinks they are great</li>
    <li> I have heard so much good comment about these brush Guards but the brushes couldn&#x27;t get dried even after 3 days!!!! I was so pissed because everyone keeps saying that if using these brush guards after washing and erect them in an open container they would be dried very soon. However, the fact is that the bristles will be squeezed together so it will be very difficult for the water remained on the bristles to evaporate properly!! I&#x27;d rather just lay my brushes on a piece of paper towel...</li>
    <li> This seller is great! Super quick shipping. It shipped from China to California in exactly one week, as opposed to the expected shipping of over a month. The item is exactly as described. Professional packaging. You get 15 pieces in a variety of sizes. Fits all my makeup brushes, both big and small. Overall? Great service, great product, great price. Would definitely recommend. :)</li>
    <li> Happy with them but I wish they have smaller sizes. All meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> These are too loose and week can&#x27;t handle the weight of my eyeshadow brushes and since the openings are too big the brushes end up fraying. Just look for the actual brush guard, it&#x27;s a good investment</li>
    <li> Very nice keeps the shape of the brushes over all good product</li>
    <li> Purchased for daughter.  Great price and even though they shipped from overseas, they arrived relatively quickly.  She&#x27;s happy with them.</li>
    <li> Guards arrived very fast. They are sturdy and stretch enough. Affordable product and perfect for any size brushes even the wider ones. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Good price and great for brushes</li>
    <li> only comes in one size. doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Too thin, I got some at another retailer and they was much thicker,so I woul recommend these, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet, but the set I received only has one size not 3 as stated in the description. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work for most of my brushes though.</li>
