      <li>Cream has very pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and a good amount in the container, great value!</li>
      <li>I found that this product helped a great deal with the frizziness of my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great product once you figure out the correct amount to use in your hair.</li>
      <li>Motions is a great line and I will continue to buy Motions products, but I will be not getting this again.</li>
      <li>and it comes out great each morning that I use this.  </li>
      <li>but it does a great job for smoothing out the front and</li>
      <li>My curls look defined and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all which is really great.</li>
      <li>The best product I&#x27;ve found for defining my curls is, surprisingly, Suave Professionals Mousse Captivating Curls Whipped Cream Mousse.</li>
      <li>However, my MIL loved it.</li>
      <li>Nothing to lose but a wonder bouncy look with gorgeous curls.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It smells good too and doesn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;musty\\&quot; smell between washings.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with the results from this one though.</li>
      <li>I never could wear an afro because my naturally wavy hair just wouldn&#x27;t stand up proudly like the best afros.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even own one.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it is as a curling product.</li>
      <li>I feel confident that it will be a good purchase for me.</li>
      <li>and this cream gives it a really nice definition.  </li>
      <li>I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s very curly \\&quot;Jewfro\\&quot; hair, and it worked great!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;She had no complaints, but basically, she said she noticed no difference whatsoever, and she would love for some great product to come along and do an outstanding job of preventing frizz or making curls spectacularly</li>
      <li>this and found that it was very effective in keeping my hair clean and even.</li>
      <li>The smell is mild and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I saw a similar product on the Hallmark Marie show where the guest  stated that in India they use a mix coconut oil with either India&#x27;s own neem oil or amla oil to get the perfect shine for your hair.</li>
      <li>It is always more frizzy when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because I have better products, but since I still use it for my \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot;, I guess it semi-works for me.</li>
      <li>Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing ]] which I have used for many years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product, but it goes on quite greasy and sticky.  </li>
      <li>so I just swirl my fingers on the top and that is all I use for my hair</li>
      <li>Once again, everyone&#x27;s hair responds different so it is best to experiment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>love Motions</li>
      <li>My hair still looked frizzed, more than when I use no product.</li>
      <li>is you&#x27;re looking for a more definitive styling product.</li>
      <li>I also used this healthy hair treatment - treated my hair and threw it into ponytail the off to the gym - I washed it after about 2 hours and it was so shiney and stronger.</li>
      <li>This product is not horrible for the price</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;hydrate my hair&amp;#34; was a better product.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
      <li>This is now one of my favorite hair care products.</li>
      <li>, I got some more curl and lovely sheen.</li>
      <li>Not the best product for 4C hair especially in the winter months.</li>
      <li>My curls, which I LOVE</li>
      <li>So if you use a fragrant shampoo it will complement it, without overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with all the charactheristics of it, texture, scent and purpose but for my hair its nothing but a greasier version of the Hydrate My Curls...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t add definition any more than the HMC does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: the three-product-combo works a lot better, but I didn&#x27;t have to go to a salon to get this, and using the Define</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>So when I get more length, I may try to ccombine the products and test the results again, in the fall.</li>
      <li>but it just OK.</li>
      <li>Perfect post shampoo and as a daily moisturizers and curl definer.</li>
      <li>You will still be able to keep your signature fragrance and have lovely curls.</li>
      <li>My Curls Creme has been doing a phenomenal job with my hair.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that I love this</li>
      <li>the more I use it.</li>
      <li>I dislike having to give this review, as I know I&#x27;m not the person this manufacturer intended to use this product, but I think better advertising is needed to get this product to people it will truly be beneficial.</li>
      <li>Like most people some parts of my hair is straighter than others.  </li>
      <li>The Motions Hydrate My Curls is an excellent companion to the Define My Curls and combining them gives your hair that much more moisture to help defeat dry brittle hair.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Naturally You Define My Curls Creme works best for me if I apply it to freshly washed hair just before I style my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is more like a gel, with some conditioning ability and light oil.</li>
      <li>I definitely would recommend this product if you want to maintain a healthy, shiny, and beautiful head of hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You really have to work it through your hair and get good coverage with it.</li>
      <li>I smooth it on my fingertips and &#x27;hand-comb&#x27; my bangs and hair and it gives instant lift, nice definition and a very nice shine.</li>
      <li>This has a very light fragrance and even that dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>though our daughter has incredibly curly hair naturally, there are times when the curls simply fall apart or just do not look good anymore</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this before going out for the evening, but for day-to-day use, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
      <li>Fantastic creme for my over processed color treated hair.</li>
      <li>It is lightly scented.</li>
      <li>I prefer the styling pudding over the creme for her hair, but this one still works great and adds extra shine.</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:moCE50B6M69ZQ7]]Although this product line is marketed for ethnic hair, I find, as a caucasian male, that it works great for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is pleasant and evaporates quickly, but that&#x27;s the only redeeming quality.</li>
      <li>you really have to take your time and work the product into your hair, and WALL-LA!!!</li>
      <li>I really like how this creme is very natural and the product has natural ingredients that make my hair feel good and look great.</li>
      <li>The product is lightly scented and pleasant, and fades away shortly after application.</li>
      <li>I was excited to use this</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any improvement in hair moisture, and it did not do anything special for my curls.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my hair because it is very dry.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this product and was very hopeful before trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hair line because they leave my hair full of moisture and full of life.</li>
      <li>I imagine it would be good for making dreadlocks because, that&#x27;s essentially what it did to my hair.</li>
      <li>Many of them do a good initial job, but the next day you have to really work with your hair to try and get it looking good again.</li>
      <li>It worked great on my MIL, and no matter how light my wife would go on the product, it was too heavy on her curls.</li>
      <li>I worked the product through my hair, or tried to, and found out quickly that it seemed to sort of \\&quot;gunk up.\\</li>
      <li>I really like as well--it does a great job in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has a quick drying time.</li>
      <li>Overall a very nice product for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it provides great moisture, curl definition and shine without weighing the hair down and feeling oily.</li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s with a bit of skepticism I try new hair products any more.</li>
      <li>exactly what i was looking for!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice not to have to wash it daily to remove styling products.</li>
      <li>applied this product to freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>It works best for Wash and Go styles especially if you are on vacation and need something to dry fast and quick.</li>
      <li>and it also helps tame the frizzy fly away</li>
      <li>You will have to experiment to get the right amount for your hair.</li>
      <li>product smells great, but is very messy.</li>
      <li>However, we found that when applied to dry hair WITHOUT other products, it works best.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it it seemed to work some softening my hair but the curls were not defined</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was heavy and it didn&#x27;t define my curls it made my hair heavy and lay flat the product was to thick for my hair</li>
    <li> like a glue. i have pipe curls, while it helped them not frizz it also weighed them down to just heavy waves</li>
    <li> Granddaughter says &amp;#34;It works Nana&amp;#34; manages her curly hair!</li>
    <li> Returning. It&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this but it did not live up to my expectations. I would recommend something else as this product is a bit tacky and sticky.</li>
    <li> This product is a ten star</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of learning how to manage my natural hair, and I purchased this product as a result of a recommendation from an acquaintance.  It&#x27;s an okay product, but it goes on quite greasy and sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t remain that way, but, initially, that&#x27;s how it goes on.  Additionally, I don&#x27;t find that it helps to define my curls any better than the other products that I&#x27;ve tried (there have been quite a few), and ultimately, upon drying (the best results come from using this product on wet hair), I find that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturized as I expected.  I don&#x27;t hate this product, but I don&#x27;t love it either.  It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> I tried the Motions Define my curls crème after I received it in a product swap. I tried it with a twist out and the results were greasy hair that left my hands feeling gooey when I touched my dried twist out. I also tried a wash and go and my curls were very defined but the residue and grease was not worth the trouble. I have 4a medium length hair. Don&#x27;t buy this product and I should&#x27;ve known when I got it at a product swap that it was less than stellar.</li>
    <li> I think it was not suited for my hair type which is 4a,b and c all over....i ended up giving it to my cousin. It is rather sticky though so im not sure if i would have continued using it even if it worked with my hair....</li>
    <li> The texture of the cream was very unexpecting you would think that if its a creme it should have looked like on it has a weird texture. but overall all it worked well its sticky at first and then it completely comes off your hands with no problem does not leave the hair sticky or dry.</li>
    <li> I will be the first one to admit that I have straight hair and no curls.  However, I like to style my hair every now and then and this cream gives it a really nice definition.  I put a little bit of it at the ends and it helps me style my hair and curl it up by using a wide brush.  Cream has very pleasant smell.  So if you use a fragrant shampoo it will complement it, without overwhelming.  It goes the same if you like to spray some of your favorite perfume into your hair.  You will still be able to keep your signature fragrance and have lovely curls.</li>
    <li> I have over-processed, dry, curly hair. I like using this product on my hair. You can use this on dry or wet hair. It helps define my curls only when I use it on wet hair. When I use it on dry hair, it makes my hair appear shinier.  It reminds me of the [[ASIN:B001E763K4 Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing ]] which I have used for many years. A little goes a long way with this product. Too much and your hair will look really greasy. You will have to experiment to get the right amount for your hair. It is lightly scented.</li>
    <li> The wife wanted to change her look a little. A very small amount of this styling creme went a long way. Her hair glimmered and appeared wet. Very eay to apply with stunning results , she is presently checking out the rest of the product line.</li>
    <li> This product worked well on my 4c natural hair. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> This is now one of my favorite hair care products. I use it after I&#x27;ve washed my hair to restore moisture. Works great on my hair because it is very dry. Oh, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This product, I brought with the Hydrate My curls, which I LOVE........ I dont care for this, too much. I am in love with all the charactheristics of it, texture, scent and purpose but for my hair its nothing but a greasier version of the Hydrate My Curls... It doesn&#x27;t add definition any more than the HMC does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say use it together but that&#x27;s too much product at once, in the summer.  My hair is 4b/c,and responds well to the motions naturally line...So when I get more length, I may try to ccombine the products and test the results again, in the fall.</li>
    <li> It might be a matter of hair type, but this did not work for my hair.  The results were zero. I discarded it.</li>
    <li> This is a first time purchase for me.  So far so good.  I feel confident that it will be a good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer after I apply my leave in during a twist out. My hair is soft and juicy after I use it. I have very thick and curly 3c4a natural hair and I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and I have no complaints. Its not creamy, greasy, nor does it leave a residue feeling. Its clear, the smell isnt too strong but it doesn&#x27;t mix well with oils ie: castor oil, but it does give your hair a natural shine.  Even after I add my styler (gel) my hair  is still soft with this stuff.</li>
    <li> My wife has thick curly hair, and seen this and thought that she would give it a try. \\&quot;It smells nice, and it is like a thick gel substance that goes along way. My hair gets really frizzy and I have to add gel, grease, hairspray, among countless items to keep my hair from frizzing out. This product works wonders, apply to your hair wet or dry and style how you please. This is definitely a product worth trying if you have thick, curly, or frizzy hair. Nothing to lose but a wonder bouncy look with gorgeous curls.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you probably have a slew of hair products you bought to try, used a few times, then decided you were sorry you bought them, so they go to the back of the cabinet until you clear it out and throw them away. So, it&#x27;s with a bit of skepticism I try new hair products any more. Many of them do a good initial job, but the next day you have to really work with your hair to try and get it looking good again. My hair is short, thick, and rather fine, so even with a layered cut I am always trying to give it some curl, definition and volume. Enter this product...Motions Naturally - You Define My Curls Creme has been doing a phenomenal job with my hair. It leaves it soft, clean-feeling and gives a definite shine. I have used this 3 days in a row at times and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, limp or over-producted. Maybe that&#x27;s a new word, but you know what I mean. I wash my hair every 2-3 days and it&#x27;s nice not to have to wash it daily to remove styling products. I will also be reviewing another Motions Naturally styling product I really like as well--it does a great job in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this is you&#x27;re looking for a more definitive styling product. The consistency of this one is that of a gel. It only takes a small dab or two, about the size of a dime or so, to do the job. Err on the side of using less then adding more if needed.  I smooth it on my fingertips and &#x27;hand-comb&#x27; my bangs and hair and it gives instant lift, nice definition and a very nice shine.</li>
    <li> When I got this styling pudding I did not know it was marketed for African-American hair care.  I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s very curly \\&quot;Jewfro\\&quot; hair, and it worked great!  It made her hair very shining and defined the curls without being sticky or greasy.  It also smells wonderful.  I prefer the styling pudding over the creme for her hair, but this one still works great and adds extra shine.</li>
    <li> I received this product through the vine program. I have very dry hair and health issues and medications has caused my hair to be very damaged, breaking, thin and dry. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that I can use to keep my hair moisturized while wearing braids, weaves and wigs and this product does work . . . temporarily. The packaging advises users to use this product in conjunction with the \\&quot;Define My Curls Pudding\\&quot; for desired results. It helped moisturize my hair for a short time, but when I slept, even with a silk scarf, I woke up to a greasy pillow, and by morning, my hair was just as dry as it was before I applied the product. Another issue I had with these products is that when I moisturized my hair with them and wore a head scarf, it gnatted my hair off. I recently had to cut out gobs of gnatted hair from my head and after examining the hair, I realize that the build up of this product after only a couple of uses made my hair dirty and itchy. If I have to wash my hair every day after using this product, that really defeats the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; issue.  I&#x27;d probably continue to use this product until I found something else that worked better, because \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; is just not an option for me. Because this product was used in conjunction with the Pudding, these reviews may be similar.</li>
    <li> It made my hair hard and weighed it down, I have light fluffy hair so it dried it out. I do not Like this product</li>
    <li> I have long hair that isn&#x27;t curly but I have problems with frizziness. I hoped that this Motions Naturally You would solve some of the problem. I found that this product helped a great deal with the frizziness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great, but is very messy. The less is more philosophy should be adhered to in this case. There are definitely results to be had, but you need to be careful not to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Motions Naturally You isn&#x27;t very expensive and is worth a try if you want to tame your hair. I don&#x27;t know how effective it is as a curling product. I&#x27;m sure there are other options for frizzy hair but you might find some other viable options in this price range. I was very satisfied with the results from this one though.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly Caucasian hair. If I apply product, it goes into more defined curls, but just washing it is enough to make it naturally curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was more weighted down by this product, which is always a bonus, but I also didn&#x27;t see a defining curl like I would with Frederick Fekkai products or even coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I really like how this creme is very natural and the product has natural ingredients that make my hair feel good and look great. My curls look defined and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all which is really great.</li>
    <li> This product smells sort of like a summer rain or tropical fruit trees. I can&#x27;t really put my finger on that scent. It smells pretty good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, but is not a miracle. I have soft, yet tightly coiled hair. Anything too heavy makes my hair lose body and lay flat/limp. Anything too light makes my hair frizzy and thick. This was too heavy if I applied too much and if I applied too little, it did nothing...but it does a great job for smoothing out the front and back \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot; area. I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product, so I use it just like Jam or Gel for my \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot; and not my entire head any more. I can use it daily on dry hair so my front and back do not wave up (like when applying to wet hair). I think a drier/thicker/harder hair type may stand up well to this product. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work, but you must have a certain hair texture to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because I have better products, but since I still use it for my \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot;, I guess it semi-works for me.</li>
    <li> I teach water aerobics and my curls can get very dry and brittle(frizzy). Motions Naturally You, Define My Curls Cr&amp;egrave;me has restored bounce, shine and defined my curls better than any other product I have used!&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! Use Sparingly or risk having your hair look greasy! I use a dab about the size of my pinky fingernail and sometimes even that tiny amount can look \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is primarily for people with curly hair - it contains natural oils which will help even out curly hair which is stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this and found that it was very effective in keeping my hair clean and even.</li>
    <li> This stuff works on my hair which is 4a, b, and c you really have to take your time and work the product into your hair, and WALL-LA!!! curls everywhere!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and I really like it...but beware, do NOT use too much! It will make your hair greasy and heavy.  The product is thick paste almost like wax so I just swirl my fingers on the top and that is all I use for my hair (it is long...about mid-back).  It keeps the frizz down and helps it hold curl. I wash my hair at night and put it up in socks to curl it and it comes out great each morning that I use this.  It is always more frizzy when I don&#x27;t use it.  It will last for a long time no more than you need to use to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This gel tangles my hair. I imagine it would be good for making dreadlocks because, that&#x27;s essentially what it did to my hair. Except I don&#x27;t want dreadlocks or tangled clumps of hair. Maybe my hair doesn&#x27;t have enough natural curl for this product to work. My hair ranges from wavy on dry days to curly on humid days. So that might be why this product defined clumps instead of curls on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very greasy and leaves my hair very heavy. When applying it I feel like I have glue on my finger tips it&#x27;s so sticky</li>
    <li> exactly what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> Not the best product for 4C hair especially in the winter months. This product works better when hair is completely wet. It has a quick drying time. The problem is it does not have enough moisture in it for winter months. It reminds me of the old VO5 treatment. When its hot outside it melts all over your face and cam cause acne or skin rash. Not the best situation. This product is not horrible for the price but if you have an emergency and can&#x27;t find anything else then go for it. It works best for Wash and Go styles especially if you are on vacation and need something to dry fast and quick. For the price you can&#x27;t complain. It is what it is.</li>
    <li> Really defines my curls!  i used it twice, one for a twistout and the other for a wash and go.  Both times the curls were so defined!  Smells great and a good amount in the container, great value!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moCE50B6M69ZQ7]]Although this product line is marketed for ethnic hair, I find, as a caucasian male, that it works great for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not someone who likes to fuss with hair much. I get out of the shower, towel dry my hair and then typically apply something to my wavy/curly hair to help it out a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like mousse or gel products that make my hair hard and crunchy. And I don&#x27;t like heavily fragranced products. Motions Define My Curls Cr&amp;egrave;me meets both those requirements and I like it quite a bit,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the product reminds me of \\&quot;Vasoline\\&quot; although that is only for purposes of describing what it reminds me of, As far as how it feels, it is definitely NOT like vaseline. It is in fact not greasy whatsoever. I do not exactly apply it as suggested on the product label. What I do is get a blob on my fingers and distribute it evenly on my fingers, then I just run my fingers through my hair to distribute the product in my hair. That&#x27;s it. I do nothing else. It leaves my hair soft,  but defines the curls and does not smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviews that characterize this as too perfumy... I don&#x27;t get that at all. This has a very light fragrance and even that dissipates quickly. And for all the \\&quot;leaves my hair greasy and sticky\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t get that either, This product is not greasy. Perhaps those people are using too much product in their hair, I mean, look at my video... does it look like my hair is greasy? It&#x27;s not at all. It&#x27;s shiny but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the Motions pudding [[ASIN:B0072XT8BA Motions Naturally You, Hydrate My Curls Pudding 8 Ounce]]and I actually prefer that for my hair, although they both give me a somewhat similar end effect.</li>
    <li> I have slightly wave hair and this added extra wave without an curling iron. I also used this healthy hair treatment - treated my hair and threw it into ponytail the off to the gym - I washed it after about 2 hours and it was so shiney and stronger. I saw a similar product on the Hallmark Marie show where the guest  stated that in India they use a mix coconut oil with either India&#x27;s own neem oil or amla oil to get the perfect shine for your hair.</li>
    <li> Motions got it right with this creme for naturally curly hair. I apply it to wet hair and it holds my curls all day. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair either. Curls are soft.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product and was very hopeful before trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product does not deliver. If anything I noticed my hair was more dry on the ends after using it for a week. I have long layers of coarse naturally wavy hair. I put the product in when my hair was towel dried and let it dry naturally. The first time I used it it seemed to work some softening my hair but the curls were not defined and actually it weighed my hair down pullin the curl out. I used about the size of a dime. I increased what I used to the size of a quarter with the same results. My hair still looked frizzed, more than when I use no product. It never looked greasy though. The smell is mild and pleasant. It does look and feel like vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to cut shorter layers soon and try the product again. I will update afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:&lt;br /&gt;Cut layers into my hair and gave this product another try.  Unfortunately I had the same bad results.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product. The best product I&#x27;ve found for defining my curls is, surprisingly, Suave Professionals Mousse Captivating Curls Whipped Cream Mousse.</li>
    <li> Our daughter is a caucasian 6 year old with curly hair (think Curly Sue).  I mention this because there is a misperception that this product is only intended for African American usage. That is simply untrue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though our daughter has incredibly curly hair naturally, there are times when the curls simply fall apart or just do not look good anymore (I guess the word flat or tangles is applicable). And, since she is hyper sensitive about how she looks when she leaves the house, she demands her hair be either 1) very curly or 2) completely straightened with a hair straightner.  This product gives us the option to revitalize the curls very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody&#x27;s method of use will vary.  However, we found that when applied to dry hair WITHOUT other products, it works best.  The texture is somewhat thick compared to typical hair gels.  We work in small increments starting with a small amount spread on the palm of our hands and then applied to the hair by rubbing it in. We will repeat the process as needed, working with small amounts because we found that if we use a large amount, hair will appear greasy (also noted by other reviewers) or we will have to work hard to spread clumps of the product throughout her hair.  We also applied the product to wet hair but found it leaves the hair too shiny.  Once again, everyone&#x27;s hair responds different so it is best to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found the product will last for at least two days and is easily \\&quot;reactivated\\&quot; by wetting the hair.  Also found it works very well in combination with [[ASIN:B0072XT8BA Motions Naturally You, Hydrate My Curls Pudding 8 Ounce]].</li>
    <li> Very sticky like syrup. It does not go in my hair well</li>
    <li> This is a great hair creme! A very little bit goes a long way, so expect this 8 oz. tub to last quite a long time. It applies easily, and gives coarse, dull hair a nice luster, while helping keep the hair healthy and prevents brittleness. Do not go overboard on application though, or else you&#x27;ll go quickly from a soft sheen to looking like you dunked your head in vaseline. The product is lightly scented and pleasant, and fades away shortly after application. Overall a very nice product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Always looking for products for my natural hair. Usually I find that they don&#x27;t give enough shine, tend to be oily, dry my hair, or don&#x27;t give a good twist-out. Well, this product was all of the above (and how rare was that!).  It also had the nice addition of being a bit sticky, which really was not fun. I will say that the price of these motions natural hair products are reasonable, which is a plus!  The &amp;#34;hydrate my hair&amp;#34; was a better product. I actually use it on my son&#x27;s hair. But the &amp;#34;define my hair&amp;#34; did not work for me!  I certainly won&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> I tried [[ASIN:B007A592HU Motions Naturally You, Define My Curls Crème]] to replace the three more expensive products that I use on a regular basis. I got some curl but not as much as I hoped.  When I added [[ASIN:B0072XR560 Motions Naturally You, Radiating Hair Gloss]], I got some more curl and lovely sheen. It&#x27;s still not as much curl as I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the three-product-combo works a lot better, but I didn&#x27;t have to go to a salon to get this, and using the Define My Curls and Radiating Hair Gloss *combined* cost less than one of the salon products. I wouldn&#x27;t use this before going out for the evening, but for day-to-day use, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> Usually it takes a couple of days for my natural hair to fully recover moisture after a shampoo and conditioning,  but this curl creme allows my hair to bounce hack instantly.  Additionally, it provides great moisture, curl definition and shine without weighing the hair down and feeling oily. This has replaced all other products that I use.  Perfect post shampoo and as a daily moisturizers and curl definer.</li>
    <li> My mother in law and wife both have curly hair. My MIL has thicker hair and my wife has thinner hair. It worked great on my MIL, and no matter how light my wife would go on the product, it was too heavy on her curls. However, my MIL loved it. The product sat well with her textured hair, and it was shinier without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is very heavy and leaves hair sticky and stiff, even though I used very little, It looks and feels like thick vasoline. I don&#x27;t see any improvement in hair moisture, and it did not do anything special for my curls.  It actually seemed to dry the hair the more I use it. The fragrance is pleasant and evaporates quickly, but that&#x27;s the only redeeming quality. I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
    <li> The unfortunate thing about this review is evidently I am not the target consumer for this product. I am a caucasion woman with naturally curly, very thick hair, that has a tendency to frizz up. This product - as I now see on the Amazon product page - is targeted for individuals who are African-American. I can only review this product as it worked (or didn&#x27;t) for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem I encountered was the fact the Amazon Vine label was firmly afixed to the part of the jar&#x27;s label that gave instructions on how to use this product. And Amazon Vine labels are made not to be removed. Second, what instructions were visible are written in teeny-tiny print in colors that are very difficult for my 52 year old eyes to make out - even with my reading glasses. Since most products such as this require a small amount applied through wet/damp hair, that is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product to freshly washed hair. I applied a little less than a quarter-sized amount. The product itself, even though stated as a créme, heavily resembled a simple jar of vaseline when opened. I debated whether to actually put this in my hair, fearing it would cause too much greasiness, but hoped it might dry up. I worked the product through my hair, or tried to, and found out quickly that it seemed to sort of \\&quot;gunk up.\\&quot; I tried to work it through with my fingers and ended up with a tangled mess. I started to panic, but ended up working enough strands through to resemble some order. (My hair is shoulder-length) What I ended up with was a mix of wet hair and vaseline-like grease, and it was all plastered to my head. YUK! I got out the blow dryer and the diffuser, and went to work. Normally, I only blow dry my hair to get most of the wet/dampness out and then finger-fluff the rest of it to complete dryness. That didn&#x27;t work with this product. I had to dry and dry and dry and dry. And my hair was simply staying flat, flat, flat! I tried fluffing and scrunching and drying from underneath. By the time I was done, my hair was sort of still curly, felt as greasy as though I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in several weeks, and it felt as though I had a helmet on my head. My hair felt stiff and dirty. The entire day I felt dirty and grungy and just horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the worst of this? When I washed my hair the next day (I normally only wash my hair every 2 to 3 days, but with this gooey, greasy gunk, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it out of my hair!), it took several shampoos before I felt as though this stuff was out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using this product, but then I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the target consumer. I dislike having to give this review, as I know I&#x27;m not the person this manufacturer intended to use this product, but I think better advertising is needed to get this product to people it will truly be beneficial.</li>
    <li> I have hair that can go a little curly and frizzy. I&#x27;m always interested in trying new products to help define and control. After receiving this I realized I&#x27;d ordered a heavy &#x27;salve-like&#x27; product. My mind flashed back to high school and an African American friend of mine who tried to convince me to wax my baby hairs down around the edge of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This effect DOES NOT look good on a blonde girl with pale freckly skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buyer beware...pay attention to the &#x27;Ebony&#x27; stamp on these products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product once you figure out the correct amount to use in your hair. Everyone is different - so we all need different amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more like a gel, with some conditioning ability and light oil. It says to use it on dry hair, but through experimenting, you will find you can use it on dry hair too, it just has to be applied properly for your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really have to work it through your hair and get good coverage with it. If you get too much in an area, it is going to get clumpy and greasy. If you don&#x27;t use enough, you won&#x27;t get the results you want. Work it through well with your hands and comb through with your fingers, kind of pinching coating each curl section, all the way down to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down too much. It can revive dry hair quite well and get the curls back into shape and eliminate the frizz. It smells good too and doesn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;musty\\&quot; smell between washings.</li>
    <li> Motions Naturally You Define My Curls Creme works best for me if I apply it to freshly washed hair just before I style my hair.  I&#x27;m not one to use hair dryers.  I don&#x27;t even own one.  This product helps to hold my curls because my hair tends to get straighter when it dries.  Like most people some parts of my hair is straighter than others.  Growing up I never could wear an afro because my naturally wavy hair just wouldn&#x27;t stand up proudly like the best afros.</li>
    <li> Motions Naturally You! Define my Curls helps lock in the moisture of your natural hair and it also helps tame the frizzy fly away ends to relax hair. I have a \\&quot;low-boy\\&quot; cut and I use it to lay my edges down and keep them from rolling up too much or becoming dried out along the hairline.  Define my Curls has the same consistency as the product \\&quot;Jam\\&quot;, but it is a little more thicker which is better for your natural hair because it will last much longer. I like that this product does not leave a filmy residue as some of the other natural hair products can produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Motions Naturally You! Hair line because they leave my hair full of moisture and full of life. The Motions Hydrate My Curls is an excellent companion to the Define My Curls and combining them gives your hair that much more moisture to help defeat dry brittle hair. I definitely would recommend this product if you want to maintain a healthy, shiny, and beautiful head of hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, so I agreed to review this product so my wife could try it. She is always using some anti-frizz product because her hair is very curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was decidedly underwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had no complaints, but basically, she said she noticed no difference whatsoever, and she would love for some great product to come along and do an outstanding job of preventing frizz or making curls spectacularly bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did complain that it took too long for the greasy feeling to go away. Other reviewers have complained about it being heavy or having a mineral oil look. My wife called it greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I simply shampooed and conditioned my hair with my regular brand Mane N&#x27; Tail.  I then towel dried my hair and applied this creme.  I combed it through &amp; then scrunched it up and let it dry naturally.  My hair felt soft and controlled all day.  Fantastic creme for my over processed color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that I love this but it just OK. It makes my hair very hard and crunchy. I use it as directions says, I have used it both wet and dry hair and although it define my curls. Motions is a great line and I will continue to buy Motions products, but I will be not getting this again. I still have well over an entire jar of this.</li>
