<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this lotion. Skin feels so smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Best cream on the market. Love this stuff. Try it you will never use any thing else.</li>
    <li> excellent, first started using it when I bought first can from SAMS Club.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have found out that Sam&#x27;s will have back in stock in July!!!! yey!!!! lessor price!!!</li>
    <li> This cream is great for all over skin care. Glides on easily and no greasy after feel.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product timing, packaging and product quality</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. My son has Type I diabetes and this is the only lotion that keeps his skin hydrated. I buy it at my local Sam&#x27;s club for $8.98 for a 16 ounce jar. It&#x27;s unbelievable what Amazon is charging for this. Very sad for such a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Best Body lotion.</li>
    <li> Nothing equals this Coconut Oil Creme.  I had major surgery on my leg and the scar was severe.  Even the home care therapist could see the difference after using it for a few days as a massage creme.  As an entire body creme, it is outstanding and very absorbing.</li>
    <li> I love its smell! I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends! I apply it even on my face since it is not harsh for the skin since it is all-natural.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion would not use anything else!</li>
    <li> Best lotion for  dry skin !</li>
    <li> I bought this from Sams club they are out of stock now so I Looked on here and the price is absolutely stupid rediculous !! It&#x27;s wonderful cream!! But it doesn&#x27;t keep the moisture all day ..not that great for 20.00 that&#x27;s for darn sure ! I have given it 5 stars for the smell and texture and the way it feels in my skin good for over night cream! But you will need to add more if you are using it during the day.</li>
    <li> Excellent, non-greasy. The only complaint I had was that the jar I opened was not completely full.  Very large empty space.  I ordered 3 jars and have not opened the other 2 yet. The cream easily absorbed into your skin leaving it much softer.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best-feeling, all-over moisture cremes I have ever used!  I purchased it first on a whim at the local Sam&#x27;s Club. I love how it makes my face, arms, legs and even feet feel after a shower. They advertize correctly when they say it is NOT greasy, and the fragrance is ever so light. It would not conflict with anything else one might choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;My local Sam&#x27;s did not choose to re-stock this item, so I chose to go online to obtain a new supply. I even ordered some for my D-i-L, but don&#x27;t tell her. It&#x27;s a secret!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised and in excellent shape.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a greesy feel to it.  It smells and looks exactly like coconut cream that you would eat.  The smell of the coconut is very mild.</li>
    <li> Having used a LOT of body and facial creams throughout my life, I can honestly say this is the #1 moisturizer for not only my body but my face as well...and best yet...the price is awesome and very affordable!  Goodbye expensive department store creams!  Oh, and the smell is amazing and the cream feels so nice on my body...a bit of a cool feeling.</li>
    <li> Live this product!  it has helped my fingernails so much. Great lotion for my hands. Does not leave a greasy feeling. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Great moisture cream - use it all over my body - in my hair - light odor of coconut - very pleasant - found it at Sam&#x27;s Club - but they have stopped carrying it which makes me very sad - I would recommend it to all my family and friends but not if we cannot get it locally.</li>
    <li> Funny story.  I asked my boyfriend to pick up some coconut oil for me at Sams Club. They didn&#x27;t have the 28 Oz bottle for 10 dollars anymore but a 60 oz for 19. I couldn&#x27;t afford that so I said nevermind. He texts me after a bit saying he found a 16 Oz for roughly 9 bucks.  I told him that was fine. When he gets home,  this is what he had.  I ask him immediately if he knew that this was not coconut oil. He was a bit confused but we laughed about it. He knows I use  coconut oil primarily for health and cosmetic purposes so he may have assumed even he saw this in the hygiene area that it was actual coconut oil lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep it.  I&#x27;m now kind of mad I did because this is very nice cream and I see me wanting to purchase this in the future. It&#x27;s got a nice scent and great texture. Leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite body lotion!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I love this on my face with vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> Love the product &amp; have used it for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast service...</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good for after bath it helps my skin not be so dry</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This is different than the same named product that I bought at Sams Club!  So if you are looking for the light moisturizing product that you bought from Sams Club, this is not it!  It is much heavier and you will not get the light feeling that you are loving and looking for.  This item smelled badly as items do when they come from China.  I was disappointed and NO  I would not order it again.  I would however try it again from Sams Club, as I believe they are different.</li>
    <li> Love the product ,to pricey.but I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love this product.  If you mix three tablespoons of the NatureWell Extra Virgin Coconut Oil with one tablespoon of extra virgin cold pressed olive oil and put it on your face day and night, your face will feel fantastic.  It is a great moisturizer for the rest of your body, too.  I never have dry skin when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. I can&#x27;t use allot of moisturizing creams because my skin is so sensitive.  My skin is so soft now! I have tried so many without being able to use them. I have ended up throwing away allot of $$$$$. But this works for me!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! It smells amazing and natural, and once you rub it in, there is no oily residue at all. I use it all over!</li>
    <li> This is great moisturizer but is very expensive on line.</li>
    <li> Light scent, and will do wonders for very dry skin, I love it enough to hunt it down to get more</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and break out in rashes easily.  I discovered that this coconut oil relieves and  makes all rashes that I have experienced go away.  I have used it from everything from a substitute deodorant to a heat rash! It is also good for using with itching skin. As a facial creme it excels  and  I am very pleased with it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased  this  from sams club for $8.98. Love it not oily lightly scented&lt;br /&gt;. Went back to sams to get more and it&#x27;s gone but I&#x27;m not 2 I&#x27;ll 7 n gnomes put double</li>
    <li> One of the best I have used.  Long lasting.</li>
    <li> Sam&#x27;s Club was selling this. I tried the Tester and noticed an immediate difference. This cream is very rich, but not greasy like Nivea, which I was using. I&#x27;m going to fill up a travel tube with it so I can take it on the go.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product from Sam&#x27;s Club so glad I did, I love the scent it&#x27;s not over powering very calm smell and also &amp;#34;NOT Oily&amp;#34; this is a cream and it absorbs to the body quite well and leaves your skin very soft and smooth. Simply Love it and will continue to use and purchase from my Sam&#x27;s Club because the price is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... I have a sensitivity to certain scents and this one is perfect. it smells good and goes on so smoothe. Love it always.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer. Too early to determine other benefits from using this product.</li>
    <li> Just Bought this item from Sams club for $8! (same 16oz size)  and noticed a huge difference in just 1 week of using it. It&#x27;s great for an &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve used this on my face and its been wonderful! No break outs, no oily face....I&#x27;m going to go buy another jar to have ready when this one runs out....</li>
    <li> It was too old and had no smell at all.  I was disappointed!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she raves over it</li>
    <li> Swear by this stuff.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and creamy texture. Apply&#x27;s very nicely to skin and does not leave a greasy mess.  A small amount is all that is needed but liberal application absorbs nicely also.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft and hydrated. Gentle enough for face but effective enough for hands elbows and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is the best that I have found for over all skin care after bathing.  It moisturizes without leaving an oily residue. It is non-irritating and goes well under make up. It also goes well with any fragrance. It is pleasant and fresh. You do have to be careful about how much sun exposure as it will tan you easily without any true protection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing to my skin! I love it and it smells so amazing, it has no oily residue and no parabens.. I&#x27;m keeping it in my ceramic studio to keep my skin moisturizer because the clay really dries out my skin. And again.. It smells awesome! People keep telling me I smell good, lol</li>
    <li> When I opened the jars, I was not very happy.  There coconut smell had diminished and smelled old.  Both jars smelled the same, and I was very disappointed  I purchased my first jar from Sams Wholesale Club and loved it.  These two jars were not fresh at all.  Will not be ordering any more online.  Trashing these.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion EVER! I use from head to toe! I&#x27;ve tried everything on my skin and this is the winner for sure! I have a skin disorder that makes my new skin grow faster than the old skin can flake off. I&#x27;ve had this lotion for 2 months and I have no more skin issues. I wish they sold it in a 50 gallon bucket!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I really wanted this to be awesome.  I was introduced to it after purchasing it at my local Sam&#x27;s club.  The product I received from Amazon was not of the same quality that I initially experienced.  The coconut smell had dissipated and I&#x27;ve been left with a 20 dollar jar of blah.  Super excited that my local Sam&#x27;s club has started carrying this again.  Plus, I can&#x27;t beat $8.99!</li>
    <li> NatureWell Coconut oil moisturizing cream is awesome! Its great for dry skin especially during the winter. But can be used year round, not greasy at all. Sells for about $8 in stores.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every moisturizer possible for my face, but they all made me feel greasy and look oily. They made me have bad break-outs too! I bought this on a whim (not from Amazon) to see if this was any different, I was a bit skeptical. I tried it on my face, elbows and hands right after a shower and was amazed at how little I needed. It applied smoothly and absorbed very well and not too quickly. I loved that I could smell the coconut, but it was sublte, not overly potent smelling. I have been using it now for almost a month and LOVE it!!! I have a few blemishes, but only because coconut oil pulls toxins from your skin and go away almost as quickly as they appeared. My face has never felt so soft, supple and moisturized! This was well worth the money I spent and have purchased a second to keep on hand for travel and work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Sams Club for only $8.98 for 16 oz.  Absolutely love this!  Smells wonderful and soaks into your skin so there is no oily residue, just soft skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent but it disappears quickly. It&#x27;s not greasy and it softens the skin. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of lotions on my extremely dry skin, only to be left with greasy, unabsorbed lotion layering the outer skin. NatureWay Coconut Oil leaves my skin soft &amp; non-greasy.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion ever !! Not greasy at all. You can put your shoes on right away.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Leaves skin soft and smells wonderful. helps heal cracked skin, great for every type of skin.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband, he had originally purchased some at Sam&#x27;s club and looked to buy more but it wasn&#x27;t available. He was very happy when we tried amazon and sure enough there it was. He thinks it is great for his feet, which need special attention because the skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sam&#x27;s Club for my bf. He has severe burns covering 78%of his body from a child hood accident. Because of many skin graphs and surgeries his skin doesn&#x27;t stretch and there&#x27;s almost no elasticity. He pretty much is uncomfortable in his own skin all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said I bought this hoping it would be a decent moisturizer for his skin. Omg is fantastic! He uses it several times a day. He&#x27;s been using it for about a month now and it keeps his skin hydrated and really soft. He&#x27;s gained back alot of elasticity and &amp;#34;movement&amp;#34; in his skin. He says he&#x27;s alot more comfortable and loves the way it smells. I got it alot cheaper at Sam&#x27;s Club but it&#x27;s def worth the price either way. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. It absorbs into the skin really good, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue on your hands. Is absolutely worth the price and in my boyfriends situation an actual life changer. This is the moisturizer we both will be using from now on. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  I bought it for my fiancé who has really dry skin.  He has tried many expensive products but has not found one that worked for him.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> Best lotion Ive ever used. Mad I didn&#x27;t buy more from Sams for $8. Now I&#x27;m stuck paying $23. I am only getting this time. Can&#x27;t spend $23 on body lotion the entire family uses. I am sure health stores have a comparable for a much better price.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have used for dry skin.</li>
    <li> i gave up all my other lotions for this one. i first bought this at sam&#x27;s club and really liked it. i got my second order and this is the body lotion for me from now on. it leaves your skin so soft. i love it. thanks</li>
    <li> I use this as a all body moisturizer, my face has been especially dry this winter but much improved since I have been using this product as a night cream. The smell is clean; application is non greasy.</li>
    <li> My hands were getting extremely dry + itchy and a stranger let me use a bit of this stuff and I LOVE it already. Not oily, not potent and its very moisturizing. Leaves your hands nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I have had psoriasis on my hands for 3 years and nothing I have tried has helped. Not even my prescription creams. In the past 3 years it has not once cleared up. Has only spread until it almost completely covers the whole inside of my hand. Within a week and a half of using nothing but this cream my hand looks normal again.</li>
    <li> The BEST MOISTURIZING CREAM EVER!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Every jar was broken or leaking. There was lotion all over the box even on the outside, I can&#x27;t believe the postman even left it. I got maybe 1/2 jar out of all of it. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion,</li>
