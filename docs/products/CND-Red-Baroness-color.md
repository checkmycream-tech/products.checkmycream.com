      <li>It saves me so much time and money to use on my own at home, and it&#x27;s a beautiful color..</li>
      <li>And so easy to apply!</li>
      <li>Easy to do at home!</li>
      <li>Great product to keep natural nails looking good.  </li>
      <li>but I use this one the most.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a blue-red which is more flattering to my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Finding the perfect red has always been challenging for me.  </li>
      <li>I love Shellac polish.  </li>
      <li>If, however, you like a more satin finish then go with the axxium.</li>
      <li>This is the best red ever!</li>
      <li>I love the color.  </li>
      <li>It has a shinier, smoother finish and a more slippery feel than axxium.  </li>
      <li>I loved it for Winter because it is a deeper red, and it also looks great for fall.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and it just seems some goes on better and stays on better than others.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my computer or iPhone, but I thought this polish was more of a wine or burgundy color.</li>
      <li>This will give total coverage and perfect color in one application!  </li>
      <li>Love this colour.</li>
      <li>Whenever I need to feel more festive, I go to this color.</li>
      <li>I love Shellac.</li>
      <li>Love this colour.  </li>
      <li>Still gorgeous though, and still worth the money.</li>
      <li>I love shellac polishes as they wear so well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colors to wear throughout winter or over Christmas.</li>
      <li>Very rich color.</li>
      <li>It is so rich and has an iridescence that is just spectacular.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great, classic color for toes.      </li>
      <li>Such an easy polish to apply and goes on beautifully!  </li>
      <li>the colors from CND shellac are so nice and as they stay on the toughest, they are  super value for the money.</li>
      <li>Shellac is the number one product for nails that keeps the healthy and strong.  </li>
      <li>So, when I really don&#x27;t need, or have the time to re-do the whole manicure, I found a perfect touch-up polish!  </li>
      <li>Beautiful color and well worth the money, pretty lil sparkle to it.</li>
      <li>I found it to be very true to the color of the bottle, except it looks a teeny bit darker/redder after I applied it.    </li>
      <li>very good for brittle nails that chip with regular polish.</li>
      <li>With two coats I expect it will be a deeper cherry red, which will be even more beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Then I put a coat of zillionaire on top and now I&#x27;m rockin a really pretty sparkly raspberry kind of color.</li>
      <li>Just a couple coats, and good as new!  </li>
      <li>Dries very quickly and has an immese shine to it.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to take off.</li>
      <li>Just be sure you clean up around your nails before curing or you will have bits or clumps of cured polish.</li>
      <li>This color is a beautiful medium ruby red!  </li>
      <li>Lovely true colour</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful red.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was the second color of Shellac that I tried.  It is a little darker than what I would usually choose but even after two weeks of wear I still loved it.  It is a sparkly, deep red and is so beautiful in light or sunshine.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Discovered Shellac at the nail salon, decided to try it myself.  I purchased the CND basecoat, topcoat and polish color and a Thermal Spa UV light.. works great.  Easy to do at home!</li>
    <li> I love this color! I was looking for something with some coverage to cover my bruised nails, and this was just the ticket! Sparkly and pretty red.</li>
    <li> I use this product at home (I am not professionally trained, but have 8 years of doing my own gel nails) so I had the UV light already. I initially had a Shellac manicure at the local beauty college and really like it (but not the price). This system gives, by far, the longest-lasting nail polish manicure. Yes, gels last a lot longer, but I started having a sensitivity to a chemical in the process, so they weren&#x27;t an option for me anymore. This way, I have a longer-lasting manicure but also have a little more flexibility in changing colors more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: this doesn&#x27;t really last the 2-3 weeks they tout. After a week the growout from my cuticle is pronounced enough that I want to have a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; (which I haven&#x27;t tried yet) or a re-do. But during that same week, I have no chips and the color stays very shiny and looking like new.</li>
    <li> this is my second CND color and I LOVE it! I usually don&#x27;t wear red nail polish but this is such a rich, shiney red- almost burgundy. Goes on well and bottle color is true.</li>
    <li> great shellac product - works like any other cnd shellac products - dries via uv lights. stays on for approx two weeks. very good for brittle nails that chip with regular polish. worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on december 3rd over a month later and several emails to them (two of which weren&#x27;t replied to) I still haven&#x27;t received it.  Not worth the headache and hassle.</li>
    <li> This is the best red ever! I love Shellac polish.  Manicure lasts and shines! If you love \\&quot;Really not a Waitress\\&quot; you will love this color.</li>
    <li> I am in luv with CND Shellac Red Baroness. This is my second CND Shellac color and I couldnt be happier. I have nail polish commitment issues so, to commit to 2 weeks of any color is a stretch. I do another swipe of alcohol after a week and it carries me through to the second week looking just as fresh as ever. When it is time for a manicure, it&#x27;s because of my cuticles. By the way, this is a ruby red, not a deep color ruby and not too bright either. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful red. I purchased it because the wrap looked like a red-purple-wine color. I do like this red, but it isn&#x27;t as dark as what I thought I was buying. I bought it for a fun color on my toe nails.     Still gorgeous though, and still worth the money. I love Shellac.</li>
    <li> This is my holiday or sassy pants color! Whenever I need to feel more festive, I go to this color. Perfect for Christmas and Valentines</li>
    <li> Great product to keep natural nails looking good.  Not an acrylic but not suppose to be.  Easy to apply and incredibly easy to remove with pure acetone.  Don&#x27;t short change yourself by not getting the correct UV lamp or other required top and bottom coat.  If you can paint your nails you can use this product with ease.  Beautiful color too.</li>
    <li> Bye Bye traditional nail polish....... I used a CND base coat, 2 coats of CND \\&quot;red baroness\\&quot; followed by a CND top coat and my nails look fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the color last a long time and keeps my thin nails from braking. If you purchase this nail polish make sure you get the cnd uv lamp and no other.</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty color.  It&#x27;s more of a blue-red which is more flattering to my skin tone.  I found it to be very true to the color of the bottle, except it looks a teeny bit darker/redder after I applied it.    It&#x27;s a great, classic color for toes.      I did the Shellac process at home by myself, and this was my 1st attempt.  I did have some red come off when I applied alcohol as the last step, but it didn&#x27;t seem to mess anything up.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! It saves me so much time and money to use on my own at home, and it&#x27;s a beautiful color.. I&#x27;m definitely a red baroness type of women!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty color. Great formula that can be peeled off rather than soaking nails in harsh chemicals. Uighly recommen this brand foe that reason.</li>
    <li> this is a super deep maroon red for those who enjoy a luscious fall red.  the colors from CND shellac are so nice and as they stay on the toughest, they are  super value for the money. i purchased and my manicurist applies using the UV light as prescribed. works very well!</li>
    <li> This red is so rich looking. And it wears longer than some of the other colors. Makes your hand look smooth and pretty.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color and is very easy to work with under the UV light. Love the color and love the product!! :)</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and well worth the money, pretty lil sparkle to it.</li>
    <li> CND is the only way to do your nails.  Shellac is the number one product for nails that keeps the healthy and strong.  Wonderful colors and instructions.  You can even  mix the colors for your very own one-of-a-kind color!</li>
    <li> Great color for any skin tone! Not too bright, but not dark either. I wear this color all year round and it lasts at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This color is just great. I think it looks fantastic on toes. You get great coverage with one coat, but two coats will give a great look.</li>
    <li> Color is BEAUTIFUL!  Closest shellac match I&#x27;ve found to OPI I&#x27;m Not Realy a Waitress.  CND is hands down the best shellac. Application and wear perfection. OPI Shellac is thick and peals. This gives the color I crave with high shine lasting power!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice Christmas color - this was perfect.  More of a burgendy red.  Like some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, if your coats a thin, it will last about 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I have been painting my nails for DECADES, but this product will not go on evenly.  When the streaks are finally gone, there is too much polish and it dries with bumps - what does dry</li>
    <li> Great product. Dries very quickly and has an immese shine to it. I hate doing dishes wearing gloves so I did dishes and the Polish remained perfect through dishes and cleaning for a week and a half. Probably would of lasted longer if I had of worn gloves. The color is a deep brighter red. I would say an apple red if one coat used and a deeper red if more than one coat used. The reason I give three stars is not because of the product but the seller. I could of received this in two days with my prime membership if purchased from Amazon but I decided to buy from this seller as I thought I was getting one heck of a deal! The listing states that the buyer will receive 3 bottles of this shellac. But I only got one. Bad advertising and even if it&#x27;s a mistake bad advertising and false. Also it took forever to get to me and the box to the shellac was crushed. But the product is great!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in new condition. Great price on a product of the highest quality. I love CND!</li>
    <li> I was at the hair salon when asked to try a manicure using CND shellac. I was hesitant to try this expensive manicure as regular nail polish usually starts to come off in a few days. The technician assured me this would last for 2 weeks and would not damage my nails when removing the product. So I gave in and gave  the  CND shellac a try. I was amazed at the results. The color was vibrant and shiny. It stayed on for over two weeks and the process to remove the polish did not damage my natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;I am now doing my own nails with the CND product using the top and base coats. You will need the UV light to cure the polish, it sets the polish no wait time for them to dry! Awesome  product!</li>
    <li> I have bought four CND shellacs (Fedora, Red Baroness, Hot Chilies and Wildfire) and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The Fedora is a little thicker than the others. Like some reviewers stated, I noticed slight bubbling under the UV lamp, but after applying a second coat and the top coat it smoothed out nicely. Red Baroness is probably my favorite red; my boyfriend refers to it as \\&quot;Bass boat\\&quot; red because it has a pretty sparkle to it when in the sun.  I hope to get a few more spring/summer colors soon.     If you&#x27;re a savvy DIYer who wants to save some money on a mani/pedi, I strongly recommend that you invest in these products.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color! If you know OPI and like \\&quot;I&#x27;m not really a waitress\\&quot; you will love this polish.  It is almost the exact same shade but, it goes on so much easier than the axxium (OPI) gel polish. If you are looking to start doing gel polish on your own don&#x27;t be afraid. The other gals at my work were suprised when I told them I do my own nails now. I actually find this easier to do than traditional polish.  It does not dry until you cure it so if you make a mistake you just wipe it off and redo.  Just be sure you clean up around your nails before curing or you will have bits or clumps of cured polish. If you use the cotton ball with acetone and foil wrapped on your nails it comes off real easily in only about 10 min (especially the CND). I highly recommend the CND gel polishes. They cure quickly with the UV light; they are easy to use because they come just like the old nail polishes unlike axxium which comes in a little bottle and requires a separate brush (plus axxium is thicker and a little harder to work with). I have not used the CND sealer but I have used the gelish and I much prefer it to the axxium.  It has a shinier, smoother finish and a more slippery feel than axxium.  If, however, you like a more satin finish then go with the axxium.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors to wear throughout winter or over Christmas. Color comes out as advertised in the picture, and lasts for two weeks. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Very pretty red without orange under tones&lt;br /&gt;CND is a good product for me makes my nails strong enough they don&#x27;t break&lt;br /&gt;Keep them moist</li>
    <li> Lovely true colour that&#x27;s really rich</li>
    <li> When I saw this color on my nails the deep rich holiday burgundy red colors came to mind.  I have at least a dozen colors in the CND Shellac and of all of them this one is the richest!  It has a unique quality that I have not seen in the other colors.  This will give total coverage and perfect color in one application!  It is so rich and has an iridescence that is just spectacular.  I know why it is called Baroness because it is indeed royal in nature.  If you are looking for that perfect winter color especially for the holidays, then look no further because this is sheer perfection.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my computer or iPhone, but I thought this polish was more of a wine or burgundy color. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s very red. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful rich red color.  Looks great on all skin tones. This is a must have for the holiday season!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great color!!  It goes with everything and lasts two to three weeks even with heavy use!!  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Shellac Red Baroness is dirty....  Great color...  Applies well and last long with the other Shellac products.  Nails look like a salon did them....</li>
    <li> This color of red is deep but not a true red.  I got lots of compliments on the shade.  You will see the goof if you don&#x27;t get the color on perfect, however.</li>
    <li> The color is a little more red than the picture would suggest, but I love it!  I ordered one, and it came with two!  Great service!</li>
    <li> I have only used it with CND Zillionaire so far, but it is a pretty cherry red color.  With two coats I expect it will be a deeper cherry red, which will be even more beautiful.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great color!!  Stayed on longer than some of the other colors. I have server so other gel products from the same company and it just seems some goes on better and stays on better than others.</li>
    <li> I love this shellac! With typing all day every day, it was really hard to keep my nails from chipping. Now I don&#x27;t have that problem!  Sometimes it lasts me longer than two weeks!</li>
    <li> I love using Shellac, and this color is beautiful.  ***As always, try to find a swatch of the nail color on an actual finger nail, or other surface (a google search of &amp;#34;Shellac swatch ___color____&amp;#34; will give you a good start).  I have found that the bottle color on CND polishes is almost always a little different from the actual color of the polish inside.</li>
    <li> O dios mio!!! Its perfect!!!! Im crazy about it!!!! I stopped to use other colors. I dont need them. I know that now sounds like crazy but about this gel and this color - yes, im crazy! Its my favorit one last 2 years and im gonna use it and use it! My manicure-master even doesnt offer me other colors. Even if she gives me multi-panel where just colors w/o names - i all the same choose this one :) i wear it 3 weeks at hands and up to 5 at feet. Perfect quality. Perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;I did my choice!!!</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed, however, that there are not more sparkles in the product. I love CND&#x27;s products as they last quite well, but the range of colors offered leaves a lot to be desired. Would really like more glitter in some of the deeper colors.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most beautiful colors of all the Shellac nail polishes.  Deep burgundy with a little shine. Perfect.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of ruby red slippers. Goes on smooth and wears well. It&#x27;s a fun color and gets many compliments.</li>
    <li> Finding the perfect red has always been challenging for me.  This red LOOKS really dark in the bottle but it is SO pretty on the nails.  Last night I tried Tutti Frutti as the first coat and this red on top.  SO pretty!  It&#x27;s great how you can change it up just a little by mixing the color layers.</li>
    <li> Love it! Buy it! Start doing your own Nails, don&#x27;t pay to get them done.  I&#x27;m a beginner and all I needed was Youtube videos!</li>
    <li> Love this colour. It&#x27;s more beautiful in person.  It&#x27;s a beautiful red colour with a hint of dark pink.  I love it and will wear it many times !!!</li>
    <li> I orderd this product along with alot of other colors but I use this one the most. not to red and I wear it alone or with fedora. Always have nice things said about the color. I tell them where I got it. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Such an easy polish to apply and goes on beautifully!  It has a hint of shimmer in it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Sooo many compliments on this color! I loved it for Winter because it is a deeper red, and it also looks great for fall. I will be using other colors this spring and summer, but my mother loves deep reds and wears it all year round!</li>
    <li> I think this color shines brighter using the UV light and duller using the LED light</li>
    <li> I love the color.  It&#x27;s a wear-with-most-anything classic red with a slight hint of sparkle.  It is very appropriate for the office.  Unlike some of the reds, I don&#x27;t see a dark nail line that manicurists say occurs with some red polishes.  It is also easy to take off.</li>
    <li> Love this colour.  Currently have this colour on and wears very well and the red is deep, rich. I get a lot of compliments on them.</li>
    <li> This color is a beautiful medium ruby red!  I love shellac polishes as they wear so well.&lt;br /&gt;But, I do a lot of gardening, and even with gloves, I find it will chip on the ends occasionally,  So, when I really don&#x27;t need, or have the time to re-do the whole manicure, I found a perfect touch-up polish!  It is Sally Hanson, Insta-Dri, #330, Magenta.  It is a great match with this shellac color. Just a couple coats, and good as new!  (I file down the edge of shellac a little to smooth it out so there is no line between polishes.) Really odd thing though, even the S. H. Magenta looks like a bright pink in the bottle, but it dries much darker to match the shellac Baroness color.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  a deep burgundy and just the color to wear alone ar layer with another shade.  a must have</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this color by itself.  I had to put two coats on to make it look decent.  Even then I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the color.  Then I put a coat of zillionaire on top and now I&#x27;m rockin a really pretty sparkly raspberry kind of color.</li>
    <li> This was my very first shellac color I bought and I loved it! This red was a deep enough shade which I think is very classy.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this product.  It is a little risky to order a product where the color makes all the difference but this one is a great choice.  It is a really pretty tone that is more in the plum family in my eyes than a true red.  It has the blue undertones rather than orange, which I really like.  Very rich color.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous red.  And so easy to apply!</li>
    <li> I like it, but the color is not good.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I purchased the UV light for on Amazon for a fraction of the regular price and it really works great.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast. The product exactly how described. I made my shellac nails with the CND Red Baroness already. Great quality of the polish. Perfect. Thank you</li>
    <li> It will be great. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it was sent right away. I have had it at the mail salons.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Applies easily, it has a beautiful colour, long lasting, and comes off in minutes!! I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I received this Cnd Shellac Red Baroness color nail polish in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  The color was as I expected for a nice medium pinkish rose color.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but am not disappointed at all.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really loved the sparkle of this red color. Two coats are a must. Very versatile color that matches almost anything.</li>
