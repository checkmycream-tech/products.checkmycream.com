      <li>Great for those bright reds.</li>
      <li>Glides on easily and is really good for my lips !!</li>

      <li>I love Too Faced Cosmetics !</li>
      <li>Pretty happy with that!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>This product provided amazing smoothness and staying power under Hourglass lipstick.</li>
      <li>This is kind of what I&#x27;d expect since I&#x27;m priming my lips for the color and not applying something over the gloss to lock it to my lips.  </li>
      <li>think this is effective.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything to be honest.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product as I love may of TOO FACED products!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it keeps my lipstick on better or makes it more even--it probably does--and it feels nice on my lips.</li>
      <li>I look forward to using more of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, it does a better job than that one did.  </li>
      <li>Will be buying more of this product.</li>
      <li>I do find that my lip color has more pop when I use the primer as opposed to when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>and it just looked better.  </li>
      <li>I wish the applicator was better.</li>
      <li>I never knew there were so many kinds of primers before --</li>
      <li>(my lips are generally in pretty good shape, though).  </li>
      <li>Best lip primer I have found out of many other brands tried.  </li>
      <li>I used it with some highly pigmented coloured gloss that has always feathered on my, and it looked amazing!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had an easier time getting my top lip outlined and filled in without the color going everywhere else as I did today after I&#x27;d used this.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m probably not going to use this every day, but there are definitely certain lip products I&#x27;ll be using this with (the &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; ones that tend to migrate a bit more -- including the Too Faced Melted lipsticks that are popular</li>
      <li>Really easy to apply.</li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
      <li>For me, it works great and has become part of my daily makeup routine.</li>
      <li>This lip stick is fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t smooth out the lipstick or create a longer wear.</li>
      <li>Light and nongreasy.</li>
      <li>I was actually surprised how good this stuff is.  </li>
      <li>This product is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this as a sample in a Sephora kit and after two days use went out to get a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ingredients list on the product page is incomplete; here is the full list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this, and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Worth the dough.</li>
      <li>An absolute must have for any bright, long wear lip color.</li>
      <li>lately).a bit more -- including the Too Faced Melted lipsticks that are popular lately).</li>
      <li>do not find this to be drying, but so far I have only used it under fairly moisturizing lip products (a Mirenesse Lip Bomb, today).  </li>
      <li>It lasts well and really prevents the bleeding of colour into fine lines around lips, which is the main reason I use lip primers.  </li>
      <li>If I want ultimate staying power I sometimes apply a Lipstick sealer on top, like the My Lips Are Sealed product.</li>
      <li>Too Faced Lip Insurance Primer, along with a Too Faced Gloss, was my first experience with this brand.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and use it daily.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no need to apply a large amount on your lips.</li>
      <li>Makes your lips a smooth surface for your lipstick and definitely makes lipstick look more vibrant and last longer.</li>
      <li>Really helps keep lipstick on and</li>
      <li>My lipstick stays on much of the morning, controls feathering and bleeding.  </li>
      <li>I like the way the product goes on, it&#x27;s very silky.</li>
      <li>While this product glides on smooth, it doesn&#x27;t always make my lipstick last longer.</li>
      <li>once the lip color is on, I don&#x27;t notice that as much.  </li>
      <li>What I really like about it is that it helps keep lip colors in place.  </li>
      <li>You really have to dig around to use up all of the product.</li>
      <li>I want my lipstick to have staying power and most brands are way too slick and creamy, so the color disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does keep your lipstick on a lot linger than normal.</li>
      <li>It does make my lips feel very dry and smooth once the primer dries.  </li>
      <li>Probably a new staple in my collection.  </li>
      <li>Use this under regular lipstick and it really helps your lipstick to stay put and wear much longer.</li>
      <li>This product is not as I expected because it doesn&#x27;t keep my lipstick from bleeding entirely and it has to be reapplied more than once.  </li>
      <li>it is clearly a miracle makeup!</li>
      <li>so those fine little wrinkles around the lips have appeared.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I see as a con is that I can feel it more than the previous lip primer that I was using.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really looking for something that completely keeps my lipstick from bleeding and only has to be applied once during the day.</li>
      <li>I am a 43 year old woman</li>
      <li>looks way professional after I apply lipstick or gloss.  </li>
      <li>I am a 62 year old woman and have problems with lipstick feathering.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real benefit of using this - especially for the price.</li>
      <li>but I am not sure if it makes a huge difference because I used matted lipstick by Nars and that by itself helps</li>
      <li>It does keep your lipstick in place though, so it is worth a little dryness.</li>
      <li>Faced Lip Insurance Primer goes on white, but dries clear.  </li>
      <li>Minus one star for price--that&#x27;s just too much.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at the two low reviews, I guess everyone&#x27;s experience is different.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I am applying too much of the product, so I will try using less.  </li>

<li> The bottle lasts a long time too, just a little dab will do ya!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a translucent/whitish product that looks clear when it is applied in a thin layer on the lips.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little sticky but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Keeps my lip color All night w/o feathering or having to reapply!</li>
    <li> i hate this product!! it will smudge ur lips !! i thought it might be from the lipstick brand, i have tried mac, bobbi brown, makeup for ever and dior, all went the same with this primer.. i hate it, its a total waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i could rate this with no stars i would have! but amazon made me rate!</li>
    <li> This product provided amazing smoothness and staying power under Hourglass lipstick. An absolute must have for any bright, long wear lip color.</li>
    <li> Really easy to apply. I can&#x27;t tell if it keeps my lipstick on better or makes it more even--it probably does--and it feels nice on my lips. I like it. Minus one star for price--that&#x27;s just too much.</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised how good this stuff is.  It works, when I put it on it looks way professional after I apply lipstick or gloss.  Probably a new staple in my collection.  I used it with some highly pigmented coloured gloss that has always feathered on my, and it looked amazing!  It didn&#x27;t feather at all and it just looked better.  Pretty happy with that!</li>
    <li> Lipstick was not very long-lasting.  It may just be me, but I did not like the feel of it by itself or with lipstick.</li>
    <li> My lipstick does last longer! Great Product! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I am a 43 year old woman so those fine little wrinkles around the lips have appeared.  I have tried numerous products to help stop my lipstick from feathering.  Finally, finally....I have found a product that works.  I literally threw away several items last night that didn&#x27;t work.  My lipstick stays put for hours and even looked good after meals/cocktails.  This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Im very happy with it .</li>
    <li> This is a great lip primer! Give it plenty of time to dry, though, before applying lip colour.  It lasts well and really prevents the bleeding of colour into fine lines around lips, which is the main reason I use lip primers.  It does seem to help with the feathering &amp; peeling issues, too. The only thing I see as a con is that I can feel it more than the previous lip primer that I was using.  However, it does a better job than that one did.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product really keeps lipstick from disappearing after a short time, and also keeps it from that awful feathering look.  However, I am under the impression that you have to wait for it to dry on your lips before applying your regular lipstick.  That delays finishing up.  Also, once it dries, it actually makes your lips feel dry and also feel that there are &amp;#34;pieces&amp;#34; of the product that don&#x27;t belong on your lips.  Perhaps I am applying too much of the product, so I will try using less.  At any rate, it does what it says it will do -- keep your lipstick on your lips -- so I will keep trying to use it.</li>
    <li> My lipstick stays on all day!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real benefit of using this - especially for the price. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Use this under regular lipstick and it really helps your lipstick to stay put and wear much longer. Great for those bright reds.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Glides on easily and is really good for my lips !!</li>
    <li> Too Faced Lip Insurance Primer, along with a Too Faced Gloss, was my first experience with this brand.  I look forward to using more of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too Faced Lip Insurance Primer goes on white, but dries clear.  It doesn&#x27;t taste or smell.  It does make my lips feel very dry and smooth once the primer dries.  It&#x27;s a weird feeling, but I don&#x27;t notice it after I apply my lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feather, doesn&#x27;t fade, does transfer.  I&#x27;ve been using the lip primer along with a gloss.  While I find that it does lock in the color to keep it from feathering or fading, there is gloss transfer when I drink.  This is kind of what I&#x27;d expect since I&#x27;m priming my lips for the color and not applying something over the gloss to lock it to my lips.  I do find that my lip color has more pop when I use the primer as opposed to when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I wish the applicator was better. Design of bottle leads you to leave a lot along the sides of the bottle that can&#x27;t be reached. You really have to dig around to use up all of the product. I do like the way it holds my lip color. There&#x27;s no need to apply a large amount on your lips. Apply, then let dry before adding liner.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product as I love may of TOO FACED products!  Gives my lipstick/liner/gloss staying power!  I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 months now &amp; it&#x27;s still going strong.  Would definitely be purchasing this product again, as well as recommending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it does seem to make your lips a little dry.  It does keep your lipstick in place though, so it is worth a little dryness.</li>
    <li> This is great for moisturizing, sealing and priming your lip before applying lipstick or gloss. It dries matte, but not gross matte. Worth the dough.</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old woman and have problems with lipstick feathering.  This is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that prevents that and also makes my lipstick stay on all day.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This lip stick is fantastic. it has improved on my lines&lt;br /&gt;and flakes on my lips. Will be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> Light and nongreasy. I can&#x27;t tell that it prolongs my lipstick though. But keeps my lips moist</li>
    <li> Best lip primer I have found out of many other brands tried.  Really helps keep lipstick on and lips are left smoother and softer at the end of the day. I want my lipstick to have staying power and most brands are way too slick and creamy, so the color disappears quickly. This product helps to slow that down considerably. If I want ultimate staying power I sometimes apply a Lipstick sealer on top, like the My Lips Are Sealed product.</li>
    <li> I love Too Faced Cosmetics ! I have never used a lip primer before but I feel when I place it on it makes my lipstick brighter ! I don&#x27;t think it last very long though.</li>
    <li> I never knew there were so many kinds of primers before -- lip primers, foundation primers, eyeshadow primers.  But, I&#x27;ve found foundation and eyeshadow primers to be helpful, so when I got a tube of this lip primer, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is effective.  It&#x27;s a translucent/whitish product that looks clear when it is applied in a thin layer on the lips.  It definitely has a texture and I feel like it helps fill in lines/wrinkles/uneven areas of the lips (my lips are generally in pretty good shape, though).  What I really like about it is that it helps keep lip colors in place.  I&#x27;ve never had an easier time getting my top lip outlined and filled in without the color going everywhere else as I did today after I&#x27;d used this.  I waited maybe 30-60 seconds after applying this to start putting on the lipcolor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list on the product page is incomplete; here is the full list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isododecane, Silica, Talc, Ethylenediamine/Stearyl Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Isobutyl Methacrylate/Trifluoroethylmethacrylate/Bis-Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Acrylate Copolymer, Acrylates Copolymer, Disteardimonium Hectorite, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Jojoba Esters, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Trihydroxystearin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Triethylhexanoin, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tribehenin, Propylene Carbonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, o-Cymen-5-oL, Ceramide 2, PEG-10 Rapeseed Sterol, Portulaca Pilosa Extract, Sucrose Cocoate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-38&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not find this to be drying, but so far I have only used it under fairly moisturizing lip products (a Mirenesse Lip Bomb, today).  It&#x27;s a little sticky but once the lip color is on, I don&#x27;t notice that as much.  It did not make my lips peel at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably not going to use this every day, but there are definitely certain lip products I&#x27;ll be using this with (the &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; ones that tend to migrate a bit more -- including the Too Faced Melted lipsticks that are popular lately).a bit more -- including the Too Faced Melted lipsticks that are popular lately).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything to be honest. It&#x27;s not a primer and it didn&#x27;t smooth out the lipstick or create a longer wear.</li>
    <li> I like the way the product goes on, it&#x27;s very silky. However, I&#x27;m not sure that it makes my lipstick last any longer without me having to touch it up.</li>
    <li> While this product glides on smooth, it doesn&#x27;t always make my lipstick last longer. It seems to make my lips look like they are peeling. I wait a minute or so for the product to dry and then I add my lipstick, but I am still experimenting with this product. this product is so-so.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the two low reviews, I guess everyone&#x27;s experience is different.  I love this product and use it daily.  I have lips that peel and usually lipstick just bleeds out.  Since using this my lips are smoother and at least in my experience the lipstick stays on longer then usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this as a sample in a Sephora kit and after two days use went out to get a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying it and see how it works for you.  For me, it works great and has become part of my daily makeup routine.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!!  my lipstick stays on ALL day... it is clearly a miracle makeup!</li>
    <li> I am buying my second bottle, wear it everyday and it lasts all day.  No more bleeding lipstick.  Great product, don&#x27;t ever stop making this!!!  The bottle lasts a long time too, just a little dab will do ya!</li>
    <li> This product is not as I expected because it doesn&#x27;t keep my lipstick from bleeding entirely and it has to be reapplied more than once.  I&#x27;m really looking for something that completely keeps my lipstick from bleeding and only has to be applied once during the day.</li>
    <li> I think it helped my lipstick not feather but I am not sure if it makes a huge difference because I used matted lipstick by Nars and that by itself helps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m FLOORED that this company gets away with their prices. This product is crap. Wanna prime your lips? Go buy a chapstick lip balm and use that other $19.50 towards a smarter purchase. Too Faced, I&#x27;m over you!</li>
    <li> Not a miracle worker, but definitely makes my lipstick stay on longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does keep your lipstick on a lot linger than normal. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have found that works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use it with my matte lipsticks almost all of the time. Keeps the color locked in place all day. There is one downside to this product...If you drink red wine, it will stain your lips.</li>
    <li> Is supposed to hold Melted Lipstick on for a long time. I have not had those results as of yet. Still trying this product..</li>
    <li> I love it.  My lipstick stays on much of the morning, controls feathering and bleeding.  However, it is very expensive for such as small amout.</li>
    <li> Makes your lips a smooth surface for your lipstick and definitely makes lipstick look more vibrant and last longer. I love this product.</li>
