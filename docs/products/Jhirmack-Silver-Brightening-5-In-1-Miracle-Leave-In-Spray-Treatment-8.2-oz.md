    <li> This leave in conditioner is great.  My silver and white hare is only a little shinier, but has a great amount of volume.  And the volume lasts for days.</li>
    <li> A bit oily feeling and seems to make my hair dirty.  I don&#x27;t have dry hair so maybe it would be better for someone who does.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Even my hairdresser was impressed with the color and texture of my gray hair.  I put it on at the end of the day, leave it all night, wash it out the next morning.  Everyone says my gray is shiny.  It lays well and is easy to style.</li>

    <li> I love this product,  it makes my hair easy to manage,  brightens, and gives it volume. One problem,  can&#x27;t find it in stores locally,  so don&#x27;t let yourself run out, order multiple bottles.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I just spritzed it on and let my hair dry and the white hair became a glorious shiney white. I love the white now. It doesn&#x27;t look dingy, and my hair isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy looking. I sure can tell if I have forgotten to apply it. I even  told a friend who has a complete head of white hair and she used it and we both agree that we don&#x27;t want to go without it. It lso seems to tame down our hair and make it more manageable. I hope that Jhirmack  doesn&#x27;t  stop making the Silver Brightening Miracle 5 product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really think it did anything but I have had several comments on my hair since using it.</li>
