      <li>but I am never disappointed!</li>

      <li>This is my first time buying something that is, I guess, &amp;#34;cotton touch&amp;#34; and honestly I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>it is cotton touch, my face would look fresh even at night!</li>
      <li>It feels nice when you put it on, and does help your makeup to initially look very smooth and not oily, but after a couple of hours the oilyness is there still.</li>
      <li>And it controls your face from getting super oily.</li>
      <li>I must say this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve EVER made &#x27;cosmetically speaking&#x27; if you get what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;For a long time I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that will help me reduce the amount of oil that produces my face, and I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I have problems with any bb cream I purchased before this since I always have smile line marks, but once I purchased this, I noticed that this doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>

      <li>and I love it, the effect lasts for the entire day</li>
      <li>finishes in a powery gritty feeling that sit on top of skin...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very think and sandy.</li>
      <li>and I like how it gives a matt finish, unlike most other sunscreens that leave an oily or sticky layer on your skin.</li>
      <li>You can also use it under make up and it makes it last WAY longer and makes you look fresh even in hot-humid weather.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my makeup lasting and it really doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
      <li>It provides a great light weight base with a soft feel to my skin.</li>
      <li>I am a Etude House fanatic, literally.. I have so many Etude House products, it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous..</li>
      <li>and you have a soft, silky finish.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s 1/3 the cost of one of my old products, and takes the place of 3.</li>
      <li>This product make my face too oilly which i feel my face healthy  at the mean time it make ur make up herrie in a summer time.</li>
      <li>Oil, pores, creases, controls your bb cream or foundation from settling into those smile lines or any other problems you have.</li>
      <li>If you need high spf and oil control to make makeup last all day this is it.</li>
      <li>Other than that it doesn&#x27;t alter the colour of make-up and seems to work very well as a primer/sunscreen.</li>
      <li>it feels a little sandy when you first start rubbing it on.  </li>
      <li>Since its a primer, having dark skin isn&#x27;t an issue &amp; my bb cream/foundations seem to go on much</li>

    <li> This product smells good, but it really is not that impressive for what it claims it does. It also made my skin break out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product!!!  I like how it make your skin looks nice and not oily. I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin smooth and smells wonderful. I will definitely try other Étude House products.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite primer. It is very dry and helps my skin stay matte fir a while. I have never had a sunburn while wearing this.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin look nice and fresh even after a long and stressful day at school! Also when I put this on before my BB cream and other makeup it doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look clumpy as the day goes on. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I am a Etude House fanatic, literally.. I have so many Etude House products, it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous.. but I am never disappointed! All of them are great quality, including this product. This product covers everything you can imagine. Oil, pores, creases, controls your bb cream or foundation from settling into those smile lines or any other problems you have. I use it before I put on my BB Cream, and it works perfectly. I have huge pores, and this covers them! And I noticed that my smile lines never show when I use this. I have problems with any bb cream I purchased before this since I always have smile line marks, but once I purchased this, I noticed that this doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. And it controls your face from getting super oily. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used to hate oily faces after the days been over...&lt;br /&gt;especially around my nose....&lt;br /&gt;to look fresh i would wipe my face and redo my makeup&lt;br /&gt;however using this as a sun block/ primer,&lt;br /&gt;since it is cotton touch, my face would look fresh even at night!</li>
    <li> it feels a little gritty when I&#x27;m applying it which is odd.  Other than that it doesn&#x27;t alter the colour of make-up and seems to work very well as a primer/sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It feels nice when you put it on, and does help your makeup to initially look very smooth and not oily, but after a couple of hours the oilyness is there still. It does seem to be less than normal, so I would still recommend this.</li>
    <li> I must say this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve EVER made &#x27;cosmetically speaking&#x27; if you get what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;For a long time I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that will help me reduce the amount of oil that produces my face, and I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;It just has everything I need daily: sunscreen, primer, it smooths your skin, lights it up, and best part... it takes that god awful oily shine off your face!

You can also use it under make up and it makes it last WAY longer and makes you look fresh even in hot-humid weather. It smells really good too!</li>
    <li> I had been using an oil control hydrator, an oil control primer, a SPF 30 BB Cream, and then setting it with powder. As someone with oily skin, I hate having to layer a bunch of stuff on my face! And it still got oily after an hour or so and my make up settled into my pores. I got some of this stuff and am able to just put a powder foundation on top of it. I don&#x27;t get the least bit shiny for 8 straight hours (and then just a tiny bit in my T zone) and my make up looks great all day. This goes on like an oil control, pore smoothing primer, but the SPF 50 is no joke, I&#x27;m walking outside all day and have had no issues with burning or redness. And it&#x27;s 1/3 the cost of one of my old products, and takes the place of 3.</li>
    <li> OMG. Love this.  I use it as a primer. it feels a little sandy when you first start rubbing it on.  But then it melts out and you have a soft, silky finish.  And the 50 SPF makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing a good job protecting my skin.  It helps keep my makeup lasting and it really doesn&#x27;t take much.  It applies easily and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a powder cream and I like how it gives a matt finish, unlike most other sunscreens that leave an oily or sticky layer on your skin.</li>
    <li> Great base for your sunscreen and primer in one! Third time re-ordering! If you need high spf and oil control to make makeup last all day this is it.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using this primer. I got the first one in KoreaCand I love it! However this brand doesn&#x27;t have the branch in US so I can only purchase it online. New look but good still!</li>
    <li> It provides a great light weight base with a soft feel to my skin. Since its a primer, having dark skin isn&#x27;t an issue &amp; my bb cream/foundations seem to go on much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love how soft &amp; protected my skin feels with it.</li>
    <li> Works wonders with my daily routine! I have used this everyday during the hot summers here in Texas and have noticed my dark spots are not returning this summer. Great SPF protection, but I do recommend you reapply every 2-3 hours. It goes on smoothly and smells wonderful. I am definitely buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This keeps me matte all day long.</li>
    <li> For me I&#x27;m a dry skin type. This product make my face too oilly which i feel my face healthy  at the mean time it make ur make up herrie in a summer time. It works great on winter.</li>
    <li> finishes in a powery gritty feeling that sit on top of skin...weird</li>
    <li> I like this sun block. It&#x27;s like anything else Etude House has--floral scented. It is smooth and works GREAT as a primer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very think and sandy. However, it covers your pores and make your skin look smoother. It just look very sandy and dull. I will not buy it again...So hard to even rub it on your face, too think and oily and sandy..ahhhh</li>
