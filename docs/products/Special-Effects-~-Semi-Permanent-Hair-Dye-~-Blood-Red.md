      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t get much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Prepare to Dye!&lt;br /&gt;I made sure I had a rat tail style comb for parting and a wider tooth comb for distributing the dye and backup combs.</li>
      <li>This is ideal for this type of dye if your hair cuticles are open they will absorb more dye.</li>

      <li>Love me some special effects.</li>
      <li>It will go fine when you put in the dye the comb ran through easily.</li>
      <li>If I was doing a full head application it would have been lovely.  </li>
      <li>In any case, I&#x27;m fine with how it turned out.</li>
      <li>dye was a huge pain</li>
      <li>covered my floor and and vanity with cheap dollar store shower curtains.</li>
      <li>this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>and I really like the color!!!</li>
      <li>I was successful around the front and on the top part around my ears it was harder</li>
      <li>manic panic does not stay in my hair but special fx has always stayed in my hair for weeks longer than MP.</li>
      <li>I decided to try Special Effects after a friend recommended it to me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Roll over Manic Panic, Special Effects is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
      <li>You could find people will be lookng at bright red scalp for days if you get it all over.</li>
      <li>If you want really bright red  </li>
      <li>I went and quickly made my pitcher of 1/2 cup vinagar and 1 cup water for my rinse.</li>
      <li>The color came out brighter on my bleached hair, but it was a decent look and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty color the light brown parts of my hair which are underneath didn&#x27;t take the dye well at all</li>
      <li>more a bright red than a blood red,</li>
      <li>In case you think you will do better if your natural color is a shade brown by leaving it in overnight.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth getting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, deep crimson.</li>
      <li>hair is a bright red especially when the light hits it indoors and out</li>
      <li>I found that Soft Soap Aloe did a fine job of washing the dye off if I washed immediately.</li>
      <li>The colors are very cute and stay vibrant for a long time.</li>
      <li>I love dying my hair an unnatural red color.</li>
      <li>I was pretty darn hot</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying this</li>
      <li>My goal was NOT for the punky red hair most of you reading this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen people with brightly dyed ears,necks and forheads not cool!</li>
      <li>The results over my dark hair with lighter streaks throughout, is STUNNING!</li>
      <li>I have long hair almost to my lower back and one bottle is enough, the color is beautiful!</li>
      <li>: Make sure you let the bathroom cool down after blow drying washed hair</li>
      <li>looked good but in the end it was still a little much after I did my whole</li>
      <li>I got the water to run fairly clear even with shampooing rinsing with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very dark hair and was only able to lighten it to an orange, but that did not stop this dye from being a vibrant and beautiful red.</li>
      <li>Love the color and goes a long way!</li>
      <li>This colour is a great deep velvety red, and is beautiful on blonde, red or dark hair.  </li>
      <li>THE COLOR WITH THIS ONE STAYS ON LONGER AND VIBRANT!</li>
      <li>like the color except when the light reflects off off it in which case you REALLY see red.</li>
      <li>Shipping from this seller was very prompt.</li>
      <li>The dye stuck to my hands, which meant my light switches, hair brush, and door handles all turned red, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you havealready have naturally very porous hair(born with it)</li>
      <li>It worked really well , one bottle just didn&#x27;t cover my whole head.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t have the pop I wanted in it and faded very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>color did run even though I was very thorough in rinsing and washing my hair.</li>
      <li>item were lined up on the counter and ready to go.</li>
      <li>I had my shower cap ready also bought at the dollar store (Deals)in a pack of 8.</li>
      <li>My helper also checked my whole head and still found places I had missed.</li>
      <li>Most colors I use wash out in a week or less, but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older and work in a office</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s REALLY vibrant and that&#x27;s what I LOVE!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly advise washing your hair in a stationary tub if you have one.</li>
      <li>Currently I have a medium brown hair color and this still will show up as a nice tint to dark hair-- in the sun</li>
      <li>it swells up the hair follices 20 time to their normal size.</li>
      <li>I am going to wash as normal</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s too easy to get dye on your scalp and miss spots if you have short hair in back like me.</li>
      <li>I used a jar of Palmers (thick) cocoa butter to apply around my skin to prevent the dye from getting on my face, ears and neck which is more skin friendly than vaseline especially if you are prone to acne.</li>
      <li>She has already bought another exact same product...</li>
      <li>hair was a mix of natural light brown regrowth and strawberry blond from previous permanent hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare</li>
      <li>Prior to covering the sink I smeared a light layer of petroleum jelly on the porcelain as I&#x27;d read stories of people scrubbing thier sinks and vanities for 3 months and still having stains.</li>
      <li>Mostly near my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I picked out old clothes that I didn&#x27;t care if they were stained by the dye.</li>
      <li>Bring an old towel and a hand mirror with you.</li>
      <li>(supposed to be natural)</li>
      <li>Wash off with Soft Soap Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Paper towels, old towel, Hair dryer Hand mirror.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend thisto anyone who wants low maintenance red hair.</li>
      <li>I used this shade first over dyed medium/dark brown hair and saw a noticeable difference in the shade of my hair, it was a deep red tone.  </li>
      <li>the Blood(y) Red scene!&lt;br /&gt;It was amusing my soon to be partner in crime came home to find the whole bathroom covered in plastic made a few jokes referrencing a few horror movies...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s messy, as is any hair dye, but it&#x27;s easy to use, and it is not possible to harm your hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did a Google Image Search to decide if this was a red I wanted.  Everything I saw had it turn up as a nice, rich, and -- yes -- bloody red color.  For some reason, though, it didn&#x27;t go in my hair that way.  It doesn&#x27;t look bad, but it has a quality I would call &amp;#34;fiery&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my hair color or the dye itself.  In any case, I&#x27;m fine with how it turned out.</li>
    <li> SAVED ME A LOT OF MONEY ON HAVING TO HAVE TO DYE MY HAIR EVERY 2 WEEKS WITH MANIC PANIC! THE COLOR WITH THIS ONE STAYS ON LONGER AND VIBRANT! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> While I realize this is temporary hair dye, I didn&#x27;t realize that my entire body would be blood red for a week after using this product. I have been dying my hair red for several years, but have always used Manic Panic in the past. I decided to try Special Effects after a friend recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dyed my hair and the color was fantastic, but it bled so badly that my entire body was red for a week. Every time I showered or washed my hair, the dye got EVERYWHERE: in my shower, on my body, on my towel. The dye stuck to my hands, which meant my light switches, hair brush, and door handles all turned red, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dye was a huge pain and I will definitely be sticking to Manic Panic from now on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have very dark hair and was only able to lighten it to an orange, but that did not stop this dye from being a vibrant and beautiful red. I have had it in for 3 months now and am just now about to touch up the color. It still looks great except the ends have faded. I highly recommend thisto anyone who wants low maintenance red hair.</li>
    <li> pricier but holds the best in unbleached hair compared to other products on market</li>
    <li> Love me some special effects.</li>
    <li> I used Blood Red on chin length hair shorter in back and barely used a 1/4 bottle. I took all precautions and suggestion on various websites if you google beeunique you can find UK website that has all kinds of tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation:&lt;br /&gt;Always do a strand test! Less surprises and you can adjust the color if you don&#x27;t like it. I did mine 3 days before so I could see how washing effected it. They suggest snipping a strand I chose a small portion of the underside of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It looked good but in the end it was still a little much after I did my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a mix of natural light brown regrowth and strawberry blond from previous permanent hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare the Blood(y) Red scene!&lt;br /&gt;It was amusing my soon to be partner in crime came home to find the whole bathroom covered in plastic made a few jokes referrencing a few horror movies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I covered my floor and and vanity with cheap dollar store shower curtains. I also used a few dry cleaning bags and painters tape to cover the walls near the sink. Mind you even with regular hair dye I always manage to spatter something. This dye is even harder to get off stuff. Prior to covering the sink I smeared a light layer of petroleum jelly on the porcelain as I&#x27;d read stories of people scrubbing thier sinks and vanities for 3 months and still having stains. For the sink I snipped a small hole for the spigot and a tiny hole for the water to drain directly to the drain. I left the sink handles covered to avoid possibly have to wipe them if I turned on the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare to Dye!&lt;br /&gt;I made sure I had a rat tail style comb for parting and a wider tooth comb for distributing the dye and backup combs. I had a dye applicator brush purchased from Sallys,I used a disposable plastic bowl for my dye. I picked out old clothes that I didn&#x27;t care if they were stained by the dye. Tip: Have long sleeves to avoid potential dye splotches on the arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought those thick dishwashing style gloves to avoid getting on my hands. I had my shower cap ready also bought at the dollar store (Deals)in a pack of 8. I also had a hairdryer nearby.  I used a jar of Palmers (thick) cocoa butter to apply around my skin to prevent the dye from getting on my face, ears and neck which is more skin friendly than vaseline especially if you are prone to acne. I found that Soft Soap Aloe did a fine job of washing the dye off if I washed immediately. Tip: Try exfoliating if you get it on you and trouble getting it off your face or hands. Wash off with Soft Soap Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All item were lined up on the counter and ready to go. Other items I&#x27;d suggest or you really need: are distilled water for hair prep and white vinegar 1/2 cup and 1 Quart REGULAR water(not the distilled they are chemical different) for your rinse, some sort pitcher to mix your vinager rinse in so you can dump it on your head. Paper towels, old towel, Hair dryer Hand mirror. You might want to Vaseline or find some way to protect your glasses if you wear them. I found plastic wrap as suggested a pain. Glove fingers are another suggestion but I suspect they will be a pain too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair with a volumizing shampoo which I read raises the hair follices which is ideal since you want this dye to get in it if possible. I washed twice to remove build up of hair products. You should at least use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t promise to condition your hair. Avoid conditioner it seals your hair which is not good for this application! I rinsed with regular water to get shampoo out and I did my final rinse with DISTILLED water I&#x27;ve read online it swells up the hair follices 20 time to their normal size. This is ideal for this type of dye if your hair cuticles are open they will absorb more dye. You may notice your hair is a little tangly. This because the cuticle are not laying flat so they may catch a bit. It will go fine when you put in the dye the comb ran through easily. If you havealready have naturally very porous hair(born with it) you may want to skip the distilled water. I used half gallon to rinsed my hair use however much you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dried my hair&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure you let the bathroom cool down after blow drying washed hair I was pretty darn hot and I had to keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brushed on the dye onthe front myself trying to miss my scalp the best I could. I was successful around the front and on the top part around my ears it was harder I didn&#x27;t want red ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Sure Someone&#x27;s Got Your Back!&lt;br /&gt;For the back I got help and I would not suggest going the back alone it&#x27;s too easy to get dye on your scalp and miss spots if you have short hair in back like me. You could find people will be lookng at bright red scalp for days if you get it all over. My helper also checked my whole head and still found places I had missed. Mostly near my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I allowed it to process for 45 minutes I checked my head at that time rinse a little out of the front (you can reapply) and I could see it was really BRIGHT! My goal was NOT for the punky red hair most of you reading this will be aiming for. I&#x27;m older and work in a office I wanted vegetable dye that is not tested on animals this fit the bill. It&#x27;s Vegan for anyone that cares. If you want really bright red  it&#x27;s perfectly ok to leave it in for hours even overnight and it will last longer. It won&#x27;t harm your hair like permanentdyes. I wanted a subtle burgandy and after asking around based on my current tone of hair this was suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing the Bloody Stuff Out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your gloves on! Bring an old towel and a hand mirror with you. You may want to rubber band the ends of the gloves and strip off your shirt. I highly advise washing your hair in a stationary tub if you have one. Use it every time you wash it hereafter. If it&#x27;s a sink you care about coat it thinly with petroluem jelly and get help with washing the dye outto avoid splatters. DO NOT wash in the shower unless you like a blood red shower that you will be scrubbing for ages. I&#x27;ve read many reviews and stories stating this can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vinegar Rinse&lt;br /&gt;So I went and quickly made my pitcher of 1/2 cup vinagar and 1 cup water for my rinse. That is the prescribed amount I decided to go with quart of water to have more rinse water. It worked.  My hair had a odd smell similar to that of photo fixer like in photography darkroom after I put in the vinager rinse. So that it would fix the color in my hair made a little sense (they say it raises the PH which is supposed to be good with semi-perm dyes) but it did make me pause as to wonder what have they put in this dye? (supposed to be natural) I left the rinse in for 5 minutes and then rinsed and rinsed my hair until the water was fairly clear. I used very cool water which is supposed to help preserve the color. I used a sprayer hose nozzle which was great for helped to remove dye from my scalp. Pay lots of attention to rinsing and washing your scalp,neck and ears so you don&#x27;t have any runs. I&#x27;ve seen people with brightly dyed ears,necks and forheads not cool! If you don&#x27;t have help use your mirror to help you find any dye spots on your scalp neck or ears. I washed my hair with a color preserving shampoo. I got the water to run fairly clear even with shampooing rinsing with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty color the light brown parts of my hair which are underneath didn&#x27;t take the dye well at all but they blend in since the ends are lightened. In case you think you will do better if your natural color is a shade brown by leaving it in overnight. I did my strand test overnight and I didn&#x27;t get much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a bright red especially when the light hits it indoors and out&lt;br /&gt;I like the color except when the light reflects off off it in which case you REALLY see red. I think most of you who want that effect will be very satisfied. If I didn&#x27;t work in an office I wouldn&#x27;t care. Outside my office people say they like it and while some people can&#x27;t wear colors like this I can pull it off. So if want something that looks a little unnaturally red and cool (bearing in mind not all people want excessively red hair) this is a good color without have to bleach your hair excessively if you have a fading red permanent hair color it will take and not look bad. For me I am in the process of finding out what other base color I have to mix with this to get the more burgandy tone I was seeking so I can be more office freindly. If you know post your comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Follow up care:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like your color they suggest washing your hair less often to prevent fading maybe rinsing instead. The suggest adding a small amount of color to your conditioner and leave in for 10 minutes to help preserve it. Using color preserving shampoo. I am going to wash as normal which is every 2-3 days. I tried using a brown based conditioner to help tone down my hair to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Last Warning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color did run even though I was very thorough in rinsing and washing my hair. I know I spent a minimum of 20 minutes doing this. I found pinkish-red on my forhead and edge of my face and obviously it was on my neck because it turned the collar of a jacket I wore a reddish color. I hope I can get it out the jacket was recently purchased. So stick with dark colored tops the first few days after dyeing. I didn&#x27;t have much trouble removing the dye runs with some lotion and soft soap. I just washed my hair I used a couple of styling products that I think will help seal my hair. I will update to let you know if it runs still.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the product. It was easy to use and it works great!  She has already bought another exact same product...</li>
    <li> Special Effects is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s messy, as is any hair dye, but it&#x27;s easy to use, and it is not possible to harm your hair.  The results over my dark hair with lighter streaks throughout, is STUNNING!</li>
    <li> Love the color and goes a long way! I have long hair almost to my lower back and one bottle is enough, the color is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!  I used this shade first over dyed medium/dark brown hair and saw a noticeable difference in the shade of my hair, it was a deep red tone.  If I was doing a full head application it would have been lovely.  As I was doing a single large panel, it wasn&#x27;t vibrant enough for me, so I lightened my hair and reapplied.  It&#x27;s brighter than I expected (pre-lightened hair to a dark orange) more a bright red than a blood red, but it&#x27;s a lovely color and seems to be staying nicely.  Most colors I use wash out in a week or less, but I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable fading so far (a week) and there is no dye running down my shower.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this product,she liked it but it makes a mess in your tub every time you shower and comet is the only thing that will clean it with scrubbing.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t have the pop I wanted in it and faded very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I did not bleach prior, however I have been dying my hair red for years. It should have taken better.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well...pricey lesson learned</li>
    <li> This colour is a great deep velvety red, and is beautiful on blonde, red or dark hair.  I really love it, and get a lot of compliments.  Beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair for over 20yrs. This product beats manic panic hands down. It lasts a really long time. My color outlasts my sister&#x27;s salon jobs at triple the price.</li>
    <li> The color came out brighter on my bleached hair, but it was a decent look and I am completely satisfied.  Application was easy and so fair it is holding color pretty well.</li>
    <li> manic panic does not stay in my hair but special fx has always stayed in my hair for weeks longer than MP. The colors are very cute and stay vibrant for a long time. The only brand I use</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this and I really like the color!!! Currently I have a medium brown hair color and this still will show up as a nice tint to dark hair-- in the sun it&#x27;s REALLY vibrant and that&#x27;s what I LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty thick and hard to get all out of the bottle, so I wish I bought two bottles ( even though my hair is only shoulder length). It worked really well , one bottle just didn&#x27;t cover my whole head. But the product itself is amazing !</li>
    <li> Shipping from this seller was very prompt. I love dying my hair an unnatural red color. This dye is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a nice, deep crimson. It also lasts much longer than other red dyes I&#x27;ve used. Definitely worth getting.</li>
    <li> Received fast, tried it out and needless to say will stick to using this product. I have been washing my hair every day and it does not fade!</li>
    <li> It stained everything, I had to wash my hair twice. If it becomes wet, it starts staining again, on my clothes, pillows, floors, ect... It also stains when my hair is dry, so hard to get rid of the dye from my clothes, pillows, they have a permanent stain now. The color didn&#x27;t turn out like i wanted, it wasn&#x27;t red, just a hint of purpleish red, only seen clearer under the sunlight. I left mine in for 3-4 hours and didn&#x27;t bleach my hair. Also, my hair feels rougher, I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair dyes, permanent ones, and they didn&#x27;t leave my hair this rough.</li>
    <li> Roll over Manic Panic, Special Effects is where it&#x27;s at. Seriously, this stuff holds on to my hair like no other direct deposit color dye. I can go up to 2 weeks with washing my hair every day and it stays put. LOVE IT.</li>
