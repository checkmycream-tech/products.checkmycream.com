      <li>After years of using Cerave Moisturizing Cream, and being pretty happy with it but still wanting more from a moisturizer, my dermatologist suggested Vanicream.</li>
      <li>Love this travel size of one of my favorite creams.</li>

      <li>Ok as a nighttime moisturizer i guess.</li>

      <li>I use this on my face, I love that it is not watery, it absorbs well (may take 10 minutes), is fragrance free, alcohol free good for eczema .  </li>
      <li>Love Vanicream, it&#x27;s always in my bag-</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>We tried many creams</li>
      <li>Love love love</li>
      <li>This cream is ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types of moisturizers and creams and came across Vanicream by chance here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>this lotion would highly recommend this lotion if you want a great skin care from body to face it comes in 16oz jars  </li>
      <li>Works great for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very good creamy, petrolatum-based moisturizer for dry, itchy Winter-skin.</li>
      <li>You have something good, just market yourself more so the public will &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; it is great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easier to spread than Eucerin in the tub and obviously this tube is more portable than Eucerin (which is my very favorite).  </li>
      <li>Great on dry, cracked heels.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
      <li>and it just seems super clean and non greasy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best stuff for sensitive dry skin, like mine.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs and dries quickly, for all day moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Eucerin original is amazing when it comes to softening elbows and feet, Vanicream is a close second.  </li>
      <li>Vanicream in general is the absolute BEST lotion on the market--no dyes, perfumes, parables, or formaldehyde--and I&#x27;m just glad it comes this small because my alternative is to carry around the one pound tub, but I would do that if necessary, it&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
      <li>Cerave DOES contain ceramides and hyaluronic acid, but Vanicream, to me, is far more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The pump on Vanicream keeps the moisturizer sealed against contamination, and lets me get just the right amount.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cream itself is great, but why do they make a 4 oz tube, (which is obviously meant as travel size) when the  carry-on rules for airlines is 3 oz or smaller?</li>
      <li>Pretty greay, though,</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that I only need one skin cream for my body and face!  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>Now, I liked creams that smelled good and tried hard to convince myself the results were imaginary since the Vanicream products have absolutely no fragrance.</li>
      <li>I use the large pump  container for home use.</li>
      <li>tube is great - big enough to last a while, but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, non-comedogenic and has not scent whatsoever - no fragrance OR masking fragrance.</li>
      <li>Scent-free and can be used on your face around your eyes if you need that much moisturizer there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought after-market pumps for Cerave since there&#x27;s something really gross to me about dipping fingers (clean or not) into a tub of moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My face was free of any little bumps and felt really smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I think the main difference between Vanicream and Cerave is that Vanicream contains petrolatum, while Cerave does now.</li>
      <li>in the morning it&#x27;s all clear!!</li>
      <li>It absolutely will not irritate and it will calm the itchiness and soothe the dry patches.  </li>
      <li>At first use, it felt heavy; however, after about an hour I noticed that it didn&#x27;t feel as heavy and that my skin felt really good.    </li>
      <li>I bought the large jar with built-in pump at a local drugstore, but wanted something a little more travel/purse-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I use Vanicream, Vanicream lite, and the facial cleanser (Free and Clear) made by the same company.  </li>
      <li>I wish it had a pop top instead of screw on cap because it&#x27;s hard to get it on with a pile of lotion in your hand.  </li>
      <li>have many skin issues due to auto-immune disease and this cream does the job for dry skin</li>
      <li>The lotion is unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, or cause an allergic reaction.  </li>
      <li>We have the 1lb tub but really like this smaller, on the go size for the diaper bag.</li>
      <li>cream itself is not as thick as Cerave, but it&#x27;s more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It is really nice - no strong fragrance, absorbs in quickly - no greasiness.  </li>
      <li>My son has eczema and at times VERY flaky dry skin.  </li>
      <li>My son started getting little bumps on his arms and legs and this cleared it right up before it turned into something</li>
      <li>I live in the high and dry southwest area and have dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Usually, I&#x27;d get little bumps from face cream products most likely from clogged pores.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My doctor told me to buy this....couldn&#x27;t find it in a store but Amazon had it.  Got it quickly and it works great!</li>
    <li> Very good creamy, petrolatum-based moisturizer for dry, itchy Winter-skin. Rubs in thoroughly and won&#x27;t leave greasy residue on clothes. Great on dry, cracked heels. Scent-free and can be used on your face around your eyes if you need that much moisturizer there. I know I do.</li>
    <li> I live in the high and dry southwest area and have dry skin.  I couldn&#x27;t survive here without Vanicream.  I&#x27;ve tried many types of moisturizers and creams and came across Vanicream by chance here on Amazon.  After reading some very good reviews on this cream, I decided to give it a try and the Vanicream Cleansing bar as well.  At first use, it felt heavy; however, after about an hour I noticed that it didn&#x27;t feel as heavy and that my skin felt really good.

Usually, I&#x27;d get little bumps from face cream products most likely from clogged pores.  My face was free of any little bumps and felt really smooth and soft. I kept using the cream and skin cleanser, and after a couple of weeks, my skin felt wonderful!   I&#x27;m very impressed with these Vanicream products and have made them a permanent item on my shopping lists.  I also love the fact that I only need one skin cream for my body and face!  I definitely recommend the products to family and friends.  [[ASIN:B000NWGCZ2 Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream with Pump Dispenser, 16 Ounces]]</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion! Even in the driest part of winter, this stuff will keep your skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> The cream itself is great, but why do they make a 4 oz tube, (which is obviously meant as travel size) when the  carry-on rules for airlines is 3 oz or smaller? I cannot travel with this travel size, and airplane air is so dry that I need to bring moisturizer in my carryon. Please make a 3 oz size! 4 oz is too big for travel and too small for  home use. It&#x27;s a pointless size.  I use the large pump  container for home use. Now I have to  repackage the cream into a travel size jar, which is very messy.</li>
    <li> Handy size.  A little costly.  Have been using this brand off and on for at least 6 years.</li>
    <li> After years of using Cerave Moisturizing Cream, and being pretty happy with it but still wanting more from a moisturizer, my dermatologist suggested Vanicream. I bought the large jar with built-in pump at a local drugstore, but wanted something a little more travel/purse-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the pump alone puts Vanicream above Cerave. I&#x27;ve bought after-market pumps for Cerave since there&#x27;s something really gross to me about dipping fingers (clean or not) into a tub of moisturizer. The pump on Vanicream keeps the moisturizer sealed against contamination, and lets me get just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is great - big enough to last a while, but small enough to slip into a purse or travel bag/dopp kit. I&#x27;ve never seen the tubes in any stores, only the pump jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is not as thick as Cerave, but it&#x27;s more moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or leave the skin feeling greasy or sticky. I think the main difference between Vanicream and Cerave is that Vanicream contains petrolatum, while Cerave does now. Cerave DOES contain ceramides and hyaluronic acid, but Vanicream, to me, is far more moisturizing. It&#x27;s both emollient and occlusive, sealing moisture in and lasting all day and all night. It&#x27;s gentle, non-comedogenic and has not scent whatsoever - no fragrance OR masking fragrance. To me the cream works best when used in conjunction with the Vanicream cleansing bar. While the skin is still slightly damp but not wet, apply the lotion. It absorbs and dries quickly, for all day moisturizing. Definitely a holy-grail product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - I use this moisturizer primarily on my body, but it also works wonderfully for the face!</li>
    <li> This cream is ok. Bought it because my son has eczema. Keeps him moisturized and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin, but definitely doesn&#x27;t do anything for his flare ups.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! GREAT SIZE FOR TRAVEL AND CARRYING WITH YOU.&lt;br /&gt;WONDERFUL FOR SENSIVE SKIN - WORKS GREAT ON&lt;br /&gt;ECZEMA AND MCS SUFFERERS.</li>
    <li> I would bathe in this stuff if I had enough of it!  I have very sensitive skin and my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I found this product from good reviews here.  I use this on my face, I love that it is not watery, it absorbs well (may take 10 minutes), is fragrance free, alcohol free good for eczema .  safe for babies. I use it at night and under makeup.  So glad I found this product.  I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Pharmceutical,&lt;br /&gt; Please please don&#x27;t sell out ever to Johnson and Johnson  like SC Johnson Wax did with Aveeno years back and how the product was destroyed after!!  They will cheapen any product. You have something good, just market yourself more so the public will &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; it is great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> My son started getting little bumps on his arms and legs and this cleared it right up before it turned into something worse.&lt;br /&gt;It also helped his diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on thick but not greasy. Will order the bigger size next time.</li>
    <li> Works great on age spots, and just about everything else.</li>
    <li> a little thicker then the jar one</li>
    <li> Vanicream works great on my skin.  It keeps my skin hydrated, without causing breakouts.  My dermatologist recommended Vanicream for my dry skin.  I use it on my face and body.  The lotion is unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, or cause an allergic reaction.  This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My son has had extreme eczema since 4 months old. His dermatologist recommended this cream. He can have an out break and I put it on and in the morning it&#x27;s all clear!! I love it and have it every wear, the diaper bag, changing table, car. I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with extremely dry skin who doesn&#x27;t like smelly, glossy looking lotions. This stuff is great! Not greasy, no perfume, and makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion would highly recommend this lotion if you want a great skin care from body to face it comes in 16oz jars  I won&#x27;t use anything else it&#x27;s that awesome</li>
    <li> I wish it had a pop top instead of screw on cap because it&#x27;s hard to get it on with a pile of lotion in your hand.  Vanicream in general is the absolute BEST lotion on the market--no dyes, perfumes, parables, or formaldehyde--and I&#x27;m just glad it comes this small because my alternative is to carry around the one pound tub, but I would do that if necessary, it&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
    <li> Ok as a nighttime moisturizer i guess. Pretty greay, though, plus it gave me tons of closed comedones. Not for me, but others seem to love it. I&#x27;ll stick to my St. Ives</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer.  I have dry skin and I use this everyday. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  It is really nice - no strong fragrance, absorbs in quickly - no greasiness.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and at times VERY flaky dry skin.  We tried many creams i wouldn&#x27;t say this one a miracle cure but it did help.  I like the ointment for too, it burns less.  We noticed it worked best immediately out of the shower.  We use it on his face as well as all over body. good luck!</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that has helped rashes on my daughter&#x27;s face. It was recommended by a dermatologist and we tell everyone about it.  Not much scent to it and it just seems super clean and non greasy.  We have the 1lb tub but really like this smaller, on the go size for the diaper bag.</li>
    <li> Any of the Vanicream products are wonderful to use.  They were sent home with me from the Mayo Hospital in Rochester, MN where I had been a patient for atopic dermatitis.  The dermatitis has thankfully subsided, but I will continue to use  these products to keep my skin well moisturized after my showers, at bedtime, after having my hands in water, to protect against cold winds, etc.</li>
    <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. It&#x27;s very thick so a little goes a long way. I definitely recommend it and will buy it again. Their sunscreen is good, too.</li>
    <li> without it.  Love Vanicream, it&#x27;s always in my bag- it&#x27;s easier to spread than Eucerin in the tub and obviously this tube is more portable than Eucerin (which is my very favorite).  Vanicream has no fragrance, it isn&#x27;t quite as moisturizing as heavy duty Eucerin, but it does work.  I use this on face, hands, body.  Eucerin original is amazing when it comes to softening elbows and feet, Vanicream is a close second.  I use Vanicream, Vanicream lite, and the facial cleanser (Free and Clear) made by the same company.  It&#x27;s the best stuff for sensitive dry skin, like mine.  It absolutely will not irritate and it will calm the itchiness and soothe the dry patches.  This is a terrific brand all the way down the line.</li>
    <li> Love this travel size of one of my favorite creams.</li>
    <li> This is awesome take it everywhere have many skin issues due to auto-immune disease and this cream does the job for dry skin</li>
</ol>
