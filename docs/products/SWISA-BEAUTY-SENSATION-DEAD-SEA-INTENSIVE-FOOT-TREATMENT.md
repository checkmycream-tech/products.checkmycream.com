<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my favorite lotions especially like to use at nite when going to bed.</li>
    <li> I have overactive feet at night.  My son told me about this SWISA and I got some and tried it.  IT WORKED.  Got to love it.</li>
    <li> I have diabetes type 2. My feet really respond well to this cream.  When the nurse examines my feet she always compliments me on how good they look and feel.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  Absolute magic.  Always arrives on time and without any hassle!</li>
    <li> I have severly calloused and cracked heels.  I use this in conjunction with the Ped Egg.  It smells like Ben Gay but is very effective if used regularly</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Smells refreshing and makes my feet silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Use this foot lotion every morning and I cant really express how much my feet feel after using this product.  i am diabetic and this lotion soothes and maintains feeling in my feet every day.  I won&#x27;t go without this product and will continue to purchase it until it is no longer available which I hope will never be the case.</li>
    <li> It is the best foot treatment ever.  There is something magic in that bottle. It not only smooths the feet but a small massage with the stuff relaxes the feet like none other!</li>
    <li> I just reordered this product as I am runninig out of my original bottle. I use this daily after my morning shower. It feels good and help keep my feet fairly soft and seems to make them feel better.</li>
    <li> i bought this item years ago when i had extra $, but as recession settled i thought id never be able to afford again until i searched Amazom. It really works on dry, cracked, hard feet</li>
    <li> I have severe neuropathy in both feet, it did not help with the pain, I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a couple of weeks but did not see any improvement.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for Neuropathy foot pain I  have tried. It truly works. I can&#x27;t be without it or I would not be able to go to sleep at night .</li>
    <li> This is the product for you if you have neuropathy.  Apply liberally, wait a few minutes and then re-apply if necessary.  It takes the edge off and makes getting to sleep a little easier.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and find it to be the best of the topical treatments for neuropathy.</li>
    <li> love it ,takes the pain out of my feet!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My doctors tell me that I have diabetic neuropathy.  I pay lots of money to the doctors to get their advice and recommendations for my treatments.  And the doctors have over the years prescribed many medications to treat the neuropathy.  The prescriptions do not work!  So I question, \\&quot;If I have the neuropathy ailment but the doctor&#x27;s prescriptions do not provide relief, do I really have neuropathy?\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know!  But, who am I to argue with the doctors?  My feet swell, burn, and tingle most of the time.  I don&#x27;t sleep well because of the foot pain.  It is difficult to walk during the day because of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertisements on TV and adds in medical trade journals promote the use of the various medications and drugs doctors are presently prescribing for diabetic neuropathy.  However, if you read information available from other sources (books, internet, etc.) on diabetic neuropathy, you will quickly become aware that diabetic neuropathy is not fully understood.  The symptoms are addressed and there are theories as to how diabetes brings on neuropathy, but there is not enough understanding to allow development of a cure or a real treatment.  Therefore opportunity is presented to the \\&quot;Snake Oil\\&quot; salesmen (be they drug companies, doctors, or other) to make big bucks from human misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the SWISA SENSATION foot treatment for two or three years now.  The product does not cure the diabetic neuropathy.  The product does not make the pain completely go away.  However, the treatment, unlike the various prescription drugs, does provide some relief from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy three bottles of SWISA SENSATION on each order from AMAZON.  Each bottle will last me about one month.  The cost of the three bottles of SENSATION is several times cheaper than the cost of a single month&#x27;s supply of any one of the prescription drugs.  Unlike the doctor&#x27;s prescriptions the SWISA SENSATION does provide a noticeable relief from diabetic neuropathy condition.</li>
    <li> I have nerve damage and my feet and toes often feel numb. This lotion is the best I have found for almost making them feel normal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend, who has Type 1 diabetes.  She uses it at least twice per week and she says it&#x27;s the best foot treatment she has ever used.  Her feet and toes remain healthy, which is no mean feat for a diabetic. No pun intended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  I was very happy how quickly it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody that has dry skin, this isn&#x27;t just for diabetics.  Works great on other parts of the body as well.</li>
    <li> When you have diabetes you have to take really good care of your feet. This foot treatment outshines others by a good deal.</li>
    <li> I AM DIABETIC AND MY FEET ARE ALWAYS SWELLING ESPECIALLY IF I FORGET TO USE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY. IT DOESN&#x27;T USUALLY ELIMINATE THE SWELLING PROBLEM COMPLETELY BUT IT DOES KEEP IT MANAGEABLE AND OFTEN MINIMAL.</li>
    <li> My husband has diabetes and this product is the only one that helps stimulate the nerve endings in his feet! It is used daily and works better than any other product he has tried.  We will never go back as long as we can purchase it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEUROPATHY AT THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET. AND THIS LOTION HELPS WITH THE TINGLING AND I HAVE THAT COMES WITH BEING A DIABTEIC. AND I JUST HAD TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT AND THAT HELPS IT TOO. WITH ALL THE NERVE ENDINGS COMING BACK TO LIFE(TINGLING,  SKIN SENSITIVE) LOV THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Swisa was very effective at first &amp; gradually lost its effectiveness over time.  With approximately seven days the effectiveness had diminished down to a three star.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews where folks said how great this stuff is, but I was still kind of skeptic.  However, after just  one use, it made a huge difference with the dry skin on my feet and on my husband&#x27;s feet.  We&#x27;ve continued to use it and will be back for more.  Also, he is diabetic and this is made for diabetics, so he&#x27;s very happy!</li>
    <li> I have terrible feet problems, and when I get this lotion rubbed in, it does calm them. I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who is on their feet a lot and who have pain. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is the best foot cream I have ever used. It is not greasy, yet it helps to keep the skin on my feet supple and I love the very light eucalyptus scent.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, it helps with my husband&#x27;s neuropathy pain.</li>
    <li> Makes you think Jesus touched the Dead Sea and some of His healing power was blended in. This is my most used body treatment. Almost miraculous results. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well. Negative side - too strong smell.</li>
    <li> Intensive Foot Treatment by Swisa is the best! It is very intense in a good way. When I can&#x27;t sleep because of my restless legs I rub this lotion all over my feet. The restless legs quiet down and I go to sleep...Thank you Swisa!</li>
    <li> I just really like this product!!  My feet feel so good when I use it, they,my feet, are warm and fuzzy.</li>
    <li> fast service...great product</li>
    <li> Best pain reliever ever!</li>
    <li> Works great on these tired old feet. The product odor is slightly pungent but rapidly dissipated after a few minutes.</li>
