      <li>I will say this was probably the best product of the entire line, yet it wasn&#x27;t good enough to justify the price.  </li>
      <li>Which would be fine if it wasn&#x27;t pricey, you know.</li>

      <li>The product is very pricey, but worth it.  </li>

      <li>I think it is a good weather shield, especially with the current NYC weather.</li>
      <li>I liked it, but I have to say that it did tingle a little.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change in my skin.  </li>
      <li>but it was very well packaged and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>I have a very oily skin and it gives my skin a matte look.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Murad also adds a few more indgredients such as retinol that accounts for the high price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>If you want soft, even colored skin get this product.</li>
      <li>i USE THIS AFTER THE WHOLE FACE ROUTINE, THEN USE THE SKIN PROTECTION AND THEN FINALLY MAKEUP.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really notice a different s, I have used murad for awhile.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable price for how long it lasts too.</li>
      <li>This product left my skin so radiant looking with a clear and even skin tone that I no longer wear foundation.  </li>
      <li>was worried that this might be a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; due to such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;However, comparing it with my genuine Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Renewal Complex purchased from Sephora, I can tell this is a real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I had high hopes but am becoming sort of cynical when it comes to finding a skin cream that can treat and repair hyperpigmented aging skin of a forty-something-year old.</li>

    <li> I really love this face serum.  It makes my skin feel so good.  It isn&#x27;t oily or messy.  As a woman over 50 with changing skin, it is just right. It moisturizes without being greasy.  The only negative is the price.  It is expensive, I will continue to buy until I can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change in my skin.  I am Asian with combination skin.  When I used it, the next morning I would need to apply extra moisturizer as the cream itself isn&#x27;t enough.  So maybe it will work for other skin types?  For the price, I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but I have to say that it did tingle a little.  My skin felt smooth after a week, but my skin is always very smooth and soft.  I think it is a good weather shield, especially with the current NYC weather.</li>
    <li> The product is very pricey, but worth it.  I have very sensitive skin and any little pimple I get will leave a mark if I mess with it.  Thus I&#x27;ve been using murad combined with the Proactive regime for over a year now and have beautiful skin and I am acne free too.  This product left my skin so radiant looking with a clear and even skin tone that I no longer wear foundation.  I am complimented on my skin all the time.  I can feel the difference in my skin minutes after using this cream.  It&#x27;s much better than the other sticky serums that have the vitamin c in them.  Murad also adds a few more indgredients such as retinol that accounts for the high price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product!!! I love the Murad Vitamin C line. I tried the starter kit with the moisturizer, cleanser, pigment gel, and the serum and loved it so much. Once I ran out I decided to try this product instead. I use it after the essential C cleanser and then use the moisturizer. It is a GREAT combination!!! I love my skin now. If you want soft, even colored skin get this product. I highly recommend it. Murad sure knows how to make the best skincare. I even tried a $200 moisturizer and nothing compares to this line. My skin just gets better and better. It&#x27;s a reasonable price for how long it lasts too.</li>
    <li> I like it. feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! Great value for the price. Will definitely shop with them again!</li>
    <li> My dark spots from acne is fading away slowly, im so happy. However, I havent done my first bottle yet. This works for me, I would recomend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but the shipping was slow. I am 56 and feel this keeps my face smooth. Helps with wrinkles, I think? I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I use several Murad products.  I recently purchased the Essential-C Renewal Complex.  It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  It feels like velvet on my skin.</li>
    <li> My husband told me today I looked younger after only using this for 3 days. Excited to keep using it!</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother each time i put this on.  It has been about 6 weeks since i started using this product and can see a difference on my skin for the better. My lines are not as noticeable which gives me the smoother look I so much enjoy to see.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really notice a different s, I have used murad for awhile. So I went back to Oil of olay...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I use it every night and I have definitely noticed improved smoothness of my skin over the three months that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Thrilled you have this product!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes but am becoming sort of cynical when it comes to finding a skin cream that can treat and repair hyperpigmented aging skin of a forty-something-year old. It is a nice texture, smells nice, but I never did see any big change.  Which would be fine if it wasn&#x27;t pricey, you know.</li>

I will say this was probably the best product of the entire line, yet it wasn&#x27;t good enough to justify the price.  Disappointed I spent so much money thinking that the most expensive would be the \\&quot;best\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m using a product now that costs 1/4 of the amount I spent on this line and see incredible results!!  Don&#x27;t bother with this line.</li>
    <li> Excellent, makes face and neck soft and primed for make up.  No breakouts at all.  The results are that your face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  My dark spots are lightened but not sure if it&#x27;s this particular product or a combo of this with other Murad products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years! Feels great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL LIKE SILK, IT MAKES THE LARGER PORES SEEM TO FADE AWAY.. i USE THIS AFTER THE WHOLE FACE ROUTINE, THEN USE THE SKIN PROTECTION AND THEN FINALLY MAKEUP. IF NEEDED.</li>
    <li> Just use this for 2 weeks and you will be noticing the improvement in your skin (Texture, tone, lines.. etc).&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing (Not greasy) and has a good scent. Perfect for night use.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that this might be a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; due to such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;However, comparing it with my genuine Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Renewal Complex purchased from Sephora, I can tell this is a real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again! :)</li>
    <li> feels very good on my skin. I have a very oily skin and it gives my skin a matte look. i love it</li>
    <li> Used this product for 2 months and saw no results. Found that odd. maybe i bought fake product? 1 star.</li>
    <li> I wish this product were not so expensive because it is excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I will not purchase it again. It&#x27;s got a weird texture to it but it was very well packaged and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this this product and I was vary skeptical. It is amazing.  Evens out your skin under makeup.  Leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t reiune your face ladies. I did the make that mistake and I&#x27;m still suffering between Dr office every day since I put that product on my face. It&#x27;s a nightmare.</li>
