### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I wish I had someone dye my hair to ensure even application even though I tried as best</li>
      <li>but I am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with the color-</li>
      <li>Perfect!  </li>
      <li>great and leaves hair</li>
      <li>i was happy when i found out this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This dye worked great on my hair.</li>
      <li>but I believe it will give me a good results.</li>
      <li>But still good</li>
      <li>loved this product.</li>
      <li>but I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to be over prepared than under prepared!</li>
      <li>and now my hair looks exactly like the box but better!!!</li>
      <li>it made my hair color into a warm, ash brown color, but it&#x27;s not tan brown like the picture in the box.</li>
      <li>i try a lot kind of color.</li>
      <li>A mascara wand (clean) is good if you also want to dye your eyebrows</li>
      <li>, many shades away from the color on the model.</li>
      <li>I think instead of cute creative names for their colors..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>I have better conditioners in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and we mostly get the orange/red hair after we dye our hair.</li>
      <li>Milk Tea Brown is an OK color.</li>
      <li>Ok so I have been dying my hair ever since I was</li>
      <li>Also, I let the dye sit in my hair for about 10-20 minutes more than the recommended time.</li>
      <li>Ok then, shes using her allowance on this</li>
      <li>and I LOVE the color</li>
      <li>This is why I let it sit in for about 10-20 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Make sure that after you wash out they dye, you don&#x27;t wash your hair until 2 days after.</li>
      <li>However, with the hair I was able to saturate with the dye, it became the color that was on the box.  </li>
      <li>it also burnt the top of my head and hurt  </li>
      <li>The most importanttip of all: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE VASELINE.</li>
      <li>This is to make sure that your scalp isn&#x27;t stained somewhere that isn&#x27;t covered by hair.</li>
      <li>I love how they have so many shades.</li>
      <li>but it looks like it can be spread more evenly.</li>
      <li>and more importantly, it felt</li>
      <li>Make sure to put some kind of cream (vaseline worked pretty well)</li>
      <li>but it is definitely worth the investment to receive a nice color and still retain the health on your hair.</li>
      <li>But the result is very nice and natural.</li>
      <li>During this two day period your hair is going to absorb the dye, after the two day waiting period when you do wash your hair, make sure you are using hair products that are hair dye friendly, you want to minimize the gradual hair dye wash out.</li>
      <li>Was easy.</li>
      <li>Best for darker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a black hair, you can always trust Palty to help you get a lighter shade.</li>
      <li>, it came out very nicely on my virgin black hair, a kind of brownish.</li>
      <li>After leaving it on for thirty minutes (the instructions say 20) my hair came out a light brown color.</li>
      <li>Indoors, it looks medium brown and in the sun, it looks light brown.  </li>
      <li>The Palty is a good product but when buying online make sure it is actually the color you want.</li>
      <li>Also, don&#x27;t forget to use hair dye friendly conditioner.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s your first time, I always make sure to have everything set up ahead of time</li>
      <li>My hair did not turn out super light brown, like the picture on the box, which was what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Good product and won&#x27;t damage the hair as much American products will.</li>
      <li>The Japanese hair cream is also good.</li>
      <li>and  I just wish that it is more reasonable.</li>
      <li>I was lucky</li>
      <li>This is great item for dark hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally black hair and this hair dye was very effective into dying my hair into a noticeable brown.</li>
      <li>One thing I did notice is that you have to be pretty quick in application, so it&#x27;s good to have a friend or a second person there to help you if it&#x27;s your first time.</li>
      <li>After that I used my own deep treatment hair</li>
      <li>This is the first hair color was true to the photo.  </li>
      <li>and she still thinks its worth it.</li>
      <li>Other than that, good color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Color is true to the box, I love the color and would definitely buy again to dye my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
      <li>The product is great, although it smells just as bad as most dyes even though it says it smells better, but who cares about that?</li>
      <li>This is the best dye that I have used so far to dye my black Asian hair into a light color without using bleach first.  </li>
      <li>One thing I will say is that yes, this box advertises a very light brown that&#x27;s almost blonde.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s my first time purchasing it online.</li>
      <li>Next time I think I will buy two boxes or get the bubble dye version costs more</li>
      <li>Instead of making my hair lighten out or turn more ashy from a caramel color, my hair actually got darker brown.</li>
      <li>My natural hair color has never been dyed this lightly from a store bought hair dye</li>
      <li>It lightened my hair in 30 mins, exactly to the color that matches with what I had already had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The picture is enhanced so much but the results did not even come 20% close to being \\&quot;milk tea brown\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously this product really works you just have to choose the right shade, and remember it lightens dark hair, so you should do a test with a streak, and see for yourself how effective it is.</li>
      <li>If you decide to do this, make sure you and your partner are watching your hair, you don&#x27;t want to have burned hair because you let it sit for too long.</li>
      <li>I have fine brown hair that NO MATTER what I do to it comes up red.  </li>
      <li>I find that for some shades, I go ahead and only leave it on for 10 min, or 15 min depending on the color and how light I want to go.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I usually pick mine up at the asian grocery stores for about $9.99 (usually Ranch 99 &amp; Ichi Ban Kan) has them, but it&#x27;s awesome to be able to get the variety of colors on amazon.</li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
      <li>It REALLY did made my hair practically orange.</li>
      <li>It came out really ashy</li>
      <li>This palty hair care product works very well on my hair.</li>
      <li>The results were very close to the color on the box.</li>
      <li>They always come out much much</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely superior than some of the other color boxes that I&#x27;ve tried from the regular stores, and</li>
      <li>but it is pretty noticeable in natural lighting.</li>
      <li>Totally regret spending $24 on 2 boxes, I would have been better off sticking to an American brand.</li>
      <li>In my personal experience, 10-20 extra minutes was safe and didn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
      <li>Having a wrap-around robe (not a t-shirt or a tank that you have to pull over your head), an old towel or a large garbage bag (to use as a cape to wrap around your shoulder and neck) and newspaper or another cut up garbage bag (for the floor) is helpful.</li>
      <li>Obviously the first section and the last section would have they dye on it with a significant time differential.</li>
      <li>I also love their little conditioner</li>
      <li>I bought this palty hair color in milk tea brown,and it looks more like a reddish chesnut, my natural hair color is black, I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
      <li>i wish that they would actually put on the box the actual color names as well like for this it would be a light ash brown.</li>
      <li>And with this It&#x27;s only one bottle, one color as exact as the box says and for  </li>
      <li>It made me feel a little dizzy by the time I was done applying.&lt;br /&gt;The strong smell lasted in my hair about 5 washes then started to fade.&lt;br</li>
      <li>there is just something at a whole new league about Japanese hair products, I don&#x27;t know what it is</li>
      <li>One bottle was used up so quickly that I feel like this was designed only for people with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try other colors in the summer!</li>
      <li>I have asian hair and most of the hair dyes I buy at the store are never true to the color on the box.  </li>
      <li>The color does NOT come anywhere near the color on the box.</li>
      <li>left it in for 30 minutes and the results were very unsatisfactory</li>
      <li>I was scared that I would get it on my scalp because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>There were no harsh chemical smell...</li>
      <li>died my hair in a 3 dimensional shade of caramels and golden ash browns from Italian Salon only brand Alfaparf.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i try a lot kind of color. i was happy when i found out this stuff.  i hope you like it</li>
    <li> This is the best dye that I have used so far to dye my black Asian hair into a light color without using bleach first.  I have to recommend that if you have hair longer than to your shoulders; you will need to buy 2 bottles because I only bought 1 and 1 wasn&#x27;t enough to color my hair.  However, with the hair I was able to saturate with the dye, it became the color that was on the box.  This is going to be my regular dye from now on.</li>
    <li> The Palty is a good product but when buying online make sure it is actually the color you want. The milk tea brown turned out to be an ash and it turned my hair green and silver color mixed. I think instead of cute creative names for their colors.. i wish that they would actually put on the box the actual color names as well like for this it would be a light ash brown. Good product and won&#x27;t damage the hair as much American products will.</li>
    <li> it didnt work i have dark hair i left it in for as long as it said followed every thing i said and my hair stil the same color&lt;br /&gt;and it also burnt the top of my head and hurt  really bad  it might work for some people but not me  i will not be buying this ever again</li>
    <li> I bought this from the Asian grocery where it was on sale for around $11. My Asian hair is virgin dark dark brown and about waist length. I used 2 boxes and it wasn&#x27;t enough at all. One bottle was used up so quickly that I feel like this was designed only for people with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it in for 30 minutes and the results were very unsatisfactory, many shades away from the color on the model. My hair is now unevenly colored and only a little bit lightened . My roots are only slightly lighter and my length is the same color as before. I wish I had someone dye my hair to ensure even application even though I tried as best I could by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was also really bad. I felt nauseated even though I was working in a well ventilated room and the chemical smell lingers even after you wash your hair. The conditioner wasn&#x27;t good or bad. It just didn&#x27;t really do anything.  I have better conditioners in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not use this brand again and unless you have a pixie cut, I would not recommend it to anyone at all. Stay away from this hair dye!</li>
    <li> After reading lots of beauty blogs, I came across multiple reviews for Palty Milk Tea Brown hair dye, and thought that I&#x27;d give it a try. I have thick, long, dark dark brown asian hair (My hair was never truly black, but a very dark brown). Since I had long and thick hair, I bought 2 boxes. It&#x27;s better to be over prepared than under prepared! I was lucky I ordered 2 boxes because the bottle was small- It&#x27;s smaller than your average loreal, or clairol dye that you can get at your local target. There were no harsh chemical smell... in fact, it smells like flowers!   My hair did not turn out super light brown, like the picture on the box, which was what I wanted. I read on blogs that the end color is darker than the one that&#x27;s on the box, and that&#x27;s what I was going for. I was very happy with the color- it made my hair color into a warm, ash brown color, but it&#x27;s not tan brown like the picture in the box. Perfect!  I&#x27;m not sure why, but I feel like my hair is a lot drier and not as smooth after dyeing my hair. I&#x27;m sure if I used other brands, it would be the same thing because when you strip everything down, hair dye is essentially composed of  harsh chemicals that harm your hair.   If you have dark hair and want to lighten it, definitely try this hair color!</li>
    <li> i sorry to say this,this hair color did not change my hair even 1% don&#x27;t put your money on this product i try all product on the market nothing work if you want to change your hair color go to salon so you will have the color that you want.</li>
    <li> The color does NOT come anywhere near the color on the box. The picture is enhanced so much but the results did not even come 20% close to being \\&quot;milk tea brown\\&quot;! Instead of making my hair lighten out or turn more ashy from a caramel color, my hair actually got darker brown. That&#x27;s not what I was going for at all. Totally regret spending $24 on 2 boxes, I would have been better off sticking to an American brand. And it also burned so bad! Worst than any dye job I&#x27;ve ever had. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this can make black hair to the color of the model on the box.    I have used this, and it made my ROOTS ORANGE. This isn&#x27;t a joke. It REALLY did made my hair practically orange. I would only suggest purchasing this if your hair is already blonde and wanted a beige-type color to your hair.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have been dying my hair ever since I was 11 yrs I&#x27;m 22. My hair is dark ebony brown almost black. When dying my hair, I always had to think ahead of the inconveniences regarding the difference in hair shades, porosity texture and if I had a different root color or not. I must say that I have tried quite an amount of japanese cosmetic and beauty products, including hair products and I can say with all certainty that there is still yet to be a competition or contender against them. (I have also tried Korean products yet there&#x27;s just something about the japanese quality).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I died my hair in a 3 dimensional shade of caramels and golden ash browns from Italian Salon only brand Alfaparf. My roots eventually grew and I was desperate to die them yet a bit scared to not be able to match the color.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the parts of my hair that had already been dyed and the roots. I bought this on a whim seeing many reviews and videos and considering my past experiences with japanese products I bought it. I used it. I can&#x27;t believe the quality. I&#x27;m never going to a saloon again for coloring. Why? this hair die did something I have never seen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned my hair color exactly as it said in the box it would be, regardless of the color of my roots and previously dyed hair. It lightened my hair in 30 mins, exactly to the color that matches with what I had already had.&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product. It covered my ugly poking almost white hair-ish looking highlights, and evened out my overall color. It is easy to use, and the Tsubaki conditioner it has with it (not surprising) is extremely nourishing. I felt no coarseness in my hair or dryness... there is just something at a whole new league about Japanese hair products, I don&#x27;t know what it is but it works. I had to go to a saloon before, and have 3 shades of color mixed in and be charged like 200 or 400 $$. And with this It&#x27;s only one bottle, one color as exact as the box says and for  only $13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry hair&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t unevenly dye hair&lt;br /&gt;extremely nourishing conditioner in kit&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously this product really works you just have to choose the right shade, and remember it lightens dark hair, so you should do a test with a streak, and see for yourself how effective it is. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The box doesn&#x27;t state if it&#x27;s in a foam or cream application. This one is cream texture and I have uneven color spots in my hair as result.</li>
    <li> This is great item for dark hair. It does not turn out like the box tho.... and  I just wish that it is more reasonable.</li>
    <li> At first i was skeptical to try to this product. I&#x27;ve tried every hair dyes out there trying to lighten my black asian hair. I was so surprise when this actually lightend my hair! I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I received the Palty milk tea brown hair dye. my natural hair is a dark brown. My hair type is a 3C, which is curly/wavy (I am African American). This dye worked great on my hair. Before I dyed it my hair, as stated previously, was a very dark brown. After leaving it on for thirty minutes (the instructions say 20) my hair came out a light brown color. The dye does not dry out my hair nor does it damage it. The product is great, although it smells just as bad as most dyes even though it says it smells better, but who cares about that?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t bleach, so of course it didn&#x27;t look like this;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it came out very nicely on my virgin black hair, a kind of brownish. Was easy.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, black asian hair, but I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair gradually to an ombre blond at tips and reddish brown at the roots.  I wanted to the Palty Hair Dye because it is supposed to help tone down reddness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color is true to the box, I love the color and would definitely buy again to dye my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and leaves hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only bought one box because I have shoulder length hair and it wasn&#x27;t enough.  I only saturated the roots on the bottom half of my head and then realized I was out of product so I had to start piling my hair and hope I could spread it as much as possible.  Next time I think I will buy two boxes or get the bubble dye version costs more but it looks like it can be spread more evenly.</li>
    <li> Before using milk tea brown I bleached my hair with sparkling blonde till it turne orange then I dyed my hair after a week with milk tea brown and it took out the brassy color and now my hair looks exactly like the box but better!!! It came out really ashy</li>
    <li> I have naturally black hair and this hair dye was very effective into dying my hair into a noticeable brown. One thing I will say is that yes, this box advertises a very light brown that&#x27;s almost blonde. But if you are Asian with dark hair, you need a dye that is this strong in order to get your hair color into the brown color ranges without having to bleach your hair. I&#x27;m a Chinese 17 year old with short hair so I only had to use about half the bottle and by the way, I would recommend having a partner apply the hair dye to your hair. Your partner can see areas of your hair that you can&#x27;t.  Also, I let the dye sit in my hair for about 10-20 minutes more than the recommended time. This is only to make up for the difference in time of the way I applied the dye to my hair. What I did was my hair was split into sections and my partner would apply the dye a section at a time. Obviously the first section and the last section would have they dye on it with a significant time differential. This is why I let it sit in for about 10-20 more minutes. If you decide to do this, make sure you and your partner are watching your hair, you don&#x27;t want to have burned hair because you let it sit for too long. In my personal experience, 10-20 extra minutes was safe and didn&#x27;t burn my hair. When you wash out the dye from your hair you should notice a change in your hair. You can&#x27;t see it as well in fluorescent lighting but it is pretty noticeable in natural lighting. Make sure that after you wash out they dye, you don&#x27;t wash your hair until 2 days after. During this two day period your hair is going to absorb the dye, after the two day waiting period when you do wash your hair, make sure you are using hair products that are hair dye friendly, you want to minimize the gradual hair dye wash out. Also, don&#x27;t forget to use hair dye friendly conditioner. Your hair might not feel as soft as it is before the dyeing process so you have to condition it back to the soft texture.  The most importanttip of all: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE VASELINE. Outline the border of where your skin ends and hair starts with Vaseline. For example, where your forehead ends and the roots of your bangs start. You want about a 1/4-1/2 inch width outline. This is to make sure that your scalp isn&#x27;t stained somewhere that isn&#x27;t covered by hair. You don&#x27;t want to face the world with a big brown smudge across your forehead.</li>
    <li> I have fine brown hair that NO MATTER what I do to it comes up red.  This is the first hair color was true to the photo.  It was a bit drying but not enough to keep me from using it again.  Seriously, my hair came out almost exactly like the box--that has never happened before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been actually almost seven years since I fully colored my hair.  My hair is dark brown almost black with Asian/Spanish DNA :) I applied this for about 30-35 minutes and when I washed it off it was gold.  When it dried up it was a lighter brown with some red tint in it.  In some days, my hair will be like a soft red.  Just a warning, it does itch a little- I was a little worried that I was about to have an allergy reaction.  Also, I have really fine thin hair and so it did dry out the ends but did not murder any of it.  I still had some extra coloring in hair dye and my hair is considerably medium longish (past shoulder length) but I have thin hair.  It is a little pricey but it is definitely worth the investment to receive a nice color and still retain the health on your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this palty hair color in milk tea brown,and it looks more like a reddish chesnut, my natural hair color is black, I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> IT is not my first time using this product, I always buy this from local japanese store but it&#x27;s my first time purchasing it online. I havent try this yet but I believe it will give me a good results. Try to let someone help you because sometimes you can&#x27;t see some areas.</li>
    <li> Best for darker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a black hair, you can always trust Palty to help you get a lighter shade. Milk Tea Brown is an OK color. It has a little bit of orange tint but consider that I am Asian and we mostly get the orange/red hair after we dye our hair.</li>
    <li> The Japanese hair cream is also good. But before my hair dyed black, dyed it a bit inconvenient. But still good</li>
    <li> I am an Asian with originally black shoulder-length hair. This is a good product - only if you&#x27;re looking for subtle change and patient enough to dye your hair multiple times. I had to dye my hair three times with this before I got a noticeably different color! But the result is very nice and natural. If you&#x27;re a dark haired individual like me looking for an instant and eye-catching change I would recommend using the Palty hair dyes with bleach in them instead.</li>
    <li> From the recipient:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a general review of Palty hair color; For an at-home hair kit, it is terrific! I usually pick mine up at the asian grocery stores for about $9.99 (usually Ranch 99 &amp; Ichi Ban Kan) has them, but it&#x27;s awesome to be able to get the variety of colors on amazon. One thing I did notice is that you have to be pretty quick in application, so it&#x27;s good to have a friend or a second person there to help you if it&#x27;s your first time. This is because even though the instructions says (some boxes are in Japanese only, whereas some of the ones you might pick up at Ichi Ban Kan also have an English translation inside) apply color for 20 min, you really need to watch your hair to see how fast the color is turning. I find that for some shades, I go ahead and only leave it on for 10 min, or 15 min depending on the color and how light I want to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely superior than some of the other color boxes that I&#x27;ve tried from the regular stores, and I love how they have so many shades. I also love their little conditioner packet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s your first time, I always make sure to have everything set up ahead of time so I can just run in and rinse it off when its time. Having a wrap-around robe (not a t-shirt or a tank that you have to pull over your head), an old towel or a large garbage bag (to use as a cape to wrap around your shoulder and neck) and newspaper or another cut up garbage bag (for the floor) is helpful. A mascara wand (clean) is good if you also want to dye your eyebrows (do it in the last 5 min or so before rinse, time depends on how light or dark you want to g0). Make sure to put some kind of cream (vaseline worked pretty well) all around your hairline and ears (and eyebrows if dyeing)) to avoid staining (I also put a little on my fingertips before putting on the provided clubs incase it rips). Hope it helps!</li>
    <li> I have asian hair and most of the hair dyes I buy at the store are never true to the color on the box.  They always come out much much darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this dye in Milk Tea Brown and I LOVE the color it is now! The results were very close to the color on the box. Indoors, it looks medium brown and in the sun, it looks light brown.  My hair at the roots were my natural dark brown/black, the ends were dyed at a salon a medium reddish brown, and the middle was dyed with Loreal preference a cool medium brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and after 25 minutes I washed out the dye and after it dried, I noticed that the color was uneven.  It was difficult to spread the dye evenly with the applicator brush attachment. I would recommend getting someone to help you apply it.  I was scared that I would get it on my scalp because I have sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve dyed my hair at the salon two times and it burned my scalp so I do it at home and don&#x27;t really trust other people to do it because they aren&#x27;t as careful.  I must&#x27;ve gotten some dye on my scalp near my forehead because I had a three red dots there.  They didn&#x27;t itch or burn. It was just red for a couple days and then faded away.  Small amounts of dye probably touched my scalp but as far as I could see it looked fine elsewhere and more importantly, it felt fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was as bad as other dyes. It made me feel a little dizzy by the time I was done applying.&lt;br /&gt;The strong smell lasted in my hair about 5 washes then started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after dying, I only used the conditioner that came with the dye and my hair remained as soft as it was before.  It did not feel damaged in any way.  After that I used my own deep treatment hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color has faded slightly since I dyed it two weeks ago but I absolutely love it! The color at my roots are the same as the color at the tips. I&#x27;m not sure how that happened but I am very happy with the results. My natural hair color has never been dyed this lightly from a store bought hair dye before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try other colors in the summer!</li>
    <li> maybe i did something wrong? my hair turned out all blotchy and miscolored even tho i applied as instructions were given. my hair was dyed natural red before so maybe its just not for people with already dyed hair. im really disappointed i really wanted my hair to be this color</li>
    <li> This palty hair care product works very well on my hair. I do not have anything really negative to say, but just that the color did not look exactly like on the box, even with my hair bleached. Other than that, good color.</li>
    <li> My daughter (teenage) with expensive taste says she really likes this product. She has long (to the mid back) thick black hair and she said she only needed one box to dye it. I tried to talk her into getting the 5 dollar dye from walmart but she aint having it. Ok then, shes using her allowance on this and she still thinks its worth it.</li>
