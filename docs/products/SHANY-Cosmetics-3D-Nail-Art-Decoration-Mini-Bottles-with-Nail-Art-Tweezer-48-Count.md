<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> well other than the bottles being only about an inch tall,its ok.i wouldn&#x27;t recommend for little girls under 8 or so.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the 3D Nail Art!  She and her friends are having a great time adding \\&quot;bling\\&quot; to their fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers that come in the kit make the little decorations much easier to attach to the nail.  Very easy and fun to use.</li>
    <li> Wow was I ever disappointed. The bottles are tiny. Only about 1/2 an inch tall and there are only a few embellishments in each bottle. You can only do a few fingers with each bottle.</li>
    <li> The bottles are SO SMALL!  I wish there had been a better description on the site</li>
    <li> Tiny, but really really Cool</li>
    <li> Great way to get a lot of variety of colors....</li>
    <li> WAY smaller than I thought it was going to be. The jars are a little bit bigger than my thumb nail. Some of the glitter slipped, but all the lids seemed to be on tight. Other than that the things in the jars are pretty cool, I wish there was more in some of the jars though.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter really loved this gift</li>
    <li> I knew these were going to be tiny based on the description, but I just could not imagine HOW tiny they were! Each bottle wasn&#x27;t even as big as my fingernail! The kit made for a cute gift but I&#x27;m sure it was a royal pain to try to use!</li>
    <li> The bottles are smaller than expected, but how cute are they, its worth the price, one set of nails and it pays for itself.</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my niece. She absolutely love them and finds new and exciting ways to do nails...</li>
    <li> Bottles were very small and some bottles but liked the item,  pleased</li>
    <li> Arrived a week after I ordered with Super Saver shipping. All the bottles were intact. The tweezers were under the plastic sheet that holds the bottles in place. I ordered two sets, they were slightly different. In both sets, one of the bottles contains slices of a polymer cane. One set had little pink flower slices and the other had pink and white heart slices. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> product is okay, has a lot of option, do wish it had more flowers and stones and less glitters which is over 90% , however the packaging was terrible, when it came 2 of the bottles were broken as they were not securely packed.... also the tweezers are very sturdy and is a great addition.</li>
    <li> This is the TINIEST little kit ever - maybe the size of a CD. I can&#x27;t imagine what the little bottled inside can hold. A drop?</li>
    <li> Although the box was small and I thought I was going to be disappointed once I opened the box the containers and very cute and fun looking.  They are lots of jewels, a few with less than others, but still LOTS of jewels.  I think my daughter will love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do nails.  This item caught my eye because of the adorable little bottles.  Forty-eight of them!  Each filled with around a 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of something pretty.  Lots of glitter, every color you can think of and plenty of sequins and bling.  For my small scale crafts projects (embellishing bottle cap art and homemade greeting cards) this will probably last me my lifetime (you only need a little after all.) This came with a nice little pair of tweezers that alone is worth the $10 (shipping included) price tag. Had I realized that, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered an extra one.  The little bottles have plastic stoppers that keep the contents where they belong.  Besides all that they&#x27;re just plain cute and fun to look at.  A good value and I would heartily recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> The product is very good and it was beyond my expectation.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and they liked it quite well.  It arrived on time and was packaged well.  Recommended</li>
    <li> This stated it came with the tweezers to place the designs. But it did not. Several of the bottles had the glitter outside the bottles. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> Bottles are EXTREMELY small. I like the variety, but these bottles are so small there is no excuse why they are not completely full. One of the bottles even had 3 rhinestones in it. Literally - just 3! I would say this product is not worth more than $5.</li>
    <li> A lot of the bottles where almost empty and two had nothing at all.. The bottles in my opinion are to small to be half empty. The size would be ok if they had a decent amount. Other than that I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Some bottles do contain less than others but cant complain as it is shown on the picture so I was already expecting that. The tweezer it comes with is very nice and helpful. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The person I purchased this for loved it. Great price. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Fastest shipping ever!!! LOVE THESE!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought two of these and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!  Many different things to choose from.  The only complaint that I have is they are difficult to get onto the nail without dropping (even when using the tweezers).  But I still rate this 5 stars because I&#x27;m sure its the users fault and not the products fault!!!</li>
    <li> The glitter goes a long way and lasts a long time, but some of the bottles of little gems only had 5 gems in it! very incorrect when it says &#x27;200 to 2000 in each bottle&#x27;. It should say 5 to 2000. The glitter is pretty though and the flowers have this nice curve to them so they stay on really well with topcoat alone. Three stars because I feel like I probably would have paid this price for half of these bottles, I love the colors. One of them even has little duckies! only 10 months until easter, then it&#x27;s on.... but seriously it makes the inner child scream with happy for the glitter. So, glitter. GLITTER. and theres flowers and hearts and crap. It&#x27;s a great little set, they just need to fill up the gem bottles a little better. Charge an extra dollar, but fill that sucker up!</li>
    <li> So cool. Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail and the bottles were smaller than I expected and some of them didn&#x27;t have that much product in them, but it&#x27;s a nice selection with lots of fun colors and decorations.</li>
    <li> good sampling of nail jewels. My neice is just starting to decorate her nails and she uses this all the time .</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey for what you are getting since the majority of the bottles are half full or less, but I think that&#x27;s because of prime shipping maybe. There are also alot of glitters and not alot of 3D nail decorations. I wish more of the 3D decorations were filled up all the way, then I would be in love! The bottles are really cute though and I will be using it all, but I am very hesitant on repurchasing. I love that it came with tweezers though since I very much needed some. The tweezers fit perfectly inside the little bottles too.</li>
    <li> So much variety in the kinds of decorations, a wonderful deal! Some, you can only use for one set of nails because of the numbers that come in the bottles. It allows you to experiment with different designs before you purchase a full-size pack of decorations.</li>
    <li> Got this as a present and i love it. Some mini bottles dont come with many but enough to start. All you need is creativity and imagination.</li>
    <li> Bottles are a lot smaller then I thought they would be, but perfect for my daughter who lives to do her sisters and her nails, great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves it.  Such a great variety and all organized in little bottles.  The tweezers are a big help with the application.  Such a fun kit for those that love to do their nails.</li>
    <li> So many choices to use in this collection.  Love that it came with long pointed tweezers.  Bottles either had caps so tight--hard to get off or caps that won&#x27;t stay on/in...two bottles spilled in transit.</li>
    <li> I received this product today and I have to say that I am completely happy with it. I cannot wait to put some on my nails. I love that it came with the tweezers, that helps a lot when applying the art to your nails. I also love the little bottles these came in...so cute! I would definitely recommend and buy again. The price in unbeatable! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She likes it OK, but the bottles are a lot smaller than expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Very, very, VERY tiny. Picture is extremely misleading!  My niece did love it, but the pic made it look like it was a large collection.  The box was approx the height and width of a ladies wallet, except only about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
    <li> One of the jars completely empty... two or three othsr jars have very few pieces.... Eh, wasn&#x27;t what I expected... I anticipated more jewels and rhinestones... just losts of glitter.. small glitter.. confetti glitter.. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order this because of the bad reviews. Well sometimes it&#x27;s worth taking a chance!!! I received my beautiful nail art in perfect condition. I was really surprised at all that was there. I know that everyone has complaints on how full the bottles were filled. In my years of doing nails i have learned that alot of the time less deco is best. I love this kit and would definitely buy more!!!</li>
    <li> its a cute starter set and I say cute because of the size!!! Some jars only have three or four stones. Mind you, in my pic that&#x27;s a full size lighter, not a mini one!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I liked the tool that came with it and the variety of the bottles. I would have given 5 stars if they would have put more hearts and stars then glitter, but I just like those more. Good product!</li>
    <li> Ok so these decorations are great except for the amount of gliter/gems/etc. is horrible. most of the bottles are barely filled. The gem bottles are filled with like... 10 gems. Some bottles are filled to the top and most are barely filled. The gems/glitter/etc. itself is great but the amount in the bottles isnt so great. Hope this helps!! :)</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it was. And size should have been mention.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, there are so many different glitters, studs and jewels to use, they are small enough for anyone with small nail beds. You can even use them for other things like make up or arts and crafts. the only bad thing is that there is so little in each little bottle and they can run out quickly, and for the price I feel like there should be more product in the little bottles. Other  than that its great!!</li>
    <li> The bottles are super small, literally the size of a quarter. I was actually gonna post a pic but I can&#x27;t from my phone for some reason. Anyways I&#x27;m not at all disappointed. No color repeats. Nice variety. I thinks its cute how small the bottles are.</li>
    <li> My daughters love these!  Very neatly packaged and adorable.  would be a great gift too.</li>
    <li> Purchased this set for my wife who paints her nails 1-4 times a week. She loves it. All of the jars look like they have at least 10 pieces but she told me that wasnt a big deal if they didnt because she tends to only put a jewel on 1 or 2 fingers when she does her nails. The tweezers were a great too. Before she got this recent set, she used to use a toothpick with a small amount of clearcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who doesnt want to pay an arm and a leg at a nail salon.</li>
    <li> I love pretty much every product I get from this company. These nail things are adorable! They do fall off, some times fast, sometimes not as fast, but you get so many or such a cheap price, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. They make my nails look so cute and adds pizazz to the cool colored nail polishes I wear. Polishes I actually get from Shany. 25 bucks for 24 nail polishes in all kinds of cool colors, what a steal! I love this company!!</li>
    <li> Do not recommend. There&#x27;s like literally nothing in the bottles. You could probably use one bottle up in one use. I think it is better if you just buy the glitter from craft stores and all other things, at least then you get what you paid for. Hate this. Oh and on top of that when I received mine many were broken. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Heck with nail art! I use these for crafts! Lots of cool gems, confetti, etc..., enough to embellish all sorts of cards, crafts, atc&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> These were so cute it was hard to resist they will work great with my other nail art supplies.great job Amazon .</li>
    <li> Nice variety and well packaged.</li>
    <li> These bottles are tiny. Teeny tiny. But for $19 one should expect that. I was still a little blown away that every bottle was no more than an inch high. Despite that I am giving it 5 stars because it is an awesome selection. The photo is pretty accurate when it comes to how full the bottles are (but keep in mind their size) but the ones that look the least full actually have little hearts, stars etc in them so it makes sense. I will say that the tweezers are pretty cheap looking but I haven&#x27;t used them yet so they might work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for a birthday party for my daughter and I think it will work perfectly. I think its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the kit after ordering it.The kit arrived when stated and I was excited to see the possibilities of all the creative ways that I could do my nails. I was so disappointed to find that the kit was missing the mini bottles on the entire 4th row. That night I send an email expressing my disappointment. The very next day I received an apologetic response. Today, (2 business days later) I received another kit free of charge. Thank you!! The kit contains an adorable assortment of decorations.</li>
    <li> I am a beader and I enjoyed bead weaving around these tiny little bottles. They are so cute. You may want to make a display case for them because they are so adorable, you wont want to use them for nail art. The tweezer fits perfectly into the bottles neck to grab the tiny pieces of decorations. The tray they come in holds the bottles securely so hey do not fall out. The contents of some of the bottles remind me of magic pixie dust or something like that from an old kids movie. I probably will purchase again to make more bead weaving bottles.</li>
    <li> 48 or so itty bitty bottles of glitter, some shapes, hearts and stars in a number of colors.  If you like adding decorations to your nails, this is a good set for the price</li>
    <li> The product came right on time, every little nail art bottle comes with what you need and the bottles help you organize. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get the slightly smaller ones with the tweezers, but the tweezers help out a  l o t! The price for this was great, I got what I wanted thank you.</li>
    <li> Well for the price it&#x27;s a good deal. I did think that the bottles would be larger. But they are about the size of half your pinky. There pretty small. When I opened mine up one of the tops was inside the bottle sp the blue sparkly stuff was everywhere.  Some of the bottles where full to the top and some had almost nothing in them. I was a little confused. But I don&#x27;t know. For the price I would buy it again. In hopes that the next one the bottles would be fuller and not have opened during shipping.</li>
    <li> Read the description.. vials are very small. But that is my fault for not reading. and every vial is filled to exactly what&#x27;s on the picture if not more.</li>
    <li> A Package was covered by sprinkle!! No wonder why, one of a glass bottle was broken!! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again....</li>
    <li> This is the cutest sampler set for decorating your nails.  It has a little of everything.  Hours of creative entertainment!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece and she was thrilled!!  Thanks for a product that let&#x27;s me be a hero to my niece without being in the dog house with my sister!!  ;)</li>
    <li> Some of the bottles were filled to the top white others only had a few pieces in them.. other than that they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
    <li> well, when i saw this on here I was so excited I had to order it. looking at the picture I figured that some of the bottles had less than others, which I was completely okay with. Well what I didn&#x27;t realize was 8 of the bottles had 3-6 stones in it. Really if I want to put one on each of my ring fingers, what am I going to do with the lonely 3rd little gem. I was just a little disappointed when a few of the bottles have so very few in them, I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be full, but at least have more than 3. Other than that it is a okay product.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, the different designs and they amount of bottles, you can created many different looks with this nail art. :0)</li>
    <li> Some of the bottles came almost empty</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for anyone that likes nail art and seeing what they can create.  There are a number of different kinds of nail art decorations, from stars to glitter to beads and confetti, making the possible combinations endless.  A must-have for anyone that enjoys creating new nail art</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get the bottles are the size of the tip of your finger if you are the only one using these thats great.  Unfortunately myself and my mom will be using so it wont last.  Love the tweezers that came with them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a girls summer camp. The girls had a blast with them. They are exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I really like that, to many styles and colors...&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27; m gona have a real fun w/ this stuff :)</li>
    <li> Have different shapes, a lot of colors and comfortly packed, so the bottles are easy to open even with wet nails and the holder is good cause you can shake it, but the bottles stays on their places and the tweezers are pretty useful and comfortable, I never used ones before so cannot compare, but liked to use this ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who thinks she wants to gain knowledge in nails. This is one (of many) products I&#x27;ve bought and this will be perfect for her supplies!</li>
    <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art and this set makes professional results even for me with no training I just watched videos online AND THIS SET ROCKS!!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but very useful if you do your nails a lot with gems.</li>
    <li> Actually purchased this for my niece&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s birthday.  I heard she loves this.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with the price. I understand now why it is an add on to your order but not worth 10.00 dollars maybe 5.00 dollars cause of the bottles and tweezers but over all I wouldn&#x27;t get it again. the picture is disceiving and when I got them they are very small they are vials and or trinket size bottles. with product so may get one or two uses out of a few bottles. but over all a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Hate it! Items are way too small.......BAD INVESTMENT!</li>
    <li> Tried two different sets. Both had broken bottles, open bottles, bottles with no lids, and most bottles that had items just had a couple things (like 5 crystals or decorations). This was a very disappointing and misleading set.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister-in-law who is totally int all things nail art and she loves them!</li>
    <li> As many other reviewers have noted, the bottles are extremely small -- maybe 1/2 inch high and not filled completely. That being said, it&#x27;s a fun collection with a wide variety of nail decorations. It came promptly and in good condition, packaged in a box with all the bottles securely displayed in an insert. My only complaint was that one bottle of the collection was empty.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described! Love this set!!!</li>
    <li> These are great and there were plenty of items in every bottle. Only issue is one of the bottles shattered during shipping and I need to use it for an event so I can&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> They are so tiny I felt like I needed a microscope to see them...unfortunately the description leads you to believe there will be more stuff in the bottles which makes you think that they will be bigger than the SUPER TINY or better yet MICRO bottles that they are. (a bottle is about the size of my ring finger nail) I must say the picture actually is the correct proportion.but because of the lack of reference it doesn&#x27;t relate that way! The bottles with charms contain only 4 charms and the other flowers and rhinestone contain may be 10-20 at best. The description mentions 200-2000 count in each bottle, I seriously think they are referring to the grains of GLITTER... Who does that????! Though it is a nice selection but should more appropriately be called a MICRO SAMPLER package. I suggest to the vendor to add a picture that would show better reference to the actual size by adding a coin to the product picture. Because of the nice selection I don&#x27;t feel cheated on cost BUT I am disappointed on the misleading reference to the quantity and size of product (200-2000ct...WRONG!). Had the picture been better so I didn&#x27;t have an expectation of more product and realized they were referring to glitter in the count (again..Who does that??!) then I would have given it a better score..though the value isn&#x27;t as awesome as I thought I was originally getting it isn&#x27;t unreasonably priced for the sample selection. Not an awesome deal just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again???............Maybe as a gift but definitely NOT as my own product supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actual Product description: 1/4&amp;#34;x1/2&amp;#34; Micro bottles (about the size of a jelly bean or red hot candy)&lt;br /&gt;12 containing varied selection of small iridescent cutouts (~30-50ct in each),&lt;br /&gt;12 containing varied selection of colors of ultra fine glitters (bottles are about 1/3-1/2 full);&lt;br /&gt;12 containing varied selection of fine Mylar tinsel glitters (bottles are 1/3-1/2 full);&lt;br /&gt;3 containing varied selection of Micro pearl glitter (maybe enough for 1 nail??)&lt;br /&gt;3 containing varied selection coarse glitter (bottles are 1/3-1/2 full)&lt;br /&gt;3 containing varied selection small low profile rhinestones (~15-30ct)&lt;br /&gt;2 containing varied selection tiny plastic flowers/hearts (~10-20ct)&lt;br /&gt;1 containing metallic charms (4ct)</li>
    <li> We bought this for our 13 year old daughter. She likes to paint her nails occassionally and my husband thought she might like to experiment with all of the decorations in this kit. It comes in a fairly small box as each bottle is pretty tiny. The tweezers that are included are very nice which surprised me since they can be pricey bought separately. They are definitely needed for some of the decorations. I can see this lasting a while and coming out at sleepovers or nail parties. As for glue to help them stick, we just bought a package of nail glue, probably for sticking on fake nails, at wally world, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and love it all... It&#x27;s my first try and it&#x27;s a win win purchase... Thank you so much...</li>
    <li> Is very small, I thought it would be bigger, there are several bottles not bring almost nothing, but still... is beautiful and practical!</li>
    <li> If you have a passion for designing nails and you love choices this product is great for you ,,its 48 different choices n designs in little bitty cute bottles ,,i love it</li>
    <li> I love it! The tweezer are a great plus!! My favorite part of this product is that it comes seperated in bottles which help a lot!  I bought it for personal use and it comes with many different styles!!</li>
    <li> This is was gift for my niece. She absolutely LOVED it and wanted to paint everyone&#x27;s toes right away! ;)</li>
    <li> My daughter in law loves this!  Bought this as a gift to her and she is really enjoying it.  So much to choose from, shapes, colors, sizes!  She was also happy the little tweezers came with it.  I will order again when and if she ever runs out!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I became obsessed with nail art . The little bottle R adorable and I use them for various other things. My only complaint is some of the bottles were barley full. None had the same amount of stuff in it. Other than that I liked them</li>
    <li> I think this is WAY over-priced!  The tubes are only about 1/2-3/4&amp;#34; tall.  I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re absolutely adorable! It comes with fine glitter, big glitter, gems, stones, hearts, stars, flowers! So many things to choose from. Most of the bottles came at least half way full if not a tad more. The tops of the bottles are easy to take off no struggling at all and they&#x27;re also easy to put back on. I would highly suggest this to anyone who wants to put little decorations on their nails!</li>
    <li> It has a lot of of the same colors. Two of my bottles were broken and some were very hard to open but for the price it was ok.</li>
    <li> I got this few months ago . Just open tonight .The color where food.  It had all different things in there . But there just on things they are not full bottle . Mose of then only half full or less.</li>
    <li> The wrapping is perfect. but the cards were printed horribly.</li>
    <li> Although some bottles were more filled then others, it is  still a great deal for all the product and variety you get.</li>
    <li> Came in record time!  So many cute pieces for nail art!!!!! My daughter is jn Heaven! Would def buy again and again!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these items yet but I love the variety.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve expected bigger bottles but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> These are really cute and I love the small bottles to keep things nicely separated. The item description says each bottle contains 200-2000 pieces but 10 of my bottles have fewer than 20 pieces in them. I didn&#x27;t expect huge amounts but this was ridiculous, not enough for a full manicure in a coupleasure bottles.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit for my wife who liked it quite the bit.  The little bottles the nail products are in are quite adorable.</li>
    <li> Huge selection of nail decorations which will provide hours of fun for my granddaughter and her girlfriends. The tiny bottles are an extra bonus - I think she will love using the empties for her little keepsakes. I know I would.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter.  For us the bottles were a bit too small for her to work with and she didn&#x27;t have the skill to make it look great as an independent soul....but the product and options are a lot of fun and I would have kept for older girls.  The seller Nuntun? was absolutely awesome to work with, very reponsive and great service.  I would recommend the seller and the product for older gals who want some fun glitter and bling!</li>
    <li> The price was ok and I needed some nail art to practice for school. The shipping came fast and it was packed securely and properly. The reason I gave 4 stars is I thought the bottles would be a bit bigger even though they do look small, they are very small.... The size of your thumbnail most likely is the accurate description of how small the bottles are. On the other hand, they are very nice little containers that I will re-use.</li>
    <li> She tells me she has looked at this item many times and had it on her Christmas list, so it was funny that I, not knowing this, bought it for her.  SHE LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> Ok, I spent $100 on shany nail accessories, and this one turned out to be my favorite. The bottles are very small, but super cute. I love the designs inside, beside the rhinestone and 3D shapes, the rest are mostly crushed shell, acrylic powders and small 3D stones.. some have only 3-4pcs inside a bottle, but the reality is, it wouldn&#x27;t fit more than 3-4 and you are not going to use that many at all. Free tweezer also grabbed my attention, one thing I didn&#x27;t like was, the tweezer in my package was black, but in picture they are showing a silver one. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I mixed some with my clear nail polish finish that I had and applied to my nails. It looks awesome, the best part was , I got creative with it and designed the back of my iphone with it, I used the orange 3D shapes and mixed them with Pink, and applied them on top of purple crushed shell. It looks fantastic, everyone is asking me where did I buy this case? Using this item now I have designer nails eventhough I am not a professional and I am not spending $100 dollars at a nail sallon. It is easy and I hope this was helpful. Loved the product, would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not sure there are as many pieces in these teeny weeny little bottles as they claim, but as others have said it&#x27;s a neat little starter/sampler kit. Don&#x27;t expect much though - the bottles are about the size of a rolled up dime - about a half inch in in height (maybe) and about half as round as a pencil. Cute little miniatures... is about all they are!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  There are so many pretty colors to choose from</li>
    <li> These little bottles are so tiny and adorable.  Purchased for my niece and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality Thanks A Lot</li>
    <li> Tiny little bottles of fun things to put on your nails!  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> These bottles are TINY but they do come with plenty of stuff in each bottle to do a set of nails atleast once if not 2-3 times per bottle. This is a great starter set and especially fun for a child or teenager that wants to try to do their own nails. The pair of tweezers inside are nice quality!</li>
    <li> small amounts bottles are &amp;#34;TINY&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These are tiny samples of each kind of nail art. All kinds of fun and pretty ways to decorate nails.</li>
    <li> Bought these as part of a gift for my wife.  She wanted those cool things her friends had.  So after searching I found them here.  This has everything you could want for nail decals.  She has yet to use any of the nail decorating things I bought her including this but I looked at a few of the bottles and they look really thin and very small.  The tweezers included are very much needed.</li>
    <li> These tiny little bottles carry the most ever needed for nail design. Can take them anywhere anytime. I just love em.. Thanks AAA+++</li>
    <li> My granddaughter (13) loved this sparkling gift to add to her new passion for funky nail art.  It claims to be appropriate for professional nail salons.</li>
    <li> Extremely tiny bottles. I counted the metallic square beads and I got a total of 7 pieces. I don&#x27;t see how there are 200 pieces at least in a bottle because they are so tiny anyway. They are cute, but it&#x27;s not enough for one manicure.</li>
    <li> I love this item. There are sooo many different designs to work with &amp; the colors are AMAZING!!! You should truly order this. I promise you wont be disappointed. This will be endless fun with my Daughter. THANK YOU :)</li>
    <li> This set is not only useful, but the display of the gems is beautiful.  Fast shipment.  The gems are easy to apply and wear nicely.</li>
    <li> It is a great kit for either starters or professionals!  Tons of possibilities.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase, exactly as described, tweezers are great too.</li>
    <li> Double duty micro bottles and product. I can&#x27;t wait to try product. Looks fun.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviews that the bottles are super tiny, but we&#x27;re talking about little tiny little fingernail decorations.  They are super cute and my teenage daughter will love them.</li>
    <li> Very small bottles, kind of like sample sizes but awesome just to try out some different mediums on your nails. The tool that it comes with is a godsend, I wouldn&#x27;t have known what to do with it. Really cute fun for yourself or as a small present for a nail addict.</li>
    <li> My stepdaughter (17) loves these for her nails the bottles are small but seem to be lasting.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter lover the nail art</li>
    <li> a little disapointed because the bottles it was almost empty. the rock were amazing and beautiful but into the bottle are few. is in the middle of the bottle. not full.</li>
    <li> Some had more product than others, but for the price u can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> The selections are great - very happy with this product and would recommend it, especially to those nail artists that like to create unique designs.</li>
    <li> These are nice additions to any nail design. hearts starts and little beads stick up off of your nail a little but they are still cute especially for the little girls</li>
    <li> Great product! Worth every penny. Shipping time was great. The little jars are cute too. Will order more. Great for my 7 year old and 14 year old sister.</li>
    <li> It was ok. One bottle was completely shattered, also very tiny bottles. However, not the worst and good for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for Granddaughter ...cute as it can be...she will have a great time decorating her nails with this set</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of decorations for me! The tweezers are a nice added touch!</li>
    <li> gift item for a teenager, naturally never heard back!</li>
    <li> Was a gift, 15 year old LOVED it</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter loves nail art.  This is a great kit.  It has lots of choices but is a nice compact size.  A little of these glitters or appliques go a long way, so she hasn&#x27;t even used up one vial completely.  I thought the tweezers were quite nice too.</li>
    <li> very cool idea for nails, Christmas present</li>
    <li> Bottles are so tiny.  About as big as a quarter and not even half full.</li>
    <li> my nail girl is going to love this one.  There is a lot of fun available in thses little bottles.  :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really realize just how small these little jars of glitter/fringe/sequins are...but for the price, it&#x27;s a great little addition to any nail art lover&#x27;s collection.  Just as advertised, the bottles are not &amp;#34;brimming&amp;#34; with product, which is totally fine.  A very good selection of stars, hearts and fun rhinestones too.</li>
    <li> I really like it. The little bottles are cute. But one of the bottle was empty and there was glitter everywhere other than that i loved it.</li>
    <li> best thing that ever happened to me, i love them and omg they actually stay on! and they&#x27;re pretty &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> These perfect tiny bottles filled with the cutest nail art, I love it! It&#x27;s the perfect gift to a friend that&#x27;s in to nails or even to keep just for fun,like a girls night!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and was first excited when I got it. but now that I look at it.. Iam thinking WTF? i have some vials with ONLY 5 pieces in there!  5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what is up with that?&lt;br /&gt;there is a vial with hearts in them.. ONLY 3 are in there!! 3!! what a waste!!  they should have equal measurements in each vial.  The glitters are all different amounts from half way up to a third none of them are full&lt;br /&gt;one vial has white beads in them but they are stuck together and melted&lt;br /&gt;I see one vial with octagons in there but there are only 5 in that vial.&lt;br /&gt;the vials are nice, and it is a great idea.. but  it looks like they emptied the vials some so they could be greedy. I say that because on the cover of the box it shows the vials full in the pictures. in fact I am almost 100% that is what they did.  they probably bought some vials and split them all up.  I am very disappointed with companies that do that.&lt;br /&gt;also when I went to the Shany website it shows the bottles being full.&lt;br /&gt;I dont care that they marked up the price it is that the bottles are mostly empty</li>
    <li> The bottles are very tiny, but perfect for my purposes. I was really looking for a wide sampling of decoration rather than a lot of any one thing. My package includes little shamrocks, several varieties of hearts, stars and glitters. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I love these they were smaller than I thought they were they are pretty tiny but they are great other than that I seen some people put on their reviews that some of the bottles we practically empty I only had one bottle like that out of all of them other than that most if them were full or almost full I will defiantly be buying this again</li>
    <li> The images and description make these bottles seem to be a lot bigger than they really are. They&#x27;re about the size of my pinky finger, top knuckle to tip. The description says &amp;#34;each Glass bottle has 200 to 2000pcs inside&amp;#34;. I have 8 bottles that have MAYBE 20-40 pieces inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;several of my lids weren&#x27;t pressed in tight enough during shipping, so I opened my box and got sprayed with glitter that had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips of my tweezers aren&#x27;t lined up right, so they have trouble gripping anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister who is a huge manicure art enthusiast.  The bottles are very small vials but there is definitely enough product and variation for hundreds of nail art projects.  Definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who is &#x27;into&#x27; personal manicures.  She was satisfied with the color selection and selections offered.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for at home nail art and it is perfect. The product comes with tweezers help a lot. My favorite part of this product is that it comes seperated in bottles which help a lot compared to products I&#x27;ve purchased that come in small bags. I would and will recommend this product to my family and friends. I also love Shanys other products. The items ive purchased come in a timely manner. Great company!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and I&#x27;m very disappointed. Like everyone else I expected it to be much larger. The picture also shows the bottles in what looks like a black flocked tray when they actually come in a cheesy white plastic tray. The kind you definitely throw away after opening. It looks more like a $3 to $5 item.</li>
    <li> Really cute bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Looks amazing. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> Have not used yet but there is a nice assortment of embellishments. The jars are tiny, about thimble size so don&#x27;t expect to be able to do a lot of manicures. Also, there isn&#x27;t same amount of glitter in every jar, some were almost full, others were filled less than 1/3. The tweezers are good, very sharp. I will also be using some of the bulkier embellishments for crafts.</li>
    <li> Arrived well, smaller than expected with each bottle about 2cm and half full, like a good half so I&#x27;m not disappointed, not a fan of 1/4 of the stringy tinsel things but overall wonderful</li>
    <li> This little collection of nail art was a great purchase. I find myself doing some very wild designs with a lot of the decorations. The tweezers were a nice addition as well.</li>
    <li> Great value for such an awesome selection, Great containers that can be refilled.</li>
    <li> I purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandaughter.  She and her friends love doing their nails and couldn&#x27;t wait to have a girls day to use this.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for christmas, and though it was smaller than I was expecting, there are a LOT of little glitter shapes and pieces of all colors and sizes. She&#x27;s an avid nail-doer (like once a week) and I&#x27;m pretty sure this will last her a long time!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I think that I expected larger containers, but there is an ample supply of items in the mini bottles to do a lot of nail art.</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed when I got this. I was super excited when I ordered it and then it came in and the bottles were teeeeny tiny!!! That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s a bad product to order, the pictures just made them seem a lot bigger. I was also expecting them to have more product in them. A lot of them do, but there are about a handful of bottles  that only have 3 or 4 pieces in it and the description says &amp;#34;each glass bottle has 200 to 2000 pieces inside&amp;#34; wrong. (Probably another reason why I thought the bottles would be bigger.) and since the bottles are so small, you really have to watch how much product you use, especially the glitter ones so you don&#x27;t use it all in one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do love how much variety I have with this set and they stay on pretty well. I used a clear top coat nail polish to keep the glitter on. It&#x27;s also such a steal and much cheaper if you think about how much you would spend at a craft store or a beauty supply store. I would probably order again. At least now I know what I would be getting.</li>
    <li> Cute item even tho I ordered wrong item. I thought it was polish. Now I need to figure out how to return.</li>
    <li> We were really surprised at how small the bottle were. They seem bigger in the picture.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get my nail decor, but thought some of the decor pieces in some bottles were a little short on quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the small decor pieces, very cute and fun, just wished there should of been a little more on some of the bottles that looked almost empty.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the tweezers??</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3d nail art decorative bottles... and i love them! Not only are all the little nail art items awesome... they come in little glass bottles... that I can reuse! Love this item and would buy again! I hope that next time I can get it a little cheaper tho!</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described - with many different shapes,colors  and textures. Arrived 2 days earlier than scheduled and even though it came in an envelope it arrived undamaged. For 1 person like me this will last at least through a whole year of holidays and other events. Very Happy with this.</li>
    <li> Yes! I waited for this for some time bc it sold out so fast. I was excited to order when it came back in stock. I read all the reviews until then. I must agree with some of the reviews that there are only a few in some of the bottles. For me though, it&#x27;s ok, it will force me to be more creative and use those particular short handed ones for accent nails only. I don&#x27;t have a salon and just do them myself (like most of us) and this collection is still good. Once I&#x27;m done with the bottle, I can reuse it for some other nail accessory items that I buy that come in those cheap cellophane bags, so either way, it&#x27;s a win-win! Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> This kit is fun and full of different nail fun! I just love it- it gets four stars because one container came empty :/ but besides that the kit is awesome and full of nail fun that will go for a year :)</li>
    <li> its ok its really small</li>
    <li> Love these!  So many cute glitters and 3D pieces I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use them all.  They&#x27;re very small bottles but there&#x27;s over 40 and they have plenty of product in them. Delivery was fast as well.</li>
    <li> Got these for my adult daughter for Christmas.  She loves them and uses them to do her nails regularly.  Other people have even asked her to do their nails.</li>
    <li> I received this in tack and I&#x27;m very excited to start using some of these decorations. None of the containers were empty but there were some that had only a few pieces in it but I don&#x27;t really mind. I assumed that they were just samples of these decorations since the containers are small. Overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> These are TINY bottles, but a great variety for about a one to two time use for nail art (in each bottle). My 12 year old niece really loved playing with this kit!</li>
    <li> Mostly just loose glitter... not worth the money if you want something nice. Any of the cool designs barely had any in the bottle. Basically confetti.</li>
    <li> Bought these for Grand-daughter, they are as listed. She will love them at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Would be a great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for a grandaughter nice variety of items. One of the small bottles were broken upon arrival the rest seem to be ok</li>
    <li> OMG!!! this tiny bottles are great just to compare which style one do you want to use. I bought it for personal use and it comes with many different styles. I like it !!!</li>
    <li> The only thing that would have made this perfect would be the addition of adhesive.  There are literally hundreds of nail applications contained in these bottles.  And the bottles are useful for keeping beads and jewelry fixings organized after the nail appliques are gone as my daughter does jewelry as well and often has a mess in the bottom of her jewelry making box.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly but items were not as described. description says &amp;#34;each glass bottle has 200 to 2000 pieces inside&amp;#34; BULL! Dimensions of bottles should be disclosed (size of the top half of your pinky)as well as some of the vials only had a couple of stones in them. I cannot even do one hand much less all 10 fingers the same with half the products. Will never purchase something like this online again without exact counts per bottle &amp; dimensions per bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my niece for Christmas and it&#x27;s a great starter kit for her as she likes designing her own nails. I thought the bottles and contents would be a wee bit bigger but it met more all my expectations. Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my granddaughter and she was happy with it. A large variety of decorations to choose from.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what is pictured and almost everything is really pretty and usable. My favorites are these lovely mint/pale aqua stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s quite a bit of glitter and foil shredded bits but they&#x27;re in really nice colors and all separated really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is similar to the others I have read.  There are a few bottles without much in them (I think 6 is the lowest I can see).  Those pieces are generally pretty large so they can be placed one per hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great for at home when you want lots of options without taking up much space.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this for her nail art and soon discovered that she did not get the tweezers. The overall was ok she likes it but is very sad that she did not receive the tweezers</li>
