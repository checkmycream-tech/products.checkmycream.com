      <li>the best ever purchased.</li>
      <li>These are the best scissors I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>Very good quality.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, these are beautifully crafted nail scissors</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with these scissors!  </li>
      <li>but they give great control and do everything you would want of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not everyone is happy with $1.50 clippers.</li>
      <li>Works great for what I needed it for.</li>
      <li>These were really great.  </li>
      <li>These are great nail scissors</li>
      <li>Gives me great control.</li>
      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>Very nice quality and performance.</li>
      <li>they are too good.</li>
      <li>They seem good.</li>
      <li>i love these sissors!  </li>
      <li>I love a good, hand crafted, quality tool.</li>
      <li>I love a good tool and these are.</li>
      <li>The best nail-cutting scissor ever - will last a lifetime.</li>
      <li>So, for now the scissors do what they&#x27;re supposed to do :-)</li>
      <li>Just the best nail-cutting scissor ever - will last a lifetime</li>
      <li>I wanted to love these.</li>
      <li>I realize they&#x27;re not billed as cuticle scissors, but originally they worked marvelously well for that purpose, now the two blades seem slightly out of alignment and rip skin rather than slicing it, tightening the screw doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>cut well and precise</li>
      <li>These are incredibly well-made and sharp.</li>
      <li>The finger openings are a perfect size for all size fingers, not too small.</li>
      <li>I could never cut my own fingernails on my left hand</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Took forever to get here, but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right size and fits well into my hand.</li>
      <li>Scissors came SUPER fast.  </li>
      <li>Update two months later: love them.</li>
      <li>They are sharp and have a nice point.</li>
      <li>The stainless steel is of high grade and expect they will last many years.</li>
      <li>Perhaps of note is that the finger holes are perhaps large for some.</li>
      <li>arrived in two days in a rather large box</li>
      <li>Four years later although I&#x27;ve been treating them well they butcher my cuticles, although they still work fine on my nails.  </li>
      <li>I had my current pair for 35 years and they still work fine, however I am turning them over to my daughter and replacing mine.</li>
      <li>Nice little nail scissors.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer scissors to clippers for my toenails.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>Out of the box I absolutely raved about them.  </li>
      <li>Performs very well.  </li>
      <li>I have some other German nail scissors that are 20+ years old, and I am still happy with them.</li>
      <li>The problem being that you end up cutting more nail, more quickly than you want to.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>They are sharp and strong.</li>
      <li>Very strong and excellent cutting ability even on toe tough toe nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a male, I have large hands and they fit onto my thumb perfectly; fitting snugly just behind the nail.</li>
      <li>Well, these live up to the reputation, but dare I say..</li>
      <li>Sharp and precise and sturdy; a far cry from inexpensive \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; products.</li>
      <li>Sharp and perfect for cutting finger nails</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but my son likes them very much.  </li>
      <li>They are very sharp and really zing through my toenails!!!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>

<li> So far very sharp and solid</li>
<li> My last nail scissors were some no-name model and lasted around that long.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re tired of the cheap nail scissors that have loose blades and cut as well as a brick, this is your answer.</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I kept cutting off  more fingernail than I wanted to and drawing blood.  </li>
<li> Still my favorite nail scissors, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> Or too sharp rather.</li>
<li> Does not come loose with just a little use.</li>
<li> and I will definitely hold on to them and wait for the time, if ever, that they dull a bit.</li>
<li> May be somewhat expensive, but they really are like the BMW&#x27;s of nail scissors.</li>
<li> These scissors are poorly made - the 2 blades only touch each other partially.</li>
<li> Not your everyday nail scissors.</li>
<li> They are stubbier than some, if not most nail scissors</li>
<li> These scissors are sharp but difficult to use, for some reason.  </li>
<li> useless</li>
<li> For anyone who prefers scissors to clippers, you will not be disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Very good quality. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Performs very well.  I have no issues with the item.  I would definitely recommend these scissors.</li>
    <li> Not your everyday nail scissors. One blade is serrated and they do not slip as you cut. They are sharp and have a nice point. They are stubbier than some, if not most nail scissors but they give great control and do everything you would want of them.&lt;br /&gt;I probably could go on and on and gush eloquently about the quality and design. I love a good tool and these are. Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, these are ambidextrous scissors. Perhaps of note is that the finger holes are perhaps large for some. As a male, I have large hands and they fit onto my thumb perfectly; fitting snugly just behind the nail. Gives me great control.</li>
    <li> So far very sharp and solid</li>

    <li> i love these sissors!  I could never cut my own fingernails on my left hand but I can with these!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and performance.</li>
    <li> This review should be written in ~10 years. My last nail scissors were some no-name model and lasted around that long. So, for now the scissors do what they&#x27;re supposed to do :-)</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s the right size and fits well into my hand. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is I wish it were sharper.</li>
    <li> Very strong and excellent cutting ability even on toe tough toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;Can cut using either hand!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these. I love a good, hand crafted, quality tool. Especially when it&#x27;s made by the Germans. Well, these live up to the reputation, but dare I say.. they are too good. Or too sharp rather. The problem being that you end up cutting more nail, more quickly than you want to. Nevertheless, these are beautifully crafted nail scissors and I will definitely hold on to them and wait for the time, if ever, that they dull a bit.</li>

    <li> These scissors are sharp but difficult to use, for some reason.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I kept cutting off  more fingernail than I wanted to and drawing blood.  I think I will just use these on my toenails and calluses.</li>
    <li> Sharp and precise and sturdy; a far cry from inexpensive \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; products. Does not come loose with just a little use.</li>
