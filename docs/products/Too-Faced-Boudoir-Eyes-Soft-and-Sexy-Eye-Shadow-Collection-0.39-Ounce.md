<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great set. The colors are wonderful. I do see a bit of fallout but I have crappy brushes so it might be them. Too Faced is my favorite and I will definitely be buying more sets in the future.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors that last for at least 10 hours before needing a touch up!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy the other color palletes from Too Faced!</li>
    <li> These are beautiful colors they blend well the only thing bad thing is the darkest color has a lot of glitter fall out</li>
    <li> The reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of five doesn&#x27;t really have to do with the product itself… just that I could tell somebody sampled the item before I even used it.  I think it&#x27;s a great product and the colors are great..you can go natural or have some smokey looks as well.  I was just surprised that Amazon would allow this.  I&#x27;m a girl and I can tell whether or not someone has tried make up...</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend to use and she loves the heck out of it.</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite palette yet. One thing that I don&#x27;t like however is that they changed the instruction cards, you have to take a paper out and unfold it to the look you want instead of finding the individual card you want.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my 13 year old but I didn&#x27;t think the names of the eye shadows were appropriate for her so I kept them and I am so happy that I did :) Love all these colors and they stay on pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love love love this palette. It&#x27;s perfect. I rarely use anything else! The pigments are great, even the matte colors which other companies can&#x27;t seem to figure out for some reason. I would recommend this set to anyone who likes a soft natural or smokey eye. It&#x27;s just pretty. This is the second 5 star rating I&#x27;ve ever given to a product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The colors are much lighter that what I thought they would be.  They are very pretty, but much much lighter.  They go on extremly light.  You loose quite a bit of the shadow as well if you don&#x27;t have some type of primer as well.</li>
    <li> this palate has great colors with really good pigment and shimmer. Plus I use one of the colors as a highlighter and blush</li>
    <li> Genuine Too Faced product seen in stores but the closure magnet is faulty and does not close like it should.</li>
    <li> Best color pallet out there!  Love two faced Boudoir eyes shadow!  Cant find it at Saphora any more either.</li>
    <li> Let me reiterate I LOVE too faced pallets. Honestly I probably own them all- naked, natural, smokey eye, romantic eye, etc.. I purchased urban decays and benefits pallets, but too faced pallets are just awesome! They do just what they say. This pallet is so soft and feminine. I am going to get it for my cousin for Christmas- I am totally sold!</li>
    <li> good make up, good price, and lasts a long time. Really should use brushes for this. Seems professional grade, and even though it&#x27;s too inexpensive to be professional it is much better quality than drug store make up.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and these colors blend well. Beautiful color combos.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice palette that is more neutral.  I think some of the lighter colors don&#x27;t show up a lot, but overall I am very happy with it.  I love TooFaced shadows.</li>
    <li> Perfect! My wife loves it and continues to stand by this product! I&#x27;m sure plenty more will be purchased in the future.</li>
    <li> Great for going out or day to day. This combo is the perfect go to for eyeshadow and looks great on pale skin</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; present. She&#x27;s been doing some acting lately and wanted to give her a little kit she could take with her and have a few different looks. She seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in the pigmentation of the dark colors. They were very light! I love the light colors, applies very smooth and blends nicely but I end up reaching for my Stila dark colors to complement this palette.</li>
    <li> This product came in good shape but I hold the product up to the screen to compare the colors and they can&#x27;t be further from one another. The product online has more of a pink/purple hue to it. The product I received has all browns and gold hues in every color. Very disappointed. Won&#x27;t use it, don&#x27;t recommend buying it here unless you have seen the actual product before.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow palette it is beautiful. Great pigmentation.</li>
    <li> This is my second shadow pallet by Too Faced and I love it! The colors are beautiful and the right amount pigmented. The color lasts all day (I use a lid primer) and they do not fade. My favorite color in this pallet is Sugar Walls. Wish I could get that shade in a single. I&#x27;ll buy again when this runs out. (The other pallet I own by Too Faced is Chocolate Bar - love it, too and it smells so good,  just like chocolate! )</li>
    <li> Love the colors.  Will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I love these :) I am going to buy the naturals set next, very nice. The last all day with a nice primer</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, highly recommended +++++A</li>
    <li> Really pretty colors!!! Love this palette. Got one for myself and my mom. We both love it. Good for fair skin</li>
    <li> My package came to me looking used, banged up &amp; that is not okay... I expressed this in my review and at this point I have a change of heart! It was never this product in and of it&#x27;s self that I had an issue with because this palette is AMAZING, but the presentation was all bad! This has since been rectified which makes me a very satisfied customer and as a result to the provider doing this I&#x27;d shop here again gladly, thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this shadow palette. The shadows are nicely pigmented and so smooth!</li>
    <li> Full coverage and the colors are useful for day and night.  Great product and worth the money!  Small enough for my purse.</li>
    <li> This  was my first Too Faced purchase. I&#x27;m not a fan.  I didn&#x27;t realize how sparkly the shadow is. One of the shadows in the compact was shattered.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this kit. Very versatile...from everyday eyes to dramatic &amp;#34;going out&amp;#34; looks, it does it all. Great formula and very pretty colors! My go to shadow!</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors.  I love to mix them and makes for great date nite looks.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed in this product. This is how it showed up at my house. It is unusable and caused a mess upon opening.</li>
    <li> Colors are exactly as pictured....just beautiful...love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This palette includes great colors perfect for day or evening looks.  The quality is amazing nicely pigmented and easily blended.</li>
    <li> I really like Too Faced products.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to get this! The colors are great.,I had bought the Naked Collection before and used it almost every day. This one looks perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice collection. Great to have all favorites in one cute tin. I leave it sitting out rather than putting it away each day because the tin is so pretty.</li>
    <li> This Pallet........ the best one yet! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. So easy to work with, blendable, and user friendly.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that I like to change things with my makeup occasionally.  For example, I like to switch up my eyeshadow shades.  I ordered this product about 8 months ago, and this is the only eyeshadow kit I will use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are amazing and blendable.  They are just perfect.  Even the darker colors (black, purple, grey) blend to look nice and smooth, and not too dark.  I don&#x27;t use the colors as suggested, but I mix and match the colors to what suits me best.  My favorite color is Sugar Walls.  Aside from that one being almost gone (I use it as my main/base color), I still have plenty of all colors left.  Fuzzy Handcuffs is a nice soft alternative, and In the Buff is an awesome highlighter.  I like to use French Tickler or Voulez-Vous (for a softer look) on the outer corners of my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I will be ordering this again.  It has everything I need, and I love it.  It is definitely worth the investment ($$$).</li>
    <li> This is my second Too Face pallet. Beautiful colors with shimmer that look great on my fair complexion. I will be buying more of these pallets!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the names on them are so cute. Bought it as a gift for my mom who just started dating again. She thought it was hilarious but also love the colors</li>
    <li> I have been using this palette for months and I absolutely love it. I can wear these colors day or night. They are beautiful and stay on well! My favorite eye palette no doubt.</li>
    <li> Love! Best eyeshadow ever.</li>
    <li> Fake! Fake! Fake! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> love the colors. Too Faced always has great products.</li>
    <li> BEST EYESHADOW EVER. Point blank. I wear it every day.</li>
    <li> I really love these Too Faced eyeshadow compacts.  I got the Natural Eyes compact over a year ago and found myself using is almost daily, so I decided to get another one.  The Boudoir Eyes compact also has a great selection of colors and makes it easy to apply the correct shades.  The pink and purple shades of the Boudoir Eyes don&#x27;t work quite as well on my complexion as the natural browns but it&#x27;s fun to have something different.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and they loved it</li>
    <li> Overall its a good palette, 4 matte shades, 5 shimmery (subtle shimmer) The packaging is adorable, its a tin box with hinges and a magnetic close, the only thing is wish it had a mirror. It comes with a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; guide with three different looks. The shadows themselves are easy to blend and are subtle enough to wear on an everyday basis and you can also build them up for a smokier, more dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i think its overpriced. Its a good product, but you can find similar palettes for a lot less.</li>
    <li> I have all too faced eye shadows pallet. And I was so happy to put my hands on their last pallet. I loved the colours as usual and I think they go so well for day makeup or night. And I have that Revlon lipstick colour that goes so well with these eyes shadows.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette! I use it often, usually with my NAKED Basics palette. The colors are gorgeous and go on well. They all have pretty good staying power! Too Faced is one of my favorite makeup brands and they have yet to fail me!</li>
    <li> Product is ok  but it goes on really light.  I feel like I have to use more than I should to be able to see it on.  For the money I would probably not purchase again. It&#x27;s just o.k.</li>
    <li> I love 2 faced makeup and always wanted to try the Boudoir eyes so this worked out perfectly! Thanks for a great item.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m 42 years old, I&#x27;m very much a beginner with eye makeup. However after reading reviews of other Too Faced products and listening to my coworkers rave about them, I decided to give this a try. LOVE it! I was skeptical about being able to make my own eyes look like what I see in magazines, but the little card-things that are included with the product show and tell you exactly where to put each color. Even though I feel like I have sort of &amp;#34;hooded&amp;#34; (ie. 42 yr-old) eyes, I followed the directions exactly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Even my husband, who typically hates makeup, commented that my eyes looked natural and pretty.</li>
    <li> Such pretty eye shadow!  My gf loved it!</li>
    <li> Like the way it feels</li>
    <li> I guess I have been a bit naïve as to there being fake makeup out there.  I bought this because I have always thought too faced to be good quality.  It wasn&#x27;t until just recently that I was looking into buying more but I remembered that I bought this pallet and thought that it was actually crap.  I have just started actually reading the reviews when I became aware of fake makeup here on amazon.  This pallet was indeed a fake after reviewing the differences.  The biggest difference is the French tickler.  It is an ugly green instead of the color that is posted in the pics.  If you buy this and get an ugly green color, then it is a fake!  Pretty disgusting that amazon allows this to happen.  Needless to say, I am done buying makeup on amazon, as well as just about anything else.  Kinda funny that they are jacking their price up to $99 for prime when they hardly ever deliver in two days(I even give a couple days for the weekend) and if you look into prices of things that are not amazon prime, a lot of times their prices are cheaper(when you do the math for shipping, they are close to equal).  I think that this was the last straw because you seriously don&#x27;t know what is in this fake makeup.  What if someone goes blind from this crap?!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was in new shape pigment came out perfect with all the colors in pic In the buff ,satin sheets,birthday suit,fuzzy handcuffs,sugar walls ,lap dance,voulez-vous,garter belt,and French tickler.</li>
    <li> love the colors, glide on effortlessly and the helpful tip card.......will buy more collections from too faced!! awesome buy, do not regret</li>
    <li> I have several palettes from Too Faced and I love them. This one is no exception. The colors and the quality are what I come to expect from this brand. The shadows are very pigmented, so a little goes a long way. The colors stay put and don&#x27;t crease, which is also great. It you want extra staying power use Too Faced Shadow Insurance. It works well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this palette comes in a little tin. The packaging is a little smaller than other palettes from the brand. I don&#x27;t mind it, because it makes it even better for travel. It still comes with the same amount of shadow as standard Too Faced palettes. It does not come with any make-up brushes, so you will have use your own or purchase some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors can easily go from day to night. It includes some great neutrals and some darker colors to add drama. This is a great palette for both beginners and make-up lovers alike. It comes with 3 tutorials for various looks. You can use those, or mix and match with other palettes. I highly recommend for any eye color or complexion.</li>
    <li> It came quick but when I opened it, it looked like someone already opened it because it had fingerprints on the palette. The shadows were untouched but I&#x27;m a little scared to use it. For the price, It&#x27;s great though.</li>
    <li> I have never been so happy with an eye shadow purchase!</li>
    <li> Horrible colors.  Ver dead and drab.</li>
    <li> Love this small pallet, colors are easily blended also good pigmentation to the colors on this pallet!  Love too faced products, and very happy to see these on amazon rather than having to order them on sephora.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my college age daughter, who probably read about this company in a fashion magazine.  However, the product was as described and she loves making her eyes look attractive and stand out with the colors offered in the palette.  I like the case that the colors are contained in!</li>
    <li> Not genuine. Knock-off. Chalky, low-pigmentation, not even the same colors as the actual Too Faced palette! Takes 12-15 brush swipes into the product to get ANY color to show up on the skin (with a primer). Not even exaggerating. Not only is this fake, it&#x27;s also worse than any drugstore eyeshadow I&#x27;ve ever used! Ever! Purchased this as a replacement for a Boudoir Eyes palette --shocked to see the colors weren&#x27;t even similar (oranges instead of champagne, brown instead of plum). Voulez-vous in the fake palette is just straight up brown. Not purple in the slightest. Not that it matters because it hardly shows up on the skin anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money. I should&#x27;ve just picked up another at Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the Too Faced eye shadows and shadow insurance.  Easy to apply and wears great all day long.  Beautiful muted colors.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this palette here... Sephora is discontinuing it and I&#x27;m ecstatic 😀😀😀😀</li>
    <li> The colors in this are absolutely perfect...not too deep or too light easy application and lasts quite a while too.</li>
    <li> First of all, I ordered it last week, and it came so quickly that my Amazon account still hasn&#x27;t caught up lol. Second, this palette is just gorgeous. The color lays on beautifully with little fallout. Even the packaging is adorable! I am very happy with this purchase and have definitely become a TooFaced fan!</li>
    <li> My daughter performs on stage a lot and has to really put on the make up.  She really seems to enjoy this trend of make up not just for when she is performing on stage, but also in her day to day.</li>
    <li> Wow do I love this set. Such pretty combinations. I mix and match almost every day. Worth it!</li>
    <li> This palette might just be my favorite too faced palette!! It is really beautiful!!</li>
    <li> LOVE. Bout time to buy another...</li>
    <li> This palette is natural, pretty and enhances the eyes. It&#x27;s my go-to for both day and night.  I have brown eyes and a medium complexion and I like to keep my makeup very simple. There are three &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34;: Day, Classic and Fashion - all very wearable. The names of the colors are fun too, i.e. Fuzzy Handcuffs, Garter Belt, Satin Sheets… ooh-la-la ….. you get the picture!  BTW I&#x27;m 59 so I think this palette can be worn at any age.</li>
    <li> Easy to use guide- beautiful colors. Not as purple as pictures show, more gray. Gorgeous on!!</li>
    <li> ILOVEIT!!! It has a beautiful look, and directions to do it correctly! My favorite eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I love this palette, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. This palette is great for a soft,  sexy look as the name implies.  But, it can also be used nicely for a sultry day look for those nice Sunday dates.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of returning.  I received and two of the eye shadows were broken.  Either the palette was old or the packaging was not sufficient.  I was very disappointed.  This would have been my second purchase of this palette...it is one of my all time favorites.  Please don&#x27;t let this review sway you from buying.  I think my package had a bad day.,</li>
    <li> Absoultey love this eye shadow pallete . I make me feel like a natural beauty queen.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye shadow palette from Too Faced! There is a little pamphlet inside that gives you three separate looks to do with the shadows depending on how you&#x27;re feeling -- which is really helpful if you&#x27;re not too good at doing your own eye make up or if you&#x27;re looking for a new look! The eye shadow goes on really well, but just like with most eye shadows, I would recommend using a primer before putting it on to make it last maximally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadow arrived on time and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with packaging or damage. I also read some reviews of their eye shadows being fake, and I did not have this experience. There were no strange colors, and it was exactly as I&#x27;ve seen it at Sephora and Ulta.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, they look great with my skin and almost any skin tone. You can use them at night or during the day. The only thing i don&#x27;t really like is the powder is loose and still falls down on your cheeks when applying it.</li>
