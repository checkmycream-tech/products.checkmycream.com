      <li>I love this HerStyler hair straightener.  </li>

      <li>and it comes in handy when I have to do a quick touch up and drop it in my overnight bag.</li>
      <li>We are talking perfectly straight and shiny hair that stands up to a good amount of humidity and lasts.  </li>
      <li>Product seems to build up on plates, although it is removed easily with a damp cloth.      </li>
      <li>, I was happy to be able to buy another one at such a fantastic price.  </li>
      <li>I saw this item at the mall and got a free demonstration.  </li>
      <li>Panteen light leave in conditioner spray to add moisture to my hair    </li>

      <li>Now, the light turns on when plugged it, but it doesn&#x27;t heat up.      </li>
      <li>Great flat iron!  </li>
      <li>This iron gets real hot</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product in the mall for $80.  </li>
      <li>Received the item this week and so far - love it!  </li>
      <li>I had orginally bought one in the mall for the full price</li>
      <li>I loved it, but i broke in my luggage on a recent trip.  </li>
      <li>I really loved the flat iron because it leaves your hair shiny and silky to the touch, but didn&#x27;t have the money to pay the whopping $100.00 price.</li>
      <li>Allows for quick straightening.  </li>
      <li>when I first started using this product it was getting very hot, now it dosen&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
      <li>HEats up super fast and heat remains consistent.  </li>
      <li>I came home and looked the item up online and found it here for a fraction of the price...same item, new and in the originally box.  </li>
      <li>I was upset at first because they broke, but I had to remember they were all ceramic.</li>
      <li>When my daughter found it on Amazon I was kicking myself for not checking Amazon first.</li>
      <li>It is identical in size (even though it states 1 inch), design and features to the Amica hair styler, but also has an on/off light and offers temperature control up to 210 C.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it lasts long, but I will be happy even if it only lasts a year since I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing one to replace this one for 30 bucks.</li>
      <li>I was extremely hesitant to spend that kind of money, so I walked away.    </li>
      <li>so when I would do it straight with my old cheap flatiron</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had mine long, but for 30 bucks, it works better than the pricer ones I have purchased.</li>
      <li>The salesman(a really cute young hairdresser with a million dollar smile) said I could have it for $100.00 that day only...</li>
      <li>but I certainly cant see any damage using this</li>
      <li>Next time, will buy a better, higher priced, reputable brand one that will last more than a year - or the warranty is at least usable.        </li>
      <li>it only took me 25 minutes, It feels so smooth and looks shinny</li>
      <li>I really do like this straightener.  </li>
      <li>It really makes your hair silky straight.  </li>
      <li>models (though I see some people did pay that much for this, oopse).    </li>
      <li>my HerStyler straightner makes is straight with no problem at all.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair, and have two daughters, one of them with very curly hair</li>
      <li>I t works really well on Afrian America hair textures.</li>
      <li>It was very well priced, as I am fugile and do not believe in buying any hair product over 60$.</li>
      <li>I totally recommend it to anyone specially the one&#x27;s that have hair like mine</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and super straight after using the HerStyler flat iron.</li>
      <li>In addition, I just happened to be in my local Big Lots store and,lo and behold, there was a Style Elements 1 inch hair styler available for $12.  </li>
      <li>I bought this flat iron to replace the one I have, which doesn&#x27;t thoroughly straighten my fine wavy hair during the humid Central Texas summer where I live.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s curly and VERY soft</li>
      <li>I purchased my first HerStyler several years ago at a mall and paid 4 times</li>
      <li>It got so hot and left crimp marks on my hair.  </li>
      <li>No more for me :)  </li>
      <li>Also, it came in quickly, just like the other items I&#x27;ve bought with Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am also in a transitioning stage, going from relaxed to natural hair.</li>
      <li>I recommend this flat iron to ANYONE who wants to save money going to the shop.  </li>
      <li>I had this straightener for more than a year when my boyfriend (who has short hair but still stole this all the time to do HIS hair) accidentally dropped it on a hard tile floor</li>
      <li>I found that mine was quite sturdy as I brought it everywhere with me in soft, carry-on luggage and was not very careful with it.  </li>
      <li>I then blow dry it straight   </li>
      <li>I mean I&#x27;m sure any heat technically damages hair</li>
      <li>I am African-American with thick coarse hard to straighten hair and this product straightens my hair great.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s naturally sandy blonde</li>

    <li> The Amika product appears to work well as a hair straightener and it does make my hair silky and shiny. I use a small amount of Argan oil as a hair protectant.  The oil is available at Sally Beauty Supply. I purchased the Amika hair styler from the HerStyler kiosk at the mall.   I would venture to guess that the Amika is identical to the HerStyler.  I was one of the people who got roped into paying $100 (suggested retail of $200) for the Amika styler.  I can only blame myself for not checking online as I usually do.  You should pay no more than $60 for the hair styler.  In addition, I just happened to be in my local Big Lots store and,lo and behold, there was a Style Elements 1 inch hair styler available for $12.  It is identical in size (even though it states 1 inch), design and features to the Amica hair styler, but also has an on/off light and offers temperature control up to 210 C.  Yes, I know that this is a review of a Her Styler product, but I would venture to guess that it is identical to the Amica product and almost identical to the considerably less expensive Style Elements ceramic hair styler which is a private label Big Lots product.  There is no warranty on the Style Elements hair styler, but with such a low price, who cares?</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I bought the flat iron at the mall for almost $100, when I saw it for $40 I was mad but oh well.    I have long curly hair so when I would do it straight with my old cheap flatiron it took me about 1 hour and it would smell all burnt and looked stiffed, with Herstyler it only took me 25 minutes, It feels so smooth and looks shinny and it don&#x27;t smell like my hair was on fire. This product is awesome I totally recommend it to anyone specially the one&#x27;s that have hair like mine (long, curly and frizzy)Now my hair looks beautiful!!!!!</li>
    <li> Most malls sell this product in a kiosk. You know, the guys and gals that yank you by the hair to encourage you to try the herstyler. For years I paid anywhere from 130-150 dollars for this straightener because my 2 girls and I love it and we all need our own. Now that I have been able to find it on Amazon for 30.00 bucks we can all have one. Thank God!!! Love it-always have! Works great and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this HerStyler hair straightener.  I have very curly hair, and have two daughters, one of them with very curly hair and we all agree this is the best hair straightener we&#x27;ve ever used.  I bought them one each for xmas and they both say it is the best present they received.  And the price!  Who can beat it?  I purchased my first HerStyler several years ago at a mall and paid 4 times what I paid on Amazon.  The ceramic plates chipped - but I must admit to dropping the thing regularly.  I never did bother to return it, I was happy to be able to buy another one at such a fantastic price.  This is a really good deal and a good product - don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
    <li> I really do like this straightener.  Its every thing I had hoped for.  Even the price.</li>
    <li> This straightner is wonderful.  I have very thick naturally curly hair and my HerStyler straightner makes is straight with no problem at all.  I only have to go over it once and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or damaged.  I have recommended this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace the one I have, which doesn&#x27;t thoroughly straighten my fine wavy hair during the humid Central Texas summer where I live. But the Herstyler flat iron works wonders! My bangs stay flat and frizz-free all day. I would recommend this product to anyone who battles frizzy hair. It provides a great smoothing effect.</li>
    <li> when I first started using this product it was getting very hot, now it dosen&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Herstyler almost every day for a few months now and have not had any chipping whatsoever. I love the ease of use... although I did have to get a few tips from my hairstylist in order to get it right. Written instructions honestly don&#x27;t do any good. If you want to be able to actually use these thing easily and make your hair look REALLY GREAT, ask your stylist for some tips! It makes all the difference in the world!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after the one I purchased at my local mall fell and the plates shattered. I was upset at first because they broke, but I had to remember they were all ceramic. I really loved the flat iron because it leaves your hair shiny and silky to the touch, but didn&#x27;t have the money to pay the whopping $100.00 price.I am a penny pincher so I was really impressed with it to shell out that much money. When my daughter found it on Amazon I was kicking myself for not checking Amazon first. I have had this product for quite a while now and it is still working great. It is being shared by three people in my household, so it is used on a daily basis. I am also in a transitioning stage, going from relaxed to natural hair. I am African-American with thick coarse hard to straighten hair and this product straightens my hair great. And the case is a definate plus, it is a heat protected case and I use it to protect my counter tops and it comes in handy when I have to do a quick touch up and drop it in my overnight bag.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron!  The same one was selling for $125.00 at a local mall.  The salesman(a really cute young hairdresser with a million dollar smile) said I could have it for $100.00 that day only...got it at amazon for $25.00 + $10.00 shipping!  I am soooooo pleased!</li>
    <li> The product is great and I have noticed less damage to my hair. My hair is soft and super straight after using the HerStyler flat iron.</li>
    <li> I recommend this flat iron to ANYONE who wants to save money going to the shop.  I&#x27;m an african american woman with german ancestry.  My hair is fairly long and when it&#x27;s wet it&#x27;s curly and VERY soft and it&#x27;s naturally sandy blonde (so it can get dry from time to time)- when I blow dry it, it gets fairly straight but with the flat iron I can curl AND straighten in 30min.  Sometimes 20min - but the thing that gets me is I lay on my hair at night and the next day it&#x27;s STILL nice!!!! - very bouncy and NO frizzies and no dryness - it leaves a nice sheen to my hair - all I do is spray a VERY VERY VERY light oil sheen to my hair to add a very nice sheen to it - EVERYONE thinks I go to the shop but I save about $110 a month - this is how I do my hair:   * I wash with Dove shampoo (after trying NUMEROUS shampoos and conditioners this brand works PERFECT with my hair leaving it SO SOFT)   * I condition with Dove shampoo and comb it thru with a big tooth comb and then rinse it out   * I use either Dove leave in conditioner spray OR Panteen light leave in conditioner spray to add moisture to my hair    * I then blow dry it straight   * Then my favorite part - I use my herstyler flat irons...My husband LOOOOOOVES the way I do my hair and I didn&#x27;t spend a heap of money at the salon. My girlfriend paid $120 for two of them but I got mines here on ebay for 1/2 that price...I LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> The plates bend when you curl your hair. I love this feature. This iron gets real hot so you can straighten your hair in half the time. I haven&#x27;t had mine long, but for 30 bucks, it works better than the pricer ones I have purchased. I don&#x27;t know if it lasts long, but I will be happy even if it only lasts a year since I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing one to replace this one for 30 bucks. I have curly frizy hair, length reaching my lower back and also very thick and can straighten my hair in about ten minutes... Awesome!</li>
    <li> The ceramic plates chipped within two weeks of purchasing this product.  There was no abuse to the product - it simply chipped when it was set down on the sink.  I have tried to email multiple times to get a new one, but no one at the company will get back to me.  This is the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> I love my Herstyler straightener!  I had orginally bought one in the mall for the full price but after time it broke.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford another one but you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon sale price!  Also, it came in quickly, just like the other items I&#x27;ve bought with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Below is the review from December 2008 - just over a year later, I am reposting my disappointment.  The heat has been going over the last two weeks - on Sunday, the iron made a loud pop/crackle noise, the plates went cold and the exterior casing heated up; too hot to touch.  Now, the light turns on when plugged it, but it doesn&#x27;t heat up.      Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  Next time, will buy a better, higher priced, reputable brand one that will last more than a year - or the warranty is at least usable.        DECEMBER 2008 Review:  Received the item this week and so far - love it!  Great price and seems to be a great quality product.  Came in a nice box and with a carrying sleeve.      The weight of the iron is heavier and the spring inside the iron seems to be of a good quality compared to others I have used out there.  Love the 1.5\\&quot; ceramic plate.  Allows for quick straightening.  HEats up super fast and heat remains consistent.  Plates allow for smooth pulling through hair. Product seems to build up on plates, although it is removed easily with a damp cloth.      Cord at base of unit swivels to decrease chance of breakage.      Really impressed with quality and price so far.</li>
    <li> I saw this item at the mall and got a free demonstration.  I loved what it did for my hair.  The salesperson was whispering that \\&quot;for today only I could purchase the product for only $119 instead of the $299 price on the box\\&quot; or a deposit would \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; that price for me and I could pick it up at anytime.  I was extremely hesitant to spend that kind of money, so I walked away.    I came home and looked the item up online and found it here for a fraction of the price...same item, new and in the originally box.  So I bought it.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I recommend it to anyone that has had a bad hair day!  No more for me :)  The purchase went smoothly and was at my door before I knew it.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I began use of it through a roommate then had to get one of my own. It was very well priced, as I am fugile and do not believe in buying any hair product over 60$. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair straighteners as I have very difficult hair and poor hair styling skills.  I am very lazy and dont like to have to do much to mess with my hair and am not good at it when I do try.    Performance &amp; Ease of Use:  This hair straighten works great for me.  I get salon results with very little time and effort.  We are talking perfectly straight and shiny hair that stands up to a good amount of humidity and lasts.  It doesnt damage my hair like other straighteners either.  I mean I&#x27;m sure any heat technically damages hair but I certainly cant see any damage using this and my hair actually feels and looks healthier.    This definitely works as well as the $100+ models (though I see some people did pay that much for this, oopse).    Durability:   I had this straightener for more than a year when my boyfriend (who has short hair but still stole this all the time to do HIS hair) accidentally dropped it on a hard tile floor and it cracked a little at the corner.  I found that mine was quite sturdy as I brought it everywhere with me in soft, carry-on luggage and was not very careful with it.  If it hadn&#x27;t fallen on the floor I&#x27;d still be using it over my more expensive CHI straightener.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product in the mall for $80.  I loved it, but i broke in my luggage on a recent trip.  I was desperate for a hair straightener, so I bought an expensive Chi...what a mistake!  It got so hot and left crimp marks on my hair.  I was so relieved when I found that Amazon sold this hair straightener.  It really makes your hair silky straight.  It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This item is the best.  I would recommend this flatiron to everyone.  I t works really well on Afrian America hair textures.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and it arrived in no time! I literally just finished using it and I was more than happy. Such a steal!</li>
