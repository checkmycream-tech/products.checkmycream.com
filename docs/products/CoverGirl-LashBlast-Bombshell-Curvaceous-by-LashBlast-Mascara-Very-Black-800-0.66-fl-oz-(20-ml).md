<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It clumps so easily which is not what I was looking for. It sticks on like glue as well which is alright in some cases but not when you&#x27;re trying to remove it. It is nearly impossible to remove from skin as well. I do not recommend if you&#x27;re looking for perfect lashes. This mascara makes a huge clumpy mess!</li>
    <li> I love that this mascara has 2 brushes to really elongate the lashes! My only problem is that it clumps a little more than I would wish. I&#x27;m not sure that it is worth the price that you are paying to get extra long lashes. Thanks #Influenster for my #SurfsUpVoxBox</li>
    <li> I got this free from Influenster in their SurfsUpVoxBox, I don&#x27;t normally wear make up, but I tried this and it applied clumpy and was hard to remove. Easy to apply and a cute little bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I got a free sample in my SurfsUp Vox Box from Influenster and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that this mascara was the one chosen! It works so well and my eyelashes are loving it. They look longer and plumper but without clumps! One of the best mascaras I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I received cover girl bombshell mascara from influenster to try and I love it. It for sure adds volume and some length and is all day wear. The only thing is it is extremely hard to remove. You must use the oil base eye makeup remeover to get it off. It seems like a water proof mascara but it doesn&#x27;t say that it is.</li>
    <li> I recently received this in my surfupvoxbox to try out and loved it!&lt;br /&gt;although the size of the tube itself is pretty big and not very travel friendly it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;It does an amazing job at lengthening and adding volume, and it does both in one tube! it works perfect just make sure you use an oil based makeup remover to take it off since it works like a water proof mascara.</li>
    <li> I give this CoverGirl Lashblast bombshell mascara 5 start because it it AMAZING!  it smells so good, lil coconut.  My lashes looked longer and it didn&#x27;t made lumps.  it also lasted all day. i will recommend this for summer hot days specially.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get sent one of these free from Influenster.com for product and review purposes, and I must say I love this mascara! I am blonde and live in California so the sun bleaches my eyelashes away to nothing. Mascara is a daily ritual for me but I often find that I am sensitive to some brands. Covergirl, which don&#x27;t test on animals, don&#x27;t seem to upset me at all which is awesome! My eyelashes looked huge after using this! And the coverage lasted absolutely all day, all evening too actually. In fact it was pretty difficult to get off! I don&#x27;t typically curl my eyelashes so using the double wand really showed me the difference that curling can make. I&#x27;m not likely to use one of those torture devices that you can buy but I can use this! Influenster tell you to provide an honest review and that&#x27;s really what this is, if I didn&#x27;t like it I would absolutely say so. Good job Covergirl!</li>
    <li> It is always hard to find a good mascara, and CoverGirl did not disappoint with the LashBlast Bombshell Curvaceous. This product made my eyelashes longer, fuller, and darker. It is a must have for all of your makeup needs. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara .that influester send me to tested.. it.made my eyelashes pop out..i have small eyelashes but this.made it to outstand..:).love it .amazing product</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara! I am always out there searching for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t look clumpy, lasts a long time and seems to extend my lashes. This has hit the mark in all 3 categories. I received it complimentary from Influenster for review purposes and am sooooooo glad I did! I will definitely be a customer in the future! #bombshelling #SurfsUpVoxBox</li>
    <li> I got this from influenster for testing purposes in my surfs up voxbox, and I am SO GLAD! It gives amazing volume, and I can wear it to the beach without having to worry about it running! I even tested it out the other day (; must try!</li>
    <li> There were a few things that I did not like about this product. The first was the wand is too short and so close to the handle that I couldn&#x27;t get the outer corner of my eyelashes without using my  non dominant hand. The second thing I did not like, It did not give my lashes look I usually go for. It looks like my mascara was almost non-existent. The third and final thing that I did not like about this mascara, it was extremely hard to remove.  I was annoyed by this because I usually stray away from waterproof mascara to avoid this. This is not a waterproof mascara but it was just as hard to remove.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample from Influenster the other day and I must say, I LOVE IT!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday and it looks amazing. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, as well.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Influenster Surfs Up Vox Box. After putting on step 1 I absolutely saw the curvy in my lashes and I like it. I went on to put on step 2 and I like the added volume from step 2. It is not at all sticky like some say. I would put up pics of comparison if there were a link. I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara from Influenster for free and I thought it was a pretty great product. It goes on easily and makes your lashes look a lot longer and fuller. The only downside to this product, I would say, is that it is more difficult to remove than it is to apply. I would use it again, though.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Influenster  Surfs Up Voxbox &amp; I was excited to try it out! Made my lashes longer &amp; fuller &amp; was really good on not clumping them together. I was nervous from the bad publicity I had heard about this product but I&#x27;ve use baby wipes to take this off before &amp; it came off with no problems &amp; didn&#x27;t rip any of my lashes before so I don&#x27;t see the problem!</li>
    <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster for testing purposes as part of their Surfs Up Vox Box. I&#x27;m not usually a fan of two step mascaras but this one made my lashes look amazing! If you&#x27;re willing to do a little extra work to take it off I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I have some of the straightest non curled lashes I have ever seen.  I have trouble finding a mascara that will both curl my lashes and leave them looking fuller than they are.  I have used Cover Girl products in the past and generally it is my mascara of choice.  After I received this one, I tried it out both using an eyelash curler and without.  I was amazed with the way the lashes curled even without the eyelash curler.  I have never found a mascara yet that would do that.  I also Loved the way the mascara made my lashes look fuller and thicker.  I will definitely be investing in this mascara in the future.  the only thing I really did not like was how wide the tube was.  I am used to smaller tubes and this one was a bit big.  But otherwise it is a great product!</li>
    <li> I received the Cover Girl Lash Blast Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara complimentary by influenster.  I am so pleased with the coverage of this mascara!  It is a little hard to get used to the larger size handle (I have small hands) but once I did, my lashes were full and for once a mascara that does NOT flake after a few hours of wear.  Honestly, this mascara will not off until you remove it....which in my opinion is a plus!!</li>
    <li> I revived this in a influenster voxbox. It&#x27;s really good mascara.  Made my lashes look thicker and longer.  Only thing is other is really hard to get off. Make sure you use an oil based makeup remover and it should be fine.</li>
    <li> I loved this cover girl mascara.  My lashes looked thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked how it does not clump.  It stayed on all day.</li>
    <li> I normally struggle to find a mascara that works on my eyelashes. Normally the mascara doesn&#x27;t stick well or fades during the day. The two-step process of bombshell curvaceous fixes these problems for me. My mascara stays after only one application. Definitely a fan of the thick lashes this mascara offers!</li>
    <li> This product is okay! I get the meaning of the step 1 and step 2 but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it does when I mix to other different mascaras. I like step 1 but not step 2, and formula is a little too wet for me. This mascara is really hard to take off as well. It ripped out a lot of my lashes. I am glad Influenster sent me this to review because I needed a mascaras but this is just not the right one!</li>
    <li> This mascara does miracles. I always had a challenged on getting my eye lashes to look longer however,  this mascara curls my eye lashes and it makes them grow. People always ask me if they&#x27;re fake or real yet i just tell them about this amazing mascara.!!</li>
    <li> i received this product free from influencer for testing purposes, i was so surprised!&lt;br /&gt;it goes on smooth and leaves eyelashes looking large and full.&lt;br /&gt;this mascara also doesn&#x27;t clump up or make the eyelashes look too spidery&lt;br /&gt;i love it! would recommend!</li>
    <li> I liked this mascara duo. The two step system of base and top coat felt nice on my eyes. Even though I have thick eyelashes, I liked that this product brought them out more. It didn&#x27;t curl my lashes per se, but it did gives them more volume and made them stand out more.</li>
    <li> As a huge fan of Lashblash already I was excited to see this in my Influenster kit which i received for review purposes to give my honest opinion. At first I was a little concerned and had a good chuckle on how fat the tube was and had to figure out how exactly I was going to put it on - but it was easier Then I thought and the results, amazing!! I got compliments all day!! Definitely a new fan and will buy!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a lovely indelible mascara, this is the one for you. It looks great, and it won&#x27;t come off even with the best of makeup removers. Enjoy your wear, because it will be there for a long time!</li>
    <li> My new go to mascara!!! Makes my eyelashes look full and beautiful</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary from influenster. I was very excited to try out this mascara as I have been using cover girl mascara for years. It worked ok, but I thought that the wands could be a little longer for easier use, and I had some problems with clumping but I just used my separating brush and that did the trick.</li>
    <li> I recieved a complimentary sample of this mascara from influenster in their SurfsUpVoxBox so that I could give feedback for it.  I really like this mascara and it is one of the better ones that I have tried.  of course, it is not the best and I think it would be better as a waterproof mascara.  The two different brushes really help my eyelashes look nice without having to have two different mascara wands.</li>
    <li> I received the Covergirl LashBlast Bombshell mascara for FREE in my Surfs Up Voxbox via Influenster. I was super excited to test this product! I am generally not a fan of Two step mascaras but was pleasantly surprised with this one. The first step gave my lashes some volume (without any clumps.) The second step provided a nice color and thickened up the lashes even more. After a full days wear I experienced no smudging or chipping. I am a huge fan of Covergirl products and I will be adding this one to my must have list!</li>
    <li> I got this mascara free in my voxbox from influenster.com and i love it! I will but this from now on.  It gives my lashes extra length and didn&#x27;t clump!  Great product</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this, im always on the look out for Mascara that will make my lashes fuller and longer and this definitely does the trick. I used the Volumize side first and off the bat i could tell a noticeable difference than how my lashes looked with other mascaras, but i wanted to see what else it could do, so i flipped it over and opened the intensify side. WOW!!! that pretty much sums it up, not only did my lashes look fuller and longer but it brightened up my eyes and made them POP. they stood out so much better than they had in the Past! i love this product and will be buying some soon as this runs out!</li>
    <li> I am a serious mascara snob and usually use at least 2 mascaras everytime I apply makeup..but.. this stuff is amazing. You only need the one tube and you&#x27;ll get long and voluminous lashes. It&#x27;s worth all $20!!! ** I received mine for free through Influenster** influenster.com :)</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary of Influenster for testing and review. I fell in love INSTANTLY! This mascara is far superior to the mascara I currently use.  Although the tube is a tad bulky, I have great confidence that it will last me longer than my typical mascara.  I like the 2 step application process too. When I wear this product, I feel like a true CoverGirl.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies to mascara so I have trouble finding one I can use I got this mascara from an influenster voxbox  I had a wedding to go to the next day I used this mascara and loved it it held up in the heat and sweat and the tears on top of that it did not irritate my eyes like most mascaras I love it and will continue to use bombshell volume mascara</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s the first one that made my dull eyelashes look good!! I would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I received it for free from Influenster in my Surfs Up Vox Box, and am delighted to share that I absolutely love it! It blows my last mascara out of the water. My eyelashes are not very full, but CoverGirl&#x27;s LashBlast Bombshell Curvaceous mascara makes my lashes darker, more full, and even longer. I didn&#x27;t actually expect this much of a difference at all. I love it and a big thanks to Influenster.com for sending it to me for free.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product makes my lashes look. Longer, darker, and more full almost like fake lashes. On the other hand I have not wore it in 4 days and used eye makeup remover to get it off and I still have clumps in my lashes that will not come out. I love the product just wish it removed better.</li>
    <li> I was a little on the fence with this product only because the volume mascara from the line did not really work for me at all. However I have to say that I like this one a lot better.</li>
    <li> Love the 2 wand system!  I have small eyes, with thin lashes, and I finally feel like you can actually see my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been travelling in the south, and even the hot, humid weather doesn&#x27;t cause this mascara to wear off.  I put it on in the early morning, and its still there at night.  Even after shedding a few tears, it stayed where it should, and did not run down my face.  I&#x27;m impressed!  Thanks to Influenster for sending it to me to review!</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT!!!!! I got this Covergirl Lashblast Bombshell Mascara Complimentary from  Influenster to try and review.... I loved it it stayed on all day and night didnt clamp up or flake up.... And didnt irritate my eyes..... I have to order more now.... i love stocking up on the make that i like.... got five starts from me!</li>
    <li> I received this product compliments of Influenster as a part of the surfsup vox box tester kit. I really linke cover girl mascaras so I was looking forward to trying it out. All I can say is ... meh. After completing steps one and two I expected almost false looking eye lashes. What i got was the same effect that I&#x27;ve gotten with other mascaras that do not tote volumizing promises. Lengthened? Check. Darkened? Check. Volumized? Eh, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have also been reports of women losing their lashes because if this product. It didn&#x27;t happen to me, but I always use a mineral oil based make up remover, something Cover Girl recommends to remove this product,  to remove eye makeup since I normally wear water proof mascara - I live in Hawaii and humidity &#x3D;  raccoon eyes off you don&#x27;t use a waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try the new Bomshell mascara. I don&#x27;t quite understand this product as it actually &amp;#34;flattened&amp;#34; my lashes after I had curled them and I need a longer brush to be able to get the corners of my eyes. Thanks for letting me try this out but this is not for me.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara for free through Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a double sided mascara before. I was happy with it, but didn&#x27;t see a HUGE difference between the Bombshell Curvaceous and my normal mascara.</li>
    <li> I recently recieved this test product from influenster and i am head over heels in love with this mascara!! It&#x27;s definitely my go to mascara and I even bought an extra one for my purse, just in case I lose one haha. Great quality!</li>
    <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing.  I LOVED how dark and bold it made my lashes.  Only thing I wasn&#x27;t excited about was that I felt like it un-curled my lashes a bit.  Overall I liked it though!!</li>
    <li> Love the lashblast! Easy to apply and stays on all day and all night. Love the non clumping formula that makes my lashes look long and curly! I received this in my #influenster #voxbox for testing and review and fell in love with It the first time I tried it! I would give 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to use an oil based product to take it off.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THAT IT GIVE MY LASHES THE FULLNESS , AND BRING MY EYES THE GOOD LOOK, And love the look into my eye&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> I really liked the lashblast bombshell I got in my surfs up voxbox. It was awesome almost no clumping and long last (actually hard to remove) my only complaint is my eye lashes felt like I sprayed them with hair spray but luckly that feeling doesn&#x27;t last long I would definitely buy!</li>
    <li> i actually really love this product! it makes my lashes look darker longer and fuller! i would recommend it to everyone it was my first time trying the product and i really did like how it made my lashes look!&lt;br /&gt;(complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes)</li>
    <li> Impossible to remove. I don&#x27;t use waterproof for that exact reason. Do not waste your money is you want to spend all night trying to remove makeup and it&#x27;s still on your lashes no matter what you do. Never again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I got a free sample in my SurfsUp Vox Box from Influenster and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that this mascara was the one chosen! It works so well and my eyelashes are loving it. They look longer and plumper but without clumps! One of the best mascaras I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I just received this as a complimentary product in my surfsupvoxbox from influenster and it is a fantastic product!  It&#x27;s also really hard to remove, but that makes it great for long wearing makeup I suppose.  Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love how big this mascara makes my lashes look. I already have long lashes but they go straight out and i usually end up looking like I have none at all, but this Mascara makes them curve up so you can see how pretty they truly are. The dark color contrasts my eyes and I am in love!</li>
    <li> I received this mascara in my influenster voxbox and I love it. My lashes look long and full without clumping and it comes off pretty easy. It is comparable to the MAC zoom fast black lash that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> I just went out and got my box of products sent by Influenster. I tryed the mascara and it&#x27;s actually better then all the others I have tried. It made my lashes look full and longer. That&#x27;s what I need! Looking forward to using this more often. Thanks Influenster!</li>
    <li> I Love it.  Very waterproof! !! Very black,  i got it free as a sample from influenster. New favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. It isn&#x27;t clumpy, and it makes my lashes look great.  Would definitely recommend.  I have tried many brands, and this is, by far, my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I got it for free from Influenster.com for review purposes and I was thrilled to get a mascara. Truly, this defined my lashes, and did not make them appear clumpy at all! I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product complimentary of influenster.This is a great product.I love that it doesnt clump up.It is very easy to apply.The brush is awesome I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the dual brush action here. I received this producer from influenster and it works wonders! It stays on very well</li>
    <li> I was really excited to be chosen to receive this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but unfortunately it is just AWFUL.  I used it for a week before throwing away the remainder.  It clumps horribly, especially the #2 side.  The applicator is large and awkward to use.  Worst of all, however, is the removal- it doesn&#x27;t come off!  Not with water.  Not with soap.  Not with makeup remover.  It just STICKS.  Those awful clumps in your lashes leave a disgusting, sticky, clumpy residue in your lashes that you can&#x27;t get rid of.  The worst is if you accidentally get a spot on the skin around your eyes- practically impossible to remove!  I have never, ever used a worse mascara- and I&#x27;ve tried a lot over the years.</li>
    <li> I recently recieved this test product from influenster and i must say I am Absolutely in love love love with this mascara!!!!! I am not a big fan of eyelash curlers and this product gives me the perfect look without using one. It&#x27;s definitely my go to mascara and I even bought an extra one for my purse as I am notorious for misplacing products I love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used mascara before and I found this easy to use. I was sent this product complimentary of Influenster.</li>
    <li> I received this compliments of Influenster. I love the fact that this mascara is buildable. I already have lashes that do just find without mascara. But this really makes them pop and I can make them really black. I will purchase this item when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from influenster for testing purposes, and have thoroughly tested it. It&#x27;s easy to use and produces a great result. I only suggest, from my own personal experience, that you don&#x27;t layer up too much on either step one or two or your lashes may clump together somewhat. After using it a few times I have a good routine down. It is hard to get off, so gently use an oil based cleanser. I like that it is hard to get off though, it stays in place excellently and don&#x27;t get any residual darkness under my eyes throughout the day as I have with other products. This product is worth the buy, I will be purchasing it when the time comes to get more!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It made my eyelashes pop! This Mascara didn&#x27;t flake either, it stayed on my eyelashes all day, I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> This was just truly awesome and ACTUALLY made a difference which is hard to find in mascara. Usually I have to apply 2 to 3 different types of mascara and just this one was enough</li>
    <li> The dual wand situation is not very ergonomical, which makes using this mascara difficult. Also, like some others have said, it is quite wet and is a hassle to wait for it to dry before properly opening or closing your eyes. Further, it doesn&#x27;t create a &amp;#34;perfect look&amp;#34; to combat these downsides. Finally, it is difficult to remove, despite being easy to put on improperly. Not a winning mascara, but a good idea, nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I love this Covergirl maraca!! It makes your eyelashes longer and it last longer. I guarantee this maraca is worth buying!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complimentary  from Influenster for testing  purposes  and I must say I am in love its lasted all day and night and never has it got clumpy since I began using it thank you cover girl awesome job!!!</li>
    <li> i wish i had recieved this test product from influenster. i didn&#x27;t so i went out a bought it myself. i must say I absolutely love this mascara!! this now officially my go to mascara!</li>
