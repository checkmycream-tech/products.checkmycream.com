      <li>Although it does kind of turn your hands brown-ish.</li>

      <li>nice product you should try it</li>
      <li>came in a timely manner and was packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice smell that I think is fine for either a guy or girl.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy with this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Not only did I get an incredible even tan this summer, but my tattoos looked great and were not damaged and didnt fade.  </li>
      <li>Downside is that it doesn&#x27;t smell super great</li>

      <li>the results after tanning are great as well, you will be a shade darker first time using it.</li>
      <li>From all the positive reviews, I thought this would be a great bronzing lotion.</li>
      <li>Just make sure u rub lotion all the way into ur skin because it is a 90xx bronzer...</li>

    <li> Love it - I put it with the Baby Black and get good color.  Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> the best tanning bronzer ever</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion out there!!! I have been using it off and on for years and I won&#x27;t use any others!!</li>
    <li> this works great! it&#x27;s gives you an awesome color right away and you will notice a good change to your tattoos but don&#x27;t really on wipes to clean your hands. gurmX and then wipe works perfect</li>
    <li> I go to the tanning bed once a year before any big beach trips so I get my &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; done with at home and can enjoy hours and hours of being on the beach. I never used tanning lotion before, but I had tattoos now. Tattoo protection lotion was recommended to me by a friend so I decided to come on Amazon and check some out.&lt;br /&gt;I workout before I tan, so I never liked the ones that made you feel hot. This one does not do that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still unsure if the tattoo protection part is just a gimmick, or if it&#x27;s proven it works. I can&#x27;t really tell to tell you the truth.</li>
    <li> Just started tanning again use to go all the time used different lotions took  me forever to get tan ....I have fair skin easily burned ... This product is great  noticed color first time I used it really does get you dark ...smell unisex not fruity but I could careless of smell color great ....used sample deft will be getting the bottle</li>
    <li> This ed hardy has to be the best bronzer i have ever used..If u want a dark tan quick this lotion is it..After first use i could definitely tell i was darker...Just make sure u rub lotion all the way into ur skin because it is a 90xx bronzer...</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned with tattoos so I have a hard time tanning with out burning plus I worry about my tattoos fading when I do work on getting tan. I have been trying for a long time now to find a lotion that worked for me.  I won&#x27;t EVER look for another lotion again! I saw results after the first use and then each time after that I see a difference.  I recommend this to everyone who needs that little extra bronzing help but also doesn&#x27;t want that added worry of loosing vibrant tattoo color!</li>
    <li> For me,  it&#x27;s been the darkest of the Ed Hardy lotions!</li>
    <li> Best one year. You get super dark really quick.</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected. I will order this again. MUST BUY for tanning. Smelled great and went on smooth. Cool</li>
    <li> I just received this tanning lotion and i was VERY disappointed.  The only thing i liked about it was the smell.  The label looked like it was made from a knockoff brand. I guess you pay for what you get applies in this case. I didnt even get hot using this.  I had better results from a 16.00 no name brand i bought from the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I love the color I get from this lotion. I was DARK! I hate the smell of bronzing lotions. You are supposed to keep them on longer so they can sink into your skin. It was a bit hard for me but the results I got was well worth it. I know use it in combination with my Ed Hardy Coconut Kisses.</li>
    <li> Quick dark tan and when applied daily helps maintain tan.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and the girl at the tanning salon recommended this lotion to me. I saw a difference from the first visit! Everyone was commenting on how tan I looked. I have never tanned this fast and got this dark before! I thought I was going to have to go a million times to the tanning bed like I usually do to get tan but not now! I am definitely buying a bottle! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have been somewhat disappointed in this product so far. I have to use gloves to apply it or else it stains my hands. It does seem to work well so far as a tattoo fade protector but I don&#x27;t seem to be tanning as fast as I did in the same amount of time using my other product which is far less pricey. I would not recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> The only way I can describe this product&#x27;s ability to protect all of my ink is to say that I swear, my colors are more bold now after multiple uses!!!  My skin gets a nice dark tan with the bronzers and all of my tattoos seem to pop much more than other lotions I have tried that claim to protect tattoos. I highly recommend this product to all of my inked friends who tan!!  I&#x27;ve even mentioned it to my salon and suggested they look into carrying it.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> not a huge fan, it stains your skin</li>
    <li> I did see some color later from this. However, it was really dry when I put it on and left brown &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; everywhere.</li>
    <li> I just got this lotion and have only used it twice, but so far it&#x27;s given me great color. I used to work at a tanning salon and have tried tons of lotions. This one is by far one of my favorites. It has a very nice smell that I think is fine for either a guy or girl.  I mostly got this for the tattoo fade protection. I can&#x27;t really comment on that yet since I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but so far I really like it. No complaints here! I think I found my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Didnt see results like the Dark Tanning Lotion</li>
    <li> Bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed, only wrapped in saran wrap. Seemed shady. Seems to work OK but not $30 kinda OK.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent bronzer.  No tingle and it does not get hot.  Smells nice before and after tanning.  This lotion does not have any after tan odor.  It is very moisturizing and get me super dark.  I highly recommend this one if you want to get dark!  This is in my rotation at all times.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff , I&#x27;m always worried to order lotions online from all the bad things I&#x27;ve heard . So in order to make sure I don&#x27;t get fake lotions I buy  a small packet from the salon or distributor and then compare color, texture, smell ect along with the bottle I ordered . If it doesn&#x27;t match up I return it . This is the real deal . At first I didn&#x27;t think it was it seemed watery and other reviewers said it was loaded with bronzer that stains and leaves you streaky . Well I didn&#x27;t have these problems  and I just rub it on real quick and go and I&#x27;ve never had steaks my hands do stain a bit but not much at all . If you order I would order from &amp;#34; salon supplies &amp;#34; I got my legit bottle from them . I&#x27;m white white white and my legs tan like crap but after one use I have great color the smell is MEH but I shower soon after anyways . I will keep buying this lotion.</li>
    <li> Nothing at all to like about it.  I see no difference when I use it.  Not worth the money.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d take this if someone offered it to me free.</li>
    <li> I WORK AT A TANNING SALON. I HAVE VERY FAIR SKIN AND HAD BEEN TANNING FOR ABOUT A MONTH. NO ONE EVER COMMENT ON MY TANNING RESULTS UNTIL I USED A SAMPLE OF BLACK ELIXIR, ITS AWESOME THE NEXT DAY PEOPLE STARTED COMMENTING ON HOW DARK I WAS GETTING,AND HOW FAST I GOT DARK..LOL NOT KNOWING I HAD BEEN TANNING USING OTHER LOTIONS FOR A MONTH. THIS IS A MUST HAVE..</li>
    <li> TURNS COLOR FIRST USE. I MAKE SURE I RUB IN REALLY WELL AROUND HANDS AND ANKLES. ONLY DUE TO BRONZER AND I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH BLOTCHING.</li>
    <li> Dont use until you have a tan, the bronzer will streak.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner and go 5-6 times a week. I thought I had reached my peak and wasn&#x27;t getting any darker. My salon has a guarantee where you can try each lotion up to 3 times, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, exchange it. I went through that with 4 different lotions, ranging from $55-$85 all with disappointment. I was just tired of paying that all together, being that I go through a bottle in less than a month. There are so many different lotions to pick from on here so I just focused on something with a good review. I received this superrrrrrr fast and without regret. I&#x27;ve used it twice and i already see a difference. It did not stain my hands and is a rich, thick, dark lotion. I will most definitely purchase again :)</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion. In has some self-tanner in it so you have to wash your hands after application. Other than that I have gotten a very natural dark color. I get a brown NOT orange color. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Gives a golden looking tan just a touch of orange but the orange fades after about an hour or so great tattoo safer though. Keeps skin silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> The tanning lotion itself is GREAT! Super dark, works wonders. But when I received my purchase the whole lid was broken.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion. The bronzer works very well. It has definitely saved her tattoos when she tans in a tanning bed!</li>
    <li> Love the bronzer in this product. Will be purchasing more of this soon. I usually don&#x27;t like bronzer, but this product has changed my mind.</li>
    <li> This is really a great lotion, I&#x27;m happy with this price as well!! Shipped before I was expecting it which is always nice too! Very happy</li>
    <li> Ordered this For a gift</li>
    <li> Would give 5 stars but only negative review is that this lotion stains your palm of hands and nails. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it and it works great with my Tats</li>
    <li> Much cheaper that the salon, same quality.</li>
    <li> i love this product it is the best i have used so far, it smells good, your skin feels good, tats don,t fade:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of tanning lotions and this one has given me such a nice golden bronzed color it&#x27;s crazy! And best of all it doesn&#x27;t wash the color away when you shower! I was previously using millennium lotions and I thought they were good but as I used them more I became orange! After just 1 lay using this lotion all the orange was gone and now two weeks later of laying everyday I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; I am! This lotion is amazing and ill order many more bottles! I read reviews about how you&#x27;ll stink after tanning using this and I haven&#x27;t noticed any of that so I think it really depends on the person using it. It has such a nice light fragrance. Seriously buy this if you want the best golden brown tan!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bronzer! Doesn&#x27;t turn Orange but gives you a great tan! Works great with indoor tanning beds!</li>
    <li> Product did not have seal on bottle and was wrapped in plastic wrap!!!! Scent and application of product is different then when ordered from actual direct site</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a great price and it arrived fast. From all the positive reviews, I thought this would be a great bronzing lotion. However, I&#x27;ve used it for several months, and although I do have a tan, I really don&#x27;t find anything great about this particular lotion at all. I mean, let&#x27;s be honest...it&#x27;s Ed Hardy. Ed Hardy should not be making &amp; selling tanning lotions....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for a few hours after you go tanning (&amp; when you use this lotion), the smell is pretty horrible. I usually don&#x27;t mind the after-smell of tanning/tanning lotions, but this smell was so bad I wanted to shower, and then shower again.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t, however, have any problems with it staining my hands, clothes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Just wash your hands after you tan...that goes for any bronzing lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It smells wonderful - not to strong or perfumey and has tattoo protection that i need.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of tanning lotions and I mean a lot of tanning lotions and this is the first one to make me dark very fast. I find that I dont need to go tanning as often and it last a decently long time. Downside is that it doesn&#x27;t smell super great but I usually shower a few hours after I shower anyways. Otherwise I recommend this product to anyone that doesn&#x27;t tan easily or someone that just wants to get a more intense tan.</li>
    <li> this tanning lotion is by far the best I have ever used. It makes you soo dark. The bronzers are strong too. I love this lotion. Im out but ill be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly pleased with this indoor tanning lotion. I actually ordered it by accident not realizing it was for those who where tattoos. I don&#x27;t have tattoos but it is still an excellent bronzing lotion. I really like it and will order it again. Some may not like it because it is pretty dark.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever used, &amp; I have spent tons of money on lotions in the past. But ever since I tried this product I&#x27;ve never bought anything else. I definitely recommend this tanning lotion to anyone looking for a great bronzer. And I recommend ordering it from this company cause the product is at a great price &amp; not fake like so many other company&#x27;s who sell tanning lotions online. So thank you for a great &amp; affordable tanning lotion :)</li>
    <li> No smell, worked fast but my tan rubs off like the lotion didnt help it absorb deep into my skin for a lasting tan.</li>
    <li> Product works wonderful. Well worth the money. No streaking or orange color. Also made my skin feel so moisturized. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Would have told how it works, takes some time. Several more times to wait after color shows up. Will catch up then.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this brand</li>
    <li> I burn and get red. This allowed me to turn brown and it lasted longer then other lotions. Goes on smooth not greasy. Smells good too. Definitely worth it if you burn or do not tan well. ( Indoor tanning )</li>
    <li> Was a very good lotion</li>
    <li> I heard rave reviews about this tanning lotion so I bought it...it is everything I heard about it and more. The smell is amazing and stays with you, you don&#x27;t have that after tanning smell. It&#x27;s a thick lotion and it spreads evenly. It has bronzers in it, which I love and didn&#x27;t give the orange look that some bronzers do. I was very happy with this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gets you very dark very quickly. Smells good and doesn&#x27;t get all streaky. Although it does kind of turn your hands brown-ish.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome bronzer. You can&#x27;t get darker than this. My goddess of my tanning salon recommended it and I walked out of the bed dark. Seen the difference.</li>
    <li> This lotion looks like mud. If you want to get deep dark tan, this is it. Smells okay too. I previously used Amazon best seller, Paint It Black, I&#x27;m probably twice as dark with same amount of tanning.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good tanning product. The husband and I are prepping our skin for a trip to Mexico and have been tanning to try and avoid burning too badly when we go. This was recommended to me and I&#x27;ve only used one other good tanning lotion so I can&#x27;t say that I have much to compare it to. I can say with the other product I used my skin was getting pretty dry but still tanning nicely. When I started using this product though, my skin wasn&#x27;t as seeming as dry, and I have great color going. I do have to say I hate the smell after you&#x27;ve tanned with it. The smell going on before tanning is fine, but whatever happens after the time in the tanning bed, it has &amp;#34;activated&amp;#34; maybe and it smells pretty yuck.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a good smell and doesn&#x27;t have a weird after smell after you have tanned when using it. The fragrance is also not super girly or feminine smelling, making it a great lotion for guys too! It also gives you really great color that you start to notice after the first time or two that you start using it, it gives a natural looking golden tan. I love this lotion!</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t tan super easily, but this product helped me tan very quickly!  As w/most bronzing agents, it has a bit of a funky smell after tanning, but I would still highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and it apperars to have made a differance on her tan. nice product you should try it</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion just because I was bored with my other lotions. I have a pretty decent collection and I like to switch up which I use.  With one use I noticed MAJOR color with NO ORANGE or unevenness. I paid a lot more in the salon but even that price is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Finally I had a chance to try this product and I was amaze, I was under the sun for 40 minutes, and I saw the difference in this short of time; I live in Arizona and the weather on that day was 103 so I couldn&#x27;t stay any longer! but I&#x27;m very happy with the results. Thanks for the seller, I received my product in a very short time and in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how fast this lotion worked, I looked a lot darker in just 2 tanning sessions, the only reason why I gave this product 4 stars is because of the smell, not very pleasant and it does give you a burnt smell after you tan....but other than that it works great!! :)</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it seems to work well, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so dark because it can come off on your clothes if you don&#x27;t let it fully absorb into your skin first..</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes you super dark!!! Just make sure to apply evenly or it will leave spots.</li>
    <li> great deal! came in a timely manner and was packaged nicely. Smells great! the smell is light sandalwood scent, it is a very mutual smell men or woman would be happy with it. I will say though after tanning the bronzer in this lotion makes you pretty smelly--I mean quite a few bronzers have this issue so if you don&#x27;t mind that factor its great! the results after tanning are great as well, you will be a shade darker first time using it. it didn&#x27;t leave the palm of my hands or in between my fingers or toes orange at all- I just made sure to wipe my hands on a towel after applying...after tanning I would wash them as well....</li>
    <li> Nice!  My wife loves to tan and has used serveral different tanning oils, this one was also a great tanning oil to use.</li>
    <li> I have used alot of lotions and this is the best one so far! Doesnt leave a bad smell or feeling nasty !</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love this! It was a gift to him and I worried about the fragrance of it but was thrilled to find that it was pleasant for both of us to use and didn&#x27;t have that bad after tanning scent.</li>
    <li> Need to rub in well or leaves dark stains where clumps were left. Even putting it on your skin and leaving it there for a couple seconds it will start to stain your skin. Smell is alright, but will get you a good looking tan!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I like my bronzers DARK. Most of them out there are just too light for me. Black Elixir is loaded with DHA, so if you do not have a decent base tan I wouldn&#x27;t use this. I also wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week. I get about the same results with Black Elixir as I do when I get a medium spray tan. Black Elixir makes me a deep brown color, never orange or streaky. Don&#x27;t apply it at the salon unless you have something to wash your hands with, or they will stain. I put it on at home, wash my hands immediately afterwards, and head to the salon. Smell is not as important to me as color results, but this lotion smells pretty good. However, since it does have a lot of DHA, about six hours after tanning, you are going to REEK of it. This is the best extreme bronzer I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t give me the orangies.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have tried lots of different lotions and none of the&lt;br /&gt;Compare to this one! Love it and yes I&#x27;m planning on ordering more after I write this review!</li>
    <li> I just started using this lotion and it really works well for me. I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions in the past, including several expensive ones. Black elixir made me darker than any other lotion. I originally bought it for the tattoo protection, which seems to be working as promised. It smells great and definitely boosts your tan! It&#x27;s a little thick to rub in, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer. Never stains my hands. Gives me a great tan. I have been using this tanning lotions for a out a year. Great for outdoor use as well.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and keeps your skin silky</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! smells great and works great too!!!! Gives you a great tan in a little time. I would only reccommend it for dark complected skin.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this lotion is designed for people that already have a base tan going. If you are just starting back tanning after a long period of time or completly new at tanning I advise you start with something a little less strong. Before using this lotion I had a pretty decent tan going and after 4-6 days of using this lotion I could tell a big difference.(Of course everyone is different so the results may vary.) My tan went from decent to dark! I also love the fact that this lotion has a tattoo fade protection to it. I have four tattoo&#x27;s and this helps to keep them from fading as fast. I totally love this lotion and I recommend it to people! Buying it from Amazon is usually way cheaper than any salon or store as well. This was totally worth buying!</li>
    <li> This is a very dark lotion.  Smells really good and feels nice on, but sort of gave me an orange color after i used a few times.</li>
    <li> My brother in law introduced me to this lotion and I love it! It&#x27;s not available locally, so I ordered through amazon and it&#x27;s perfect! Great bronzing, keeps my tattoos from fading and my tan is long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is a good product it shipped fast and seems to work with my tats very well. I have not noticed any fading. they are still bright</li>
    <li> I was out to find a lotion that would get me really dark,and I have heard good reviews about ed hardy lotions, so I thought I would try some. I noticed I was darker the first time I tried it. I tried it a few more times &amp; I am really dark. I have a nice golden brown snooki tan that I was trying to achieve. I would definitely recommend this lotion &amp; buy it again. If you want to look like you just got back from Florida I would definitely buy this lotion.I am dying to try ed hardy body shots next.</li>
    <li> Just remember it does have a bronzer and will stain your hands just a little. Only issue is the lids of these products. This one as well as another that I purchased prior from this manufacture, I have found has a lid issue. That is, the lid has broken on both of my bottles very easily. Doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it, just have to be careful how I carry it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I have used.  Will purchase again.  Very thick and dosnt leave you feeling greasy allows you to tan to a deeper tan</li>
    <li> Feels great, does exactly what it says without feeling heavy. Darken alot faster. Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> Meh.. seems a bit fake</li>
    <li> I know everyones opinions vary depending on what your needs are. I am giving this lotion a 5 star review because, it worked beyond great for me. I am very fair skinned and I needed something with DHA in it that didn&#x27;t give the appearance of a Dorito overdose lol this works great, awesome coloring..lots of compliments, I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone :)</li>
    <li> I had a friend recommend this lotion to me.  Sells at salons for $50-$60, I got it for $25.  First thing I noticed, it smells great!  You come out smelling like you have perfume on, not tanning lotion.  Next, it soaks into the skin and I don&#x27;t feel slimy after tanning.  And it helps protect tattoos.  I have 6 of them so that was really my selling point on this one.  I get a nice bronze tan too.  Very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> I do like this lotion, I noticed I was darker the first time I used it but as I continued to use it 4, 5 times a week I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t necessarily getting darker, it was getting kind of an orange tint to it. You really have to apply a lot and rub it in REALLY good to make it not streak and get color. It also has DHA in it which creates an orange tint and streaks if it&#x27;s not rubbed in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like Ed Hardy lotions, just this one I&#x27;m not in love with,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the seller, super fast shipping! Was very happy with the seller.</li>
    <li> used it for 1 week didnt notice any color actually lost color i dont recommend this product jwoww has the best bronzing lotion</li>
    <li> Smells really good and provides great results in the tanning bed with no streaking.  Would be good on fair skin as long as it is evenly coated.  I have extremely fair skin and was able to use this lotion as well as my boyfriend who has more of an olive skin tone.  Great results on both.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and works really good!</li>
    <li> Noticed no difference in my tan with this vs that European something named brand that I bought from walmart for $6. Won&#x27;t purchase again since the results were the same for more money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times. Results do vary depending on skin type. I did see some reasonable results.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product, I became at least two shades darker and the color stays longer than most bronzers! Now I can not find another lotion out there that can exceed my expectations that this lotion established!</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product !!  Not only did I get an incredible even tan this summer, but my tattoos looked great and were not damaged and didnt fade.  I will never go back to using anything else.  My tan not only looked great , but my skin remained soft and moisturized !!!</li>
    <li> This gets you way darker than most tanning lotions because of the high level of DHA. Make sure you wash your hands after applying and completely rub it in all the way! Otherwise you will be left with oddly dark palms and streaks. But love the product and now I can wait longer between sessions.</li>
    <li> If you like bronzers and want dark color quick go with this! I havea  lot of tattoos and couldnt see a difference in them, however the bronzers will actually give you a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tan that lasts for days as well as help you tan quickly. LOVE THIS! I was pasty pasty white and this still looked awesome on me.</li>
    <li> The lotion is super thick, stays on until you are ready to wash it off. The smell is great, even after tanning, there is no burnt smell. Got super dark using this product.</li>
