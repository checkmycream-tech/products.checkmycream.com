      <li>These earring backs are amazing.  </li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>These are amazing.</li>
      <li>They work best on earrings with a straight post, but I have used them on hook earrings too.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I did not think I would like these.  </li>
      <li>they held my studs nicely, but no locking feature.</li>
      <li>but they really do the job great!</li>
      <li>It is so nice to wear quality earrings with no worry of losing one.</li>
      <li>have not had any issues with them catching on clothing or towels.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re effective at locking earrings</li>
      <li>I am happy about Amazon&#x27;s policy and I received a full refund and will look for some earring backs that don&#x27;t break after a week</li>
      <li>I am so happy that I found something to secure my favorite diamond earrings</li>
      <li>Great product, super hold for earrings you don&#x27;t want damaged</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t come off even if you try to force them, yet very easy to remove when desired.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love it, in fact I&#x27;ll be getting more for gifts!</li>

      <li>These backs are phenomenal.</li>
      <li>If I had received them perhaps they would have met my expectations however it&#x27;s been more than a month</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad for the invention...</li>
      <li>They are much more affordable than taking your earring to the jeweler to be fitted with screwbacks or Lapossette backs.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the silver backs and am so in love with them.</li>
      <li>They have the advantage of being able to be used on all your earrings.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they must work for some people.  </li>
      <li>Glad I found this.  </li>
      <li>what more can I ask for.</li>
      <li>Love these.  </li>
      <li>It works for it&#x27;s purpose and comfortable to the ear, i&#x27;m happy that it is hypoallergen, but Aesthetically doesn&#x27;t really look nice.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have found these a while back, they are the best!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>My diamonds are safe and secure!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My mother left me her diamond earrings and I have been afraid to wear them thinking I might loose one.  Purchased these earring backs in the hope that they would be just what I needed.  The backs worked wonderfully - stayed in place until I removed them with a little pinch!  So glad I found them!</li>
    <li> These are great!  I have lost two diamond earrings now and I wish I had known about these before.  They are easy to get on and off.  I&#x27;ve had my earrings get caught on my clothing but the backs don&#x27;t get pulled off.</li>
    <li> These work very well. I was on the verge of losing a pair of diamond studs several times because the backs were loose. Since I&#x27;ve been using these, they have stayed on perfectly. I don&#x27;t agree with the reviews that say they are hard to use. I find them very simple.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good quality product! Haven&#x27;t had an earring fall out at all and I am VERY active - surfing in the ocean, cycling 50 miles, running marathons, etc. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> Easy to use; doubtful you&#x27;ll ever lose an earring again!</li>
    <li> love them, easy to use and good feeling of more security.  Slight problem in that they didn&#x27;t fit few sets of ear rings.</li>
    <li> I usually lose post earrings in no time. I have had these in for a week and I love them. They do feel kinda cheap but definitely do the job. I got 2 silver backs but I don&#x27;t see why it would really matter considering they are mostly white plastic. I have actually started wearing earrings daily again.</li>
    <li> Love these earring backs.  Easier to use that I even expected.  Am glad there were two sets and am thinking of ordering some additional sets.  I had originally thought I&#x27;d only use them for my expensive or sentimental sets, but I&#x27;d like these for all my earrings.</li>
    <li> These are awesome they really work! I use them on my diamond posts earrings and no more worries! Do practice putting them on earrings before putting them in your ear. Once you get the mechanics it is soooo easy to take them on and off!</li>
    <li> Good price and great item.  They work very well!!!</li>
    <li> They worked as stated and  locked and held. However, they are so tiny and difficult to remove I had to have help and I started to get scared.</li>
    <li> These do stay on, and they make me feel confident I won&#x27;t lose my earrings. I am glad I made the purchase and would definitely buy again if I should need them.</li>
    <li> A product that does what it is supposed  to do! I bought a set and was so impressed that I bought them for my little granddaughters.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Where have these been all my life?! Love them!</li>
    <li> Love these!  Never going back to normal earring backs ever again! I&#x27;m can rest assured I will never lose an earring out of my ear.</li>
    <li> I was really on the fence about buying these, there was only one picture to view and it looked like something out of the 80&#x27;s. They shipped quickly and they were really easy to use. They don&#x27;t look pretty but they really do the job great! I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with these.</li>
    <li> They stay on I had a hard time getting them off my fingers are numb but your will not loose earrings wearing them I have lost so  many will order more</li>
    <li> They work great. Won&#x27;t come off even if you try to force them, yet very easy to remove when desired.</li>
    <li> Got these as replacement backs for my diamond studs I leave in all the time.  They work well most of the time, but I do have one side that slips with very little pressure needed on the lever.  When they are working though, nothing will make them fall off!</li>
    <li> Broke on the first use!  Difficult to release the lock to remove the earring.</li>
    <li> Not as I hoped.  Very cheap</li>
    <li> Best earring backs I have ever used</li>
    <li> A product that works.  I am wearing earrings that have been in my jewelry box for years.  I am not afraid of loosing them.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my niece who had just lost one her diamond stud earrings.  She said she loves them! Gave the other pair to her daughters. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great concept; poor execution.  Expensive, but cheap. Due to item&#x27;s size it&#x27;s difficult to manipulate the mechanism. One should not have to &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; handling an item before its actual use.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> These are very nice!! So glad that I won&#x27;t lose my earrings again!! Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Product was as described. My daughter and I now have no worries about losing our earrings due to loose backs.</li>
    <li> They only work somewhat if they are really painfully tight</li>
    <li> Missing parts! Only came with 3 backs instead of 4! Not happy.</li>
    <li> My earrings have not come out!!</li>
    <li> These are just great!  Wish I&#x27;d found these ages ago. I have had no problem putting them on or taking off, nor has my long hair gotten caught in them. I&#x27;m in my 60s and have chubby fingers and have not had any difficulty like some other reviewers have said. I just wish they came in a small box that I could easily store them in. They are similar in size to other earring backs, and I want these to be in a separate place. Thank goodness they are white on the part that goes against the ear. That helps me find them more quickly. I have some ideas about using a very small plastic container that I used to have...if I can just find it :)</li>
    <li> After using them for a week, one now is not working so they are useless to me.  I am happy about Amazon&#x27;s policy and I received a full refund and will look for some earring backs that don&#x27;t break after a week</li>
    <li> This product is a good idea but needs to have little &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; or larger ends to push on to open them.  Hard for older people to get them off.  Had to use small pliers.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my toddler that kept taking her out her earrings.  It&#x27;s been several months, and we haven&#x27;t lost another earring!</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. While they have been very good after practicing to use them before putting on earrings with them i had a  terrible experience. I used them with very expensive earrings. I had to give them a bit of a greater push to get on. when i wanted to take off my earrings, i could not. my husband could not either. i had to go to sleep with them, hoping that i would not need an operation to remove them from my ears. at that point if getting them out meant ruining my earrings, it would have been fine--i just wanted them out. i needed a physician&#x27;s assistant to remove them with a special instrument!</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased theses earring backs.  Hopefully, I won&#x27;t lose my new diamond earrings.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, great product.  thanks</li>
    <li> Super secure locking earring backs! I can finally wear some earrings that the back was coming off of. Now I can wear them with confidence since I have the Lox backs. The backs are easy to use and well worth the price. I plan on purchasing more. The picture isn&#x27;t as clear as I&#x27;d hoped for but it still gives you an idea of what it looks like.</li>
    <li> Wife loves them..,and surprise, surprise, hasn&#x27;t lost an earring to the on/off of a motorcycle helmet or a hair brush malfunction!</li>
    <li> I have a pair of David Yurman earrings that came with poor quality backs so that I was always catching an earring in clothing - I finally stopped wearing them.  These earring backs lock in place and stay.  They do what they say.  Yes, you have to learn how to work them, but that takes all of 2 minutes and a couple of trial runs with the earring in hand.  No brainer!  I have a pair of pearl and diamond earrings that came with a very sophisticated back that locks and stays put - quite expensive.  These are EQUALLY as good as my expensive earrings backs.  Also, they are comfortable.  I wore them all day and slept in them too.  No discomfort at all.</li>
    <li> I received a silver tone pair of these from an aunt. They took some getting used to, but now I&#x27;m quite pleased with them and need to buy myself a few more pairs. They are simple to use. Just put on your earrings and slip the stopper on like any ordinary earring stopper. To take them off, you just squeeze &amp; hold the metal &amp; plastic tabs together. The metal tab will slide towards the plastic one and the stopper will easily slip off the earring. I have been using mine for a couple months. They are still holding strong, they have not tarnished. I am pretty confident that I will not lose my earrings with these. Wish I had been introduced to this product sooner.</li>
    <li> Love these.  I haven&#x27;t had the backs come off one time since I put them on over a month ago.</li>
    <li> These earring backs work so well!! They are the only ones I&#x27;ve tried that actually keep put, and I haven&#x27;t lost a stud earring since I started using them. I like them so much I ordered a second package and will share them with my sister.</li>
    <li> These are great just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love these earring backs!  My diamonds are safe and secure!</li>
    <li> These earring backings have been essential in keeping my child from removing their &amp;#34;secure&amp;#34; earring backs.  I have had to replace countless pairs of earrings because my child was able to magically remove locking bullet back and screw-backs from her ears resulting in lost earrings.  From the first day that I placed these on the back of my child&#x27;s earrings, they have not lost a single pair.  AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily removal on my part is simple and efficient.  But for my child, they are baffled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have been using these earring backs for about a month now. They definitely hold my earrings on tightly. I have diamond studs that do not have screw backs so I have come close to losing them a couple of times. These earring backs hold my earrings on very tight and I feel much better having them on. I found them very easy to get on and off as long as you follow the simple directions.</li>
    <li> Hard to remove from the earring. The back grip becomes tight and hard to press the side grip, especially if one has long nails…like me.</li>
    <li> work well. good price</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t lost an earring back yet since I put the Lox on!</li>
    <li> Work great. Better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Have had no problems.  I&#x27;m not sure they are truly hypo-allergenic.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 5 yr old daughter who kept losing her earrings. They keep the earring on but she tended to squeeze them on tighter since they were so easy to make tighter. And she seemed to get her hair and shirts caught on then A LOT.  Even with the few problems I&#x27;d still buy them again</li>
    <li> The best earrings back ever. My diamonds are safe.  Thanks LOXTM</li>
    <li> These are great. They grip extremely well and I did not find them hard to use. I would have given 5 stars if they were cheaper. I find them to be overpriced.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get them to work.</li>
    <li> I got these backs because I was constantly loosing an ear ring, these have solved the problem quite nicely. When you think about the cost of the ear ring vs. the cost of the back these are down right cheap. I have had the back on now for about 2 weeks and have noticed absolutely no slippage, and the diamond stud is right where it is supposed to be. I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems based on this 2 week trial, and I would recommend this product to anyone that has/had trouble keeping a stud ear ring/s in their ear/s, simply put, they work great., buy em, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed, I know I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> BETTER than the $65 security posts I had put on my diamond studs!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> They really lock your earrings on. No more lost earrings. Practice with them first. Once you can see how they work, they are simple to remove. Don&#x27;t push them on too far since you can&#x27;t pull them backward if they are pinching your ear. Great product.</li>
    <li> Really does work. Great for the earrings that I treasure. Can wear them with confidence. No longer afraid of losing them.</li>
    <li> These earring backs are amazing.  Your earrings are not coming off unless you want them off.  I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use these with my diamond studs. They are very secure. I can even shower and sleep in the earrings.  I especially like to use these when I am traveling so I do not have to remove my earrings during the entire trip.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing a back. They are very tight.</li>
    <li> Great backs for my three year old.  We were having to replace earrings every month but she is not able to take these out at all.  They work much better than the screw back type.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not as fancy as the $50 ball-bearing locking earring backs but they do get the job done. I don&#x27;t lose my earrings anymore, as long as I put these on correctly and don&#x27;t lose THESE! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, it&#x27;s good to practice putting them on and off your earrings just on their own before you actually put them on your ear. I did that and didn&#x27;t have any problems taking them off my ears, once I learned and understood how they work through practice. I always do a little check as well when I put them on (with a little push back) to make sure they&#x27;re locked in place, because otherwise they just won&#x27;t work. They work best on earrings with a straight post, but I have used them on hook earrings too.</li>
    <li> Since I (almost) lost one of my diamond earrings - luckily i found it on my nightstand, i wanted something that would keep them secure.  i read reviews of many different &amp;#34;secure&amp;#34; earring backs, but kept coming back to the LOX.  I received them on time and put them on immediately.  The were secure and in place and will not come off unless I remove them.  I am so happy that I found something to secure my favorite diamond earrings so i can wear them daily.</li>
    <li> Amazing. You will never lose an earring again!</li>
    <li> I got my first pair of diamond stud earrings and wanted them to be securely attached to my ears. These earring backs are easy to use and stay in place. I never have to worry about losing an earring. I am very pleased about this earring solution--the price is nothing compared to replacing a lost earring and the way they work is ingenious!</li>
    <li> These do a great job of holding my earrings on (I keep one pair in all of the time) but they tend to snag a lot on things, and my hair gets tangled up in them pretty frequently.</li>
    <li> I only wish I had these before I lost my favorite earrings.  They work great, but as the instructions say, you really have to practice talking the backs off.  I only wish they made the backs bigger because I have sagging earlobes. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love them! They are very secure and because they are, they are a little difficult to remove. With practice though, you learn to find the widest part with your fingertips and pinch until you feel/hear a tiny click and they come right off. I did as some other reviewers advised and tried it numerous times before actually putting them on my earrings so I&#x27;d have a feel for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning to buy the much more expensive Chrysmela catch backs and found these while searching Amazon and decided that for the difference in price I&#x27;d give LOX a try. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> These have been a lifesaver with my diamond earrings. I just purchased a second package to share with my daughter.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Hold well. Catch in longer hair quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have found these a while back, they are the best!</li>
    <li> These are great!  Really works.</li>
    <li> I want to kiss whomever invented these.  I have lost countless expensive earrings...never again.</li>
    <li> Love LOX! I ordered two pairs and they are awesome. Read the directions first before putting them on. So simple to use and they work fantastic. Unless my earring is being ripped out of my ear these aren&#x27;t coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have really sensitive ears and these haven&#x27;t bothered them or caused any allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Truly secures your post earrings. However, it would speed the removal of the post locks if they were larger.</li>
    <li> I managed to get them on after 5/10 minutes.  At bedtime, when attempting to remove them, and squeezing for about 15 minutes, one did suddenly and easily come off.  I have no idea why, as I was doing the same thing, time after time.  After almost an hour, removing the other one was hopeless, and I really wanted to go to sleep, so I gave up, got the pliers, and without tearing my ear, squeezed, and squeezed the back, and it finally came off, with one of the little metal things, slightly bent.  What a relief, after barely five minutes more!!  I&#x27;m sure they must work for some people.  It might help if your illustrations of the so-called bumps were larger, or if there were projections or bumps, larger than the white plastic circle, obviously horizontal to the post, that would release the back, when squeezed.  I am not a novice at wearing earrings.  Wore clips for years before my ears were pierced, about 50 years ago, and have had posts, with various backs, hooks - using little rubberized stops -, even posts with screw-on backs, but nothing like this.  I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews, but I have to tell the truth.</li>
    <li> How did it take me so long to find these little miracles?!? I will never lose another $100 pair of earrings again... These are SO easy to use and really comfortable. I saw a few reviews before I bought that said they didn&#x27;t work, but now that I have them I think those people just weren&#x27;t doing it correctly! They are SO easy to use and SO awesome... Hurray for incredibly clever and practical inventions!!!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend the LOXTM Mega-Grip Earring Backs. These really work. Very easy to use. Very secure. I have lost one high-end designer earring before. I am so happy to find a good product like this. These keep your valuable earrings totally safe in the ear. It is good that we get one silver pair and one gold pair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My daughter who is about to turn 2 in a few weeks, had her ears pierced at 2 months old. Everything was awesome until about 9 months ago when she began pulling her earrings out. We tried every thing we could find, including screw on backs but they were no feat for her. We finally found these and we&#x27;ve had them a week and she has yet to be able to remove them! Usually we couldn&#x27;t keep earrings in for more than 5 minutes. Huge victory for us. I am SO excited to have found these.</li>
    <li> Was delivered quickly and now my babies earrings do not fall off when she rolls around on the floor.</li>
    <li> They work...what more can I ask for.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  I wish you could just get silver or gold instead of one each.  Put the back on the earring first so you can see how to pinch it off.  No problem once you have done that.  Now I&#x27;m not losing my diamonds any more!</li>
    <li> This product might be better for older children, my daughter is 3 and these always get tighter and they cut her ear open on the back. Yes they lock in place and they can get tighter also they are bulky so everything gets stuck on them hair tangled, clothes and so on. And to top it off my daughters earing still fell out!!</li>
    <li> i have a pair of diamond studs set in platinum. they are extremely heavy; set in platinum, each stone weighs a little over 2.33. needless to say, not the kind of thing you want to lose. i had them set in la pousette backs and while this system is very good, the backs are not large enough to stabilize the studs on my ears -so they droop. not a good look. the jeweler gave me a set of plastic discs to wear with them which fixes the problem, but it&#x27;s a real hassle dealing with backs AND discs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i found another brand of earring backs that are basically larger plastic with a metal tube for the post. they held my studs nicely, but no locking feature. these earrings are expensive and i didn&#x27;t want to take any chances. besides the lack of any locking feature, the metal (which was supposedly 14k) irritated one of my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i found the LOX backs and figured i&#x27;d give them a try. there is no metal touching your ear at all, so no irritation. they feel great and are comfortable to wear. they do a decent job of stabilizing my studs so they don&#x27;t droop ...as much. i can wear these, and they&#x27;re the best solution so i&#x27;m going to stick with them. i just wish the plastic cushion on the back was a bit bigger. they really aren&#x27;t much bigger than a standard earring back. the plastic discs i was wearing with the la pousette backs are about the size of dime. i wish these were that size ...they&#x27;d be perfect then, and worthy of a 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> These earring backs work as advertised, and are much more affordable than the 14k ones available. They haven&#x27;t caused any break-outs or rashes. They&#x27;re effective at locking earrings I usually have problems with. I have some earrings with different diameter posts, and these backs fit them all as well.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I did not think I would like these.  The packaging is cheesy 80&#x27;s, and looks like something you would find in a cheap accessory store at the mall.  I read the reviews, which were mixed, but I thought I would try them before buying more expensive locking backs or taking my earrings to a jeweler. Don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover. I was really surprised and really happy with these earring backs. I do have earrings with screw on backs, and I feel the LOX backs hold just as well as the screw-on backs, and are a little easier to get off (once you know how to do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest &amp;#34;practicing&amp;#34; with the backs before you put them on your ear.  If you don&#x27;t know how to work them, they won&#x27;t be easy to get off.  There are some youtube videos on LOX, but no sound or explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the LOX on the earring: slide on the earring post. Done. No need to squeeze them to put them on the earring post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the LOX off: with your thumb and index finger gently squeeze the rounded metal parts and plastic tab together.  The metal part will slide down, you can kind of feel a &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;, and pull it off the post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are bigger than normal backs, but not bigger than the supportive earring backs (bullet backs with the clear disk around them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with them catching on clothing or towels.  I also try to make sure the rounded metal parts are positioned at the top to try and avoid possibility of snags. I don&#x27;t sleep with earrings in my ears, I find it annoying, but I have fallen asleep with these in and they were not overly bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all very happy with these backs, I trust them on the backs of my expensive earrings. Wish they would change their cheesy packaging.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for keeping your earring in your earlobes. No more fear of losing those diamond studs or other favorite earrings. The only thing to be careful for is that they do tend to snag on materials like towels or clothing. But, with a little wiggling, it&#x27;s easy enough to free yourself and totally worth knowing you won&#x27;t lose your jewelry.</li>
    <li> I like these because they definitely hold my new diamond earrings on really, really well. I was afraid of losing them, that&#x27;s why I bought these earring backs. My only concern is: they grip so well I struggle to get them off. Not much of a problem since I wear these earrings everyday. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do when I have to take them off.</li>
    <li> These work so great especially in the winter with coats, hoods and scarves.</li>
    <li> Great, but not for starter earrings&lt;br /&gt;They hold my daughter&#x27;s screw back and regular post earring, however her starter earring are too thick for these to go on.  Otherwise they are awesome!!!</li>
    <li> The most important thing to understand about these earrings backs is, THERE IS A RIGHT WAY AND A WRONG WAY to put them on...I strongly suggest that you:&lt;br /&gt; Put them on and take them off an earring that&#x27;s not in your ear.&lt;br /&gt; Examine the mechanics of the back when squeezed. How do they lock? How do they unlock?&lt;br /&gt; Understand that while you CAN force the back onto an earring without squeezing, it won&#x27;t be on correctly and will act like any other non-locking back.&lt;br /&gt;Try the backs with a less expensive pair of earrings the first time you use them.&lt;br /&gt;Check them for proper placement frequently. It takes maybe two seconds out of your day, and will avoid heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work, but like anything in life they need to be used correctly. Good luck!</li>
    <li> ...but easier to put on and take off.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing these for 6 months now...They do keep the earrings on.  My big complaint is that they have a rough edge on the back that snags my clothing.  They are all like this--I checked all in the package.  It has permanently snagged several items.  I would not recommend them for this reason., I would try another product.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my wife after a few scares we had with the diamond earrings I bought her for our anniversary.  She loves these things and we&#x27;ve had no heart-stopping &amp;#34;outages&amp;#34; since she started using them.  My wife has not complained that they are too difficult to put on or take off.</li>
    <li> wonderful product, need to purchase more</li>
    <li> I honestly never review anything but just have to comment on what a lifesaver these little things have been!  Had an expensive pair of pink sapphires that I wanted to wear every day but when I would be on the phone at work they&#x27;d come off or get loose. Not anymore!  These are easy to use and comfy enough to sleep in every night and the earrings don&#x27;t move!  So glad I found these on Amazon. Highly recommend and am purchasing for my daughter and sisters!!</li>
    <li> Great product and simple to use.  Definitely read the instructions and practice prior to use.  If you don&#x27;t, you might be in trouble.  Don&#x27;t let the odd packaging deter you from making this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it, in fact I&#x27;ll be getting more for gifts! Not difficult to use, like some reviews say...</li>
    <li> Great product, super hold for earrings you don&#x27;t want damaged</li>
    <li> These are perfect. I have some expensive, heavy earrings and they don&#x27;t budge a bit with these backs. Follow directions. Don&#x27;t buy anything more expensive. These are PERFECT!</li>
    <li> I can finally wear my diamond studs without fear. I&#x27;m the type of person who prefers jewelery I can wear 24 hours a day, sleeping, showering, etcetera. I needed backs that I could trust while washing my hair and not have my earrings fall down the drain!! These work!!!! Just make sure you check after putting them in that they can&#x27;t slide back, that way you know they are locked.</li>
    <li> The backs are very difficult to handle. One I got them on and they locked, I couldn&#x27;t get them off without the help of my husband.</li>
    <li> Love these, they fit tight, won&#x27;t have to worry about loosing any more earing&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> They work just as they described. I use them now for all my earrings both expensive and costume to keep them secure.</li>
    <li> If I had received them perhaps they would have met my expectations however it&#x27;s been more than a month and i am out 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> Great earing backs to secure your favorite earring! Not as good as a screw back-you won&#x27;t want to sleep with these on. But best product I&#x27;ve found for a more secure earring back.</li>
    <li> Great relief to know my new birthstone stud earrings won&#x27;t ever be in danger of falling out of my ears.</li>
    <li> These tiny earring backs are terrific!  They stay put and don&#x27;t catch on hair or fine knits.  Took a couple of tries to get them off as they are pretty small, and you have to pinch the plastic bits on the outside of the metal part to release it, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy and I no longer worry that I&#x27;ll lose another earring back!</li>
    <li> Terrific. I wish four pair came in a package.</li>
    <li> This is a good alternative to regular backings that just fall off. I gave 3 stars because this product does not provide clear instructions on how to install the backings onto your post earrings...and not to mention how to remove them too! I was struggling to remove them at first until I finally figured it out. Also if you don&#x27;t install them correctly they will fall off just like your old regular backings.</li>
    <li> It works for it&#x27;s purpose and comfortable to the ear, i&#x27;m happy that it is hypoallergen, but Aesthetically doesn&#x27;t really look nice. But it works. I&#x27;m fine with this substitute for my lost cover earrings.</li>
    <li> I have a pair of earrings with huge sentimental value and I was skeptical about these, especially for the price.  But I&#x27;m so impressed with these!  It came with two pairs when I was expecting one (obviously I didn&#x27;t pay close attention to the details) and they are so secure, I&#x27;m no longer afraid of losing my earrings.  I practiced taking them on and off before putting the earrings in my ears, so I could figure out how to remove them without looking.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These are terrible! I bought them to use on my 1 year old after she started taking her earrings out. I had tried the backs that she was pierced with, safety backs and these, and none of them worked. My niece also lost her LOX backs. If you got a toddler taking out their earrings I recommend huggies. They are tiny hoops that snap into themselves and are impossible for kids to take out because you have to use 2 hands and pull each side simultaneously. They sell them everywhere, a pair of white gold ones cost us $50 but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> These absolutely suck. They are no different than regular earring backings ... My 1 (almost two) year old got them off like nothing.  Complete waste of money and would not recommend!</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH YOUR TIME FIT FUNNY AND DO COME A LOOSE</li>
    <li> While the backs stayed on after a hard time attaching them; they were a B**** to take off. Wish they were bigger and easier to handle.</li>
    <li> I have lost many earrings from accidentally pulling them off with my riding helmet or getting them caught in a sweater or scarf.  Never again.  These are great!  Now if I could only find the lost ones...</li>
    <li> These are amazing. I feel just as secure wearing these with my diamond studs as a second pair of studs I have with screwback fasteners.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well these work and my expectations were definitely exceeded.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how some people on here have said that they had these &amp;#34;fall off as easily as regular backs.&amp;#34;  These DO NOT fall off of me, in fact sometimes the take a little extra strength to squeeze to get them off. But... That was the main reason why I purchased them. I wanted it to be that they would not unintentionally fall off. After having several big scares with almost losing some expensive diamond studs to wear in my tiered ear piercing, due to the backs falling off, I decided that it would be worth the extra cost of expensive backs.  Better to have these, than to lose an expensive diamond. There are other earring backs on the market that I would have considered, and that look better than these. But, those were WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. You cannot beat the cost of these for it&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit that you really do have to practice a couple of times first before putting these on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear studs in my second-piercing all the time, without taking them out. They do not feel uncomfortable at all.</li>
    <li> These little locks work really really wel!! They also hold the earring up on the front of the earlobe if you get it tight enough!! I&#x27;ve seen other locks that are $50-100 a pair....these are seriously economical &amp; you get 2 pair!!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I only wear one on my left ear lobe, and always lose the backing of earring posts..I decided to look one that can lock them and not lose my expensive diamond stud given to me as a Xmas present. I did find this and bought them. I&#x27;m glad for the invention...its worth of its cost.</li>
    <li> I gave five stars as it is the most secure earring back I have ever used. They work very well.  As one other reviewer stated:  practice taking them on and off an earring in your hand before putting them on your ears.  They are simple to use:  slide on and it locks in place.  Pinch the sides to remove it.  There is a technique to it and it becomes easier the more you work with them.  Just remember, you have to squeeze the sides to remove it because it&#x27;s not coming off with squeezing those sides.&lt;br /&gt;They measure about 5mm in diameter.  They are not super pretty.  Someone standing behind you will be able to tell you have on a different type of earring back.  I received one pair of silver-tone and one pair of gold-tone.  The gold tone is not very deep in color so it is difficult to tell the difference between the two colors unless you are in bright light.  They are much more affordable than taking your earring to the jeweler to be fitted with screwbacks or Lapossette backs.  These can be used on any thickness of post (including thick vintage posts) provided the post is long enough to accommodate them.  They have the advantage of being able to be used on all your earrings.  They do need a little bit more space than a friction back, maybe a mm or so.  They do have the potential to get caught in sweaters if you are not careful, with the little part you squeeze slightly sticking out.  Others have noted in their reviews that you need to check them on a daily basis, but I have not had mine long enough to comment on that and I usually do not sleep in my good earrings.&lt;br /&gt;The only ways that I can think of to make them better would be:  1) somehow make them prettier, 2) offer an upgraded option in 14k instead of the base metal, and 3) include instructions for proper cleaning of them.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy I ordered them and wish I would have found them years ago so I would have less single earrings.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get these sooner.  I always lose earrings and this is the perfect solution for me.  Provided that you follow the instructions on the packaging, your earrings will never fall out.  I swim constantly, and I have long hair, and not once have I had a problem with the earring backs loosening.  I am not sure what kind of metal/plastic combo is being used, but I have very sensitive skin and I have had no problems with these earring backs.  Amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> These backs are phenomenal. For the price, they can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;m pretty rough and tumble and recently received a pair of earrings as a gift. I have been using the silver backs and am so in love with them. The plastic bit keeps my ears from getting irritated by the metal, the metal grip is rock solid, and my earrings have been safely in my ears for months. I shower with them and haven&#x27;t noticed any deterioration. The only time I ever had an issue was when I snagged one of the backs on a paintball mask. The earring and back stayed on my ear and I had a rather painful experience. If you tend to be clumsy or have the possibility of hooking your earring on something and pulling, I&#x27;d suggest caution. These backs do NOT come off unless you squeeze the release. Fantastic product, I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described.  Backs go onto earring easily but you really have to squeeze to remove back.  If you don&#x27;t want to lose earrings, this is what you need.</li>
    <li> They work, easy to remove (read the instructions).  Now I&#x27;m not afraid that I might loose my diamond earrings. Yeah!</li>
    <li> Great idea and nice price</li>
    <li> Wow, no longer have to worry about losing diamond earrings again. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost so many pairs of favorite earrings, and I&#x27;m SO happy those days are behind me (ya know, knock on wood). I&#x27;ve even worn my earrings to sleep (unintentionally) and haven&#x27;t had to search the bed sheets for the various pieces in the morning. It may take a few tries to get them to lock, but it&#x27;s not difficult and I have zero complaints so far (2 months in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so excited about these I think I&#x27;m going to tack them on to all the birthday gifts I give to female friends from now on.</li>
    <li> These earring backs really work!!  I bought them for my 13 month old daughter who managed to get regular earring backs with clear safety backs off constantly.  These are so simple to put on.  Just slip on like normal backs and then just pinch to release when you want to change out earrings.  Will use these on ALL of her earrings!</li>
    <li> Easy to put on but locks your earrings in place, no more worrying that you&#x27;ll lose an earring when changing clothes or when you get loose backs and you somehow lose an expensive earring.  Priced right for peace of mind in not losing earrings you love.</li>
    <li> Love these. When I almost lost my first pair of very expense earrings I went searching for a back that would stay on. These are the best. Note: Read the instructions! At first I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like them but then I figured out how they work. Great product.</li>
    <li> love them, will probably order more later for Christmas presents</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them! They are super easy to use and to remove, I admit I was a little worried because of some of the reviews, but I had no problem at all. I just did what some recommended, before placing them in my ears, I became familiar with the mecanism. My earrings feel very safe, and I have tried them with different earrings and they work great. I am definitely going to buy more for me and for mi daughter.</li>
    <li> I ordered these backs and I really like them! Due to my sensitive ears, many earring backs irritate them causing me not to wear earrings; these don&#x27;t. I love how they stay put and are easy to use. the only design flaw I can find is that they catch onto shirts often due to the locking mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I cannot give it five stars is that I was sent two pairs of silver backs, not one silver and one gold. I was disappointing that I did not get a gold pair as I enjoy wearing gold just as much as sliver.</li>
    <li> Love these grip backs. it does what is said it would do. When I received I practiced putting on  and taking off before I put in my ears.</li>
    <li> A little tricky to properly use. As another reviewer stated, best to &#x27;practice&#x27; on how to secure properly before actually trying to secure to your ear. For the price, &#x27;tricky&#x27; is a piece of cake.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and works!  Glad I found this.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The back broke in half when I removed it from the envelope!</li>
    <li> What can I say, they worked! I practiced putting them on and off the earrings a couple of times before actually wearing the earrings and had no problem with the unlock mechanism. Do be careful not to slide them on too tight to the ear because unlocking them when they are tight against the earlobe is a bit tricky. I plan on purchasing at least another 6 pair so I won&#x27;t have to be spending a lot of time switching them from one earring to another.</li>
    <li> It is so nice to wear quality earrings with no worry of losing one. It took a couple of uses to get comfortable in just slipping on and pressing to remove. The screw backs are difficult to deal with and they are uncomfortable on the ear. La Possets are very expensive, and LOX Mega Grip,  is cost effective and quality. At seventy plus this is great. Any age could use this, men would appreciate the ease and security of this product. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> These earring backs worked at first, but aren&#x27;t a sustainable replacement for secure earring backs...after a couple of uses, they broke. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
