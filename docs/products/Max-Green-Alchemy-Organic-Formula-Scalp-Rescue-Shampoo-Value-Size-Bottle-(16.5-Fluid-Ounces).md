      <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
      <li>I love this companies products and will continue to use them!!!!</li>

      <li>This is the best shampoo!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
      <li>It does a great job of cleaning my hair without drying it out, and has the best ingredient list of all the supposedly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos out there.</li>
      <li>But daaaaamn does this stuff smell good!</li>
      <li>It lathers wonderfully and smells good too.</li>

      <li>This shampoo is amazing!</li>
      <li>It lathers quite good.</li>
      <li>However, after using this for three weeks (wanted to give it a fair shot), I had to give up.</li>
      <li>and it has done a good job of keeping my sebahorric dermatitis on my scalp under wraps.</li>
      <li>Really, really good.</li>
      <li>Also a pleasant smell, kind of a mix of lemon and rosemary.</li>
      <li>My hair is healthy and so is my scalp - no itchies!</li>
      <li>Definitely a strong smell, but I follow this up with a great smelling conditioner</li>
      <li>One drop foams up and my hair looks amazing when I use this.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of a cedary/eucalyptus type scent</li>
      <li>like the scent, and I&#x27;m sure it is doing good things for my scalp, but it didn&#x27;t reduce flaking or the itching in my case.</li>
      <li>nice botanical shampoo.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo!!</li>
      <li>wonderful natural product free of the chemicals that can cause sensitivities!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>healthy way to shampoo without chemicals</li>
      <li>I recommend it to many friends.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Seems to have fairly healthy ingredietns..  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>No chemicals and damaging additives in it that SO many body care products contain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite too.</li>
      <li>I like it because it is organic and safe to use.</li>
      <li>definitely the best price out there for this product.</li>
      <li>My hair feels nice silky smooth.</li>
      <li>My husbands scalp is so much better since he started using this.</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this shampoo due to the impressive list of ingredients.</li>
      <li>This product is very gentle on the scalp and also smells very good, even just this shompoo hair becomws soft.</li>
      <li>Cleans exactly as it should and has a nice clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because organic/all natural shampoos are supposed to be good for your scalp and help with dandruff.</li>
      <li>It does a good job, but not noticeably better than many other brands that I have used.</li>
      <li>I have very fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>It also smells great...nice and clean without all the chemical junk in there.</li>
      <li>More importantly, it really works.</li>
      <li>This reviewer has been purchasing this product for several years and is very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have nice hair.</li>
      <li>I liked the natural aspects of this shampoo, and after reading reviews about it reducing itching and flaking, I was definitely willing to try it.</li>
      <li>I think it is marvelous, far superior to any of the major national brands such as Head &amp; Shoulders, Sensun Blue, and any of the (odoriferous) coal-tar-based products.</li>
      <li>I was dismayed to learn that MGA hair-care products are no longer available at the Whole Foods I patronize (in SF East Bay) because they were not selling well.</li>
      <li>While Max Green is not a cure, it has proven to be the most effective product in assisting with management and tolerance.</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>Moreover, I find it kind to color-treated hair, something that cannot be said of the aforementioned national dandruff-control brands.</li>
      <li>It needs more tea tree oil at least to feel good (though tea tree oil takes 15 minutes to kill these bugs I think</li>
      <li>I feel it cleans scalp and hair very nice without being harsh.</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more in future when we run out.</li>
      <li>No scary cancer-causing chemicals.</li>
      <li>The smell was a tad bit off-putting at first, but now I like it.</li>
      <li>The only warning I might offer is that my husband didn&#x27;t love the scent at first--</li>
      <li>I treat my hair with oil at night regularly to kill mange, which most people age 50 and up  have</li>
      <li>I love that they have the big bottles.  </li>
      <li>I originally tried this because it&#x27;s completely plant based and has no chemicals.</li>
      <li>better choice for a gentle daily shampoo is Rusk Sensories (I like the Wellness Heal Shampoo).</li>
      <li>My scalp is back to normal now, and my hair has never felt better.</li>
      <li>This is my new shampoo now!!</li>
      <li>It did nothing good for my scalp and left my hair dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>Whole family loves it.  </li>
      <li>The product is very soothing.</li>
      <li>I bought Scalp Rescue on the recommendation of a Team Member at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything to eliminate flakes and intense itch (at times).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also cruelty free which makes a big difference to me.</li>
      <li>I think you can also find it at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>works real well.  </li>
      <li>cleans hair and scalp really well</li>
      <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
      <li>Thanks to this product my girlfirend is still with me,</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This is a good product but it is slow to show resluts.</li>
      <li>It actually almost felt like it had conditioner and left my hair smooth and smelling clean.</li>
      <li>And, it smells much better that the other tar-based shampoo he was having to use.</li>
      <li>i cannot live without it!</li>
      <li>it actually stopped my itch after trying so many different shampoos.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s reasonably strong while your hair is wet.</li>
      <li>It gets two stars for being an organic, paraben-free product and for being highly concentrated.</li>
      <li>Nothing really distinguishs it from any other Sodium laureth sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nothing really distinguishs it from any other Sodium laureth sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>my hair gets a little static</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a shampoo that leaves my hair clean, soft and manageable and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp</li>
      <li>, my hair gets clean and it does not dry out even though I use it daily</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that can get limp, but not with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I think I have determined that my scalp is just sensitive to the soft water we have.</li>
      <li>I bought the shampoo for it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s luxuriously soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Daughter with extremely sensitive skin has ZERO problems with it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using MGA shampoo for quite a few years. It&#x27;s the best shampoo I have ever used! I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s with very thick rich hair and little gray so far! I recommend it to many friends.</li>
    <li> works real well.  thank you.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST SHAMPOO YOU WILL EVER BUY</li>
    <li> Whole family loves it.  Daughter with extremely sensitive skin has ZERO problems with it.  Cleans exactly as it should and has a nice clean smell.  Will be purchasing more in future when we run out.</li>
    <li> it actually stopped my itch after trying so many different shampoos.  it smells great.  i cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> This did not help my hair grow back as far as I can tell, and it kept leaving.  I know why mine is leavig, it is Mange, the demodex mite.  I wash hair each day and comb out dead bugs and this stuff has not reduced nor increased number.  It needs more tea tree oil at least to feel good (though tea tree oil takes 15 minutes to kill these bugs I think&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice botanical shampoo.  Seems to have fairly healthy ingredietns..  I prefer Wen at the moment, though it does not grow hair.  I treat my hair with oil at night regularly to kill mange, which most people age 50 and up  have but it does not bug them.  heh heh.</li>
    <li> I love that they have the big bottles.  This stuff is the best</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this through a roommate, and have been using it regularly for the past couple years now. It does a great job of cleaning my hair without drying it out, and has the best ingredient list of all the supposedly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos out there. No scary cancer-causing chemicals. The only warning I might offer is that my husband didn&#x27;t love the scent at first-- it&#x27;s kind of a cedary/eucalyptus type scent and it&#x27;s reasonably strong while your hair is wet. It fades fast once your hair is dry though, and I actually like it.   You can buy an extra large bottle straight from Max Green Alchemy through their company web site-- definitely the best price out there for this product. I think you can also find it at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I bought Scalp Rescue on the recommendation of a Team Member at Whole Foods.

I was dismayed to learn that MGA hair-care products are no longer available at the Whole Foods I patronize (in SF East Bay) because they were not selling well. Rats. I feel \\&quot;rescued\\&quot; to find that all MGA products are sold by Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is very gentle on the scalp and also smells very good, even just this shompoo hair becomws soft.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo!! I have been using it for over a year now and it has done a good job of keeping my sebahorric dermatitis on my scalp under wraps. I still have to use the RX once in a while, but not nearly as often. Great product and has a nice smell to it!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle and like not having chemicals in my shampoo I also am using the conditioner.   It has a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this because organic/all natural shampoos are supposed to be good for your scalp and help with dandruff. This shampoo for about 2 weeks started to reduce my dandruff then suddenly it came back exactly as it was before and continues at that current state.</li>
    <li> I really like it a lot. My hair feels nice silky smooth. My girlfriend likes to run her fingers through my hair. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have nice hair. Thanks to this product my girlfirend is still with me,</li>
    <li> I liked the natural aspects of this shampoo, and after reading reviews about it reducing itching and flaking, I was definitely willing to try it. I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything to eliminate flakes and intense itch (at times). I think I have determined that my scalp is just sensitive to the soft water we have. Still, I wanted to try this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent, and I&#x27;m sure it is doing good things for my scalp, but it didn&#x27;t reduce flaking or the itching in my case. It&#x27;s a good-sized bottle and will last for a while. It lathers quite good. Just don&#x27;t expect it to be a all-natural reincarnation of Selsun Blue-Medicated!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with poor health for nearly two years, and it really took its toll on my hair and scalp. After reading the reviews, I decided to try this. The smell was a tad bit off-putting at first, but now I like it. More importantly, it really works. It took several washes before it healed my scalp, so don&#x27;t expect immediate results. My scalp is back to normal now, and my hair has never felt better. It&#x27;s luxuriously soft and manageable. I also bought the conditioner and I love it. Yes, this is on the expensive end, but a little goes a long way. I just may keep using this as my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo, but not the price :(</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  One drop foams up and my hair looks amazing when I use this.  Definitely a strong smell, but I follow this up with a great smelling conditioner, problem solved.  Do not buy the conditioner that goes with this.  It takes a bottle per use (slightly exaggerated) to moisturize your hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. He loves it. I like it because it is organic and safe to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using this stuff for eight years and tried other scalp/dandruff formulas. Nothing compares</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to sooth my itchy scalp.  This is the only thing that has helped me. Leaves my hair a bit dry, but nothing a little condition won&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Love it. Wish they sold it in Canada...</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! It lathers nicely and it doesn&#x27;t take an excessive amount to clean my long, thick hair! It also smells great...nice and clean without all the chemical junk in there.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a little herb store in Texas. I was skeptical to try it because I have been disappointed by all natural shampoos, I am not really sure why I even purchased it after having such bad luck but I tried it and it did not dry out my hair or make it feel like I stripped it of all its got. It actually almost felt like it had conditioner and left my hair smooth and smelling clean. So, here I am, purchasing it again. This is my new shampoo now!!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!! No chemicals and damaging additives in it that SO many body care products contain. I love this companies products and will continue to use them!!!!</li>
    <li> Having chronic psoriasis, Max Green has been beneficial in helping control the itching and flaking. While Max Green is not a cure, it has proven to be the most effective product in assisting with management and tolerance. The product is very soothing. This reviewer has been purchasing this product for several years and is very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I originally tried this because it&#x27;s completely plant based and has no chemicals. I like the smell and cleaning power and how it helps control my flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> Of all the shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried, this is the one that works the best to reduce itchiness in my scalp. Really, really good. Also a pleasant smell, kind of a mix of lemon and rosemary.</li>
    <li> It just works as described. Helps the scalp to get its healthy shape and there is no kind of negative effects ever found. Money well spent! It seems to be really natural stuff. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about all the benefits of cleaning my hair. It does a good job, but not noticeably better than many other brands that I have used. But daaaaamn does this stuff smell good!</li>
    <li> Nothing really distinguishs it from any other Sodium laureth sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say the shampoo rescued my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemon formula is a little harsh for fine hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to citrus based products, you may have a problem with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really distinguishs it from any other Sodium laureth sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> healthy way to shampoo without chemicals, my hair gets clean and it does not dry out even though I use it daily</li>
    <li> cleans hair and scalp really well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a shampoo that leaves my hair clean, soft and manageable and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful natural product free of the chemicals that can cause sensitivities!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp (seborrheic dermatitis) and have been through tons of different shampoos both over-the-counter and prescription for decades now. I can&#x27;t use 99% of all shampoos because I get an immediate allergic-type reaction. This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used to keep itchiness under control. It lathers wonderfully and smells good too. It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it. It&#x27;s also cruelty free which makes a big difference to me.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but it is slow to show resluts.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this shampoo due to the impressive list of ingredients. It gets two stars for being an organic, paraben-free product and for being highly concentrated. However, after using this for three weeks (wanted to give it a fair shot), I had to give up. It did nothing good for my scalp and left my hair dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;A better choice for a gentle daily shampoo is Rusk Sensories (I like the Wellness Heal Shampoo).</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo!  The conditioner is a winner too!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  My hair is healthy and so is my scalp - no itchies! And no gluten. I have fine hair that can get limp, but not with this shampoo. It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite too.</li>
    <li> My husbands scalp is so much better since he started using this. And, it smells much better that the other tar-based shampoo he was having to use.</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair. I bought the shampoo for it&#x27;s natural ingredients. I feel it cleans scalp and hair very nice without being harsh. I use this with a few other good shampoos , because I don&#x27;t like to use the same product all the time.&lt;br /&gt;If my hair gets a little static I dab just a little stay in conditioner on it. I will purchase this shampoo again.</li>
