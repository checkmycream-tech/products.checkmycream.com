    <li> I started to use this product was when I was studying in Europe and got to know Avene Hydrance Optional Light Protective. I used this after my daily creme for against the computer radiation. I have used this for over 8 years since then. A good product with great package. No damage at all. I will come back for more later.</li>
    <li> Avene has great products and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I use for my extreme sensitive skin for over a decade already.  I used to ask my guests to bring me this cream from Europe. Now I can just order it online!</li>
    <li> Great light weight moisturizer and light sun protection!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I first bought it in Rome, Italy at a pharmacy. It was more expensive there than on amazon. My wife made me order her three more through here so we wouldnt have to wait for shipping. It has helped her with some mild acne/rosacea.</li>
    <li> Excellent and I love the SPF which the US ones don’t carry.</li>
    <li> It is not oily and good for combination skins. I gave it five stars because of the quality of the product and also the shipment.</li>
    <li> Light and not greasy on my skin.  Avene never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Product is lightweight and does not interfere with my makeup application. Although the product is white, it does not stay white when applied to the skin like other sunscreens in the Avene line. Great for my sensitive skin!</li>

    <li> Really nice product  for my skin&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with it</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion only when I couldn&#x27;t find my usual, and it is now my everyday sunscreen. It&#x27;s non-greasy, soft, and quick-absorbing. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin shiny or sticky. No breakouts at all with this lotion.</li>
    <li> Honestly the best daytime moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. I have combination skin that needs hydration from drying topical acne creams, but every spf moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried makes me oily halfway through the day. This stuff stays matte and does its job protecting me from the sun. Will buy forever. Just wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> I hate things that are greasy but this moisturizer is very light especially with the SPF 20 built in.  I live in sunny area and the run of the mill SPF 15 in most products just won&#x27;t do.  I&#x27;m lazy too so hate to put so much stuff on my face in the morning.  This just hits the spot.  Keeps my face moisturized and protected from the sun.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it for sensitive skin, works great.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the shipping was really fast!</li>
