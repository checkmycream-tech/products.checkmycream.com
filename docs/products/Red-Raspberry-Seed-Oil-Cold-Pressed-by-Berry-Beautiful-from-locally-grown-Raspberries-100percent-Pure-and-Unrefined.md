      <li>This oil makes my skin feel so comfortable...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless amounts of products and treatments over the years, and this oil is really really great.</li>

      <li>Great quality, noticeably better than other brands.</li>
      <li>It has a strong sweet, berry scent and</li>
      <li>Good for facial sun protection and works wonders on eczema.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell which is truly the same smell you would get from crushing up fresh raspberries.</li>
      <li>after gently washing with only water and maybe a wash cloth, spritz some rose water, then this oil...</li>
      <li>I will definately purchase again but this time, I will buy the bigger 4 ounce bottle and if i still continue to like it, I will buy more of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with the red rasberry seed oil!</li>
      <li>it works very well as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feel after about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>It really makes it easier to move my finger and feels soothing.</li>
      <li>that was a real plus.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, subtle smell of raspberries.</li>
      <li>My self care wash routine has evolved to only shampoo every other day, wash cloth 2 to 3x&#x27;s a week, spray pure rose water, and this oil.</li>
      <li>From years of Retin-A, Accutane, Benzoyl peroxide, anti-biotics, Spironolactone, Clarisonic, olive oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, professional facials, medical extractions, laser, light therapy, etc, etc, etc.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>High SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve pared down to this simple routine and its been the most comfortable I&#x27;ve been in my skin for a long time.</li>
      <li>I live in Nigeria.</li>
      <li>It works so well and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, a tiny hint of kinda acetone-like smell, but its very subtle and not noticeable after a minute or two.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this oil as my moisturizer for only 2 1/2 weeks or so, but I really like it so far...</li>
      <li>It is also organic and known for being a natural spf for our skin.  </li>
      <li>I like using this since it is all natural and an affordable anti aging option.  </li>
      <li>Nearly everything makes me breakout</li>
      <li>odor - it actually doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor at all.</li>
      <li>Since I started using this oil, I feel like its helping to make old clogs of sebum and junk surface (wishful thinking?).</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the smell is of a strong oil I and was hoping for the raspberry smell that most other reviewers commented on, hence 4 stars vs 5.</li>
      <li>For me, who is quite sensitive to scents, its totally a do-able trade off for the benefit.</li>
      <li>Really, no pulling or tightness, no burning or sensitivity, no shellacked high shine, just comfort.</li>
      <li>Totally stops the itch and really makes the red and swelling go down.  </li>

    <li> PERFECT addition to my homemade sunscreen along with zinc oxide! There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; odor - it actually doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and have avoided any sunburn while outside for two to three hours at a time. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for the SPF value.  I did not expect it to smell so good...that was a real plus.  A wonderful oil with great skin moisturizing properties. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great as a low SPF sunscreen.  Unfortunately, the smell is of a strong oil I and was hoping for the raspberry smell that most other reviewers commented on, hence 4 stars vs 5.</li>
    <li> Great product, great for skin</li>
    <li> Great quality oil. I mangled my finger in the freezer ice maker and I&#x27;ve been putting it on it everyday. It really makes it easier to move my finger and feels soothing.</li>
    <li> It seems like a good, quality product. It comes in a glass bottle with a glass dropper. On my oily skin, however, even a drop or two feels too heavy. I have better success with argon oil.</li>
    <li> Perfect item for my natural sunscreen and great price!</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with this oil, and very happy to have learned about the company. For me, the oil had an unfamiliar aroma the first couple of days, but once it breathed, it was very nice and reminded me of when you bite into a raspberry seed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now in a blend as a facial serum and a different blend for sun protection. I feel it has been very effective in both purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to thank Berry Beautiful for being a company of integrity and quality. We need more companies like this one. After many interactions via email, they have proven to be trustworth and diligent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, wish I&#x27;d tried it years ago.  Good for facial sun protection and works wonders on eczema.  Also great customer service!</li>
    <li> Great quality, noticeably better than other brands.</li>
    <li> Amazingly light and smells divine! High SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a sprayer..</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good! It has a strong sweet, berry scent and it works very well as a moisturizer. It is a great anti-inflammatory and soothes irritated skin. Great value.</li>
    <li> I live in Nigeria.I use this oil on my face every morning. But what shocked me most was the way it softened my natural african hair. this oil is really also very good for 4c hair. I will definately purchase again but this time, I will buy the bigger 4 ounce bottle and if i still continue to like it, I will buy more of it. But for now, am still loving this oil for my face and hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the using when I&#x27;m outside to protect my face from the sun.  It works so well and leaves my skin very soft.  I will never be without this, even in the winter,  (sun shines then too,  :)</li>
    <li> LOVE IT and it makes my face feel GREAT!</li>
    <li> Great for skin, it improves the youthfulness</li>
    <li> love this, best price and quality I&#x27;ve found on amazon, works incredibly well as sunscreen, blocking uva and uvb rays, great for my baby and me</li>
    <li> Absolutely lovely oil.  It&#x27;s moisturizes and makes my skin look dewy/glowy (not greasy like other oils I have tried on my face i.e. almond, jojoba, argan, coconut). It absorbs rather than just sits on top of skin. I have combination skin that is prone to acne. I have also been using this on my neck and decolletage area instead of an anti aging cream. I like using this since it is all natural and an affordable anti aging option.  Very fast shipping and seems like a great company.  It has a pleasant, subtle smell of raspberries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in sunblock and several other products.</li>
    <li> I love this raspberry seed oil!  It makes my skin look younger, and it brings moisture to my skin.  It is also organic and known for being a natural spf for our skin.  I combine it with my organic essential oils for healing of dark spots and scars.  You definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product! I love the smell which is truly the same smell you would get from crushing up fresh raspberries. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feel after about 30 seconds. I feel it&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well elimination my breakouts and red spots...love!</li>
    <li> Like the smell I use it for sunscreen</li>
    <li> Using this oil in a DIY sunscreen recipe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with the red rasberry seed oil! I&#x27;m using it on my hair for frizz and my body for after-shower moisturizer.  I also noticed during a recent camping trip that it works on chigger bites!  Totally stops the itch and really makes the red and swelling go down.  Love love love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil as my moisturizer for only 2 1/2 weeks or so, but I really like it so far...almost love it. Nearly everything makes me breakout and I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne (cystic, congested/enlarged pores, greasy yet dehydrated skin, etc.) for 28 years. This oil makes my skin feel so comfortable...after gently washing with only water and maybe a wash cloth, spritz some rose water, then this oil...SIGH~ Really, no pulling or tightness, no burning or sensitivity, no shellacked high shine, just comfort. I&#x27;ve tried countless amounts of products and treatments over the years, and this oil is really really great. The smell isn&#x27;t great, a tiny hint of kinda acetone-like smell, but its very subtle and not noticeable after a minute or two. For me, who is quite sensitive to scents, its totally a do-able trade off for the benefit. Since I started using this oil, I feel like its helping to make old clogs of sebum and junk surface (wishful thinking?). My self care wash routine has evolved to only shampoo every other day, wash cloth 2 to 3x&#x27;s a week, spray pure rose water, and this oil. From years of Retin-A, Accutane, Benzoyl peroxide, anti-biotics, Spironolactone, Clarisonic, olive oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, professional facials, medical extractions, laser, light therapy, etc, etc, etc. I&#x27;ve pared down to this simple routine and its been the most comfortable I&#x27;ve been in my skin for a long time. Does my complexion look better? No, not dramatically, but I sure feel TONS BETTER. Only gripe is that the price has creeped up $3 since I made my purchase. Is it the raspberry harvest or the market or something effecting the cost to go up $3 in 2 1/2 wks? I hope its not just because of the increased popularity of this oil. I&#x27;ll update this review once I&#x27;ve used this oil for longer.</li>
