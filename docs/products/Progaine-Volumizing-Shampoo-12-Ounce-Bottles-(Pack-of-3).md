      <li>This is just very nice shampoo for balding heads.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve been trying all sorts of foams--expensive, inexpensive, and middle-of-the-road, and I have yet to find one that&#x27;s as good as Progaine&#x27;s Volumizing Foam.</li>
      <li>and I have used it for many years!</li>
      <li>So glad to get it!</li>
      <li>so he swears that this shampoo keeps it looking nice.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is good but the Progaine shampoo 2 in one I prefer better.</li>
      <li>, it made my very fine coloured hair look healther, thicker and the colour even looked brighter</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product, just don&#x27;t pay more than $7 for it....</li>
      <li>I like to think it helps, to make me feel better.  </li>
      <li>maybe it does :  )</li>
      <li>my wife likes it because it gives her hair more volume and helps to reduce the lose of any more hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything over the years and this works better than anything else that I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a CVS plug (except for being able to buy Progaine</li>
      <li>Progaine leaves my hair more manageable and easier to comb.</li>
      <li>I wish they would have advertised it more because once people tried it, they would never have switched over to anything else.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about five years or more.  </li>
      <li>Just good, gentle shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since it originally came out.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t swear that it is preventing breakage or stimulating regrowth, but the overall affect is good.</li>
      <li>They are willing to pay exorbitant prices--why don&#x27;t they make this shampoo any longer?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s evident that people like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>In order to pay such a high price this product should me magical but it´s not.</li>
      <li>It is really great shampoo for my hair which is thin and sparse.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product for thin, body-less hair.  </li>
      <li>It creates a very rich lather and doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh.</li>
      <li>But as far as shampoos go, I think it is more beneficial to thinning hair than your everyday</li>
      <li>so I could have stocked up at the old price.</li>
      <li>l&#x27;m using all my other shampoos first, l do not like to throw away anything)</li>
      <li>One has come close, thank goodness, but it still lacks that main ingredient that allows for lots of body with absolutely no heaviness/weighing-down of the hair.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and am annoyed that it is suddenly unavailable.</li>

    <li> I ordered this for my Mother cause we cannot find this around our area.  She loves it.  She says it makes her hair grow.</li>
    <li> my wife likes it because it gives her hair more volume and helps to reduce the lose of any more hair.</li>
    <li> Progaine Volumizing shampoo is the only shampoo I use. It never seems to leave any build-up and definitely does what it says it does-- Volumizes. I used to use Progaine Volumizing Foam, but they quit making it. I was so frustrated because it was the BEST body building product for thin hair that has ever been on the market. I wish they would have advertised it more because once people tried it, they would never have switched over to anything else. (Some people seemed to be under the impression that it was supposed to make hair grow....no, no, no. That&#x27;s ROgaine.) Actually, I would think that Progaine Volumizing Shampoo would work well with any sort of hair: thick or thin. I just hope that they do not stop making it! (I&#x27;ve been trying all sorts of foams--expensive, inexpensive, and middle-of-the-road, and I have yet to find one that&#x27;s as good as Progaine&#x27;s Volumizing Foam. One has come close, thank goodness, but it still lacks that main ingredient that allows for lots of body with absolutely no heaviness/weighing-down of the hair. Oh, another major plus with the foam was that you could put it on wet or dry hair, and it worked just as well either way.) Well, the shampoo is still here and works great, so please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look as thin in the problem areas when using this product on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful that I found Progaine here at Amazon.  It has been getting harder to find and also going up in price.  I have been using it for about five years or more.  I definitely positively adds volume and I would hate to live without it.  The vendors probably don&#x27;t make enough profit on it.  Otherwise why not sell it?</li>
    <li> been using it a while. . . I like to think it helps, to make me feel better.  maybe it does :  )</li>
    <li> Terrific product!! It is the best I have ever used and I have used it for many years! So glad to get it!</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo for years.  The bad news is, it is becoming extremely difficult to find and the price has gone up quite a bit.</li>
    <li> l have not use the shampoos that l ordered yet, ( l&#x27;m using all my other shampoos first, l do not like to throw away anything) but, l pick up a bottle before and l use it and too my amazement, it made my very fine coloured hair look healther, thicker and the colour even looked brighter, even my hairdresser thought that my hair was a bit thicker so l was wishing that one bottle will never ends but sadly, it did, so l did my research to get some more until l got onto your site, so l cant wait to finish all my other bottles and start back once again on progaine which l know will improved my hair by ten folds.  So if you had ten stars l would give it that, because to me it was (sorry) bloody good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s evident that people like this shampoo. They are willing to pay exorbitant prices--why don&#x27;t they make this shampoo any longer?</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and am annoyed that it is suddenly unavailable. I won&#x27;t pay ridiculous prices for it. I like it because it is &amp;#34;no frills.&amp;#34; No exotic color or scent. Just good, gentle shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good but the Progaine shampoo 2 in one I prefer better. I don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it originally came out.  It&#x27;s a great product for thin, body-less hair.  Was sorry to see it being phased out of those stores that used to carry it.  My last purchase at CVS was for $6.95 for a 12 oz. bottle.  It&#x27;s a long way from that to $22.00 for 12 oz.  Wish I had seen this coming so I could have stocked up at the old price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about twice a week, alternating with a color-preserving shampoo, and I feel like my hair is healthier than before I started using this. I can&#x27;t swear that it is preventing breakage or stimulating regrowth, but the overall affect is good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Progaine shampoo for about 20 years. It is really great shampoo for my hair which is thin and sparse. In drug stores Progaine is more expensive than others, but is quite concentrated so a bottle lasts a long time when compared to other shampoos. Progaine leaves my hair more manageable and easier to comb. However, a bottle costs $6-7; at CVS on-line it is $6.99. The price quoted here is either a mistake, or worse - an attempt to trick customers into thinking this is a drug to cure balding which it is not! This is just very nice shampoo for balding heads. It is a great product but buy it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have thin mousy hair and this product genuinely helps give my hair volume.  I have tried everything over the years and this works better than anything else that I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> To expensive comparied with other products.</li>
    <li> This is just a volumizing shampoo. It does nothing to stimulate the scalp, balance pH, or cause hair to regrowth like Bosley or Nioxin.</li>
    <li> At age 67, my husband&#x27;s hair is getting a little thisn so he swears that this shampoo keeps it looking nice.</li>
    <li> me dice mi hermana que es bueno a ella le alluda&lt;br /&gt;mucho para el cuero cabelludo,&lt;br /&gt;se lo recomiendo yo lo estoy tratando.</li>
    <li> What is going on with the price for this Shampoo? It is $90 per bottle???  I cannot continue buying it at this price levels. In order to pay such a high price this product should me magical but it´s not.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo on amazon last year. I like it quite a bit. It creates a very rich lather and doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh. As for its hair restorative qualities, well it has none. But as far as shampoos go, I think it is more beneficial to thinning hair than your everyday shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but about 6 months ago this went from $6 a bottle to about $20 a bottle on amazon. Doing a simple web search I found that just about ever vendor of this shampoo on the web did the same price hike. The single vendor that didn&#x27;t was CVS. This isn&#x27;t a CVS plug (except for being able to buy Progaine I couldn&#x27;t care less about CVS), do a web search and look for yourself. They usually have some sort of 15-25% off promo code (found elsewhere online) that can be applied to your order aswell. I just ordered 9 bottles of Prograine with shipping included for $52.34. I just wanted to pass this tidbit of information along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, just don&#x27;t pay more than $7 for it.... it is only shampoo after all.</li>
    <li> No obvious results yet even though its being used daily.  What gives?  Would not recommend this product unless you are really desperate.</li>
