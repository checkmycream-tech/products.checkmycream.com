      <li>Not as good as L&amp;#34;Oreal Sublime Glow.  </li>
      <li>So if you can deal with it then it&#x27;s good for you.</li>

      <li>This tans nicely.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s best to stay away from close contact with others--many are sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
      <li>BEST PRODUCT DISCONTINUED UNFORTUNATELY MOST NATURAL TAN EVER.  </li>
      <li>I have tried MANY sunless tanners in my day and this is by far the BEST one out there.</li>
      <li>Re self-tanning lotion in general, my dermatologist told me that it&#x27;s the best, safest way to &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>However, it is too strong on its own.  </li>
      <li>It no longer has SPF and the color is much more orange.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use self tanners many times and didn&#x27;t have this experience.  </li>
      <li>love the stuff.</li>
      <li>I use it to bring a healthy look on my face.</li>
      <li>I mostly use it for my face and throat.  </li>
      <li>It smells ok going on then after it dries</li>
      <li>(I only use it summers on my legs); cost is very good; does not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>This is great and does build a natural tan .</li>
      <li>Smells good and gets you ready for summer.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong fragrance for 1/2 the day, so&lt;br</li>
      <li>If used by itself it can be too strong looking, but the mix works</li>
      <li>The fragance is fine.</li>
      <li>I then take a tissue and lightly blot my knees, and ankle bones.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no longer for sale in stores, so I&#x27;m thankful that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this lotion, and have used it for ten years or more.</li>
      <li>; pleasant scent and just enough creaminess, not oily;</li>
      <li>Good product overall.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s true of any self tanner.  </li>
      <li>Nothing exciting though.</li>
      <li>Price is right though</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of this product, and was happy when SPF 15 was added to it last year.  </li>
      <li>This product has been part of my summer (no hose) routine for two years because it has a natural look, covers easily, and has no odor.  </li>
      <li>Very Very Clean-looking results.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered and wanted</li>
      <li>minimal streaking compared to some; I keep getting compliments on the nice tan on my legs</li>
      <li>the lotion is white but in a little bit you are the beautiful tone.</li>
      <li>You really need to rub it in evenly</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this and use it up.</li>
      <li>FAST DELIVERY</li>
      <li>The previous formula was much more forgiving and built to a gradual tan.</li>
      <li>The product description for this item includes the sunscreen element, however, the product I received was an older version, without the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Have used this product for about 10  years and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I just smile and say working outside.</li>
      <li>By doing this I use less of it and avoid getting streaks if I miss rubbing it real well in certain areas that tend to stain more than others such as the knees, ankles, and elbows because of rougher skin or natural lines.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.</li>
      <li>Looks natural everyone asks how did I get my tan?</li>
      <li>natural looks like a summer tan without looking like</li>
      <li>I put it on at night and it looks quite natural in the morning.  </li>
      <li>it keeps me brown/tanned all summer, and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable and better than other expensive ones I have been using this product for 5 years love it.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t have the positive experience of other reviewers.</li>
      <li>Ok but not great.  </li>
      <li>It does not smell foul, like  other sunless tanners do and it really moisturizes my skin.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, too, which makes it worth the cost.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it.  Streaked. Did not give you an even tan, no matter how hard you tried.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells good and gets you ready for summer.</li>
    <li> Not as good as L&amp;#34;Oreal Sublime Glow.  Too yellow, perfumey smell.</li>
    <li> I have broken out in horrible itchy hives because of this product, and have never had this problem with any other self tanners. I thought maybe something else had caused my hives so I tried it again and it was definitely this! Will NEVER try another L&#x27;Oreal tanner again.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice tan after 3-4 hours. But the smell lingers all day. I can&#x27;t take the smell. It smells ok going on then after it dries it has the tanner smell that they all have. I really wanted to like this and use it up. But due to the smell I can&#x27;t. It also interferes with my perfume. So if you can deal with it then it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and wanted</li>
    <li> Works well.  Wash hand after applying.</li>
    <li> Ok but not great.  Make lines and not easy to put on.  Don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.  Price is right though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this lotion, and have used it for ten years or more. It&#x27;s no longer for sale in stores, so I&#x27;m thankful that it&#x27;s available on Amazon. Re self-tanning lotion in general, my dermatologist told me that it&#x27;s the best, safest way to &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This tans nicely. I mostly use it for my face and throat.  However, it is too strong on its own.  I make a 50/50 mix of my daily moisturizer (my night cream is too thick) and this.  I put it on at night and it looks quite natural in the morning.  If used by itself it can be too strong looking, but the mix works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for my legs the same way -- a 50/50 mix of body lotion with this.  You really need to rub it in evenly so you don&#x27;t get any streaks -- but that&#x27;s true of any self tanner.  I do the tops of my feet up to my thigh.  I then take a tissue and lightly blot my knees, and ankle bones.  I find on a boney area like knees and ankles, it can be uneven, and a simple blotting does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might sound complicated, but it truly isn&#x27;t.  I just keep a small plastic container in my medicine cabinet and when I feel I look a little too pale put equal amounts of my lotion and this tanner in it, mix with my finger, smear on rubbing in well and evenly, blot my ankle &amp; knee with a tissue, and wash my hands.  I&#x27;ve used it for years this way.  Straight out of the bottle can look too fake or be too tan.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this product, and was happy when SPF 15 was added to it last year.  The product description for this item includes the sunscreen element, however, the product I received was an older version, without the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Put this on my legs after I showered yesterday. Did a second application a couple of hours later. By end of day, I had the start of a nice, natural-looking tan. However, after I showered the this morning I discovered that my (white) towel now has brown stains all over it. So be warned: either air dry after a shower or don&#x27;t use this. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Why I re-bought this; pleasant scent and just enough creaminess, not oily; minimal streaking compared to some; I keep getting compliments on the nice tan on my legs (I only use it summers on my legs); cost is very good; does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> The best! I don&#x27;t understand why the stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore and they sell the ugly  sticky ones. You just  follow the instructions and you Will get beautiful color wear gloves the lotion is white but in a little bit you are the beautiful tone. It&#x27;s affordable and better than other expensive ones I have been using this product for 5 years love it.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Good color and pleasant scent. Would buy again. Great delivery time-,thanks!</li>
    <li> This is great and does build a natural tan . I wash my hands well and never have a problem with staining.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak. Very natural looking. Use in the summer to enhance my tan and in winter to maintain it. Have used this product for about 10  years and highly recommend it. Great price with amazon!</li>
    <li> Sticky, streaky.  Horrible product. I&#x27;ve use self tanners many times and didn&#x27;t have this experience.  I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t have the positive experience of other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Very Very Clean-looking results. No splotching or over-colored areas. Good Product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I use it to bring a healthy look on my face. Looks natural everyone asks how did I get my tan? I just smile and say working outside. Its December in NY.</li>
    <li> Good product overall. You do have to use it often or the tan effect will vanish in a matter of 3 or 4 days- especially if you scrub your skin often when showering. The fragance is fine. Nothing exciting though. I usually mix it up with another regular body lotion so it is not too concentrated this way. By doing this I use less of it and avoid getting streaks if I miss rubbing it real well in certain areas that tend to stain more than others such as the knees, ankles, and elbows because of rougher skin or natural lines.</li>
    <li> it keeps me brown/tanned all summer, and looks natural.  It does have a strong fragrance for 1/2 the day, so&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s best to stay away from close contact with others--many are sensitive to perfumes.  Read instructions on container.&lt;br /&gt;Let it dry well prior to dressing.  Wash your hands well to remove residue from hands after applying so&lt;br /&gt;they aren&#x27;t dyed too.  Tan on body last about 4 days.  I do not apply it to face.</li>
    <li> very good product, stunning tanning :-)</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT DISCONTINUED UNFORTUNATELY MOST NATURAL TAN EVER.  FAST DELIVERY</li>
    <li> This was not the product as described. It was not the SPF 15 tanning lotion. I have always used the SPF version and loved it. I ordered 4 and used it once thinking it was the same. It is NOT. The cream is not as thick and is much more difficult to put on evenly. My tan was horribly streaky. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY sunless tanners in my day and this is by far the BEST one out there. It always makes me look sunkissed and gives me a beautiful glow. I have to buy two at a time in fear that these will not be made anymore. It does not smell foul, like  other sunless tanners do and it really moisturizes my skin. love the stuff. &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly..slightly orange in color</li>
    <li> This product has been part of my summer (no hose) routine for two years because it has a natural look, covers easily, and has no odor.  A little goes a long way, too, which makes it worth the cost.  I am fair-skinned.  Medium natural looks like a summer tan without looking like you painted it on.</li>
    <li> This self-tanning lotion has changed formulas since the last time I purchased it. It no longer has SPF and the color is much more orange. It was more difficult to blend, leaving me with orange streaks. The previous formula was much more forgiving and built to a gradual tan. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanning cream I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> I bought it and just got it yesterday.  It turned me orange and i have lines. I followed the instructions but it turned me orange with marks.  I would not buy this item again.</li>
