      <li>No flaking, no clogging, easy to use spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>spray bottle produces a fine mist.</li>

      <li>Fortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger for more than a day on clothing, but after twenty minutes of ironing, I was ready to puke.</li>

      <li>This was a real find to get (6) bottles at this price!  </li>
      <li>This is the scent of real starch!</li>
      <li>The finish is different as well, sharper and more crisp.</li>
      <li>Bought my first bottle at a store but have not been able to find it in any stores since my initial purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not really a heavy starch</li>

<li> This product is my favorite for starching fabric before cutting it for quilts.</li>

<li> I get this for a couple dollars or less in those well-known big box stores, so consider buying the product locally (or at least checking on the price) before you pay the inflated Amazon price.</li>
<li> IT ALSO CAUSES QUITE A MESS ON THE FLOOR FROM OVER SPRAY.</li>
<li> I can squirt a little and not have a ton come out like the aerosol sprays.  </li>
<li> I use heavy starch on the rest of the shirts, and use this non-starch spray on the collars since starch causes him to itch and suffer.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t clog the iron, the smell is subtle, and it makes the iron glide over clothing.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on my husband&#x27;s dress shirt collars.  I use heavy starch on the rest of the shirts, and use this non-starch spray on the collars since starch causes him to itch and suffer.  I used to find it at Walmart very inexpensively, but now I can only find it online at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes ironing smooth and easy and doesn&#x27;t leave flakes or spots, and most of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate his neck.  It only takes a second to use this spray on the collar and regular starch on the rest, and it makes a big difference to him when he&#x27;s got a shirt buttoned around his neck all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew what this was made from, because I&#x27;d make my own.  I&#x27;ve used Downy Wrinkle Releaser on his collars and that works, but not as nicely.</li>
    <li> I stopped being able to find this locally so turned to Amazon. This was a real find to get (6) bottles at this price!  I must confess my husband irons his own shirts and he loves this spray starch!</li>
    <li> The starch part of this is fine, it&#x27;s the \\&quot;fresh linen scent\\&quot; odor that I have a problem with. Fortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger for more than a day on clothing, but after twenty minutes of ironing, I was ready to puke. I also learned that commercial spray starches contain formaldehyde to prevent the starch from rotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle produces a fine mist. I reused the bottle and made my own spray starch by adding a tablespoon of corn starch with two cups of water. The result, spray starch for pennies a bottle! Add a drop or two of lemon juice or essential oils, and store in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be a victim of the commercial spray starch industry! Make your own and save!</li>
    <li> This product is the best of its kind.  It smells wonderful while ironing, but the scent does not linger.  No flaking, no clogging, easy to use spray bottle.  I purchased 6 bottles just to make sure I have it on hand.  My clothes are nicely pressed and perfect.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT DOES NOT IMPART A FRESH LINEN SCENT AND DOES FLAKE. IT ALSO CAUSES QUITE A MESS ON THE FLOOR FROM OVER SPRAY. I DID HAVE THE PROPER HEAT SETTING AND USED IT ON JEANS. I WILL NEVER USE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This spray starch is the best ever! I can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores in my area.  So glad that Amazon sells it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not really a heavy starch it is just light and makes ironing a breeze.</li>
    <li> So nice not to have to deal with the aerosol cans and clogging.  Had to order a lot but price was great in quantity and everything arrived in good shape and on time. Shared some with neighbors.</li>
    <li> This is the best spray starch. It smells great and works great. As a quilter I need to stabilize my fabrics just a touch to give me nice clean cuts and crisp sewn points.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this on line. Non-aerosol is the way to go. Why it is no longer sold in stores I do not understand, but, I&#x27;m very happy that it is still made and available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the sort of person who is willing to take the time to starch and iron bed linens. If you&#x27;ve used only the standard types of starch in a spray can, you&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference between that and this non-aerosol starch. This product goes on easier and has a genuine delightful fresh linen/starch aroma that stays in the fabric instead of disappearing after it&#x27;s been ironed. It&#x27;s not overwhelming but definitely noticeable, and quite unlike the fake \\&quot;linen\\&quot; odor of so many products. This is the scent of real starch! The finish is different as well, sharper and more crisp. Do, however, remember to check the price locally against the Amazon price. I get this for a couple dollars or less in those well-known big box stores, so consider buying the product locally (or at least checking on the price) before you pay the inflated Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I love this kind of starch for quilting.  I like that I can squirt a little and not have a ton come out like the aerosol sprays.  I can never find it in the store (Walmart, Kmart, or Target), so I was happy to pay shipping for the case.  I will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than aerosol.  Would recommend because aerosols continually clog.</li>
    <li> I prefer non-aerosol to aerosol, so this is great.  FYI, this product comes 6 in a case.  So, if you order 1, you get 6.</li>
    <li> I work in a uniform job.  Wife prefers Niagara starch in the pump bottle.  No longer available localy.  Bought a case, arrived in excellent condition.  Wife is happy and that really what matters.  PS. I look better is a starched shirt (ha ha).</li>
    <li> I iron a lot, and this is the best starch I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t clog the iron, the smell is subtle, and it makes the iron glide over clothing. I iron everything from sheets to kids&#x27; clothes to linen and dress clothes. The floor does get sticky around my ironing board, but it always does from excess spray -- I love that this is non-aerosol and the starch doesn&#x27;t fly up in my face while ironing.</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite for starching fabric before cutting it for quilts. It has a pleasant fragrance and works great. Bought my first bottle at a store but have not been able to find it in any stores since my initial purchase. Was so glad to find it on line. Did get quite a bit more than I was expecting (quantity wise), but will certainly use it and pass some along to my quilting friends.</li>
    <li> Helps your iron glide across the cloths with ease. This product gives your ironed cloths the crispness and smooth out look you need. The garments stay looking ironed while you are wearing them. Fantastic starch product I recommend this starch to any body who still irons their cloths. Works great on my husbands white RN uniforms.</li>
