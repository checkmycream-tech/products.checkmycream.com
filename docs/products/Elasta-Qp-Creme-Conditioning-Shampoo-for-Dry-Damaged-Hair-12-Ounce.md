      <li>MOST TIMES</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>They are the shampoo for relaxed hair (which I love), and this creme conditioning shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Ingredients before the change did not include any sulfate and had more vitamins.  </li>

      <li>The lather is so rich and moisturizing and a dab will do you!</li>
      <li>Great product to use for going natural trust me</li>
      <li>THIS IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE BEST SHAMPOO EVER CREATED!!!!!  </li>
      <li>I did this leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized but not stripped like most shampoos out there</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo hands down that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>..., I FIND THIS SHAMPOO TO BE PERFECTLY FANTASTIC.  </li>
      <li>it is sulfate free</li>
      <li>I wanted to try a shampoo that was sulfate free to keep some moisture in my hair.</li>
      <li>I was looking for an affordable, sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>As soon as I open the top I loved the way it smelled.</li>
      <li>These is the first shampoo that I fell in love with.  </li>
      <li>It also does not have sulfates in the mixture which make me happy as I am trying to avoid using any products on my already dry hair that have petrolatum, sulfates or mineral oil.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t care too much about how good a shampoo is,</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp good enough.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was getting clean because I exercise regularly and sweat a lot in my head and need a good cleaning.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Texture of product was true.</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo several times and it is one of the best for relaxed 4b/c type Afro American hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this shampoo and highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>, I WAS MORE THAN PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!  </li>
      <li>Normally shampoos strip my kinky hair of any love</li>
      <li>I regularly use and prefer Elasta QP&#x27;s Shampoo for Relaxed Hair (works on color treated and natural hair, not just relaxed hair) since it restores hairs natural ph and gives me great moisture with a nice slip, along with its detangling properties.  </li>
      <li>but I love it so far!  </li>
      <li>I bought this based on the reviews and after my first application, I am not disappointed at all.</li>
      <li>So many people recommend cowashing when you are natural, but that just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
      <li>After my shampoo my hair was soft and my scalp was clean and itch free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and gets my scalp clean.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure it was sulfate and sodium free and moisturizing to my dry hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this to my sister who has less hair than me, because she used it and loved it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair so soft and easy to detangle</li>
      <li>IN FACT IT STRONGLY REMINDS ME OF THE OLD FORMULA OF CREME OF NATURE CONDITIONING SHAMPOO.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle on my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>THE ONLY WAY THAT I&#x27;VE BEEN ABLE TO GET A COMB THRU MY HAIR AFTER REMOVING THEM IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THIS SHAMPOO.  </li>
      <li>BEING A STICKLER FOR NATURAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE FREE OF SULFATES, MINERAL OIL &amp; PETROLATUM, ETC</li>
      <li>I run in the opposite direction of crowds and this product had way too many positice reviews-</li>
      <li>after reading up on info I felt knowledeable enough to take better care of my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos just because I always wonder if I&#x27;m going to like another one better than this one.</li>
      <li>it was listed as a top ten moisturizing shampoo</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for several months now and am in love.</li>
      <li>Watch how you pour this in your hands because it&#x27;s very slippery and will slide right out of your hands.</li>
      <li>But it does the job of cleaning and leaving the hair soft, like a real sls free shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for going on 2 years and it leaves my hair clean without stripping all my natural oils.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what you would want in a shampoo; cleans well but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stripped, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I did find it yesterday in Walgreens (in the hood of course) and I found the intense conditioner to go with it for the first time there as well.</li>
      <li>All times my hair felt soft after using it, but during the week after washing my scalp would be super irritated.</li>
      <li>It smells nice (subtle and clean) and lathers really well.</li>
      <li>Also, it arrived very timely considering the large order I placed w/ Amazon.</li>
      <li>You dont even need to use but so much.</li>
      <li>My wife does an oil-treatment and use a clarifying shampoo on Sundays, so she was looking for a shampoo that she could use once or twice during the week without drying her hair out too much.</li>
      <li>That aside, it lathers very well, which I&#x27;ve missed from my 2 prior shampoos, my hair is left moisturized, feels amazing and is not tangled at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a lot of slip to be a shampoo.</li>
      <li>I like to follow it with the Intense conditioner.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve really seen much results.</li>
      <li>It suds really well.</li>
      <li>My scalp was really itchy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sud up though, but it really doesn&#x27;t need to.</li>

    <li> I love Elasta&#x27;s products. We have well water in our home.  Elasta makes two shampoos specifically for hard water and well water. They are the shampoo for relaxed hair (which I love), and this creme conditioning shampoo.  After trying the shampoo for relaxed hair I was very excited to try the creme conditioning shampoo.  It promised to moisturize and detangle plus combat the bad effects of well water.  It did detangle my hair during and after the shampoo, but my hair dried stiff and hard with a residue on it.  My scalp was really itchy. I got online and figured out that I needed a clarifying shampoo.  I went back to my staple shampoo (creme of nature) to remove all the residue  and build up on my hair and scalp. After my shampoo my hair was soft and my scalp was clean and itch free. I really don&#x27;t understand what went wrong, but this shampoo is not a good fit for my itchy dry scalp. I will stick to the shampoo for relaxed hair (it&#x27;s the bomb!).  Someone please let me know if you know what went wrong with this shampoo. I am really puzzled.  So many people love it, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best sulfate-free shampoo! The lather is so rich and moisturizing and a dab will do you! I had been looking for a shampoo that was sulfate free for my dry relaxed hair. After shampooing my hair is silky and tangle-free...I love this shampooooooo!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an affordable, sulfate free shampoo. I bought this based on the reviews and after my first application, I am not disappointed at all. The thickness of it takes a bit of using too, it lathers but not as much as my usual shampoo. But it does the job of cleaning and leaving the hair soft, like a real sls free shampoo. No overpowering smell. Will see how it gets in the long run but I love it so far!  I used this for many years, it was a staple. now it has sulfate....never again</li>
    <li> I have to say this is the first shampoo I have ever used in my entire life that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel uber stringy and dry after washing it. Normally shampoos strip my kinky hair of any love but this one actually leaves it feeling soft! So when I use conditioner it feels like I won the soft hair lottery! Yaaay me!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for people with normally very dry hair. Hope my review helped.</li>
    <li> This the second bottle i have bought on amazon. it is a very useful product; especially when combined with the elasta QP gel.</li>
    <li> THIS IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE BEST SHAMPOO EVER CREATED!!!!!  BEING A STICKLER FOR NATURAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE FREE OF SULFATES, MINERAL OIL &amp; PETROLATUM, ETC..., I FIND THIS SHAMPOO TO BE PERFECTLY FANTASTIC.  LIKE LOTS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN THESE DAYS, KEEPING MY RELAXED HAIR IN A HEALTHIER STATE HAS BECOME OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO ME.  MY HAIR IS THICK &amp; VERY COARSE-I BELIEVE IT TO BE 4B &amp; 4C.  IT DRINKS UP MOISTURE IN AN INSTANT, SO I AM PRONE TO EXTREME KINKS, TANGLES &amp; DRYNESS.  WHEN I TRIED THIS SHAMPOO BASED ON IT&#x27;S PROMISING LIST OF INGREDIENTS, I WAS MORE THAN PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!  I WEAR MICROBRAIDS OFTEN AND MOST TIMES I GO ALL THE WAY UP TO 3 MTHS.  THE ONLY WAY THAT I&#x27;VE BEEN ABLE TO GET A COMB THRU MY HAIR AFTER REMOVING THEM IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THIS SHAMPOO.  IT DETANGLES &amp; SOFTENS LIKE NO OTHER!!!  IN FACT IT STRONGLY REMINDS ME OF THE OLD FORMULA OF CREME OF NATURE CONDITIONING SHAMPOO.  NOTHING ELSE HAS COME CLOSE YET.  I MAY STILL TRY OTHERS IN THE FUTURE JUST FOR CURIOSITY&#x27;S SAKE, BUT FOR NOW AND POSSIBLY A LOOOONG TIME TO COME, THIS IS MY SHAMPOO!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year since i have been natural and this shampoo has my hair so soft. It almost feels like butter.I love this shampoo and highly recommend it! Its also sulfate free and fights against hard water. This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good natural black hair! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a lot of slip to be a shampoo. Watch how you pour this in your hands because it&#x27;s very slippery and will slide right out of your hands. You do not need a lot because it&#x27;s make excellent suds! It detangle your hair for you. This is a great shampoo!</li>
    <li> I was tired of using my previous shampoo, Hair One - which I used for about 2 years as a cheaper alternative to the expensive Wen I ran out of.  Not that Wen or even Hair One are bad products, I just felt I wasn&#x27;t getting the fantastic results that others were.  Anyway, I decided to find a new shampoo.  I wanted to make sure it was sulfate and sodium free and moisturizing to my dry hair.  Detangling would be a bonus.  Well, I saw rave reviews on a haircare website about this product and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very thick and kind of like a gel when it comes out.  I mention this because it takes some getting used to as it will easily glop out the bottle into your hand and keep sliding right onto the shower floor, heading down the drain.  So be careful.  That aside, it lathers very well, which I&#x27;ve missed from my 2 prior shampoos, my hair is left moisturized, feels amazing and is not tangled at all.  This is BEFORE I apply any conditioner.  I think it&#x27;s awesome.  I&#x27;m glad I tried this shampoo and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Instantly softened my Trinbagonian textured hair and no shampoo have ever done that before. Trust me I have used a LOT. Hopefully the company can make this into a 32 or 64oz size, that was the only regret and PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue because you will make a lot of people unhappy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Elasta QP products for a very long time.  This product smells good but I did not like the slip it provided and it did not give my hair the moisture I desired.  I regularly use and prefer Elasta QP&#x27;s Shampoo for Relaxed Hair (works on color treated and natural hair, not just relaxed hair) since it restores hairs natural ph and gives me great moisture with a nice slip, along with its detangling properties.  If this Shampoo for Dry Damaged Hair does not work for you then I highly recommend trying Elasta QP&#x27;s Shampoo for Relaxed Hair.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing and detangling shampoo. I like to follow it with the Intense conditioner. I get less split ends and my hair is at least 3 inches longer in the first year.</li>
    <li> Great product to use for going natural trust me I&#x27;ve tried it all. Also just because it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a great product for those who like to look at price tags.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy to see that this shampoo now includes sulfate which is a big &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; for women of color who are natural.  I am not sure when the change occurred...but it was not what I was expecting.  Ingredients before the change did not include any sulfate and had more vitamins.  What a bomber!  If it were not for this...would have given the product  5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Product: Texture of product was true. Good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery: okay</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling brittle and dry like some shampoos do. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and gets my scalp clean. It doesn&#x27;t sud up though, but it really doesn&#x27;t need to. Very gentle on my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! I can honestly say it is now my favorite of all the shampoos I have used..and I have used just about all of them! You name it I&#x27;ve tried it! Now that I&#x27;ve learned how to take care of my (relaxed) hair I know which products work best for me. My hair tends to be dry ALOT so I need products that help my hair to stay conditioned &amp; moisturized. I noticed my hair has stopped breaking since I started using this product. It is a permanent part of my hair care regimen from now on along with the deep penetrating conditioner. Using this line of products will definitely get me to my hair length goal much sooner. 5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> The company changed the formulation of the shampoo, and now instead of being sulfate-free, it has sodium lauryl ether sulfate as its second ingredient. It&#x27;s so difficult for me to find a moisturizing sulfate-free shampoo, and I am very disappointed that they would change such a great formulation</li>
    <li> OMG!! I should have purchased this aeons ago. This is exactly what you would want in a shampoo; cleans well but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stripped, very moisturizing. Seems to bring your hair back into balance. I&#x27;m natural 4C, and this is the bomb.com- Give it a try you will not be disappointed. Also, it arrived very timely considering the large order I placed w/ Amazon.</li>
    <li> It made my hair oily and it made it look dirty after using it. My hair feels heavy and does not feel soft. Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this product deserves one. I have been using this shampoo for several months now and am in love. I will never switch to another shampoo because this does it&#x27;s job and more without stripping my hair. I have been fully natural for about 15 months ( transitioned for 6 months) and this leaves my hair so soft and moisturized. So many people recommend cowashing when you are natural, but that just didn&#x27;t work for me and I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was getting clean because I exercise regularly and sweat a lot in my head and need a good cleaning. The only problem is this shampoo is so hard to find in beauty supply stores! I did find it yesterday in Walgreens (in the hood of course) and I found the intense conditioner to go with it for the first time there as well. I&#x27;m really excited to try them together because the shampoo is amazing on it&#x27;s own, and to combine it with the conditioner...it&#x27;s going to be amazing!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a shampoo that was sulfate free to keep some moisture in my hair. I&#x27;ve used this on three separate occasions. All times my hair felt soft after using it, but during the week after washing my scalp would be super irritated. It just doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp good enough. Also, I feel I have to use a lot of product to get a good lather that&#x27;s spreadable. I&#x27;m giving this to my sister who has less hair than me, because she used it and loved it.</li>
    <li> These is the first shampoo that I fell in love with.  As soon as I open the top I loved the way it smelled. The shampoo is nice and thick and foams up well. It feels more like a conditioner than a shampoo.  It detangled my hair great.  These is a great product.  I also love Elasta QP mango butter and the gel (which has no alcohol in it)</li>
    <li> My wife does an oil-treatment and use a clarifying shampoo on Sundays, so she was looking for a shampoo that she could use once or twice during the week without drying her hair out too much. This works. She says she finds it leaves a residue if it is the only shampoo used.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome!!! It strengthens your hair and give it a great healthy look. I love it and I notice a difference after a few shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the beginning of my taking back control of my hair...I have what&#x27;s typed as 4a/4b coarse hair, Oh my goodness my hair broke tons of combs, I was scared to do my hair and would leave it up to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;But after reading up on info I felt knowledeable enough to take better care of my hair. Longer story short I was at first wary of this product -normally I run in the opposite direction of crowds and this product had way too many positice reviews- I took the leap of faith anyway and let me tell you: THIS PRODUCT IS JUST THAT GREAT! I HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FOR THIS REVIEW (ANY FOR THAT MATTER) BUT THIS THICK CREAMY SHAMPOO INSTANTLY MELTED MY TANGLES. If you are looking for a moisturing shampoo BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;- mytwistedtreat</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve really seen much results.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, work well.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo several times and it is one of the best for relaxed 4b/c type Afro American hair. It also does not have sulfates in the mixture which make me happy as I am trying to avoid using any products on my already dry hair that have petrolatum, sulfates or mineral oil. I would recommend using this shampoo if you find the other more expensive sulfate free shampoos for this type of hair a bit of a hassle to find or get.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo hands down that I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve been using it for going on 2 years and it leaves my hair clean without stripping all my natural oils. I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos just because I always wonder if I&#x27;m going to like another one better than this one. But I always come back. Love it!</li>
    <li> Normally a shampoo leaves my fine processed hair so dry and over stripped that there is nearly no way to comb it out without using conditioner.  This shampoo leaves my hair so soft and easy to detangle it&#x27;s like I used a cream conditioner and a leave in.  It smells nice (subtle and clean) and lathers really well.</li>
    <li> this is a nice shampoo. I really don&#x27;t care too much about how good a shampoo is, lol i never notice a difference unless its just terrible but I loveeeeed the conditioner &amp;#34;intense fortifying conditioner&amp;#34; the BEST CONDITIONER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I found out about this product through hairlista (a hair care forum) it was listed as a top ten moisturizing shampoo so I decided to purchase it. I am really happy I did this leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized but not stripped like most shampoos out there I am also happy the shampoo is sulfate free. I am on my second bottle of this and I also buy the QP DPR deep conditioner to pair with this I love both products.</li>
    <li> Wow putting this shampoo in my hair is like putting conditioner in my hair!! This shampoo instantly detangles and relaxes and softens my tough 4c african american hair! I never used a shampoo that made my nappy hair feel so soft and manageable. It suds really well. You dont even need to use but so much. This stuff has amazing slip and spreads through the hair so easy. I luv the peppermint smell of it too. Its also has some very good natural ingredients in it as well. This will not strip your hair at all. This will definitely add moisture while clarifying at the same time.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best shampoo i have ever used. it is sulfate free and it does not dry out your hair. it makes your hair very soft. i recommend it for everyone that is looking for a good, cheap sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> Its lathers, but keep your hair very moisturized, soft and silky. I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
