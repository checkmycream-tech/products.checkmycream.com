### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I notice a difference when I use another product - this extends the life of my hair color substantially - especially bright reds and purples - to the point that my hairdresser asked what I had been using.</li>
      <li>Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>Best conditioner yet!</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful</li>
      <li>Great conditioner.</li>
      <li>It does great for maintaining your hair after a keratin treatment.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obviously best when I can keep up with the blowout treatments, but this alone is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>The smell  isn&#x27;t very appealing though.</li>
      <li>Great works as it says and is a lot more affordable here then at the salons</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I needed and for a great price.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Really love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>But the best part is, months later, after the product is long gone from my hair, I continue to use the product and am still getting great results.</li>
      <li>This is a must have with the shampoo and don&#x27;t buy at a salon with their huge markups.</li>
      <li>since I am avoiding chemicals on my body I have switched to chemical free shampoo and conditioners.</li>
      <li>I had the Brazilian Blowout treatment done at the salon and paid full price for the products the first time.</li>
      <li>Product is good, but container with conditioner is not full</li>
      <li>I also love the shampoo and deep conditioning masque.</li>
      <li>Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>So I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner for the first 30-60 days to help maintain it.</li>
      <li>Products do a great job of extending life of blowout product, keeping my normally frizzy kinky curly hair, flat and relatively sleek.</li>
      <li>But every once in a while I use the Brazilian Blow out and it really gives me the no frizz guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really humid here</li>
      <li>Keeps my blowout looking sleek much longer, calms frizzy hair even if you have not had the Brazilian blowout treatment.</li>
      <li>But I love it never the less.</li>
      <li>So I use other sulfate free products when I can.</li>
      <li>live in Bombay</li>
      <li>I have super thick, frizzy hair and this conditioner makes my hair soft, shiney and frizz free.</li>
      <li>Just like the one I bought from professional hair salon, for a fraction of the price!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel and look soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>

<li> After that, I wised up and found it for much less on Amazon.</li>
<li> Made my hair fall like crazy at the shower I have a third of hair I had in only 2 weeks, i so regret buying this</li>
<li> I usually use it without the shampoo</li>
<li> You would think as expensive as the product is they could make it smell nicer.</li>

    <li> Great product! Love it. Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair! I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>

    <li> This is a great product. Makes my hair feel and look soft and shiny. I also love the shampoo and deep conditioning masque.</li>

    <li> Great conditioner. Makes my Brazillian Blowout last longer</li>
    <li> Love it. Extends my blowout</li>
    <li> Best conditioner yet! I have super thick, frizzy hair and this conditioner makes my hair soft, shiney and frizz free. Of course I have the Brazilian blowout done twice a year but I would use the conditioner regardless.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! It does great for maintaining your hair after a keratin treatment. Wish the bottle was a little larger for the price, but you are paying for a quality product!</li>
    <li> I get my Brazilian Blowout done about every 5 months. So I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner for the first 30-60 days to help maintain it. The smell  isn&#x27;t very appealing though. So I use other sulfate free products when I can. You would think as expensive as the product is they could make it smell nicer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Helps balance the frizz in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But since I am avoiding chemicals on my body I have switched to chemical free shampoo and conditioners. But every once in a while I use the Brazilian Blow out and it really gives me the no frizz guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;I live in Bombay and it&#x27;s really humid here so frizz is always the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that Brazilian blow out was non chemical.  But I love it never the less.</li>
    <li> Great works as it says and is a lot more affordable here then at the salons</li>
    <li> Regular user of this product- works well and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a must have with the shampoo and don&#x27;t buy at a salon with their huge markups. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I needed and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Made my hair fall like crazy at the shower I have a third of hair I had in only 2 weeks, i so regret buying this I used another shampoo and conditioner and it stopped then I showered again with this to see if it was the cause and there again all the falling lots of hair it clogged the bathtub</li>
    <li> Only conditioner I will use.  There is nothing else like it and I have used everything out there.  Noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I had the Brazilian Blowout treatment done at the salon and paid full price for the products the first time. After that, I wised up and found it for much less on Amazon. Products do a great job of extending life of blowout product, keeping my normally frizzy kinky curly hair, flat and relatively sleek. But the best part is, months later, after the product is long gone from my hair, I continue to use the product and am still getting great results. I notice a difference when I use another product - this extends the life of my hair color substantially - especially bright reds and purples - to the point that my hairdresser asked what I had been using. I also notice a difference in frizz and sleekness. It&#x27;s obviously best when I can keep up with the blowout treatments, but this alone is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Really love this conditioner.</li>
