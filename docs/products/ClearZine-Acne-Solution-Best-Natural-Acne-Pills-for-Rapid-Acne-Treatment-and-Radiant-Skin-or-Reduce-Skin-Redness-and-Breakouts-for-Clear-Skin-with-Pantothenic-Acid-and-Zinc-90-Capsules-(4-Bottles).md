      <li>My nose seems to be affected the most and all of my pores are clogged.</li>
      <li>Many of them worked for awhile</li>
      <li>I think for me the Thyme tinture worked better for me.</li>
      <li>and it works like magic as I don&#x27;t have too many acnes.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I tried the product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using these pills along with a Dermabrush which I also love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I am so happy with Clearzine that I am telling everyone I know that it is a product they should try if they want real results.</li>

      <li>My self confidence has gotten so much better now that my skin is looking</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better than Clearzine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I boutght this product for my nephew and he has acne for many years.  </li>
      <li>is that it it all natural and gives you a great boost of vitamins.</li>
      <li>Give it a good 7 or 8 days to really see the difference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy</li>
      <li>but I believe I will see even better results after taking finish the full course of supplements.</li>
      <li>I was using Proactive which was fine, but</li>
      <li>I do think this Clearzine is a huge part of it.</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing product I have ever found for my adult acne...</li>
      <li>enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Her skin is still quite oily but she has been able to manage that with topical benzoyl peroxide and a good moisturzer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s far more effective than anything I&#x27;ve been prescribed by a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything else to treat my acne and this is hands down the best product with the most consistent results.</li>
      <li>I am a 32 years old woman and I&#x27;ve been taking this product for two months with great results, since the first week.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 8 day&#x27;s in- taking 6 a day religiously and the improvement is just amazing!</li>
      <li>Ok, so I have been using this product almost consistently for about 8 months now.</li>
      <li>But all of our bodies are unique and</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that the oil has reduced significantly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m honestly suprised Clearzine is not more popular!</li>
      <li>I really do wish more came in a bottle.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this helped me, cause I still did have some breakouts.  </li>
      <li>and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, loving the idea of fixing my acne with natural means.</li>
      <li>The order arrived in good time already end of January, several days before the indicated date.&lt;br /&gt;You were asking for our experience:</li>
      <li>I have waited several months to review this product because I wanted to give it a fair chance.  </li>

      <li>Fast and Safe acne treatment.</li>
      <li>AND, it&#x27;s SAFE for her and natural!!!  </li>
      <li>whatever other vitamins are great for acneic skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will continue ordering it with fast friendly service!</li>
      <li>Though I have accepted that my acne is something I will have to manage for the rest of my life I think that Clearzine is a worthy investment.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to all my friends and family members who are having acne issues and have not been able to solve them.</li>
      <li>After two months, my skin was smooth for the first time in two years.</li>
      <li>We are very excited to have found something natural to help with acne!!</li>
      <li>it really looks it too!!</li>
      <li>Although my acne was being mostly kept in control from my new face regimen, but the texture and tone noticeably cleared up and became more even and clear</li>
      <li>its worth a try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We are pleased to have found a natural way to do something about her acne problems.</li>
      <li>Cleared him right up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When i received my packaged they smelled werid but i thought  it was the normall smell.....after a while i noticed that the pills were expired and did not see any results</li>
    <li> Made me worse than it ever was!....wont recommend ever</li>
    <li> This product worked as long as it was available to take.  Once used up...the acne was back.  So, I would say it good short term but, for the long haul my problem returned.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I suffer from adult acne. Cysts and smaller breakouts also. This product totally stops them. It worked so well, I quit taking it. But I now realize I need to continue with a smaller dosage. It works so well, I can go out without make up Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Clears up my wife&#x27;s complexion.</li>
    <li> Your product has been working very well. Things are clearing up nicely in just a matter of weeks. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I gave this product benefit of doubt for 3 months.  It&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t give a go.  I always give things benefit of doubt.  Both of my girls have been taking it religiously for 3 months.  There acne is the same or even worse.  We have to start all over again.  I paid quite of bit of money having 2 teen age girls using it.  Does not last very long.</li>
    <li> I just finished the 1st bottle. Seems to helped minimize my breakout. Will continue to use this product to see it can truly contain my acne problem. There&#x27;s also no side effect so far.</li>
    <li> It has worked for me very well. I have had bad cysts, not small pimples, no they were big and purple red and hurt... I tried this product with only 2 capsules a day and the cysts haven&#x27;t come back since then. I&#x27;m planning on buying more and would definitely recommend it to anyone with acne!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 3 months or so and it is awesome. I have had only very very minor acne since I start using Clearzine. I would highly recommend this to all my friends and family members who are having acne issues and have not been able to solve them. I&#x27;m honestly suprised Clearzine is not more popular! They have made me a believer and I will continue to use Clearzine as long as I still have acne issues.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many acne &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; products throughout the past few years of acne suffering and only a couple months I  actually noticed an improvement in my skin. I went through my first two bottles of Clearzine optimistically and was told by others that my face cleared a bit, and I even noticed an improvement. That is something that has never happened before. I did not hesitate to buy an order of four more bottles of Clearzine to save some buying in bulk. I recommend this product to anyone who is tired of potentially harmful creams and other topical products. This is convenient enough to use anywhere you are. Good luck to all you acne sufferers. Keep trying, I know I will.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin, so my face does not look great every time, these pills help me to look better, my face becomes soft, not red, no more pumples... Just I try to take them as long as I can! Thanks who did them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with acne, even as an adult I still get breakouts on my forehead. Most acne medication either dries my face out or if it does work, after the first few months it seems as if my face gets use to the medication and I start getting breakouts again. Clearzine is the only product that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and keeps working. I highly recommend clearzine</li>
    <li> This tablet worked o.k for my acne but I had to take the maximum dose every day and by doing that it got very expensive to keep taking them. My advise would be to try Zinc tablets with copper 20mg two a day with a good face wash like Oxy 10%.</li>
    <li> It was a slow start for me but finally after part way through the third bottle I am able to see results! I have been dealing with moderate acne for the last 12 years and (with the exception of Accutane) have used all the mainstream products out there. Many of them worked for awhile but now my skin responds to nothing, and I was getting desperate. I saw the Clearzine online and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, loving the idea of fixing my acne with natural means. I started out with 6 capsules a day for the first few weeks and started to give up hope after the second bottle was gone and I was still not seeing results. A couple days into the third bottle my acne started clearing up and has kept improving. I am now taking two capsules a day and my acne is about 80% better!! I am so relieved I have finally found something that not only works, but has no harsh side effects.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have been using this product almost consistently for about 8 months now. This is becuase it actually does help with my breakouts and I have seen a noticeable improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s not the miracle cure for acne but it certainly does help me control it to a certain degree, hence the reason why I continue to take it. I would defintely recommend this product to others, give it a chance and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement in my skin within the first week of using Clearzine. I have been using Clearzine for 3 weeks, and it has worked the best in eliminating my acne with no other side effects. In my experience, this product works better than prescription topical creams/gels and antibiotics. I take 2 capsules 3 times per day, and have not experienced any new acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> Take as instructed with lots of water and this stuff really works! Dramatic improvement in texture and breakouts! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I am a 32 years old woman and I&#x27;ve been taking this product for two months with great results, since the first week. My face is almost clear and just a little pimples appears ocasionally. It is really amazing how fast this product changed my life, because I was really worried about my adult acne problem, I tried many other products and was just a waste of money. The creams and facial foams to cleans up the acne, didn´t work for me, but clearzine helped me to recover my self esteem. I started taking 2 pills with each meal and now I am taking 2 pills in the morning to mantein the results. I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne for the past 20 years and I haven&#x27;t found anything suitable on the market to help my situation.....until I tried Clearzine.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I started off by taking 3 pills in the morning and 3 in the evening for 2 weeks.  I then cut my dose according to the instructions and have been on 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the evening for the past 6 months.  My ache is 99% better and I only get one or two small spots now and again.  I&#x27;ve had no side effects either, which is great.  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne for over 13 years. Growing into an adult I always prayed it would go away. Like most sufferers I&#x27;ve been on prescription topical medications and antibiotics. They might work temporarily but the acne always comes back. I have even been in accutane twice and still I cringe at what I see in the mirror. Clearzine is helping control the acne it have now. Though I have accepted that my acne is something I will have to manage for the rest of my life I think that Clearzine is a worthy investment. My self confidence has gotten so much better now that my skin is looking better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself and take it the way it recommends on the bottle. When you&#x27;ve done anything and nothing succeeds anything is worth a try.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work I bought 4 packs used 5 capsules every day. My skin as the same condition I have acne new came so didn&#x27;t help at all. I regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and initially it really cleared up my acne and kept it away for about a month. But once I started lowering the dosage, the acne started coming back. I then went back to a max dosage but now, even after a month, the acne keeps coming back. I would still suggest trying it, especially if you have struggled with acne and nothing has worked.</li>
    <li> I started taking these in conjunction with the Exposed Acne Treatment. All I can say is when I&#x27;m not taking them my face seems more prone to breakout. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re a &#x27;wonder pill&#x27; but my experience leads me to believe they do help. You might as well buy the four pack because they seem to just disappear. I really do wish more came in a bottle. I mean, they&#x27;re pretty pricey as it is.</li>
    <li> Absolutely recommended for moderate to severe acne. I have tried everything else to treat my acne and this is hands down the best product with the most consistent results. Saw results within the first 2 weeks taking 4 pills a day, two at breakfast and two at dinner. Pair this with a daily face wash and it&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll ever need to get that clear skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using clearzine for about 4 months now. My issue was breakouts on the back and chest, particularly a problem during the summer months. This really cleared things up right away. I will continue to use it, why not? It&#x27;s so easy and the results are real.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am a 29 year old male who has had moderate acne since high school.  I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every over the counter acne wash and treatment. I&#x27;ve had some success with each of them, but none of them ever gave me a completely clear complexion.  With each of them, I would still expierience breakouts.  After years of frustration, I finally decided to try take an oral supplement and after much shopping around decided to start with Clearzine.  I could not be happier!!!  Within 2 weeks of taking these pills my face looked noticeably much better.  I&#x27;ve continued taking them since and do not plan to stop.  My face looks better now than it has in the past 15 years.  I would recommend this product to anyone with even a slight acne problem.</li>
    <li> Clearzine has dramatically helped clear up my face. I&#x27;m a 33 year old woman and never thought I would still be dealing acne. Within a bottle and a half my acne dramatically cleared up and my redness went away.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is having problems with acne. Clearzine has gave me back my confidence and self esteem. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Purchased for two grandchildren, but they did not see any results.</li>
    <li> You are welcome to try it and see if it works.  We have tried many other things for our 14 year old daughter and this was just one of the ones that did not work.  But all of our bodies are unique and so what may work for one may not work for another.  Nothing negative; it just did not work for us.</li>
    <li> I had recently found a facial combination that was helping keep my acne in check, and I decided a pill to work from the inside out could hurt either. I started taking 3 in the morning and three at night and by about the next week and a half I noticed a difference. Although my acne was being mostly kept in control from my new face regimen, but the texture and tone noticeably cleared up and became more even and clear, even some older acne marks faded. I love this product, only reason why it&#x27;s not a five is because My acne was already clearing so I couldn&#x27;t judge help with acne from&lt;br /&gt;It. But definitely icing on the cake when trying to get a clearer complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a natural and safe mission to heal my teenaged son&#x27;s very severe cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;We saw a little improvement within the 1st week, but it&#x27;s been a month now and it&#x27;s about the same, he&#x27;s still breaking out. ; (&lt;br /&gt;These are a great idea, I just wish they had more of the vitamins and minerals in them, like Vitamins A (Beta Carotene), D, E, and whatever other vitamins are great for acneic skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m concerned that they&#x27;ve cause him to be quite wired and is already very thin. He&#x27;s had a bit of insomnia and has lost weight which for him isn&#x27;t a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I think this company used to make a blend of herbs with Burdock Root, Dandelion, Yellow Dock and Red Clover, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore. It&#x27;s so hard to find a blend that has all 4 of these amazing herbs that are meant to heal problematic skin.</li>
    <li> This product has worked pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy it. I will continue ordering it with fast friendly service!</li>
    <li> My Blackheads are the worse and I’ve left numerous scars on my face from trying to pop them all. My nose seems to be affected the most and all of my pores are clogged. I decided to try this out and see if it works. There’s pretty mixed reviews but I decided to give it a shot. I’ve been taking two a day for a month now and my skin is looking a lot better. My breakouts are less severe and my pores look less clogged than before. I still get blackheads but not as many. My acne scars have started to fade from my nose and chin. I guess I should mention that I’ve been using my regular face scrub normally every time I shower. But still I’ve seen results using this product and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with my face since junior high. I&#x27;m now 28. In the last 2 years, my face has gotten even angrier at me, and my acne turned cystic. I&#x27;ve tried holistic weird stuff, fads, lights, and almost every cream/wash/cleansing device money can buy. I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins since July (its is currently November) and my last three months have been such a relief.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t dread waking up to feel something new on face, and my makeup routine is a fraction of what it once was. My skin is almost totally clear. I still have hyper pigmentation that the nastier ones left behind, but no new huge hard bumps. Around period time I still get two or three little guys on my face, but they are almost welcomed compared to the week long cysts I used to get. They only last a day or two and are pretty minimal in size.&lt;br /&gt;  I also purchased a pillow that is designed to keep me sleeping on my back (no face buried in pillow) and started taking pro-biotics around this same time. I do think this Clearzine is a huge part of it. I was initially trying to take 3-4 a day, but now I am taking 2 a day. It is worth buying and very cost effective compared to other acne vitamins. I personally will not stop taking them anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the prompt delivery. The order arrived in good time already end of January, several days before the indicated date.&lt;br /&gt;You were asking for our experience:My daughter has started taking it Ed of January.  We didn&#x27;t notice anything immediately (we didn&#x27;t expect it either, knowing that it is more of a Long term thing) but it starts having effect now.&lt;br /&gt;We are pleased to have found a natural way to do something about her acne problems. Great product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me...everyone is different though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  I am a dermatologist and prefer not to prescribe oral antibiotics when I absolutely do not need to.  There was a recent study in the medical literature on the benefit of B5 for acne, and this product has a good amount in it.  It seems to be helping.  Low glycemic index diets also help.</li>
    <li> I have used this products for over 3 years. I take only two daily and it works like magic as I don&#x27;t have too many acnes. Some days I forgot and took only one for a few days in a row, then a few acnes would come back. I am not sure why Clearzine&#x27;s own website is more expensive than Amazon, I would encourage Clearzine to be more competitive and sell at a similar price.</li>
    <li> Having acne my whole life has really been a downfall. I have been using this for a couple of months and I have seen drastic changes in not only my acne but the overall health of my face. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I suffer from mild adult acne and have tried every topical solution under the sun with not much success. I didn&#x27;t believe this product would work but had nothing to lose so I ordered 2 bottles at first to try out. 2 weeks later I was amazed at the results and ended up ordering 4 more. These shipped really fast straight to my door and I am 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 bottles for my 2 teens.  They are on the 4th bottle now, taking 6 pills per day.  It seems to work on both of them.  Acne are not totally cleared up yet but I noticed improvement and less breakouts.  It&#x27;s only been 15 days so I am buying some more to see if I can get targeted results. Product is expensive but at least not as much as the dermatologist fees I used to pay.</li>
    <li> The redness and blotchiness all subsided after about 2-3 weeks for me. Seems a lil slow but i think its also due to d fact the place i come from is really humid so my face gets sweaty alot</li>
    <li> I have waited several months to review this product because I wanted to give it a fair chance.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice and have been through several bottles.  Sadly, I still have acne.  I like to think this product helps because my acne has been mildly reduced, but I&#x27;ve also been using topical creams subscribed by my dermatologist.  This was no miracle product for me, as much as I wanted to believe it would be.  As a note: I am 23 female with a pristine diet and religious skincare regime so I am almost certain my adult acne is a result of hormones or other internal issues, NOT due to skincare neglect.  Maybe this product just doesn&#x27;t work for people in my situation.</li>
    <li> Clearzine is an excellent product, I love that it works so well.I am hesitant to use lose dose antibiotics, but was ready to until my husband discovered these on line.  Our daughter is using the Exposed skin care line along with these supplements with very good results.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money... I want my money back</li>
    <li> My Daughter is one I purchased it for. It did nothing at all it could be that she has a bad chase of acne but they company talked it up. It is not worth the time or MONEY! I wish there were more honest companies out there.</li>
    <li> I have definitely seen improvements in my face. I&#x27;m using these pills along with a Dermabrush which I also love. I&#x27;ve never had acne this bad in high school and have assumed it to be adult onset as I&#x27;m now almost 22. Definitely start off at 6 a day and go lower only when you see your face clearing up. Takes away all the redness! Although I feel like my results are taking a little longer because I only started off taking 4 a day..</li>
    <li> These have cleared up my skin so immensely! I have always had acne but don&#x27;t like taking medication prescribed by the doctors because of all the nasty side effects. I wanted something natural, but also something that worked and holy s**t this works!!! The only con is remembering to take the pills throughout the day!</li>
    <li> This stuff has saved my skin... it&#x27;s far more effective than anything I&#x27;ve been prescribed by a dermatologist. I order 4 or 6 bottles at a time and always reorder before I run out. I highly recommend it. HIGHLY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Clearzine for about 10-11 months now, and I can&#x27;t live without it. I began having moderate to severe acne my freshman year of college, and it became so bad that I refused to walk out of my room without a slew of makeup covering my face. I was acutely self-conscious of my skin, and it made me miserable on a daily basis. I started taking Clearzine near the end of my sophomore year as a last ditch effort before turning to Accutane, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.    I took the maximum dosage (2 pills, 3 times daily), and I was faithful about keeping to a time schedule! I noticed for the first three days that it actually made my skin appear worse. It seemed like everything below my skin started to coming to the surface.    After the first week, though, my skin was noticeably softer, the redness has gone down, and I noticed that my blemishes were smaller, even though they had only slightly diminished in number.    After the first month, the number of blemishes were less then half of what they had been (which was HUGE for me!) and the blemishes themselves grew smaller still, making them easier to cover up.    After two months, my skin was smooth for the first time in two years. I could go through my day wearing only a thin layer of foundation, and I was so relieved that it nearly brought me to tears.    I still get small breakouts every month due to hormones, and I can&#x27;t stop taking 6 pills a day or else the severe breakouts return. Since everyone is different, some people&#x27;s skin will respond even better than mine did, and some not as drastically as mine, but I&#x27;d recommend trying this product to anybody who is as desperate as I was. Clearzine has worked wonders for me, and I&#x27;ve suffered no ill side-effects after taking it for almost a year.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever found for my adult acne...it has made a WORLD of difference in my skin, and I am a customer for LIFE!!</li>
    <li> I have been trying creams and pills for decades. I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better than Clearzine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 months. I found that it takes about that long to see dramatic results and&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my results. I do get a few breakouts every now and then but it is very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about the product is that it it all natural and gives you a great boost of vitamins. I never knew that&lt;br /&gt;vitamins were key to helping me with my skin issues. I am glad that I tried the product and I plan to continue using it in&lt;br /&gt;the future.</li>
    <li> My son uses this for his teenage acne - recently forgot to reorder and ran out for 2 weeks - yikes - could really tell the difference - did not believe him that this was his cure but wow what a difference when he got back on these!!! I AM SOLD!! Will never give him a hard time about the cost of these again!! These are great....Cleared him right up and his skin is beautiful again - thanks Clearzine.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I purchased the pills for my 15 yr old daughter. She had bad breakouts due to over active hormones and Pro Active just didn&#x27;t cut it! Clearzine has definitely worked for my daughter. Her self esteem has really been bad due to her acne, but now after a month of use, her skin has almost cleared up completely and her self esteem has definitely had a boost. We will for sure be using this product for a long time! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have very problematic skin on my face and body. Its been about two months and its clearing up albeit very slowly. I started taking this with a multivitamin too following the advice of a friend. I have very oily skin on my face and I&#x27;ve noticed that the oil has reduced significantly. My lips are very dry though (invested in Aquaphor) but my skin overall is fine.</li>
    <li> This has really helped my acne along with acne face wash and cream.  I love the ingredients and will continue to take it.  I take two in the morning and two at night and I have been clear for some time!</li>
    <li> I boutght this product for my nephew and he has acne for many years.  After three-four weeks, his acne got smaller and had much less breakout.  Now I am ready to order again.</li>
    <li> After 20 years and a small fortune spent on over the counter creams, beautician sessions and prescription creams have now found something that actually works.  No ill effects or skin drying.  First week cleans out the bacteria and from then on each week skin condition improves and gets clearer with no break-outs,  Have used the product for 7 weeks and can honestly say that my skin has never looked so good.  Only take two tablets daily now to maintain the condition and have just taken delivery of my second order.&lt;br /&gt;I am so frightened that the product may disappear from the market place in the future so am stockpiling to make sure I always have a supply.  Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has skin problems</li>
    <li> My daughter, 17, has been using this for one year now  and her skin is completely different than it was a year ago.  I would say that there is a 90% improvement and that she has an occassional breakout but not very noticeable.  Her skin is still quite oily but she has been able to manage that with topical benzoyl peroxide and a good moisturzer.</li>
    <li> After 4 weeks of using your product,  my acne is getting better.  I will definitely continue to use your product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old son started taking 4 pills a day about 3 weeks ago.  His acne is mostly on his lower cheeks, possibly related to hair growth/shaving.  He&#x27;s tried a few different topical prescription drugs, but after 3 weeks, we both believe the Clearzine is clearing his skin better than the prescriptions.  He still has acne and continues to wash with Cethaphil and use his prescription, but the most noticeable improvement has come with taking the Clearzine.  We&#x27;re hopeful that with continued use, the results will improve and then he can go down to 2 pills a day.  Can&#x27;t beat no side effects!</li>
    <li> I usually dont like to write reviews but this is a great product and needs to be recognized. the reviews are right. this product works for me. i take along with ACV, liver supplement, and burdock root . try it. its worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have taken 6 pills per day for 40 days and I still have acne breakouts. It did not help to improve my acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking this about a month. I have noticed my skin clearing. My daughter, who is eighteen, and has struggled with her skin since she was 11yrs, old also started taking it at the same time.  When she was home from college last weekend I noticed that her skin looked almost as good as it did when she was on Accutane -- and it&#x27;s only been a month -- AND, it&#x27;s SAFE for her and natural!!!  We are very excited to have found something natural to help with acne!!</li>
    <li> ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW IS THAT THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!! ONLY THING THAT HAS WORKED WITH CLEARING MY ACNE. ,MUST TRY , WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> Been using this product through 2 bottles now it has stopped cystic acne and kept it away. Only get little white heads here and there and keeps acne away so far started at 6 pills a day lowered it to 3 a day now for maintenance and it is working awesomely at this dose now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with adult acne for many years I&#x27;ve tried everything - antibiotics, topical treatments, home remedies, eating clean, drinking more water and any other thing my GP or Dermatologist suggested like roaccutane, which admittedly worked for a while but with severe side effects which I would never recommend to anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;Then my sister told me about clearzine. I was skeptical.. But after reading the reviews thought it was worth a shot as my skin was absolutely terrible,  and very painful at the time..not to mention how it had affected my self confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m 8 day&#x27;s in- taking 6 a day religiously and the improvement is just amazing! It  feels 100% better and looking at my before and after photos it really looks it too!! Only a couple of spots on one side of my face and the rest is totally clear, redness is fading and makeup goes on nicely now, can&#x27;t wait until week 2!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has had no luck with anything else. It&#x27;s not the cheapest but IT WORKS!! :D I will definitely be buying more just to maintain clear skin. 10/10 for this Product I love it!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this helped me, cause I still did have some breakouts.  I think for me the Thyme tinture worked better for me.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplements for a few days now. Have noticed a difference in my acne condition. Will definitely recommend it to anyone who is suffering from severe acne. I&#x27;m only on my first bottle but I believe I will see even better results after taking finish the full course of supplements. :)</li>
    <li> I tried the two bottle version first and I was really glad to see that not only did it do a fine job on blackheads etc, but it is actually helping to minimize the sun damage.  Being 50, (yeah I said it) it is horrible to start suffering from adult acne when I was so lucky as a teen.  I was using Proactive which was fine, but using it for over 16 years, it needed a little kick.  This did the trick.  Give it a good 7 or 8 days to really see the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had moderate back acne for years and recently my hormonal imbalances caused it to worsen. I&#x27;ve tried all of the washes/creams but I&#x27;m afraid to use chemicals on my skin. I don&#x27;t have time to go to a dermatologist so I researched non-prescription solutions and found this, after just four days of taking 4 pills a day (2 in the morning and 2 at dinner), my back is already looking better. the redness has gone down, my skin feels smooth and even. I even see an improvement in my blackheads and pores on my face, I feel and look great and it hasn&#x27;t even been a week!!  I love this stuff, and I&#x27;m glad I bought 4 bottles so that I don&#x27;t run out too soon! I&#x27;m definitely buying more when the time comes. seriously, it&#x27;s worth a shot if you have hormonal acne or all of your topical treatments have failed you.</li>
    <li> Use this and clean and clear three part system my skins way cleared up. Have done accutane twice and after skin blew up again and gets bad cysts but now I got it under control again</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Ive been seeing results after just 60 days. I strongly recommend this to everyone! Fast and Safe acne treatment.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with Clearzine that I am telling everyone I know that it is a product they should try if they want real results.</li>
    <li> An acne product that actually works! I&#x27;ve tried actual medication from doctors, every body wash possible, and even tried salt baths. Salt baths helped a little bit but this product really cleared up everything. Will continue using for sure!</li>
    <li> Ripped my stomach apart daily even though I took it with food.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any perceptible improvement in my skin.</li>
</ol>
