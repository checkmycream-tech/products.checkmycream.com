      <li>This eyeliner looks pretty good</li>

      <li>I would recommend it.smudges some,but easy to take off.</li>
      <li>If you are looking to draw a fine line, this liner won&#x27;t do it.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth every time and stays on.</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I&#x27;d like</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
      <li>when you first put it on, it has a pretty nice texture and blends pretty well.</li>
      <li>The service from Amazon was very fast and precise.</li>
      <li>Overall i&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>

      <li>So I highly recommend this product for those of you that don&#x27;t have a huge problem with oily skin.</li>
      <li>Perfect dark, rich, black color.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>This one does pretty well.</li>
      <li>This eye liner is long lasting, perfect shade of black, It doesn&#x27;t look cheap</li>
      <li>, It&#x27;s waterproof but the only problem is that it may smudge if you take a shower so the waterproof feature is not that strong.</li>
      <li>Cost a little more but trust me well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I wish there weren&#x27;t any sparkles in the brown color, but they aren&#x27;t very noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it very waterproof either.  </li>
      <li>(I have very oily skin even on my eyelids)</li>
      <li>This pencil really does last well and doesn&#x27;t transfer to my upper eyelids like so many others do.  </li>
      <li>Does anybody have a better recommendation of a twist-up style black eyeliner?</li>
      <li>and I have to be particular with the eye makeup I get so that it doesn&#x27;t leak into my eye and cause itchiness.</li>
      <li>uses this everyday and it much better than what she was using.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it was my new mascara or eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>It will, however, last throughout a rainy day, or a hot day when you sweat profusely.</li>
      <li>it is a pain to completely get off at night though.</li>
      <li>I tried this and although it didn&#x27;t last for the whole day</li>
      <li>So you have to check your eyeliner frequently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soft and mushy.  </li>
      <li>I only have 2 of the colors so far but plan on expanding.</li>
      <li>I purchased waterproof because i like to apply eyeliner on my waterline for a more dramatic effect.  </li>

<li> Other than that</li>
<li> That being said, I don&#x27;t use the sharpener on the other side of the sponge tip.</li>
<li> However, the eyeliner starts in go into the wrinkles around the eye and transfer down the cheek after about 30 minutes of wear.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and nothing beats Sephora!</li>
<li> I used SEPHORA COLLECTION Retractable Waterproof Eyeliner 01 Black for a couple weeks.  </li>
<li> However, the sponge would be to harsh on delicate eyelid skin if you use it every day.  </li>
<li> It is a little expensive</li>
<li> I usually use liquid liner because pencil smears so badly on me.  </li>
<li> Item measures just shy of 5.5 inches in length.</li>
<li> but I never have crazy runny eyeliner eyes.</li>
<li> If you put on a bunch of moisturizer and expect any eyeliner to stay you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed</li>
<li> I sticking with it to use up the tube since I hate wasting stuff I pay for.</li>

    <li> If you are looking to draw a fine line, this liner won&#x27;t do it.  It&#x27;s too soft and mushy.  I didn&#x27;t find it very waterproof either.  Overrated and overpriced.</li>
    <li> I usually use liquid liner because pencil smears so badly on me.  I tried this and although it didn&#x27;t last for the whole day (I have very oily skin even on my eyelids) it lasted far longer than any other pencil I&#x27;ve tried.  So I highly recommend this product for those of you that don&#x27;t have a huge problem with oily skin.</li>
    <li> i love this product...it water prove</li>
    <li> Awesome Product according to my wife!  uses this everyday and it much better than what she was using. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner and use it all the time.  I smuge it with a brush, but the included sponge also does the job if you don&#x27;t have a brush at hand.  However, the sponge would be to harsh on delicate eyelid skin if you use it every day.  The color does not fade away or stain your eye during the day.</li>
    <li> I love the sephora collection. I was using a gel eyeliner but decided to give this a try. I LOVE THIS! I always have a problem with watery eyes and let me tell you this eyeliner stays put. Cost a little more but trust me well worth the price. You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I do makeup for people all the time and im known for doing the best eyeliner and I always use this eyeliner. It never smudges, I LOVE this eyeliner but on Sephora.com this eyeliner is $12.00 so I recommend buying it from there.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Sephora collection. It stays on for hours, does not get clumpy in the corner of your eye, glides on easily across your eyelash area and lasts for months! It is a little expensive but it&#x27;s well worth it. I only have 2 of the colors so far but plan on expanding. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and nothing beats Sephora! I love it! I had to hide them from my sisters forcing them to buy their own. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> I used SEPHORA COLLECTION Retractable Waterproof Eyeliner 01 Black for a couple weeks.  I purchased waterproof because i like to apply eyeliner on my waterline for a more dramatic effect.  At first this eyeliner seemed to work, but then i started noticing smudges (dark black marks) under my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t know if it was my new mascara or eyeliner.  So, i stopped wearing mascara all together and just wore eyeliner.  The problem was the eyeliner!! Now it&#x27;s time to try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS EYELINER. I don&#x27;t trust any other waterproof liners, I wear this eyeliner when I work out, when I surf and swim. I might need to re apply every now and then but I never have crazy runny eyeliner eyes. Comes off easily in the shower with a gentle face wash. LOYAL FAN!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> only reason i didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it still smears/smudges as the day goes on. i thought as waterproof it&#x27;d hold up longer, but it doesn&#x27;t. it is a pain to completely get off at night though.</li>
    <li> This eye liner is long lasting, perfect shade of black, It doesn&#x27;t look cheap, It&#x27;s waterproof but the only problem is that it may smudge if you take a shower so the waterproof feature is not that strong. Overall i&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice color, great Sephora product, no problems here at all, like the smoothness and the fact the product is waterproof</li>
    <li> Still wish I could find an eyeliner that is positively 100%  smudgefree! and only comes off when you want to take it off!</li>
    <li> this eyeliner goes on easy but does not stay all day.but I would recommend it.smudges some,but easy to take off.</li>
    <li> Best kohl pencil on the planet.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found yet. I put it on my inner eyelids/waterline. Perfect dark, rich, black color. Goes on smooth every time and stays on.The eyeliner has lasted me a while, and it&#x27;s still going, so I&#x27;m definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth. That being said, I don&#x27;t use the sharpener on the other side of the sponge tip. If I did, I would suspect that the product wouldn&#x27;t last as long. I use this eyeliner with ELF eye primer on my outer eyelids. Can&#x27;t say enough good things. A keeper for any girls makeup collection. Item measures just shy of 5.5 inches in length. Fits in my 7 inch wide, 16 inch long, travel makeup pouch.</li>
    <li> Always have running eyeliner until this</li>
    <li> This pencil really does last well and doesn&#x27;t transfer to my upper eyelids like so many others do.  I wish there weren&#x27;t any sparkles in the brown color, but they aren&#x27;t very noticeable.  Other than that, I&#x27;d recommend this if you want a long lasting transfer resistant eyeliner pencil.  Of course, it helps if you properly prepare you lids in advance.  If you put on a bunch of moisturizer and expect any eyeliner to stay you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner looks pretty good when you first put it on, it has a pretty nice texture and blends pretty well. However, the eyeliner starts in go into the wrinkles around the eye and transfer down the cheek after about 30 minutes of wear. So you have to check your eyeliner frequently. I sticking with it to use up the tube since I hate wasting stuff I pay for. Does anybody have a better recommendation of a twist-up style black eyeliner? I&#x27;ve used revlon colorstay and it works alright. I also tried ulta&#x27;s twist-up style eyeliner and it didn&#x27;t stay put long at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this eyeliner. There are tons of more expensive, &amp;#34;upper-brand&amp;#34; eyeliners out there, but I swear-this beats the rest. It&#x27;s the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t smear on my eyelids throughout the day. The only minor issue is that even though it&#x27;s waterproof, you can&#x27;t expect it to last while you&#x27;re in the shower, or things like that. It will, however, last throughout a rainy day, or a hot day when you sweat profusely.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have contacts and I have to be particular with the eye makeup I get so that it doesn&#x27;t leak into my eye and cause itchiness. This one does pretty well. However, it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I&#x27;d like and I often have to use the smudger to fill in gaps and make a smoother line. But then you lose the crispness of the line. Also, I wish the pigmentation was darker.</li>
    <li> his product is much better than what I thought. The quality is great, the color looks bright. The size is perfect. The description of the product on the web page is very accurate. The service from Amazon was very fast and precise. The delivery time was fully respected. I bouht it for a present and the person who got it is completely pleased!!!!</li>
