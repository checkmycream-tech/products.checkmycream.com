<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There was a miscommunication on one of the patterns I had wanted. Kenz Laurenz sent me the 6 correct pattern hair ties and let me keep the old patterns so I didn&#x27;t have to fool around with shipping back. They were quick to reply to my messages and always friendly and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair ties themselves are said to be no crease, but I&#x27;ve found that two of mine have gotten creases. If you&#x27;re looking at it as if it wasn&#x27;t tied, but it was just a loose piece of hair ribbon, you can see creases straight down the middle of the ties and then also towards the edges of the ties, 3 creases in total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why they creased, but these are my guesses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair is extremely thick and stretched the hair tie too the max (not the first time this has happened)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I had worn them in the shower to keep my hair from getting wet, so I guess maybe the moisture could have made them crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to re-wet them and put them around a small water bottle to see if they will uncrease that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that these are great hair ties in v. cute colours and patterns!!</li>
    <li> the reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because there is a seam in the middle of the ribbon which causes it to fold in half and twist. Maybe they should consider removing the seam.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I could choose my own colors and designs. Worth the good price. The seller lived up to the promise of picking my own, communicated with me, and got it right.</li>
    <li> Loved being able to select my own colors and prints!</li>
    <li> Good assortment of colors, but I was looking for more prints and also doubles.  I wear my hair in short braids a lot.  Also, I noticed a lot of the hair ties were very small and I have very thin hair.....  I am enjoying the ones that I can use, I just put two prints together.  Thanks.😊</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to choose their own colors! ? A great price for a huge pack, and they are quite gentle even for my hair which is usually dry and easily damaged</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering the no crease hair ties from Kenz Laurenz.  I have this style of hair ties from other brands, and I really liked the pick-your-own option for this 20 pack, so I thought I would give these a try.  I am very happy with my purchase!  The shipping was very fast, and I had lots of fun picking out my colors and prints.  The quality of the hair ties are the same as all of the other brands that I have tried- even brands that cost 3 times as much!  The colors and prints look great, and they seem very durable.  If you are a fan of this style of hair tie, I highly recommend these!  I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I ordered Tuesday and received my fabulous hair ties by Thursday that same week! Thank you Kenz Laurenz! I recommend letting them know what colors of ties you want right after you purchase that way you get them quicker.</li>
    <li> I think that&#x27;s great customer service.  I love this kind of hair band because it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like the rubber ones.</li>
    <li> I love these things and they come in the cutest colors. I&#x27;m ususlly able to find one that matches my outfit for that day. Stay in place too.</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties. They are so cute match everything. Great price!  I love the different colors and patterns. So does my granddaughter!</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that the company emailed me after the order to ask which hair ties I wanted.  However, they did send me two of the same hair tie and did not send one that I ordered, with no explanation.  It really isn&#x27;t a big deal, but I feel like they should have explained why they made the substitution, or at least allowed me to pick out a different one if they were out of stock on one of them that I wanted.  So, I got two of the same.  They work well and don&#x27;t destroy my hair.  Been using them for running, at the gym, in the shower,and when I sleep.  I love the neat designs.  They are so unique.</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with my order. The hair ties are amazing quality and are beautiful. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality, arrived on time, and very cute designs!</li>
    <li> Loved these!!! My daughter is always losing these and to be able to purchase 20 at a reasonable price was fantastic</li>
    <li> The best. They send me a email and ask me what I wanted and got what I ask for. Got it within a week.... awesome. Gonna order more!!! I&#x27;m very happy thank you so much.. 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> What I liked is that you can pick your styles from solids to designed patterns.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for 20 of them compared to other brand No Crease Hair Ties.</li>
    <li> These are great. The quality is good, the colors are nice. My only complaint is the package was torn &amp; a couple of the ties had grease on them &amp; all of them had a chemical smell which either came from the packing material, the elastics themselves or the black grease that got on a few of them when the package tore. Perhaps a stronger packaging method would eliminate the problem, say a box instead of an envelope? Or a thicker envelope? Overall very satisfied despite the packaging! I will probably order more. I&#x27;m a big fan of this style of hair tie &amp; love that these are so inexpensive. I didn&#x27;t have the option to choose my colors but that&#x27;s ok - they were great!</li>
    <li> stood up well compared to the expensive kind</li>
    <li> i love how you can pick your designs. Absolutely wonderful i love these hair bands.</li>
    <li> Some of the ties don&#x27;t stretch very well as I&#x27;m only able to twist it twice around my hair instead of three times, which makes a loose pony tail.  Designs super cute though.</li>
    <li> I love these rubberbands and I would recommend them to anyone.  I want to buy more.  I can&#x27;t even feel them in my hair.  I sleep with my hair in a ponytail everynight and don&#x27;t feel the rubberband.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> While I was impressed with the quick delivery and opportunity to pick my colors, I was disappointed that my order was slightly messed up. I didn&#x27;t receive a couple of the colors I ordered and got one or two that I didn&#x27;t order. I also only received 19 instead of 20. However, with such a low price it&#x27;s hard to complain.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> Very, very tiny.  They come tied with a knot.  Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Loved being able to pick what I wanted from a huge selection and arrived very fast</li>
    <li> Love this style of hair tie!  They look so cute on your arms and really do live up to their promise of not leaving creases in your hair!  In stores, they usually retail for around $5 for a pack of 5 and that&#x27;s how much I&#x27;ve been paying for them... until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenz Laurenz has so many different color options and for the price (around $0.35 each), it can&#x27;t be beat!  Quality was the same as the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased and I will definitely buy all my elastic hairties from this store from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only suggestion would be to make a reference guide with what the various colors/patterns look like since I had to &amp;#34;guess&amp;#34; what some of them would look like. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Loved them! Too cute and loved getting to pick my colors</li>
    <li> Looooved this hair ties. They are sooo pretty, my mother asked me to order some for her :).</li>
    <li> Love these.  Hold great.</li>
    <li> Fun colors. Its great that you can choose which colors you like. I like that I am actually able to twist it around my thick ponytail 3 times. However, they have started to stretch after about 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> These are cute and I enjoy wearing them.  However, they still leave creases in my hair - this is likely due to how fine my hair is.</li>
    <li> I have now ordered the U PICK 20 hair ties twice and both times my orders came exactly right and very quickly! I absolutely love these hair ties by Kenz Laurenz. I was given a few Emi Jays from a relative and that sparked my interested in this type of hair tie and so I wanted to get more for myself. These prices cant be beat compared to the other brand and the product is much better. Other hair ties were stiff when I received them and these are all soft and beautiful/ bright colors! I recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> Good quality! Great thAt you can pic colors! Just have to message them. Wish I had ordered more! Great gifts!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, super fast shipping, beautiful selection of colors.</li>
    <li> Great hair ties in super cute colors.  To pick you own colors, just email the seller and he will send you a list of what is available.</li>
    <li> Great ties, shipped quick. I was sent exactly the colors I requested! Will order these again.</li>
    <li> I use these pretty much everyday for my natural hair, and exclusively now. After searching and using so many different hair ties that need to meet my particular needs (accommodating of thick hair without breaking, material will not snag or cause friction on my hair strands, will hold hair without having to wrap too tight/too much tension on scalp, etc) these fit the bill! Will definitely purchase more when needed.</li>
    <li> Great product, these are the first ties that actually stretch enough to hold my long thick hair. Love that I got to choose the colors I received!</li>
    <li> I love these hairbands! They are fun and sassy. Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> so cute, so cheap, so chic ~ thank you for letting me pick all 20 colors and prints, it was super fun</li>
    <li> Thanks for your rapid response.  Appreciate the ability to pick out many colors and patterns.  Great well made product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love them!  They are perfect for what I needed.  This seller is so nice, too.  I chose this seller because I could pick my colors/patterns.  It sends you an email that your shipping label has printed.  I mistook this for it was shipped (without being able to choose the colors). I emailed the seller and they were so kind and explained that only the label had printed, I still had time to pick my colors/patterns.  YAHOO!  I chose them and they were shipped so quickly.  I love them and plan to buy again from this seller very soon.  The hair ties are excellent quality and the variety of choices to choose from is excellent.  If you don&#x27;t want to choose your colors, they will send you their most popular.  So it is no stress either way you prefer.  Highly recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped quickly, super cute and fun. I think these will last a really long time, but I will be ordering more just to have them!</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast, only took about 3 business days. I ordered my specific colors/patterns and my only concern is that instead of giving me a &amp;#34;black lightening bolt on yellow&amp;#34; hair tie, they gave me one black AND one yellow (I guess... two for the price of one?) Not complaining, although I do wish for that lightening bolt hair tie. It&#x27;s okay because I love all my other ones! Just be careful and I guess space out your choices more than I did. Thanks anyways, Kenz Laurenz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone who likes not having hair creases at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> these are great! TONS of colors to choose from and super customer service and communication!</li>
    <li> Love these!! I got the exact hair ties I ordered! About to order more because the girls at work kept asking for one! I&#x27;m a nurse so they are perfect for throwing your hair up quickly or at the gym too! Definitely recommend them &amp; the seller is great too! They shipped quickly &amp; I had them in no time!</li>
    <li> Exactly the colors I chose with quick delivery! Great quality, thanks!</li>
    <li> These are fun colors, and I like how gentle the are on your hair.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give these 5 stars is that the size is inconsistent.  Shipping was fast - great seller.</li>
    <li> Loved the quality and color options</li>
    <li> Ordered the coral and teal (sister&#x27;s wedding colors) for bachelorette favors.  The colors are perfect and it was shipped quickly. Great service!</li>
    <li> Love the hair ties! Lots of different colors and patterns. Super comfortable to wear on your wrist versus the normal hair ties that cut into your skin. They don&#x27;t crease my hair as much and don&#x27;t rip the hair when pulling it up. Definitely not going back to regular hair ties ever! Product was shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. Speedy delivery. Cute patters and colors, and hair ties are as advertised. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
