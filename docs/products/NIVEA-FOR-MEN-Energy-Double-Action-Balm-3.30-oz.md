      <li>It has a nice scent and my son seems to like it.</li>
      <li>Smells nice too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea For Men.</li>
      <li>Nice cooling feeling without being all greasy.</li>
      <li>it is that it would be nice if they had a product ment for persons with oily face</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t honestly tell you if this product is unique or great.</li>
      <li>Absorbs well, nice scent, feels good and easy to use because it dispenses from the bottom.  </li>
      <li>The scent, which is pleasant and light, does not linger.</li>
      <li>Has a good smell to it and keeps my face smooth but doesn&#x27;t help with the eczema I can get from shaving, at all.</li>
      <li>There is a pleasant aroma that dissipates rather quickly, so you don&#x27;t walk into a room and have people stare at you like you drenched yourself in cologne.</li>
      <li>It leaves one&#x27;s skin very smooth.  </li>
      <li>I am sing if for many months now.</li>
      <li>Especially in the winter, when the air dries out around here, this stuff is the best.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve always felt much better to me, and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works great, it really soothes and hydrates my skin after shaving.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend it as it is the best after shave</li>
      <li>This is my boyfriends favorite after shave.  </li>
      <li>opted for this size (3.3 oz), mostly so I could be compliant with the TSA rules of 4 oz.</li>
      <li>Glad 1% of profits go to charity.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>plus I love to ride, run and swim, so</li>
      <li>It fits in my kit, but again, a tube may work better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;very pleased.</li>
      <li>Checked Walgreens shelves, but the prices from Pharmapacks were much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Longevity: Excellent (delivered every three months and last beyond the period I&#x27;ve ever shelved one)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, and the cache of bottles in my drawer is evidence.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>what i love about the sensitive post shave balm is that it&#x27;s non-greasy, and absorbs very nicely into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nivea has lots of products --- I would think that they would be able to design and manufacture a more user friendly bottle.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent you can mix with acne cream before applying.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s probably nothing overly spectacular about it, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with it since I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years consistently</li>
      <li>In general, I find it to be a superior package to the more &amp;#34;tube-like&amp;#34; containers with twist tops.</li>
      <li>I have no dry cheeks, there has been shaving effects that have shown, and it applies very nicely.</li>
      <li>smells nice without being overwhelming; soothing - not heavy, zero irritation.    </li>
      <li>And yes, I like how great my skin feels (especially on my face.</li>
      <li>great for moisturizing, especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Student who was looking into a cheap but quality product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a zingy, energy-blast type of balm/after shave; rather, it&#x27;s a smooth, comforting</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t burn your face after you shave.</li>
      <li>and it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>With the after burning is gone, your skin feels silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>it is worth it!</li>
      <li>Clean smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I have always been disciplined to moisturize after shaving, and I began to search for a true \\&quot;after shave\\&quot; balm.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and te product as a whole.  </li>
      <li>The price difference isn&#x27;t worth the difference at Wal-Mart which seems to have good pricing on such products.</li>
      <li>I like using it on my face because it absorbs super quick and it never feels oily or like I have moisturizer on.  </li>
      <li>The reason I rate this product highly, is less for the lotion itself (which works just fine) and more because I find that the container to be the perfect size to fit in my cabinet, doesn&#x27;t make a mess (no drips), and has an easy open top.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be a pretty good product for keeping your entire face moisturized after a shave.  </li>
      <li>No biggie; I just clean it out and it closes again - just be aware of this.</li>
      <li>and this is a part of a shaving routine that keeps my skin calm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice bottle, however, the user has difficulty getting every last drop.  </li>
      <li>This stuff, keeps it smooth, soft, comfortable, and moist.</li>
      <li>i tried this on a whim after years of using my favorite face lotion: nivea men&#x27;s sensitive post shave balm.</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not due to touching my eyes with some product on them - within about 5 minutes they start to burn.</li>
      <li>This is the first line of products that truly and consistently has improved the look of my skin!</li>
      <li>This product soothes the most &amp;#34;sore&amp;#34; shaved skin almost instantly.</li>
      <li>If I am trying to travel with only carry-on luggage, this plastic container takes up more space than what lotion remains inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was the first non-alcohol after-shave I had found.</li>
      <li>First time I buy one of these, every time I shave myself I apply and is automatically makes my face skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and one only needs a small dab to do the job.  </li>
      <li>I also really like how it smells!</li>
      <li>not to be less than manly, but I love the q10 products get them!</li>
      <li>especially the 2 in 1 balm, you can use it on your whole face as lotion which is great in the winter when guys need to use lotion but don&#x27;t because putting on lotion is less than manly and it takes another step.</li>
      <li>So i bought a whole bunch because i couldn&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t care much for it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered it for my nephew and he seems to be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works great after shaving and even on days I don&#x27;t.  Clean smell.</li>
    <li> Best after-shave lotion i have ever used!!</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant smell and no burning like those after shave lotions. Comes in small quantities, and Amazon is unbeatable in service and overall value for the product. Highly recommended,</li>
    <li> Seems to be a pretty good product for keeping your entire face moisturized after a shave.  But this stuff makes my eyes irritated and watery all day.  It&#x27;s not due to touching my eyes with some product on them - within about 5 minutes they start to burn.</li>
    <li> not to be less than manly, but I love the q10 products get them! it is worth it! especially the 2 in 1 balm, you can use it on your whole face as lotion which is great in the winter when guys need to use lotion but don&#x27;t because putting on lotion is less than manly and it takes another step.</li>
    <li> 1-10, with 10 as best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: 10 - Individually wrapped, and then all wrapped together (mine was a four pack - not sure why it says three)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: 10 - I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It&#x27;s not a zingy, energy-blast type of balm/after shave; rather, it&#x27;s a smooth, comforting mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: like the Earth&#x27;s rotation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion: 10 - Never oily or greasy; essentially fully absorbed by the skin in 5-10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: Excellent (delivered every three months and last beyond the period I&#x27;ve ever shelved one)</li>
    <li> After I shave &amp; shower, I put this on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it since it came out.  Before that, I used the generic Nivea moisturizer.  I really like this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, you don&#x27;t need much, and it lasts a long time.  Especially in the winter, when the air dries out around here, this stuff is the best.  I like using it on my face because it absorbs super quick and it never feels oily or like I have moisturizer on.  It just keeps my skin from drying out all day.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Prefer the gel over the cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using your Nivea For Men Q10 Double Action Balm, 3.3 fl. oz. Bottles for about 2 years now and the product is awesome.  It leaves one&#x27;s skin very smooth.  The only critizism I&#x27;ve got is the type of bottle.  It&#x27;s a nice bottle, however, the user has difficulty getting every last drop.  Nivea has lots of products --- I would think that they would be able to design and manufacture a more user friendly bottle.  Do you make the same product w/an SPF?</li>
    <li> Use it everyday and love it.</li>
    <li> Screwed my face up. Used it 3 times after shaving and my skin has never felt worse. Would sting very bad after shaving and now my skin is raised and dryer and irritated due to it and its day 4 of not using it and still having problems. Bought some serious lotion to try to fix it. To bad I&#x27;m in the military and I still have to shave everyday.</li>
    <li> My husband says he really likes it, uses daily. We both use Nivea products, &amp; this is no exception. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for after shave lotion for years. It was the first non-alcohol after-shave I had found. A few years ago, the type I used became unavailable because Nivea added an ingredient and renamed it (now this product).  Hey, I&#x27;m 65 but my face looks 35 (just ask me; I&#x27;ll tell you). I love this lotion.</li>
    <li> This after shave feels great on my face and leaves my face feeling moisturized without any greasy feeling. I would definitely recommend it as it is the best after shave I have used. There is also no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t leave a burning feeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, it really soothes and hydrates my skin after shaving. I found this to the best after shave lotion I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I use this after being outside all day, at the beach, and shaving. It&#x27;s great and I&#x27;ve ordere my third bottle. A little goes a long way just a dab. It&#x27;s also good for puffy eyes. And it&#x27;s smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> i tried this on a whim after years of using my favorite face lotion: nivea men&#x27;s sensitive post shave balm. what i love about the sensitive post shave balm is that it&#x27;s non-greasy, and absorbs very nicely into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the double action balm, however, is greasier, and leaves a residue on my skin. i will go back to the sensitive post shave balm as soon as i run out of the double action balm, which i hope is soon.</li>
    <li> For as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving I&#x27;ve always broken out around my neck. Over the past 6-7 months I&#x27;ve switched to using Nivea Shaving Cream, this Action Balm, Face Walsh and Moisturizer, and my face has never looked better for such long periods of time. I&#x27;ve tried other similar lines from other manufacturers, some did nothing and others made it worse. This is the first line of products that truly and consistently has improved the look of my skin!</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  Has a much waxier feel than previous versions of the Nivea CoQ10 products.</li>
    <li> I thought i was purchasing the same item I had purchased several times before with the same name.  However Nivea has removed the SPF 15 protection from this item.  Now if you want sunscreen protection you will have to purchase and use a second priduct along with this.  For me I&#x27;ll be looking for another product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea products for many years now and I will not use any other.  Love the scent and te product as a whole.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well, nice scent, feels good and easy to use because it dispenses from the bottom.  I know nothing about Q10 but it sounds techy  so it must be good...right.</li>
    <li> smells nice without being overwhelming; soothing - not heavy, zero irritation.    EDIT: 2014-10(Oct)-11    I have started using this all over my face as a moisturizing lotion and it is fantastic.  I am scaling back on my other facial moisturizing lotion which costs so much more.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and soothing on the face.</li>
    <li> This is thick, so less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency seems like it would protect the face in cold dry weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent you can mix with acne cream before applying.</li>
    <li> This is a very good aftershave. It helps sooth the skin after a shave or even if you have to go somewhere after a long day. It doesn&#x27;t give that oily feel some other aftershaves do. It also doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell which is a plus. Buying a pack from amazon is a lot cheaper then buying them individually from other places.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Soothes my face wonderfully after shaving and keeps my skin moisturized. The product is calming to the skin, without any alcohol burn or astringent sting. The scent, which is pleasant and light, does not linger. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the lotion is not the same you buy on the shelf in the store which leads me to believe that these are seconds on the production line. I would not but this product on Amazon again. The price difference isn&#x27;t worth the difference at Wal-Mart which seems to have good pricing on such products.</li>
    <li> nice to soothe my neck after a shave, and the smell is very faint but nice</li>
    <li> This product soothes the most &amp;#34;sore&amp;#34; shaved skin almost instantly. With the after burning is gone, your skin feels silky and smooth. There is a pleasant aroma that dissipates rather quickly, so you don&#x27;t walk into a room and have people stare at you like you drenched yourself in cologne. Good product.</li>
    <li> Helps prevent chaffing and those \\&quot;dents &amp; lines\\&quot; from wearing a CPAP mask.  I rotate this with Every Man Jack and mask wear marks are gone early morning.  Nice scent too!</li>
    <li> I normally use the regular Nivea revitalizing balm.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how different this new \\&quot;double action\\&quot; version would be before I ordered it, but decided to gamble on this 3-pack.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the feel or smell, so I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> First time I buy one of these, every time I shave myself I apply and is automatically makes my face skin soft and smooth. When finish I will order more, and by the way you dont need more than just a little very little amount of this balsam after shaving to leave your face soft and smooth and is a relief to your after shave experience.</li>
    <li> Shaving cream and showering dries the heck of of my face. This stuff, keeps it smooth, soft, comfortable, and moist. But not oily. Well, I&#x27;m able to shave everyday because of this stuff. Great product. 4.5 stars out of 5.</li>
    <li> Student who was looking into a cheap but quality product. Checked Walgreens shelves, but the prices from Pharmapacks were much better. Efficient shipping, well-wrapped. I don&#x27;t know if this Nivea \\&quot;Energy\\&quot; really energizes the whole face... haven&#x27;t seen a radiance in the past couple months.  Glad 1% of profits go to charity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, in the past I did the bare minimum (teeth, hair, shower, shave, etc..) when it comes to hygiene. I never thought about using lotions and balms because I egotistically thought &amp;#34;Oh, only women use those&amp;#34;. And no, I wasn&#x27;t just convinced because of the &amp;#34;For Men&amp;#34; on the label. It was because a friend of mine recommended this to me that I decided to use it. And yes, I like how great my skin feels (especially on my face. I&#x27;ve experimented with other aftershave on my face, but it was oily and sorta burned, that isn&#x27;t the case here). With my three bottles, I&#x27;ll be set for this year.</li>
    <li> Helps but isn&#x27;t the best. Has a good smell to it and keeps my face smooth but doesn&#x27;t help with the eczema I can get from shaving, at all.</li>
    <li> wonderful balm -- thank you..</li>
    <li> Great value, but I&#x27;ve moved on to Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> As a man with combination oily skin I usually only dry around the cheek areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been disciplined to moisturize after shaving, and I began to search for a true \\&quot;after shave\\&quot; balm. This product seemed great, because I could use it on my forehead as well as the shaved areas. I would never use 2 separate \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly tell you if this product is unique or great. But I can tell you that I like it and I have had no troubles using it. I have no dry cheeks, there has been shaving effects that have shown, and it applies very nicely. It is not thick, it has no odor, it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and have tried others only to find myself returning this this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does everything it claims and it&#x27;s the best value for your money.</li>
    <li> The reason I rate this product highly, is less for the lotion itself (which works just fine) and more because I find that the container to be the perfect size to fit in my cabinet, doesn&#x27;t make a mess (no drips), and has an easy open top.  In general, I find it to be a superior package to the more &amp;#34;tube-like&amp;#34; containers with twist tops.</li>
    <li> Goes on like a soothing lotion instead of the typical bracing shock of an aftershave.  The fragrance, however, isn&#x27;t for everyone.  It&#x27;s taken me some time to get adjusted to it.</li>
    <li> Pleasant enough smell, but a slight burn after application. Not sure if its sensitive skin or an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> How weird to get this as a pick from Kindle, price was high but great product and even after gifting one bottle have enough for the next two years.</li>
    <li> The best post-shave lotion I have ever used. It soothes and moisturizes very well, while not leaving your face greasy. I also really like how it smells!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and the cache of bottles in my drawer is evidence.  Great light moisturizer, and has soothing after-shave effect.</li>
    <li> This after shave balm as as good as products I tried that were 3 to 4 times the price. Very good value</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and sensitive skin and this is a part of a shaving routine that keeps my skin calm. I use the nivea sensitive shave cream (in the white can) first, followed by this, followed by the NIvea Essentials SPF lotion (blue tube.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because a little goes a long way, I like the way it smells, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my boyfriends favorite after shave.  So i bought a whole bunch because i couldn&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for son as a Christmas gift. It has a nice scent and my son seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I bought the two-pack of Nivea, which is OK compared to other after shave lotions. Maybe I&#x27;m picky or sensitive, but I really prefer the more expensive stuff, although I can&#x27;t always rationalize spending the money on what I feel is a beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No big negatives on this product, per se, except for my preferences. I have used other Nivea after shave lotions, and I can&#x27;t really tell any difference among the standard Nivea lotion, the Q10 Energy Balm (which I&#x27;m reviewing), or other Nivea lotions with Aloe or other soothing ingredients, except for the smell, which is more of a perfume than a musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that the flip-open cap tends to get a bit clogged, keeping the container from snapping completely closed, and has caused this to ooze into my shaving kit. No biggie; I just clean it out and it closes again - just be aware of this. A tube cap may work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted for this size (3.3 oz), mostly so I could be compliant with the TSA rules of 4 oz. or smaller, which works out well when I travel. It fits in my kit, but again, a tube may work better. If I am trying to travel with only carry-on luggage, this plastic container takes up more space than what lotion remains inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I may use this balm again, but I will steer away from this container.</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t burn your face after you shave. It acts like aftershave soothes the cuts and acts like a lotions.  So you don&#x27;t have to place face lotion after the Old Spice after shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and one only needs a small dab to do the job.  Feels great, nicely designed dispenser and I am&lt;br /&gt;very pleased.</li>
    <li> Hey my last name is Beard...so as you can imagine I have to shave often...plus I love to ride, run and swim, so my face takes a beating from wind and sun (nothing else b/c I live in San Diego...).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile. The three pack is a good deal. Nice cooling feeling without being all greasy.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s probably nothing overly spectacular about it, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with it since I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years consistently now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m of darker (black) complexion and went with this product for a face lotion since I don&#x27;t really shave (I use a trimmer) and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t an aftershave. It also helped that it is made by the same company that makes Eucerin (I believe, but confirm this yourself) and since I use Eucerin, I felt I&#x27;d go with this sister product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Your face really will be grateful after shaving&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can figure out it is that it would be nice if they had a product ment for persons with oily face</li>
    <li> I like all non-alcohol after shave products. I&#x27;m not sure this one is any better, but I trust Nivea brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in January and it has basically lasted the entire year! This is one of the few lotions that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face or give me acne, and this is certainly a great buy as it is much more expensive in stores.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for it. Prefer the Nivea sensitive gel. This one does not dry as quickly.</li>
    <li> Its not very greasy. Has tolerable fragrance and reasonably priced, I like it. I am sing if for many months now.</li>
    <li> great for moisturizing, especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff smells great!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve received compliments a number of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you prefer a product with a lighter scent or have really sensitive skin, try this instead:&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> I was a little uneasy about buying this in a pack of three because I have very sensitive skin and have a hard time finding the right after shave balm... But I&#x27;m really glad I did.  I&#x27;ve now used this product several times and every time I&#x27;ve used it, my skin is left soft and smooth without the greasy feeling that you get from other products.  I also like the fact that the bottles are small enough that they can be put in a carry on bag for getting through airport security.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea For Men. This balm cools and moisturizes the skin after a shave. I have sensitive skin and shaving can be brutal - electric or wet shave. Q10 calms the fury and gets my skin back to normal quickly.</li>
    <li> I really dislike alcohol-based aftershaves and have been using Nivea aftershaves as a result for a while. They&#x27;ve always felt much better to me, and this one is no exception. This 3-pack is enough to last me more than a year, and costs much less per bottle than buying individually does. Only downside is these don&#x27;t have the no-mess squeeze openings like some of their other products do, so you have to be a bit more careful to dose out the right amount.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t deal with the strong nasty lingering scent.</li>
