    <li> I am yet to find if it is a good brush.&lt;br /&gt;As it is I like it.&lt;br /&gt;it is an average like brush.</li>
    <li> I use this brush strictly for frest cuts. Once I do get a haircut, I use this brush for the first week. I normally cut my hair with a 1.5 guard with the grain. Once a week has passed I switch to the Diane 8119.</li>
    <li> Grandson loved it.  &amp;#34;Just like the one Pete, the barber, used when I got my hair cut.  Feels sooooo good&amp;#34;  Pete gave me name of brush (Diane) and I ordered one from Amazon.  thanks Amazon, Pete, and Diane</li>
    <li> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooo&lt;br /&gt;this is a dope product especially for me because I have very course hair but this brush curls your hair I really recommend this brush and also the 8118, 8119, 8159, 9007 they are perfect for waves pick up dianes and cqp</li>

    <li> great wave brush, connects waves easier and feels good when brushing hair, I wont leave home without my Diane 8169</li>
    <li> I really like the brush, makes my long straight hair nice and smooth. Some reviews said they had problems with the bristles, I have not. It&#x27;s already my favorite brush</li>
    <li> My waves already Sea Sick</li>

    <li> Received counterfeit brush unfortunately, you can google the images of the logos of a real diane brush and the photos posted were authentic but did not receive same item unfortunately.</li>
    <li> The brush is fine but I couldn&#x27;t get it through my hair.  My hair is thick.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brush its soft, big, and does the job.</li>
    <li> When I was younger Diane brushes were sold at Wal mart and I had the 8119. This is a great soft brush for my hair when low because I have a very soft grade. Shipping was fast also</li>
    <li> Great quality, effective and soft.</li>
    <li> The 8169 is a perfect soft/medium brush for 360 waves.</li>

    <li> I wear flat tops, this brush is great for this type of haircut.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush after I go in with my med brush I use this one to lay it down followed by a compression method</li>
    <li> Amazing softy had it for a couple months and it hasn&#x27;t worn out like my regular cheap brushes usually do</li>
    <li> Bristles started coming out as soon as i opened it before i even got a chance to use it. It&#x27;s not the brush you see in the pic the wording is completely different on the handle just regular bold lettering. I was gonna return it but didn&#x27;t wanna go through the hassle of sending it back so i guess ill it as a shower brush.... Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> too soft- doesn&#x27;t even penetrate my hair- first Amazon purchase i will have to return</li>
    <li> well, it&#x27;s cheap, right?  I haven&#x27;t used a hairbrush in years, but I&#x27;m on a new regimen of oils and they recommend brushing.  These bristles fall out quickly.  I might get a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; one if I find I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Diane brush</li>
