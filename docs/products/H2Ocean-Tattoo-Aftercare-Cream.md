      <li>The product is high quality and the customer service was as well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>But all of my Co workers and friends were admiring my healing and commented on how there&#x27;s scabbed over and turned ashy gray before looking normal</li>
      <li>/&gt;or even just as a normal hand</li>
      <li>My right arm is fully sleeved &amp; my left is 3/4</li>
      <li>Used this year&#x27;s ago when I got my first and only tattoo.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really use it for my last tattoo so may have wasted money but don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
      <li>it took 12 settings of 6 hours each to complete, so I was healing in new places each month for a year....</li>
      <li>so I went through the bottle in a few days, but other than that being a pain in that I have to go back to buy more</li>
      <li>I broke out in red blister like pimples that were extremely itchy and spread all over my arm after applying it to my new tattoo.</li>

    <li> This is the best tattoo cream we have found, it is water based, lasts longer, and seems to speed up the healing process as compared to other products tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff you buy after getting a tattoo. Neither A&amp;D ointment and vasoline come close to being as good as H2Ocean. The foam version of this is just as great. Very highly recommended</li>
    <li> I really had my hopes up that this would be a great product. In my experience, it is NOT good for a fresh tattoo. I got a really cool traditional skull and dagger yesterday and used this when I took my bandage off and then before bed. This morning it felt dry, but I&#x27;ve never scabbed up before, so I washed it and applied this cream. Just used it again making for a 4th application in total and I have scabs \\&quot;here and there\\&quot; all over it. Promptly washed this off and went back to aquaphor. This cream is good for when your tattoo starts to peel, but NOT until then. I contacted their customer service (before I got this tattoo) and was told that it was intended for fresh ink. I&#x27;m saying its not. It&#x27;s a moisturizer that can be used instead of lubriderm. Fresh ink &#x3D; aquaphor. Peeling stage &#x3D; this stuff. That is all.</li>
    <li> this is a good product if you like lotions instead of salves for tattoo aftercare. I personally wasn&#x27;t happy with this product. It is a nice light cream but it is quite watery and takes a while to absorb into the skin.  overall this product isn&#x27;t bad for a lotion. i do however prefer Tattoo Goo</li>
    <li> Works wonders on rashes and hives. Also great for healing tattoos</li>
    <li> great stuff...I used this heavily for a year....had a large Japanese tattoo in full color done .....it took 12 settings of 6 hours each to complete, so I was healing in new places each month for a year....one setting per month........I scabbed very little and healed with no scarring ,even the very heavily shaded parts of the design healed quickly with no problem....I HIGHLY SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This product is amazing...I just got my first tattoo and this is what the shop sold and it works very well.  It speeds up healing time, minimizes scabbing, keeps my tattoo moisturized, and it seals the tattoo, so that the ink doesn&#x27;t bleed out.  I got a very large tattoo so I went through the bottle in a few days, but other than that being a pain in that I have to go back to buy more, I have no complaints, and it also has a pretty pleasant smell. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Would absolutely purchase again! Highly recommended. We are very happy with our purchase. The product is high quality and the customer service was as well. AAA+++ Thank you... We will be back for more!</li>
    <li> I love this tattoo cream.&lt;br /&gt;i have used it on every one of my tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;also great for rashes ect...&lt;br /&gt;or even just as a normal hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;not greasy what so ever.</li>
    <li> I broke out in red blister like pimples that were extremely itchy and spread all over my arm after applying it to my new tattoo. I switched to raw cocoa butter and it helped a bit but i&#x27;m still healing from the breakout by H2Ocean. I would test on your skin before applying it to your tattoo, it&#x27;s painful and looks really gross</li>
    <li> This lotion works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried with any of my tattoos. It has a great feel and doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. It also does a great job of preventing flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see there is a review that says the product is not like the picture. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the newer product/packaging. Do a little research before you mindlessly bash a seller&#x27;s product. All I had to do was check the H2Ocean&#x27;s website. It took 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really use it for my last tattoo so may have wasted money but don&#x27;t know for sure. So cant give any real feedback</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used to heal my tattoos. My right arm is fully sleeved &amp; my left is 3/4 Still have some work to do). I&#x27;m allergic to Lanolin which took through some rough tattoo healing times until this was figured out (regular A&amp;D ointment has lanolin). This heals my tattoos perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;it really makes the colors pop &amp;  there was almost no peeling.&lt;br /&gt;Still follow the instructions from your artist but once you switch to moisturizer this worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> Used this year&#x27;s ago when I got my first and only tattoo. The guy charged me like 20 bucks for it. But all of my Co workers and friends were admiring my healing and commented on how there&#x27;s scabbed over and turned ashy gray before looking normal but mine always looked great. I attribute my Excellent healing to this and of course my own care in making sure I got no infections and keeping it cleaned.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff....I was first introduced to this after having a tat.&lt;br /&gt;BUT.....I have super sensitive skin and always cautious what I can use on my skin....It felt so good I took a chance and tried it as a facial moisturizer and it is fabulous. My boyfriend also has sensitivity issues so he tried it one day and now it&#x27;s the only thing we both use. THANK YOU THANK YOU</li>
    <li> The image shown is not what I received at all. I really wanted the exact tube as shown but&lt;br /&gt; didn&#x27;t receive it.</li>
    <li> The only tattoo aftercare product that I use on my tattoos. Got this when the girlfriend got her tattoo and she was impressed with how well it worked and the fact that it was greasy.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! Keep it in my first aid kit!!</li>
    <li> I like it so much really good for new and old tattoos, very useful to get a beautifull final result.</li>
