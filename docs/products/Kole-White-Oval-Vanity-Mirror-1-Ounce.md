<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Something of this quality should be sold at a dollar store.  I wouldn&#x27;t hang this thing in an outhouse.</li>
    <li> This is a plastic mirror, probably good enough for a kids room.  Very cheaply made, not worth the $11 and change  I paid for it.  Reflects a clear image.</li>
    <li> Broke while wrapped under tree</li>
    <li> Nice mirror for our RV</li>
    <li> Do not buy this mirror trash</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m remodelling my two bathrooms and had removed the large mirrors and needed something to tack up on the wall until the job is finished.&lt;br /&gt;Thes mirrors fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re large enough and sturdy enough to act as temporary vanity mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what I&#x27;ll do with them after the project id finished but they&#x27;re inexpensive so it&#x27;s not a major consideration.</li>
    <li> this mirror is the perfect size. I have a half bath with a window right over the sink - but I had no mirror, I needed something to fit in there that would not take up a lot of room but would still be large enough to be functional. This mirror is Great! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Nice mirror - I am using it as a LED candle tray in a lower cabinet for more reflection!</li>
    <li> It was a little smaller than what I thought but it makes a great temporary mirror until I can get something bigger.</li>
    <li> broke almost immediately.</li>
    <li> The plastic frame cracked and broke less than three months after I purchased it.  Luckily the mirror inside did not shatter when the whole thing fell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people have complained about these but I bought a bunch for crafting and they are basically as described. They are 14x10 inches, have a clear mirror, and a great price. If you want something high-end then go buy something that isn&#x27;t $5-10. These work perfectly and can be painted, decoupaged, polymer clay-ed- get creative, folks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and super cheap looking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s functional I guess but not at all what I expected. The frame is cheap plastic and the backing is a flimsy cardboard. It was difficult to put up on a tile wall but I managed to get it on with 3m picture hangers. I put it in my bathroom for my tot. Again does the job but not what  I expected</li>
    <li> It was broken and had no return label to ship it back.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, perfectly suits my relatively small bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very small, make sure you check the measurements.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting  high quality mirror at such a very low price; however, this one looks absolutely cheap.</li>

    <li> Very cheep plastic mirror</li>
    <li> Arrived broken and appears cheap. Cost too much to return so threw it out</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror, but the description says plastic,and the mirror itself is glass. I was specifically trying to find a mirror that was all plastic.</li>
    <li> I plan on using this so my daughter can see to brush her teeth. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. Don&#x27;t expect a high quality mirror for less than 10 bucks. You can easily remove the glass from the frame and just use the piece of glass if need be.</li>
    <li> very beautiful for my bath room . my wife love it</li>
    <li> Crappy. Broke same day.</li>
    <li> Perfect for bath and view for applying makeup, face care, checking the makeup, etc.</li>

    <li> This was very cheap.  Could have gotten a better one at Wal-Mart for this price</li>
    <li> kinda cheap, but it&#x27;s inexpensive so you get what you expect.</li>
    <li> Very good for kids bathroom, I put it under regular bathroom mirror and it fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> plastic piece of junk&lt;br /&gt;can probably pick up something similar at the 99 cent store&lt;br /&gt;5.99 would be a better price / if you are expecting anything close to quality you will be really disappointed&lt;br /&gt;may return mine</li>
    <li> Looks elegant and will add to the spare bedroom I will place it in. It is the perfect size, seems sturdy enough and has that old world styling I love.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. It is durable and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Stunning mirror, really changed the look of my bathroom. Looks great and is true value for the price when compared to other similar mirrors. This is perfect for my powder room and more beautiful than pictured. Very updated and classy. This mirror is a must have.</li>
    <li> Really happy with my purchase!!!! Looks very cute in my daughter&#x27;s room. She really enjoys this mirror!!!! Good deal for the price!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Inexpensive  &amp; great for kids</li>
    <li> Flimsy backing and has gray spots all over the white border of mirror.</li>
    <li> Was a lot smaller than I was hoping, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this mirror for our son&#x27;s college dorm. It&#x27;s looks great and is also at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty stable to me.. Plastic frame but glass mirror.. Budget priced, budget mirror.. You can&#x27;t expect more for less. Not simply made for kids, adults can use it too without embarrassment (except maybe prudes). Thanks S&amp;D and Amazon for a good deal.</li>
    <li> The frame is cheap plastic. The mirror broke within the first week. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I knew it&#x27;s going to be small. It&#x27;s smaller then I expected. Still looks good with my small console. The frame is a plastic, it would be better if it&#x27;s wooden frame. The mirror is not perfectly flat, but good enough for me. I&#x27;m going to keep it :)</li>
    <li> It is an oval mirror that I hang on a door.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> When I opened up the package the mirror was cracked</li>
