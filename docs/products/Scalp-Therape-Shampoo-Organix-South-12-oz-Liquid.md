      <li>If you have psoriasis of the scalp, this product works great - significantly reducing flare-ups and skin flakes - and comparable in price to designer shampoos (cheaper than many).</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve come across in my search for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals but also leaves my hair soft and my scalp moisturized.</li>

      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>

      <li>Works better than all the meds my dr gave me to try.</li>
      <li>my scalp felt better...</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It seems like it&#x27;s mostly water</li>
      <li>But I still LOVE this shampoo</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in my rotation of shampoos, but I sadly won&#x27;t be able to use it as a stand-alone.</li>
      <li>This leaves my hair shinier, and in better condition than it ever was before.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I like the scent of this shampoo, and I&#x27;m confident it works well for some people.  </li>
      <li>I used it and my hair feels softer and more manageable than it has in 10 years.</li>
      <li>is respected by Ayurvedic practitioners for its ability to support healthy skin and scalps.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner together and they keep my hair and scalp healthy.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Like many sulfate-free shampoos it doesn&#x27;t lather too well</li>
      <li>great product if your not looking for a specific color safe shampoo!</li>
      <li>I like the natural ingredients which make a difference to shiny beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>Feels and smells refreshing in this very hot weather!</li>
      <li>so it can more easily coat and inteact with you scalp, which is fine, but</li>
      <li>This shampoo isn&#x27;t drying, lathers well, and most importantly it works.</li>
      <li>It is chemical free and healthy.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this is that it is sulfate free and cruelty</li>
      <li>and so I end up using more trying to get full coverage</li>
      <li>it IS a little runny, but it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also cruelty free and vegan.</li>
      <li>Paraben Free • Sulfate Free •</li>
      <li>It used to feel like what the moon would feel like, but now it is smooth.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Nioxin series to clean my scalp and then used Neutrogena clarifying shampoo too.  </li>
      <li>may not smell good, but I look 20 years younger.</li>
      <li>I did wait until I finished the bottle to be fair, and that took about 3.5 weeks of regular hair washings.  </li>
      <li>And it smells a whole lot better too.</li>
      <li>on the amazon description it mentioned the product was color safe, but nowhere on the actual package or brands website did it say color safe...  </li>
      <li>at bay and very refreshing in the shower at the same time.</li>
      <li>and I have to use more than the normal amount to wash my hair.</li>
      <li>I have such clean hair and it smells nice.  </li>
      <li>Hair is shinier and more lively.  </li>
      <li>after I got over half way through the bottle wasn&#x27;t so happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I am SO GLAD that I did, and I hope that anyone reading this with a problem, or just someone who wants beautiful soft hair tries this series.  </li>
      <li>top of the shampoo and conditioner, I also created my own hair oil (neem oil, jojoba oil and castor oil), which I apply a little to my scalp and the ends of my hair as a &amp;#34;shine/frizz&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ordered this by mistake thinking it was another shampoo by the same brand that I really liked.</li>
      <li>It also has a distinct medicinal aroma.</li>
      <li>The herbal smell seems to go away and just leaves it fresh.</li>
      <li>Used for centuries, Neem protects, nourishes and moisturizes even the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying for scalp and hair</li>
      <li>This shampoo is thinner than most so it will penetrate completely to the scalp.</li>
      <li>otherwise the symptoms tend to return pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine shampoo and gets the hair clean, can barely smell the neem oil, just did not work for me as advertised.</li>
      <li>now a few days into it, I have no hair loss issue, my scalp is almost itch free, and my hair FEELS better than it has in years!  </li>
      <li>It also makes my think, curly hair, soft and easy to manage..</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ordering my third bottle right now because it&#x27;s done what no shampoo has been able to do for me before</li>
      <li>Broke me out the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Much better than regular dandruff shampoo, and organic too.</li>
      <li>I meet many people daily as part of my job.</li>
      <li>Good for normal-to-oily scalp and makes hair fluffy.  </li>
      <li>This is a good shampoo for once a month scalp cleansing its very invigorating, pours very liquify so be careful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> See my review of the Conditioner. I use the shampoo and conditioner together. Itching and &#x27;bumps&#x27; persist.</li>
    <li> Good product. Gentle. Makes scalp feel great.</li>
    <li> Love it! It sort of tingles. It is chemical free and healthy. My hair is puffy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Heretofore, the only shampoo that worked for my scalp was tar shampoo, which I have heard is definitely NOT good!!  A friend recommended this shampoo and I LOVE it!  I have severe dermititeis on my scalp - flaking, itching, scabbing - and this works!!!  I am so thrilled to find a shampoo that works for me that is actually good for my skin.  It leaves my hair very soft and not dry AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is expensive, no question about it.  It also did nothing for me.  In fact, for me, it was significantly worse than OTC \\&quot;dry scalp\\&quot; shampoos.  It is the consistancy of water so it can more easily coat and inteact with you scalp, which is fine, but it means that you need to use more, thus making the product even more expensive than it seems.  While I agree that it leaves no buildup, it left my hair very dry and straw-like, left my scalp VERY dry (we&#x27;re talking flaking within 2-3 hours of showering), and it also smells pretty bad - definitely a negative when its still noticable to my wife several hours later.  I did wait until I finished the bottle to be fair, and that took about 3.5 weeks of regular hair washings.  It started bad and ended bad.  To me this all adds up to a whopping 1 star review.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again ever.</li>
    <li> Been using for dry scalp/dandruff. Both the shampoo and conditioner. Much better than regular dandruff shampoo, and organic too. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I had been using this for sometime. I had actually switched to another natural shampoo for a while to try out another brand&lt;br /&gt;but after I got over half way through the bottle wasn&#x27;t so happy with the results. I also get dandruff very easy. This seems to keep&lt;br /&gt;everything at bay and very refreshing in the shower at the same time. I also used some on my doggie when she ran out of shampoo one time and its good for her too and safe. Neem also keeps fleas away in case you didn&#x27;t know. I am so happy to be using this again. This is my number one shampoo!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo!!!! I don&#x27;t need to use much for it to work. it IS a little runny, but it works wonderfully. I have such clean hair and it smells nice.  You do need to leave it on for 3-5 minutes to get the full effect of the neem, especially if you are using it for dandruff. It is kind of cooling on the scalp.  I have really thick and long hair and this has no problem working through it, cleaning it, or leaving it dry. This leaves my hair shinier, and in better condition than it ever was before.  I will NEVER go back to regular shampoos again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For All Hair Types &amp; Sensitive Scalps&lt;br /&gt;• Paraben Free • Sulfate Free • Gluten Free&lt;br /&gt;Neem, Lemon &amp; Peppermint&lt;br /&gt;Neem is respected by Ayurvedic practitioners for its ability to support healthy skin and scalps. Used for centuries, Neem protects, nourishes and moisturizes even the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying for scalp and hair&lt;br /&gt;• Formulated for scalp relief&lt;br /&gt;• pH balanced and conditioning&lt;br /&gt;To use: Use daily or as needed. This shampoo is thinner than most so it will penetrate completely to the scalp. Apply to wet hair and massage well. Allow to remain in hair for 3 to 5 minutes, then rinse completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqueous Extracts of Azadirachta Indica (Neem) Leaf*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint)*, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary)* and Melissa Officinalis (Lemon Balm)*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Coco Glucoside, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium Cocoglucoside Citrate, Kosher Glycerin, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Azadirachta Indica (Neem) Oil*, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Essential Oils of Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) and Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;* Certified Organic</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  My head use to burn and itch, but since using this shampoo, my scalp feels so much better.  It used to feel like what the moon would feel like, but now it is smooth.  Hair is growing back and it is very shiny and healthy looking.  The shampoo is thin, but a little goes a long way.  After using it myself, I don&#x27;t understand the comment from the poster above.  One bottle of shampoo lasted me four months.  I am now on my second bottle of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Neem is a wonderful natural product for skin issues and great for anti-aging skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Use Neem products whenever you can, but beware of the smell and add a little extra perfume when you go out.&lt;br /&gt;I may not smell good, but I look 20 years younger.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo for once a month scalp cleansing its very invigorating, pours very liquify so be careful. I like the natural ingredients which make a difference to shiny beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> WARNING! I have only used this shampoo once, so this is not a review about the effectivness of the formula, only the smell. I did not purchase from Amazon, I purchased this from a local health food store. Since I have been reading reviews on different neem shampoos I have run across many of them that have negative reviews based on their smell. This is NOT one of those! I was suprised at the pleasant smell. Especially compared to other OTC medicated dandruff shampoos. I was so relieved when I opened the cap and smelled a pleasant, refreshing herby aroma. I know that one other reviewer did not like it, but I am wondering if maybe he received a bottle that was from a bad batch? If so that would explain the bad smell that lingered even after he rinsed the shampoo out and his hair dried. Because the bottle I have not only smells good, after I rinsed and blow dried my hair, I had my husband smell my hair and he barely smelled anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will update later on the effectiveness of the formula, or lack thereof, if that be the case.</li>
    <li> I have, correction; HAD really bad itchy scalp and my dandruff was out of control. My niece had lice and this is what her mom used to kill the live and stop the itching so I thought I would give it a try. In a matter of days my dandruff was GONE! It&#x27;s really thin shampoo which is great because it gets right through you hair (and I have extremely thick hair) and to the scalp within seconds. I will never go back to using anything else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat buyer.  Cured my itchy scalp better than anything I&#x27;ve found in stores, and the smell is great.  Well worth the price, as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve come across in my search for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals but also leaves my hair soft and my scalp moisturized. All of the organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried left my hair and scalp dry and caused big build up problems for me. I use the shampoo and conditioner together and they keep my hair and scalp healthy. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> is helping my scalp problem......smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> on the amazon description it mentioned the product was color safe, but nowhere on the actual package or brands website did it say color safe...  great product if your not looking for a specific color safe shampoo!</li>
    <li> Wanted to see how the adult shampoo works. Have been a fan of their kid&#x27;s shampoo for my toddler for 2 yrs. Maybe our hair types are different that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t work as well for me. I still have hair breakage (albeit less that before - or maybe I&#x27;m imagining).</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much the lemon in this would lighten my hair over time.  I only wash it every other day.  After a few months my hair was getting so much lighter people thought I was bleaching, so had to stop using it.  I&#x27;ll give it a blonde friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years now. I keep buying it because it&#x27;s so gentle on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have severe scalp psoriasis, and after trying nearly every psoriasis shampoo on the market including prescriptions this cleared up my scalp by 80% in only one wash. I can&#x27;t wait for the next wash!!! Thank goodness I found relief.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo. Very effective against dandruff and other scalp related problems. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have Psoriasis on my scalp and my hair is thinning out. Yikes!!!. I was using Tea Tree Oil Shampoo that stopped the itching/scaling for 2 days max. I heard that Neem Oil Shampoo was really good for Psoriasis of the scalp. So, I got Theraneem Shampoo as it looked like the best the use.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally amazed at how it stopped the itching and scaling AND I didn&#x27;t see hair in my hands when I washed my hair with it the second time. This Theraneem Shampoo has saved my scalp and hair. I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. It really helps with my sensitive scalp and hair loss. Make sure to leave it in for 3 minutes before you wash it out. I recommend using it with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> If  you have an itchy or inflamed scalp, this shampoo is the truth. It saved me from scratching my hair off my head.  It has neem, and cooling mint, etc.  It is thinner, but really gets in your hair and scalp and helps to remove the itch but the cause also.  I use it in my crown. My hair is very soft when I rinse. Works better than all the meds my dr gave me to try.</li>
    <li> It did not clear my scalp of dandruff, dried the hell out of my hair and left it frizzy and frail, and does not lather very well. Bad choice for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this shampoo.  I have an itchy scalp and periodically get sores in my scalp from scratching all the time.  This shampoo has done wonders for my scalp.  Although I must use it every day, it has stopped my itchy scalp and scratching.  This is good stuff.  I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone one who has any type of scalp disorder.</li>
    <li> The silicone and other bizarre ingredients in today&#x27;s commercial shampoos sent my scalp into a chronic reaction which cleared up a lot with a switch to 100% natural shampoos at last, but wasn&#x27;t 100% cured.  Knowing neem is great for all kinds of skin things, I got this shampoo.  Have used it twice so far with dramatic improvement.  I leave it on 3-5 minutes before rinsing.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was that it leaves my fine, limp hair full of body and shine, without using a conditioner!  And here I&#x27;ve been trying one natural shampoo after another trying to get some body.  I&#x27;d give this 5 stars but I do smell a bit of neem even after thorough rinsing--it&#x27;s a smell I dislike.  I don&#x27;t know if other people can smell it, but I can.  So once my scalp is fixed I&#x27;ll have to switch to another shampoo.  Which is a shame because this shampoo is fantastic for fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> fixed my dry, itchy scalp</li>
    <li> I meet many people daily as part of my job. The clothes that I wear are darker in color and tend to show dandruff and flaking skin.&lt;br /&gt;TheraNeem has eliminated this problem for me. I do not have to brush off my shoulders before meeting people.&lt;br /&gt;Also I like the slight natural orange fragrance when you first apply it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo a couple times so far but I am really liking it.  My hair is shiny after I use it and it leaves my hair feeling clean and more full than it usually is.  My favorite thing about this is that it is sulfate free and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: The smell is kind of weird but not terribly unpleasant; nothing at all like pure neem oil which is what I was worried about.  After my shower I don&#x27;t notice a smell at all and my hair just smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture:  This shampoo is really watery and pours out of the bottle really fast.  Like many sulfate-free shampoos it doesn&#x27;t lather too well but there is some lather.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Hair is shinier and more lively.  It seems to have improved a spot of excema that I have had for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I bought it for my son&#x27;s seboreic dermatitis. I used it and my hair feels softer and more manageable than it has in 10 years.</li>
    <li> Recently, my scalp has been super dry. It flaked a ton until I would wash it, but then it&#x27;d come back even worse. Three washes so far with this stuff, and my dandruff has diminished to 1/12 of what it previously was. Not to mention how shiny and bouncy it makes my hair. Definitely want to try supplementing with the conditioner!</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this shampoo, and I&#x27;m confident it works well for some people.  That said, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  If you read the label closely, neem leaf is the largest ingredient, but neem oil, which is (for me) far more effective is the 13th or so - meaning that there&#x27;s relatively little neem oil in this shampoo.  I get that - pure neem oil stinks, it makes me want to retch, and no one wants a shampoo that stinks of fermenting, rotted onions on a good day, but I&#x27;m convinced that more neem oil would help my chronic dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give this 3 stars.  It&#x27;s in my rotation of shampoos, but I sadly won&#x27;t be able to use it as a stand-alone.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo, but a little drying on my fragile hair.  To fix that I mix it with some hair conditioner when I apply the shampoo.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> If you have psoriasis of the scalp, this product works great - significantly reducing flare-ups and skin flakes - and comparable in price to designer shampoos (cheaper than many).</li>
    <li> I have been suffering my entire life from dandruff and excema on my scalp. I have been using Tar shampoo for years and years, despite the cancer and health risk as nothing else will work. I heard about Neem on Dr. Oz and decided to give this a try. The smell as others have noted is a bit strong and the shampoo is very thin but this was not an issue for me. Despite using it every day and letting it soak on the scalp for 3-5 minutes for over two weeks, I found that it really didn&#x27;t help my condition and made it a bit worse actually. Maybe I should try straight neem oil instead. I will probably still use it in conjunction with my tar shampoo, but I cannot use just it alone.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I had to throw this away after only 10 days of use as my scalp got progressively itchier and my hair more straw-like.  It also has a distinct medicinal aroma. I hated to waste it, as it was quite concentrated so the bottle would have lasted a while.  Sorry to be unable to recommend it as I generally favor organic and natural products.</li>
    <li> Stopped having to use my prescription.</li>
    <li> I do not like this shampoo at all. It made my hair and scalp super dry and actually started showing dandruff flakes in my hair. I used it 3 times and all times it was the same result. It also does not lather well. I had high hopes in this product since its supposed to contain neem, but it is totally unsatisfactory.</li>
    <li> So far I am very please with these products, despite only using them a few times. I have had an issue with dry scalp and dandruff for the past year and a half, without cause, and this has been very effective so far. I hardly have any proof to show that I&#x27;ve struggled with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the shampoo and conditioner, I also created my own hair oil (neem oil, jojoba oil and castor oil), which I apply a little to my scalp and the ends of my hair as a &amp;#34;shine/frizz&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells and feels good, but at $13 it was a disappointment.  It did not help my dry scalp at all.</li>
    <li> This really helped my seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp. My scalp is less itchy and flakey, and doesn&#x27;t get oily as quickly. This shampoo isn&#x27;t drying, lathers well, and most importantly it works. The smell is kinda funky (probably the neem in it) but nothing terrible, and I have a very sensitive nose. Yes it is thin and liquidy but putting a pump top on it helps a lot and helps me use/waste less. I think this would be good for anyone with SD, dandruff or just an occasional dry itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with the hopes of it easing my scalp irritation. It does indeed help with my issue of itching and scaleing.. It also makes my think, curly hair, soft and easy to manage.. I use it with the conditioner and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I need it something to improve my scalp. After a few washes I started to see the difference. My hair looks a lot better!</li>
    <li> Broke me out the first time I used it. My scalp is now clear. It does work</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not work for me.  I tried it about 3 times total, and my scalp was raging itchy!  I cannot remember any shampoo causing my scalp to itch so intensely, so quickly following useage.  It also made my scalp very dry and uncomfortable.  I cannot use, or recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> But for my dandruff, (thus far) it seems less effective than cheaper store bought shampoos. I will use the whole bottle, but doubt i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Really gentle and helpful for a dry scalp. Doesn&#x27;t foam up too much&lt;br /&gt;and leaves my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> Used all of this shampoo to help with flaky scalp issues. Saw little improvement, but enjoyed the smell of this product. Would consider reordering in the future.</li>
    <li> Very thin shampoo that penetrates the scalp through the hair. Nice smell as well. Suffered from a severe condition of dissecting cellulitis of the scalp and this is one of the few products that actually worked for me.</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to a professional coloring treatment, that just got worse as the days went on.  16 weeks had gone by and I was losing hair by the handful.  My head itched so badly that I imagined I had lice! I bought the Nioxin series to clean my scalp and then used Neutrogena clarifying shampoo too.  Nothing abated the itch or hair loss.  I bought the TheraNeem Scalp Therape shampoo AND conditioner and the next day my scalp felt better...now a few days into it, I have no hair loss issue, my scalp is almost itch free, and my hair FEELS better than it has in years!  I just blowed it out and used NOT ONE of my blow style treatments and it looks great!  I buy the best Professional products and was afraid to use this product on my color treated hair...but I wasn&#x27;t going to have any left, so I just bought it.  I am SO GLAD that I did, and I hope that anyone reading this with a problem, or just someone who wants beautiful soft hair tries this series.  Our hair health begins at the scalp, and this product is making mine healthier than it has been in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I also bathed all three of my dogs using the shampoo ONCE and all of their coats feel great! And the skin condition on the little guy looks better to the eye! It is a natural tick and flea repellant I hear.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin/scalp, seb derm, and hair loss as a result. This shampoo relieves the itching, my scalp feels \\&quot;calm\\&quot;. Relieves the inflammation. Love it. I would say this shampoo is best for people who have very oily skin/scalp.</li>
    <li> A great product. I have been using this for several years. It works at least as well as the shampoos with much more exotic chemical (or dangerous like coal tar). And it smells a whole lot better too. In my opinion it does not seem to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; it effectiveness as quickly as the typical scalp care shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its usefulness extends to beards as well. This and other products in this line are the only thing I have found that helps during the dreaded itching phase of growing a beard.</li>
    <li> I have scalp psoriasis and have been using this for about 4 weeks now; it alleviates the itching, dryness and redness. I do follow the directions and leave it on for the 3-5 minutes. I like the minty smell; it is watery-so be careful when pouring. This is the best shampoo I have tried yet- keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Makes the bumps on my head go away.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helps me keep my soborrheic dermatitis at bay.  It does strip my hair of all softness so I use a deep conditioner after.</li>
    <li> Right in the beginning of my review, I&#x27;d like to point out that this shampoo isn&#x27;t perfect. The same applies to the gentle therapy shampoo which I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t complete get rid of dandruff (it doesn&#x27;t claim to though) and sometimes, it does dry out my hair even with conditioning and I have to use this everyday to see lasting results.But I still LOVE this shampoo and I&#x27;m ordering my third bottle right now because it&#x27;s done what no shampoo has been able to do for me before and that is stop that incessant itching.&lt;br /&gt;I developed red itchy patches on my scalp about 6 months back and they itched like crazy, not to mention the dandruff in my hair tripled for no particular reason. I went crazy with the itch because the products that would work for me before, like head and shoulders and the tar shampoo just completely stopped working. So I did a little research and ordered this and I&#x27;m so thankful to all the reviewers out there because it really preserved my sanity by stopping the itch from the first time I used it!!&lt;br /&gt;And slowly but steadily, the red patches in my scalp are definitely going way!! Yay! But, like I said, I have to use this everyday otherwise the symptoms tend to return pretty quickly. I use this + the tar shampoo once a week because it takes care of excessive dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase this product because it&#x27;s been a miracle as far as stopping the itch for me.</li>
    <li> I am natural and was diagnosis with Psoriasis of the scalp and the medicated shampoo the Dermatologist prescribed made it worst in my opinion; especially, when I did the Dominican Blowout to straighten my hair.  Since I’ve been using this shampoo for the past month and half, not only have I seen a healthier scalp, I can even straighten my hair and not have those scaly patches.  I will never stop using this product.  It even works well with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Ordered this by mistake thinking it was another shampoo by the same brand that I really liked. This one does not foam well at all and it doesn&#x27;t leave the same clean feeling to my hair. it also smells bad.</li>
    <li> I have severe seborrheic dermatitis and this shampoo immediately stopped the burning itch and flaking. It does drying my hair some, so I use a deep moisturizing conditioner afterwards. I will continue to purchase this product because it works.</li>
    <li> For years my husband has fought scalp eczema (dry, itching, red scalp with sores).  He started getting relief after one week of use.</li>
    <li> Neem is known for being gentle and healing for difficult scalps. I have seborrheic dermatitis and have tried tons of shampoos over the years. This is one of the best at controlling my itchiness, redness, and flaking. It smells very nice and is surprisingly moisturizing. My long hair doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as with other shampoos. It&#x27;s also cruelty free and vegan. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I&#x27;d like and so I end up using more trying to get full coverage (I have a lot of hair). I alternate this shampoo with Max Green Alchemy&#x27;s Scalp Rescue Shampoo (which costs a little more but lathers better).</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would help with my scalp issues. It didn&#x27;t really seem to help and it doesn&#x27;t lather very well. It seems like it&#x27;s mostly water and I have to use more than the normal amount to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Good for normal-to-oily scalp and makes hair fluffy.  It seems to soothe the scalp nicely.  The herbal smell seems to go away and just leaves it fresh.</li>
    <li> My seborrheic dermatitis scalp feels better after one use! When you go to pour product you need to do it slowly because it is runny. The runnyness is due to no use of water but aloe vera juice and no chemical thickeners. I apply to scalp only, you don&#x27;t need to shampoo the hair, it&#x27;s enough for it to have the shampoo go down the strands in rinse. I gently massaged my scalp and left it on for a few minutes while shaving and washing up and rinsed. It doesn&#x27;t foam much like I said and after sitting on the scalp it seems to almost disappear which is because it&#x27;s penetrated the skin. I then used my conditioner of choice (I really like Wen so I don&#x27;t bother trying any other brand). Scalp feels great! I like the smell, too. To me it&#x27;s a combo of lemony pepperminty herbally smell. Feels and smells refreshing in this very hot weather!</li>
    <li> I have an itchy, flaky scalp; likely eczema or psoriasis but undiagnosed.  I read the reviews for this product and hoped it would help, but alas.  I used it for a month or two and no joy.  It&#x27;s a fine shampoo and gets the hair clean, can barely smell the neem oil, just did not work for me as advertised.</li>
    <li> I had a skin condition that could not be resolved by a dermatologist over 18 months.  Use of this product solved the problem.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great - it&#x27;s organic and has no parabens or harsh preservatives in it. It leaves NO residue behind - so no buildup on my scalp, which has been a complaint of other organic shampoos.  It smells ok, but I care more about how it makes my hair clean and feels good :) I will never go back to other shampoos.</li>
    <li> This product is just so -so for me. It cleans my hair but does nothing for the bumps on my head unfortunately. Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo seems to be a better option for me.</li>
