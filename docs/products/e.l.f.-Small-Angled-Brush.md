      <li>but it does the job :)</li>

      <li>the brush feels cheap and it came apart!</li>
      <li>To my surprise the quality is amazing and most important, affordable.</li>

      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>given the inexpensive price, and I was able to glue the brush to the handle, but PULEESE.</li>
      <li>It has so many uses, and it works with the E.L.F. Brush cleaner.</li>
      <li>This brush has easily become a favorite.</li>
      <li>I really love this brush, it makes a nice clean line and really holds the powder well.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>I use it to lightly fill in my brows with Anastasias brow pomade and it works wonder.</li>
      <li>Good and soft angled brush.</li>
      <li>Sturdy brush and makes nice clean straight lines without collapsing</li>
      <li>I pretty much have two requirements for a good brow brush: price and stiffness of bristles.</li>
      <li>i was excited to try this brush as well as some others</li>
      <li>Moreover, because I have a brush like this, I now use powder for eyeliner which is a lot more forgiving to apply and looks more natural!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this brush in an attempt to try out using powder to fill in my brows, but of course ended up learning</li>
      <li>(I believe that is the original purpose of this brush, I&#x27;m just still learning about makeup.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super cheap, which you can tell when you receive .</li>
      <li>I bought this to use to clean up manicures.  </li>
      <li>This brush does the job.nothing really special about it</li>
      <li>Awesome little brow brush!!</li>
      <li>Definitely gives you a nice smooth line though.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I saw this brush on a video for applying dark shadow along the lash line.  </li>
      <li>Have had a few months still going great.</li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>I find it does quite a nice job of blending colors on my upper lid and as an eyeliner brush along the bottom of my eye.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good brush for loose eyeliner powder or like the Mac gel liner that comes in a pot.</li>
      <li>The brush I purchased from Bare Escentuals is the best, albeit much more expensive.</li>
      <li>The bristles themselves are very short, and this brush can be used for eyebrows, gel liner, or even eyeshadow liner which is what i love.</li>
      <li>Bought a similar cheaper product that was much better.</li>
      <li>I really recommend buying this brush!</li>
      <li>This product is of very high quality and has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>It is much easier to use that the brush I was using.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for thin lines and the bristles spread more apart the more you use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, soft enough.</li>
      <li>With the very first time I used it, actually I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.  </li>
      <li>The hair of the brush is also very soft!</li>
      <li>i guess I&#x27;ll stick to My normal brushes....</li>
      <li>This brush is kinda stiff which is what I love about it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far with the bristles falling off or bending out of shape.</li>
      <li>but I have been too busy to visit the store.</li>
      <li>Too soft.  </li>
      <li>I think this brush would work well if you want SUPER stiff bristles.  </li>

<li> Too soft.  </li>
<li> I think this brush would work well if you want SUPER stiff bristles.  </li>
<li> This is a high quality little brush.</li>
<li> The stem is as long as a pencil (but a lot thinner)</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up since it&#x27;s synthetic,</li>
<li> So glad I found it because I was going to buy MAC, but I always looking for a less expensive alternative.</li>
<li> Fell apart quickly, not very good quality or worth the money.</li>
<li> I use this eyeliner brush with &amp;#34;Wet n Wild Fergie Centerstage Collection On Edge Cream Eyeliner&amp;#34; in  little black dress.</li>
<li> The bristles aren&#x27;t stiff enough to use as an eyebrow or eyeliner brush.</li>
<li> This is a slightly longer brush handle than I prefer (almost as long as as dollar bill) ,  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave powder fallout all over your face like other brushes can.</li>
<li> Pretty useless.</li>
<li> Though not quite as stiff as the Sephora brush,  the bristles are stiff enough that I&#x27;ve created brows that garner compliments.</li>
<li> (you can push down on it and not have it deform on you).</li>
<li> My typical go-to eyebrow brush is from Sephora for $10</li>
<li> I use this for eyelining and tight eye lining.</li>
<li> I was looking for something a little softer.  </li>
<li> This is a simple product, it should not be broken when you receive it.</li>
<li> Its stiff but flexible and works just how I need it to.</li>
<li> It works well since the brush is stiff and maintains its shape.  </li>
<li> , The brush is small and allows you to apply with precision.</li>
<li> It works just as well as the expensive brands but only costs a fraction of the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Too soft.  The brush I purchased from Bare Escentuals is the best, albeit much more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality little brush. I use it when I do my eyebrows, and it&#x27;s just perfect! I have zero complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I like this brush for powdered eye liner, but would have given it a 5 star rating had the brush tip been thinner and the length just a bit shorter.</li>
    <li> although i purchased mine through target, the brush is still from the same manufacturer. i was excited to try this brush as well as some others, that was until i opened it. the brush feels cheap and it came apart! Disappointed. i guess I&#x27;ll stick to My normal brushes....</li>
    <li> I use this for my crease, not for eyeliner. And it&#x27;s the perfect width for my crease. I don&#x27;t think I would use it for my eyeliner, but that&#x27;s because I like a very thin line, not the think lines that are in now a day. Definitely gives you a nice smooth line though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use to clean up manicures.  It works well since the brush is stiff and maintains its shape.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up since it&#x27;s synthetic, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I bought this at Target for $3.  Here, it&#x27;s almost $8.  Buy it at Target for much less!!</li>
    <li> i like it wish i had gotten two of it same time</li>
    <li> Very good quality!!!Fast shipping, thank you.</li>
    <li> Amazing gives me a good eyebrow arch each time. Have had a few months still going great. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use it to lightly fill in my brows with Anastasias brow pomade and it works wonder. Its stiff but flexible and works just how I need it to. The best brow bush I&#x27;ve used and its super affordable.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye brow brush! I use this in conjunction with Anastasia brow powder and I get the perfect brows every time. It works just as well as the expensive brands but only costs a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m glad I got this. RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> My typical go-to eyebrow brush is from Sephora for $10 but I have been too busy to visit the store. I researched on amazon for for price vs. quality and and have decided to to try this  brush. I pretty much have two requirements for a good brow brush: price and stiffness of bristles. The price is good. Though not quite as stiff as the Sephora brush,  the bristles are stiff enough that I&#x27;ve created brows that garner compliments. This is a slightly longer brush handle than I prefer (almost as long as as dollar bill) ,  but it still fits in my makeup bag okay.</li>
    <li> Great for the price! Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get MAC quality for this price but it does the job :)</li>
    <li> I have never heard of E.L.F. until it showed up on an amazon search. Perfect price, works great with eyebrow kit from elf. Plan on ordering more if needed.</li>
    <li> Got here faster than I thought love the quality</li>
    <li> Thinnest angled brush I&#x27;ve ever bought...it&#x27;s super cheap, which you can tell when you receive . wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this brush..barely holds any of the eyeshadow to use for eyebrows if you&#x27;re using to shapen your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I use this for eyelining and tight eye lining. It&#x27;s easy to use, soft enough.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good brush for loose eyeliner powder or like the Mac gel liner that comes in a pot. It doesn&#x27;t work for thin lines and the bristles spread more apart the more you use. It would be good for eyebrow color.</li>
    <li> This brush has easily become a favorite. The quality is great, and makes applying my eyebrow powder very easy and precise. Moreover, because I have a brush like this, I now use powder for eyeliner which is a lot more forgiving to apply and looks more natural!</li>
    <li> Love it but it kinda scratches</li>
    <li> perfect multi purpose angled brush for eyebrows, eye liner, low lash mascara application etc</li>
    <li> perfect for doing eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This product is of very high quality and has exceeded my expectations.  It is much easier to use that the brush I was using.</li>
    <li> Good and soft angled brush. You can use it for your eye brows as well as apply eye gel line.</li>
    <li> Brush is perfect for applying gel eyeliner and filling in eyebrows</li>
    <li> This brush does the job.nothing really special about it but the price is amazing and the results are flawless</li>
    <li> I like this angled brush for applying eye shadow. I find it does quite a nice job of blending colors on my upper lid and as an eyeliner brush along the bottom of my eye. I just purchased another one.</li>

    <li> I love love this brush!! It works great with my eye brow shadows!! I would deff buy again!!</li>
    <li> This brush is kinda stiff which is what I love about it. The bristles themselves are very short, and this brush can be used for eyebrows, gel liner, or even eyeshadow liner which is what i love. It has so many uses, and it works with the E.L.F. Brush cleaner.</li>
    <li> The stem is as long as a pencil (but a lot thinner) so it&#x27;s very crafty when applying eyebrow powder, The brush is small and allows you to apply with precision. I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far with the bristles falling off or bending out of shape. Best of all, it&#x27;s economical. Thank you, e.l.f.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: Some Target stores carry e.l.f. products (like my local store). You can check if they have it. They can also price match Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my eyebrows and it does a very good job. Sturdy brush and makes nice clean straight lines without collapsing (you can push down on it and not have it deform on you). Doesn&#x27;t leave powder fallout all over your face like other brushes can. No Shedding. Would buy again if I needed another one.</li>
    <li> I opened the package and the brush was not attached to the handle.  I&#x27;m not going to return it given the inexpensive price, and I was able to glue the brush to the handle, but PULEESE. This is a simple product, it should not be broken when you receive it.</li>
    <li> Fell apart quickly, not very good quality or worth the money. Bought a similar cheaper product that was much better.</li>
    <li> I use this eyeliner brush with &amp;#34;Wet n Wild Fergie Centerstage Collection On Edge Cream Eyeliner&amp;#34; in  little black dress. It works perfectly with that eyeliner and this brush is great quality. I have never been disappointed with e.l.f. brushes.</li>
    <li> awesome loved it, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Great brush!! Very fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Use this brush for my eyebrow fill in daily. So glad I found it because I was going to buy MAC, but I always looking for a less expensive alternative.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I saw this brush on a video for applying dark shadow along the lash line.  I never could figure out how the professionals did that.  Now I know and can do it myself.  Love it!! The shorter the bristles on this type of brush the better.</li>
    <li> Perfect for winged liner!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality brush and I plan to order the entire line. I bought this for my daughter who is just now starting to dabble in make-up. I didn&#x27;t want to start her out with expensive brushes that she might mess up so I bought this one. To my surprise the quality is amazing and most important, affordable.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush for the price. It&#x27;s been working well for me!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this brush in an attempt to try out using powder to fill in my brows, but of course ended up learning it&#x27;s also perfect for using eyeshadow as eyeliner. (I believe that is the original purpose of this brush, I&#x27;m just still learning about makeup. hah) I really love this brush, it makes a nice clean line and really holds the powder well. The hair of the brush is also very soft! I really recommend buying this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush makes it such an ease to have perfect eyebrows. I am very satisfied with this product and just love this brush!!</li>
    <li> With the very first time I used it, actually I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.  The brush part came off and fell on the floor.</li>
    <li> I think this brush would work well if you want SUPER stiff bristles.  I was looking for something a little softer.  Would work well for applying liner or brow powder.</li>
    <li> Awesome little brow brush!!</li>
