### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>wonderful result.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i was very happy with the effect of that lotion.</li>
      <li>Beautiful!</li>
      <li>it spreads wonderfully and is 100% invisible.</li>
      <li>It is perfect!</li>
      <li>This has to be the best illuminator you can get at this price range.</li>
      <li>It seems like it was made for very fair skin so it doesn&#x27;t advertise to be that way.</li>
      <li>i sent a jar of the silica to my mom who is in her 60s and complains about concealer creases, and she is totally happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;note</li>

      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>, i ii use this from 1 year, its amazing.</li>
      <li>this will give a amazing glow on ur face</li>
      <li>At my age of 64 nice to find something that gives your face a lift.</li>
      <li>the kind of glow that you get after giving birth for example.</li>
      <li>products of this kind are $30.00 and up,&lt;br</li>
      <li>The output of the product is like a very strong sunblock greasy and streaky.</li>
      <li>Now, I did not get this product on amazon but at target, where you can get much of the amazing No7 line, but this is great stuff.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, gives the skin a nice glow</li>
      <li>I love putting this on top of primer or mix it in with my foundation.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>well i went online looking for the best facial illuminators and that one ranked #1</li>
      <li>Such a great highlighter!</li>
      <li>i ended up spreading it over most of my face.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love liquid highlighters I feel like they apply nicer without being to glittery or making you look like a shiny monster.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but okay.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I had to learn to use it and mix with my foundation, but once I mastered how this product works, I love it.</li>
      <li>then i used the tester illuminating concealer from No 7 too which seems pretty good as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am generally a huge fan of anything from Boots, but this is a favorite.</li>
      <li>, I think it would look fine that way too though.</li>
      <li>it under the auto match foundation just gives a glow.good for my olive skin color.. not too light</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the fact that this has a pump too.</li>
      <li>I dont like sparkles on my face - a light shimmer, but not sparkles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I got to say this product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This adds just the right amount of highlighting on top of your foundation.  </li>
      <li>Gives a nice youthful glow to your skin ... highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much!</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is just as good as Clinique&#x27;s which costs DOUBLE.</li>
      <li>when i do a full makeup, i never use the silica at the end as it neutralizes the color underneath.</li>
      <li>when i do a full makeup, i never use the silica at the end as it neutralizes the color underneath.</li>
      <li>It is very light and adds just the right amount of pep to your skin to kick it up just that much.</li>
      <li>It gives you a healthy glow ~ not too much, just right.</li>
      <li>I use this over Bare Essentials foundation, below eye area and it gives a nice luminous glow that you can wear day or night.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and breakout with most make-up products, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
      <li>When I first put it on it does bring a flush (like excitement or just exercised) to my face, but this quickly fades.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s just lovely- adds a wonderful pale pink shimmer and glow to my skin which is very much needed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: i found that this actually looks even better when applied all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
      <li>More suited for younger skin, I think.</li>
      <li>It helps for a more natural, summery look and it makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
      <li>After applying your makeup, you dab a tiny bit on your cheekbones to give a nice natural illuminating effect.  </li>
      <li>now whenever i want to pretend i am naturally glowy and fresh, i know what to use ;)</li>
      <li>i already bought 2 x 1oz jars of it (100% pure silica powder) from CS and it works just as well as Makeup4ever&#x27;s</li>
      <li>i apply it over the Boots Illuminating Lotion with a large brush and over the concealer to fix it.</li>
      <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is really awsum</li>
      <li>This product has always been available at target for around ten dollars</li>
      <li>no matter how much I rub it in.</li>
      <li>Very iridescent.</li>
      <li>I really like mixing this with my tinted sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Read the reviews as they are always very helpful to me.  </li>
      <li>I will be using it very sporadically.</li>
      <li>this a brighter look which is very youthful</li>
      <li>I know some reviews said that it sparkled, but no matter how much I put on I have never had it sparkle on my skin.</li>
      <li>is this loose ultra light powder by Makeup4ever, HD microfinish, which is pure silica.</li>
      <li>Again, no shimmer, just a HEALTHY slightly rosy glow.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic, and I will definitely buy this again for my professional kit.</li>
      <li>seems very normal, nth special about this product, too dry for my combination skin, I use this under/on foundation.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend to users who want a sunkissed glow.</li>
      <li>I suggest maybe mixing it into foundation, or applying it with your fingers on your brow bone, under your eyes, high up on those cheek bones, around your nostrils, and a touch on your cupids bow.</li>
      <li>In comparison, Revlon Age Defying Spa face illuminator in pink light has a thicker consistency and adds a bit more \\&quot;glow\\&quot; but the application brush is messy.</li>
      <li>I tried some on my hand in the store and liked the subtle effect.</li>
      <li>I still use my Mary Kay Illuminator mixed with my foundation - but I was running out and was willing to try something else.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d say - try it out.. but go outside in the sunlight and look at the effect first because you could end up looking a bit like Edward the Vampire all shimmering in the sun</li>
      <li>I have medium colored skin and this product comes out pure white</li>
      <li>i did a little research and found that the one sold at CoastalScents is just as efficient at a fraction of the price, for more than double the quantity.</li>
      <li>and so far no change</li>
      <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, like mine, you&#x27;ll like the glow.</li>
      <li>No breakouts even though my skin is really sensitive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe if you mix it with your makeup the result is more subtle..</li>
      <li>i actually went without any makeup and made myself comfortable next to the Boots stand, and applied a few drops of the High Lights lotion over my cheeks, forehead and chin.</li>
      <li>It only makes a pale complexion even more pale.</li>

    <li> well i went online looking for the best facial illuminators and that one ranked #1 and then there was the one from Clinique. i am usually very careful in my choices because i have a skin prone to breakouts. i purchased a mini bottle of clinique in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; to test it (a little goes a loooooooong way) but i still waited to get to Target to try that one. i actually went without any makeup and made myself comfortable next to the Boots stand, and applied a few drops of the High Lights lotion over my cheeks, forehead and chin. No shimmer, very delicate effect, and a little goes a long way too. i ended up spreading it over most of my face. then i used the tester illuminating concealer from No 7 too which seems pretty good as well.&lt;br /&gt;i was very happy with the effect of that lotion. Again, no shimmer, just a HEALTHY slightly rosy glow. the kind of glow that you get after giving birth for example. absolutely no one will know you have any makeup on if you use it alone. it spreads wonderfully and is 100% invisible. i recommend applying this on yr cheeks and forehead over foundation or wearing it alone with concealer if you want to have a no makeup look.&lt;br /&gt;it is just as good as Clinique&#x27;s which costs DOUBLE. And neither causes me to breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so now whenever i want to pretend i am naturally glowy and fresh, i know what to use ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: i found that this actually looks even better when applied all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;there is this loose ultra light powder by Makeup4ever, HD microfinish, which is pure silica. i did a little research and found that the one sold at CoastalScents is just as efficient at a fraction of the price, for more than double the quantity. i already bought 2 x 1oz jars of it (100% pure silica powder) from CS and it works just as well as Makeup4ever&#x27;s which i tried at Sephora. i apply it over the Boots Illuminating Lotion with a large brush and over the concealer to fix it. wonderful result. i do this simple correcting makeup when i go to the gym.

    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and so far no change but I will keep trying until it runs out.</li>
    <li> i love it, i ii use this from 1 year, its amazing. this will give a amazing glow on ur face</li>
    <li> I got this product from Target because I am really pale and wish I had time to get that summer glow.  I love putting this on top of primer or mix it in with my foundation.  When I first put it on it does bring a flush (like excitement or just exercised) to my face, but this quickly fades.  After about one minute the effect is very subtle and I often put a little blush on top of it.  I find that in the summer when my skin is oily I don&#x27;t need this and moisturizer.  I know some reviews said that it sparkled, but no matter how much I put on I have never had it sparkle on my skin. No breakouts even though my skin is really sensitive. All in all I&#x27;m really happy with it. Just wish it were a little darker so I didn&#x27;t need blush too.</li>
    <li> I really like mixing this with my tinted sunscreen.  It helps for a more natural, summery look and it makes my skin feel soft.  I have sensitive skin and breakout with most make-up products, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I haven&#x27;t tried it stand-alone, I think it would look fine that way too though.</li>
    <li> Found the Boots product by accident on a beauty website.  Read the reviews as they are always very helpful to me.  I use this over Bare Essentials foundation, below eye area and it gives a nice luminous glow that you can wear day or night.  Very pleased with purchase.  Gave the name to a few friends who asked what my beauty rountine consists of because my skin always seems to glow.  Mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> Great product.use it under the auto match foundation just gives a glow.good for my olive skin color.. not too light</li>
    <li> The serum itself is lovely and goes on very nicely. I tried some on my hand in the store and liked the subtle effect. I wanted something to mix with my liquid foundation so that it didn&#x27;t look so matte. What I did NOT want was a total shimmery SPARKLE.  I put some on in the car while waiting for my son to get out of school. When I looked again - OH NO..It looked like I had a million little tiny sparkles on my face. I only used a little but it was a totally &#x27;cosmetic&#x27; result and I returned it to the store.  I have blush from, I think its Maybelline, that does the same thing - puts little sparkles on your face like those body lotions with the &#x27;glow&#x27; in them. I dont like sparkles on my face - a light shimmer, but not sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you mix it with your makeup the result is more subtle..but I&#x27;d say - try it out.. but go outside in the sunlight and look at the effect first because you could end up looking a bit like Edward the Vampire all shimmering in the sun if you dont. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t the product for me unfortunately. I still use my Mary Kay Illuminator mixed with my foundation - but I was running out and was willing to try something else.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is lightweight and adds a dewy glow to my face without a make up look.  In comparison, Revlon Age Defying Spa face illuminator in pink light has a thicker consistency and adds a bit more \\&quot;glow\\&quot; but the application brush is messy.</li>
    <li> This works well as a highlighter and does its job, but this really is the definition of a little goes a long way. I usually end up using less than a pea sized amount for my cheek bones/nose bridge/etc, and sometimes that&#x27;s even too much and I have to blend it back with some powder, or I end up looking oily.</li>
    <li> Such a great highlighter! I love this product so much! My grandma actually recommended this to me so I went and I picked it up at Target and I got to say this product is fantastic. I love liquid highlighters I feel like they apply nicer without being to glittery or making you look like a shiny monster. I really enjoy the fact that this has a pump too. The color is a pinky-silvery color but without looking to fake or unnatural. It is perfect!</li>
    <li> I had to learn to use it and mix with my foundation, but once I mastered how this product works, I love it. You can wear it alone without mixing it in with make up or as a facial highlighter with or without make up. The very slightly pink tint is translucent.   Leaves a healthful glow on your skin. The brightening components add a little lift to your spirits as you complete your look in the morning...or at night.    Not for darker skin. Will look pasty. I have slightly darker olive tone skin and can barely get away with using this without mixing into my foundation.</li>
    <li> This product does give a slight glow, but for me it also had a drying effect on my skin.  I will be using it very sporadically.</li>
    <li> This adds just the right amount of highlighting on top of your foundation.  Not too glitzy, nice texture -- good value.</li>
    <li> This product has always been available at target for around ten dollars and then it disappeared off the shelf. I suppose it was discontinued and I went to look for it and found it on hear for a ridiculous price.  Just goes to show you people will do anything to make a buck</li>
    <li> Very iridescent. Does shine under makeup. Not sure I would buy again. More suited for younger skin, I think. It only makes a pale complexion even more pale.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Alone or with foundation.</li>
    <li> I think it is sold at Target.  Comes in pink and peach.  $9.00 for about an ounce.  Thank you Thank you Thank you. Amen.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a recommentation from the[....], that rates beauty products. After applying your makeup, you dab a tiny bit on your cheekbones to give a nice natural illuminating effect.  A little goes a long way.  Gives a nice youthful glow to your skin ... highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Of course I love this stuff, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find it anywhere and I&#x27;m hoping my bottle will last me for a long time!  I think it will though, as I only use a little tiny bit on my cheekbones and a tiny bit under my eyebrow- maybe twice a week.  But it&#x27;s just lovely- adds a wonderful pale pink shimmer and glow to my skin which is very much needed.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I mix this product with my makeup.  It gives you a great glow. Gives aging skin this a brighter look which is very youthful</li>
    <li> This was O.K.  it did add a little shine to my face. For all the hipe on the No7 products I was not really impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  You can wear alone or with makeup (sometimes I mix it in with my makeup).  It gives you a healthy glow ~ not too much, just right.</li>
    <li> I have used  highlights illuminating lotion for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I use before applying liquid makeup. I don&#x27;t think&lt;br /&gt;this product would work for powder makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Most products of this kind are $30.00 and up,&lt;br /&gt;this one is $12.95, I buy 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this. Will not buy again! It&#x27;s one of those products that will just sit there and do nothing</li>
    <li> It works wonders but I would not use a foundation with it since it covers the shimmer of the lotion.</li>
    <li> seems very normal, nth special about this product, too dry for my combination skin, I use this under/on foundation.  the result is not what I expect. but okay.</li>
    <li> this item is very good, i love it so much&lt;br /&gt;i advise everybody to buy it&lt;br /&gt;it is really awsum</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, gives the skin a nice glow</li>
    <li> I love this product.  You can buy it on Drugstore.com at 12.99 and 2 for 20.79.  I highly recommend to users who want a sunkissed glow.</li>
    <li> It really makes your skin glow, but unfortunately for me it made my skin break out.  If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, like mine, you&#x27;ll like the glow.</li>
    <li> This is as it say&#x27;s very nice give your face a glow.  At my age of 64 nice to find something that gives your face a lift. I would order this product again.</li>
