<li> /&gt;It does take awhile to dry though after you&#x27;ve cleaned it.</li>
<li> I will say it&#x27;s rather difficult to clean, but that could be a cause from using longwear foundation that stays PUT once on the face.</li>
<li> However, it has worked for me with application of &amp;#34;It&amp;#34; loose powder products.  </li>
<li> smells like glue and the bristles are not straight.</li>
<li> This brush blends perfectly, a little foundation goes a long way, and this brush works wonders.</li>
<li> This brush is so lush, thick, velvety and satin like, I don&#x27;t know know how else to say it!</li>
<li> Had gotten one with compact from shopping channel but the powder color was not right for me</li>
<li> Love it, I hate writing reviews</li>
<li> Well i do have to say that the picture shows the black handle</li>
<li> I apply a few drops to my brush, and then I take the brush and apply the foundation to my face.</li>
<li> I feel as if everyday i get my makeup done professionaly!</li>
<li> While I was disappointed with the actual foundation, the brush was a keeper!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased this brush looking for a nice airbrush finish in my foundation application, loved it so much that am currently purchasing the whole line of the (it cosmetics) makeup brush line! Great product, made excellently... No shedding whatsoever! Greatly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING brush - worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I was happy to be able to purchase this brush seperately and not have to purchase the foundation, as I prefer another brand foundation, but really like this brush and needed an additional one.  It arrived well packaged and fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> This brush is worth the price! I love how well my makeup is applied with this brush, gives me a airbrushed look. I will be buying more brushes by this company..</li>
    <li> I have heard rave reviews about these brushes. And let me tell you they are not exaggerated. If you have ever felt a rabbits foot that is how this brush feels to me. Soft and luxuriouse. The ease of putting on make up superior. Now granted I have not had this long but what a difference. If you are on the fence about weather to spend this much on 1 brush don&#x27;t hesitate. The quality and craftsmanship is here. This brush will last and is a good investment.</li>
    <li> I may have gotten this brush by mistake--but let me qualify.  I rarely use a foundation as I get older.  I find that I look best with just finishing powder.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll try using foundation with this brush to see the results--may like it. However, it has worked for me with application of &amp;#34;It&amp;#34; loose powder products.  Just discovered  the &amp;#34;It Cosmetics Dual Powder &amp; Micro-Powder Brush&amp;#34;.  Can&#x27;t imagine getting better results, but I am gonna get it, too!</li>
    <li> So I read the reviews on this brush and I must add I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase as well. The brush comes in a sealed protective case. Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet, but def looking forward to using it. I&#x27;m sure this will be my favorite foundation brush of them all!</li>
    <li> I truly love this brush.  I didn&#x27;t know if it would be worth the money but it really is.  It makes a difference in concealing pores and just smoothing out either foundation or powder.</li>
    <li> Best quality brushes I have ever used.  Very soft to the touch.  No shedding of the brushes and they blend in makeup perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this brush I been using it daily. I&#x27;m even think of buying a second one to have as a backup. It blends well,  I recommend  you try this brush.</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly and I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very high quality brush for the price.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try.  I use it to apply Tarte foundation, rather than with the giant brush you get with that product. This one is the perfect size.  Washes well with a clarifying shampoo, and dries quickly propped in a tumbler.  Brush head stays full, and firm.</li>
    <li> So soft and we&#x27;ll made. Love it!</li>
    <li> Brush just as I expexted.  Had gotten one with compact from shopping channel but the powder color was not right for me, however I wanted to keep the brush because it was so soft.  It glides over skin like air.  I am glad Amazon was able to full this.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Incredibly dense. Feels nice on the skin. Blends foundation nicely</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, just as advertised.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush....makes your skin look flawless when using with  bare minerals.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve only used it with liquid foundation and it works great. Coverage and evenness are awesome. First time I used it my husband said, &amp;#34;Did you do something different with your makeup? You skin looks perfect.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It does take awhile to dry though after you&#x27;ve cleaned it.</li>
    <li> I recieved it within a week. I love this brush worth spending my money. Thank you</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this brush.  Perfect for applying power foundation.</li>
    <li> Luxurious brush that does the job. No rough scratchy bristles.  Efficiently buffs makeup. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> SOFTTTT&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;No fall out (yet, and hopefully never)&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great blush brush and blends makeup well&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT brush. I use it to stipple and swirl liquid foundation, and I get such smooth, even coverage. I will say it&#x27;s rather difficult to clean, but that could be a cause from using longwear foundation that stays PUT once on the face. The bristles are tightly packed and soft, and they retain their shape nicely</li>
    <li> Brush is so soft and apply s makeup w/ ease.&lt;br /&gt;Good value.  Most of the time you  can only get this brush  with a kit . i wanted it by itself and Amazon came through!</li>
    <li> Most of the time when I buy powder brushes the bristles end up falling out over time and the bristles will get stiff.&lt;br /&gt;  Ij&#x27;ve used this about a month and I still like it.</li>
    <li> love IT brushes.  And cruelty free!!</li>
    <li> Love it, I hate writing reviews but I had to say something about this baby... It makes a HuGe difference the way my make up goes on.</li>
    <li> IT Cosmetics are known for their beautiful beauty products. All I have tried are excellent, and you can rely upon them. That said, IT Cosmetic brushes are the best brushes I have found. Their big brush for the miracle defining glow is superb. And, then, I found this brush. It is the perfect brush for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently started wearing liquid foundation after many years of using mineral foundation. This brush is superb for applying foundation. I apply a few drops to my brush, and then I take the brush and apply the foundation to my face. I brush on a little bit, smooth it around, and then cover my entire face and neck. This brush blends perfectly, a little foundation goes a long way, and this brush works wonders. It swirls and carries the foundation to every part of your face, it does not leave pores looking large or overwhelming. It leaves just enough foundation coverage. So easy to use, and, I wash it after each use with soap and water, and leave the brush to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-26-15</li>
    <li> I love this brush! this is a great brush although I was skeptical about this brush at first and got some feed back from other amzon customers and so decided to purchase and Im happy I did, Wonderful Brush and easy to appy your foundation</li>
    <li> The best brush in all of the world!!!</li>
    <li> It brushes are the Bugatti of brushes for me.&lt;br /&gt;It DOES make a HUGE difference what brushes you use when applying foundation,powder and blush/bronzer. This baby buffs well and leaves no bristle lines and NO shedding left on face! I can&#x27;t get enough of these brushes. They are a must have!!!!!</li>
    <li> Well i do have to say that the picture shows the black handle and i was expecting the brush to come as the picture, but i ended up having the silver brush. Overall, i absolutley love this brush i never knew that a brush would actually make a difference on my makeup. I feel as if everyday i get my makeup done professionaly! My skin looks so fawless !</li>
    <li> Luxurious brush that won&#x27;t break the bank. Applies powder foundation perfectly!</li>
    <li> smells like glue and the bristles are not straight. shop elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic. It is super soft and really blends the makeup in flawlessly. While I was disappointed with the actual foundation, the brush was a keeper! I will buy different foundation in the future but still use this buffer brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is so lush, thick, velvety and satin like, I don&#x27;t know know how else to say it! You feel super pampered using this thing. Sometimes you pay a high price for something and it&#x27;s just as good as the same thing at a lower price, I don&#x27;t think it can be said about this brush. It&#x27;s amazing! If you want to pamper yourself into special-ness, get this!</li>
