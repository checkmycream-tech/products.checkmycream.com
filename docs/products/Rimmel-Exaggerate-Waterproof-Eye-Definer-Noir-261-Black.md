<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner ever.  It never smudges off.  It lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This eye liner goes on creamy smooth.  Smudgeable when first applied.  Sets well without crumbling for long lasting definition whether smudged or bold line.  Absolutely love this.</li>
    <li> Not among my favorites, hard for me to make a smooth line with this one.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like Rimmel eyeliners.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Seems to stay all day.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is easy to use, but it is definitely NOT waterproof. My makeup got really blur after only 2 hours....embarrassing...</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and defined. Stays put for well over 12 hours. Keeps shadow in place when applied under eye shadow. Enhances eye color. Never have to sharpen. I must get a dozen compliments each day telling me how beautiful my eyes are. I credit my make up 100%.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004TLG4XI Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Precious Gold]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0052Z83RA Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Purple Shock]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001V9LB9S Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Emerald Sparkle]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0052Z83KW Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Emerald Sparkle]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001V9LBAM Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Noir]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004UMQ8TQ Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Noir]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0037MOK8Q Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Sable]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0052Z83H0 Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Sable]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003ZC68PG Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Deep Ocean]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0052Z83JI Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer Deep Ocean]]</li>
    <li> Best black eyeliner I have tried.  And I have tried plenty, including more expensive department-store brands.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner.  Stays put almost all day even in the hot humid weather.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite eyeliner for years.</li>
    <li> I am really glad I ordered two, because I love it! Glides on smoothly and is nice and dark. I love the tip used for smudging, it gives a great smokey look. And the price was fantastic. I got a similar look with much more expensive brands. I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is NOT waterproof! It runs right off the outer corners of my eyes which is where it is needed most....hence the name waterproof. I do not recommend this product to anyone struggling with applying eyeliner to your water line or anyone who has oily lids.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price</li>
    <li> I have really oily eyelids and watery eyes, so finding a good eyeliner that can hold up to those conditions is a real challenge. I have tried every brand at every price point, and I am finally happy to find a reasonably priced solution that works with me. I have a little bit of running and smudging as the day wears on, but overall it does a pretty good job of staying put.</li>
    <li> Item is completely dry ...unusable - even when I twisted to bring liquid to the tip, it won&#x27;t provide any liquid.  Dry as a bone - will never purchase again!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth and stays on for a few hours.  Makes my eyes really pop.  I wish the pencil lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Not really waterproof. Smudged all day. I ended up with the dreaded racoon eyes</li>
    <li> it is very good prudacet</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d ever think I&#x27;d write a review for eyeliner, I really do like it. It&#x27;s kohl black without any shimmer or sparkle.</li>
    <li> Truly Waterproof. Long lasting!</li>
    <li> Wonderful eyeliner, does not smudge, stays in place</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really waterproof.  Stays on upper waterline, doesn&#x27;t run or smudge after first 15 seconds or so.  Many eyeliners burn my eyes when applied to the waterline; this does not.</li>
    <li> I might apply it twice if I go out later in the evening. It is a good product.</li>
    <li> Probably works better for younger generation.  If your oily or have wrinkles skip it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye liner pencil. I was sick and tired of it being out of stock at the store so I ordered it off here. It is black and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> wife likes it and the price is great.</li>
    <li> The line becomes very light and disappears within 30 mins how much ever dark you apply. Causes lot of irritation to the eyes.it is not at all dark . Waste to buy.</li>
    <li> Very good. Smooth application and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Rummel makes a great, inexpensive eye liner and it&#x27;s become my favorite... I now own every color and they&#x27;re all great :)</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner over ANY other brand!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Doesn&#x27;t smudge on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Good product, doesn&#x27;t run or smudge too bad</li>
    <li> Its a good liner, its easy to apply - goes on easily but i do have apply it again as it won&#x27;t stay on all day but keep in mind i have oily lids. The color is just as expected - black. I would probably buy again as i have not yetba liner that would stay on my lids all day !</li>
    <li> This eye definer creates a clean, fine line for eyes.</li>
    <li> This liner is not waterproof. It leaks and gives me panda eyes. After a few hours, I have it in my crease. I also used it on the waterline, and it leaks around the eyes. During application, the little particles fall under the eyes and all over my face and then smudge. Yikes. No good.</li>
    <li> Best ever; stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t sting. very smooth and goes on easy-no pulling on the lid. I have sensitive skin, and the slightest pull or sting and i feel it. Love this definer!!</li>
    <li> would like to buy more!  will recommend to my friends!!!</li>
    <li> BEST EYELINER EVER. Hands down. I have oily skin and it can still last a full 8 hour day without having to reapply. Best of all IT DOES NOT SMUDGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tip: If you go over your line with a second coating, I guarantee it will last you from dawn til dusk.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner. It&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and one tube lasts forever even with daily use. Can be hard to find in stores but it&#x27;s the same price on Amazon (though it does take a few days to arrive...guess I&#x27;m completely spoiled by Prime..) Even though it&#x27;s cheap it&#x27;s as good or better than all of the expensive brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It lasted a good 6 hours without smearing, and that&#x27;s with a primer used first. So if you&#x27;re not planning a long day/night, it&#x27;ll do the job. I work 12 hour shifts so it&#x27;s not really something I could use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Very dark, pretty smooth, and mostly water proof. I apply eyeliner on the inside of the bottom lid which always tends to disappear throughout the day, but this eye liner lasts longer than expected and i usually only reapply it once a day. I thought $5 for waterproof eye liner was a good deal since usually i pay $10 in store for maybeline waterproof eye liner, but when it showed up there were three eye liners in the package! I didn&#x27;t realize it was an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m new to amazon haha), but this was a great surprise and made the deal WAY better. This will be my new go to eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, its dosent smudge like cheep eyeliner and it isnt expensice like other brands. The only complant i have is that it is difficult to find in stores so when i actually find it i try and buy two at a time. Just make sure that you have the color you want, i have bought a navy color thinking that it was black because it was dark. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner!</li>
    <li> It runs a little in the corner of my eyes but it seems like everyone i try dose. But it doesn&#x27;t smear as easy as some others</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is great. However, it smudges throughout the day even when I do apply primer beforehand.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  It is usually sold out at local stores.  Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Does not run. Very black, which I like. Easy to apply. Does not run out as fast as others I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was in High School. My friend was amazed that when he splashed water on me, it didn&#x27;t wash off! That&#x27;s when I found my eye liner. Water proof and lasts a long time! And if you&#x27;re like me and you prefer not having pencil, this is a great item to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long-lasting eyeliner without having to get the gel kind, etc. This one is great. I&#x27;ve used the ones from Avon and also others in the drug store and found that this one lasts much, much longer that ones I&#x27;ve tried before. I use eyeliner everyday, and I can&#x27;t seem to find a &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; one that lasts even for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use on my waterline and on my lash line. I only need to apply once, and maybe another time after about 5 minutes. (Because blinking seems to always thin it a little, right?) I find that it lasts all day. Usually, by the end of the day, my eyeliner is non-existent on my eyes. With this one, I can see that I still have it on and don&#x27;t need to re-apply. (That&#x27;s unless you feel you need to &amp;#34;re-freshen&amp;#34; all your make-up to go out or something.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the smudge part at the other end, so I won&#x27;t comment on that further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will look any further than this product.</li>
    <li> This eye liner is average - not better or worse than lower-priced liners.  Don&#x27;t plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> love this eyeliner stays put glides really nice.</li>
    <li> Handsdown, my go to eyeliner. Lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge (no eyelid marks).</li>
    <li> This cheap, retractable pencil delivers rich, smooth color, and true to its name, is long-lasting and waterproof. I have ridiculously oily eyelids, and if I set this with translucent powder afterwords, it lasts all day without creasing.</li>
    <li> Like how it&#x27;s smooth to apply but it smudges from top line to bottom of my eyes within two hours. Disappointment for waterproof</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years... I&#x27;m a hairstylist, so I&#x27;m in front of a mirror all day... I also need something that stays put since I live in Texas &amp; that makes you sweat... I. don&#x27;t hand to reapply every couple of hours</li>
    <li> I would buy this product over and over again. I started becoming obsessed with this eyeliner when I was 16. The formula is creamy and goes on super smooth, easy to create a variety of looks whether you want very defined eyes or smokey.&lt;br /&gt;This works really well in getting into the upper waterline for thicker looking lashes.</li>
    <li> Easy to use  Really like this product</li>
    <li> I already knew this eye definer, and I still choose it. Its a real waterproof product, and i use it everyday, thats what i bought 7 of them.</li>
    <li> ONLY SOMETIMES NEED A TOUCHUP.  LIVE IN CHICAGO.  LOTS OF WEIRD WEATHER.  LIKE IT  GOOD PRICE  THANKS!</li>
    <li> its really waterproof! And easy to apply. i love rimmel products! affordable yet good quality.</li>
    <li> This is the eyeliner I&#x27;ve been using for years. At this point, I&#x27;d take no other! Great line, not too thick, not waxy, very smooth. :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Just what I wanted / expected.</li>
    <li> Nothing special here; I was looking for an eyeliner that last all day; search is still on.</li>
    <li> I think my expectations were too high. Very average eyeliner. Then again I have yet to find one that won&#x27;t smudge or fade after 5 hours of wear. It&#x27;s not the blackest color and not as creamy as my other eyeliner pencils, but it applies easily enough and I like that it comes with a handy sharpener. It only gives me slight raccoon eyes on especially hot days but for a daily eyeliner, it works fine. If you have oily lids or have problems with smudging, I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Needed a black eyeliner that would stay on and not smear and this does it.</li>
    <li> It just lines beautifully on my eye and has a long lasting blend.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I do not wear a lot of makeup.  I put on in the morning and it is not necessary to reapply.  I do not even take with me I just leave the liner at home.</li>
    <li> Goes on a little too heavy</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, long lasting, nice finish</li>
    <li> I have used this on my waterline a few times. Stayed in place. Worked as intended.</li>
    <li> Better than any other department store bought pencil liners including Lancome and Estee Lauder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and I tear quite a bit for some reason. After 4 hours, I could only tell it &amp;#34;leaked&amp;#34; on to my under eye part if I look really closely. But with the store bought brands, it looks like I&#x27;ve cried after just a couple of hours</li>
    <li> It is pigmented and the smudge tool works well too!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love love this product! Works as it should.</li>
    <li> last all day,and i love the sponge but doesnt last all day in waterline, the deliver was so fast</li>
    <li> works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this.</li>
    <li> rich, deeply pigmented, long-lasting (no raccoon eyes) applies smoothly and looks every bit as good if not better than pricier brands. can&#x27;t always say that about drugstore cosmetics, but this eyeliner is that good. doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes, perfectly comfortable with contacts. my eyes are my \\&quot;feature\\&quot; and this liner does them proud.&lt;br /&gt;see also [[ASIN:B00593FLMU Rimmel Match Perfection Concealer &amp; Highlighter, 2-in-1, Fair/light 230]] very good product as well. good shade very natural looking, nice and smooth, comfortable brush applicator.</li>
    <li> This is a good eye liner.  It goes on smoothly.  My only complaint is that it is not long-lasting on my oily skin.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner never smears.</li>
    <li> Great soft non tugging eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay sharp, very soft. works well on the water line. Doesn&#x27;t last but for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> Best eye liner ever! Doesn&#x27;t leave ugly smudge under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner! I work in a humid tshirt printing shop all day but my makeup stays flawless.</li>
    <li> waterproof and easy to apply works as advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different eyeliners!! I even went to out and bought a $25 eyeliner and it still didn&#x27;t last all day. I love this eyeliner so much because I can apply it in my waterline and it stays there all day! I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> great everyday eyeliner. does sometimes start to smudge throughout the day , but good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not experiencing the same eyeliner as everyone else in these reviews, but it didn&#x27;t even last one makeout session... haha.</li>
    <li> The only eye liner that has been truly waterproof that I have tried in the last several years.  Love this and great price!</li>
    <li> Love love love this eyeliner! Great price and it stays put!</li>
