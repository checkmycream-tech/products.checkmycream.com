      <li>, I have started to use this amazing cream</li>
      <li>: it&#x27;s kind of peachy/almondy smell and</li>
      <li>but I do not think it liked my hair.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice</li>
      <li>It is creamy with a thinner texture, but it provides great coverage helps with detangling, and sets my twists quickly.  </li>
      <li>du lait is the best hair product for natural hair, period!</li>

      <li>It works best when hair is wet/damp to allow it to completely penetrate.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft, works excellent as a detangle for my 4a/4b hair.</li>

      <li>I simply love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Try this, your hair will thank you :)</li>
      <li>This line needs more products.</li>
      <li>I love this leave in / detangler.  </li>
      <li>Love the moisture, definition and  shine.</li>
      <li>It costs a bit more than I&#x27;m used to paying</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I hope to find a great product one day that really works.  </li>
      <li>and You get what You Pay for:)</li>
      <li>I simply love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>However, the beauty was that I received the product as scheduled and was very excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>Good product with great ingredients, but didn&#x27;t detangle as well as other products.</li>
      <li>Great Moisturizer for natural girl 4 type coils</li>
      <li>My hair is softer than ever and easy to style.  </li>
      <li>I could not believe how easily my fingers were going through my hair.</li>
      <li>The product arrived very quickly, I believe I received it in 4 days, in a sealed box with bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>The product smells good but doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s description.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for fine 4/C hair.</li>
      <li>I would not buy this product again, because it seems to be design for those with fine or medium, hair structures.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like applying a light moisturizer on your face to rehydrate it or boost the freshness of the face without making it look oily and caked up.</li>
      <li>It is light and takes away any frizz that may come about through out the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll rather spend $25 on one product that does the job than 10 cheap others that do nothing.</li>
      <li>This leave in is absolutely amazing and my hair really likes it.</li>
      <li>This product is a great moisturizer after washing the hair and as a night moisturizer and also  mixed with the Tukka hair nourishment.  </li>
      <li>This genuinely smooths my hair by moisturizing it.</li>
      <li>It just keeps my hair happy, and continues to help my hair grow long and strong.</li>
      <li>This was worth it!</li>
      <li>My daughter has super curly hair, and I have tried a number of products so that we can comb it quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>Amazing ! made my 4b natural hair feel so soft, manageable and MOISTURISEDDDD !!!!</li>
      <li>frizz, hello soft, shiny, love it!</li>
      <li>Smell is ok--nothing special.</li>
      <li>I read that cetyl alcohol or alcohol of any kind is damaging to natural hair.</li>
      <li>My hair stays soft, cute, strong and manageable, and I color and bleach my do.</li>
      <li>My hair is very curly/spirally and breaks easily.</li>
      <li>I love it, the next morning my hair felt very hydrated and smooth easy combing.</li>
      <li>but koko du lait is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I will say I am pleased so far.</li>
      <li>and I think the price is just about right.</li>
      <li>It always felt kind of dry after I rinsed it out.  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful, great to apply everyday especially for hair that sucks up moisture and is prone to dryness.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, its nice and smooth and not too thick or thin.</li>
      <li>I just used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;that makes my hair Very Frizzy!</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced one negative result on scalp or with my hair.  </li>
      <li>how pretty my hair is and it&#x27;s because of this product.  </li>
      <li>Would buy it more often if they offered a bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>At first I was a bit concerned once I saw the consistency of it</li>
      <li>Went back to kinky-curly and the shea moisture line, more affordable and now at Target.</li>
      <li>But KoKo left my hair tangle free and manageable!</li>
      <li>It detangles the hair very well and right away</li>
      <li>So, my hair look all fresh, frizz free even if I wash my hair twice a week only.</li>
      <li>It is non-greasy, has a very mild smell, light weight and does not weigh your hair down.</li>
      <li>I love this as a moisturizer on my damp to dry hair.  </li>
      <li>If your hair are naturally curly, you will lose the straightening when in contact with water but thanks to this cream, you will regain very soft curls on your hair that wouldstill look great on you since they won&#x27;t be flying away or lumping up to increase the volume of hair to destroy the look and make you reuse the styling equipment to fix those up.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It detangles okay, but in the process leaves hair so soaking wet, that it takes another hour to get the hair ready for blow drying, and by then it is already tangled again.</li>
      <li>It really didnt penetrate pass my ends, didnt really get my root areas very well, even when I pay close attention in  those areas.</li>
      <li>I have very curly multicultural hair that likes to be frizzy and unruly</li>
      <li>I am very sceptical when coming to products for my hair and try to investigate every ingredient in products....</li>
      <li>I do not review products but this product absolutely deserves one.</li>
      <li>Also, fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>, I found it to be runny which means it was really loaded with water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not enough moisturizer in it, I found it to be runny which means it was really loaded with water.&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;ve just used water and gotten better results!!</li>
    <li> This detangler is amazing! My daughter has super curly hair, and I have tried a number of products so that we can comb it quickly and easily. My search is over! Combing her hair is now like combing silk, and it takes a fraction of the time it normally does. Can&#x27;t recommend enough!!</li>
    <li> Living in Florida, humidity and frizz were a given especially for wavy or curly hair until I tried KoKo du lait! Goodbye frizz, hello soft, shiny, love it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to control my coarse, kinky hair.  I have a lot of hair, it grows fast and is strong but is extremely difficult to control and is very dry.  I have been looking for a product to make it soft and manageable.  This is the best ever!!!.  I have only used it twice and I can feel the difference.  My hair is softer than ever and easy to style.  I simply love it. It does everything the bottle says.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. She is half African American and half Hispanic her hair is curly but not tight ringlets. This takes the tangles out and keeps the frizz away. I have tried other products but come back to this every time. I am generous with the amount I put in her hair because I want to control the frizz all day.</li>
    <li> The product smells good but doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s description. It has alcohol in it so it dried my hair out. It may work for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff. I use it on mine and my sons hair. His is curly, and I use it on my curly hair when its flat ironed and back in a pony tail. It smells wonderful, its nice and smooth and not too thick or thin.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and works wonders as a moisturizer, leave in conditioner, and a detangler. I could not believe how easily my fingers were going through my hair. Usually, the most difficult part of washing my hair is after rinsing out the deep conditioner, air drying, and finally trying to comb through it before styling. But KoKo left my hair tangle free and manageable! KoKo, where have you been all my life?!</li>
    <li> This product has very good ingredients, however, it contains a large amount of water&lt;br /&gt;that makes my hair Very Frizzy!, having said this, I am not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I like the results I get with this product.  My hair feels softer and easier detangling.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in / detangler.  It works best when hair is wet/damp to allow it to completely penetrate. You can then detangle with fingers before using a comb/brush.  It leaves my hair moisturized and completely soft...I strive for products without hidden ingredients and I trust that Tukka Naturals is my solution.  After a month - 2 months at the most, other products would give me a negative reaction to scalp and hair....Ive been using Tukka for over 8 months now and I haven&#x27;t experienced one negative result on scalp or with my hair.  I love these products and admire how this company strives to make their products better and better and affordable.  Ive purchased products 2x&#x27;s the price of Tukka without receiving half the benefits I get with these products...Im now a Life Long Tukka User.</li>
    <li> Amazing ! made my 4b natural hair feel so soft, manageable and MOISTURISEDDDD !!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very curly multicultural hair that likes to be frizzy and unruly and this tames it. The only drawback is the size of the bottle. Not very convenient if you have long hair. Would buy it more often if they offered a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair tends to be dry and breaks easily. When I leave the conditioner in my hair it is soft for a short while but when I rinse it out my hair is left soft and manageable and easier to style than before. For what it&#x27;s, being that I haven&#x27;t been using it long I will say I am pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I am Bi- Racial My Hair is Naturaly Curly and very thick. In the past I have permed my hair twice a year to help manage it. I am not getting perms anymore and want to just go completely natural and I am in the faze right now where the Perm is still somewhat in my hair but in search for natural products I purchased this one, After reading the reviews. I have tried several products and I dont like feeling greesy or my hair being hard. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! it has no greesy feeling to it. It is light and takes away any frizz that may come about through out the day. I am now looking for a Spray that I can use with it so that I dont have to wet my hair everyday before using it :) I think I am going to try the Shea Moisture product.. I found it on walgreens web for 9.99 on Amazon it is $18... The ONLY negetive I can say about this product is the Price But you dont need alot and You get what You Pay for:)</li>
    <li> My hair strands are thin and they curl, fly away and make a huge lump of a mess just whenever they catch any moisture, dust or wind. This cream here is different from hair serums and sprays.&lt;br /&gt;Hair Serum (L&#x27;oreal, Sebastian, Acai etc) and sprays claim to make your hair frizz-free, but leave you disappointed just after a few minutes of generous application and fail you completely when you need them to work the most.  They can&#x27;t shoo away your fear of getting tiny bit of exposure to rains or humid weather. Also, if you applied these serums a little too much making sure that every last strand got some of it while still being careful to not apply over the scalp, they would always get cluttered on hair and scalp and cause hair breakage and dandruff if you don&#x27;t wash your long and impossible hair the very second day. After the next day wash, the vicious circle of serum applying and getting-rid-of-it-the-next-day-to-end-itching starts all over.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have started to use this amazing cream and I apply it everytime after drying my hair. This genuinely smooths my hair by moisturizing it. It removes every but of frizz from my hair. After application the volume of hair is what I would ideally like to have on my head.  My hair don&#x27;t look clingy. It&#x27;s like applying a light moisturizer on your face to rehydrate it or boost the freshness of the face without making it look oily and caked up. So, my hair look all fresh, frizz free even if I wash my hair twice a week only. Plus points, it works in rains and all sorts of bad weather, sweaty scalp, basically you are not scared of any unannounced contact of hair with water/moisture.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t style the hair, so if you straightened or curled your hair, you will loose quite a bit of styling but the powerful anti-frizz formula here would save your day. If your hair are naturally curly, you will lose the straightening when in contact with water but thanks to this cream, you will regain very soft curls on your hair that wouldstill look great on you since they won&#x27;t be flying away or lumping up to increase the volume of hair to destroy the look and make you reuse the styling equipment to fix those up.&lt;br /&gt;This definitely has taken a lot of tension off my mind and I can handle the rainy weather without the umbrella or getting hair all wet on a beach without worrying about the outcome once the hair dry up. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> After years of glopping on everything from Ultra Sheen, to Sulfur 8, I&#x27;ve finally found a product that manages my B.F.A. without leaving an oil slick on the furniture.  This stuff makes my hair soft and manageable without a trace of grease.  My girlfriend actually enjoys running her fingers through my hair without the subsequent toweling off.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It detangled, but it worked terribly as a conditioner and moisturizer. It seems that the same thing allowing it to detangle so well (a bunch of water) is what left my hair feeling dry and rough. I naturally have barrel curls about the diameter of a pinky finger. I noticed that, once my hair dried (after using it as a leave-in and detangler), I&#x27;d have little white bits of residue on and in my curls, and my hair looked duller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I saw absolutely no positive difference in my hair.  I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle and I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> After trying more expensive products like Moroccan Oil products, I found this to be more effective, less expensive, and suitable for  daily use. There is build up over time between washes but not extreme build up. I think I will stick with this though I wished the price point would be a bit lower.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel. I tried knot today by kinky curly and it was ok, not bad but not great either. Then I tried this stuff. I fell in love. Keeps my hair soft, works excellent as a detangle for my 4a/4b hair. It keeps my hair soft and mixes well with my other hair products.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely AWESOME!!! It helps a comb ease through my 4c hair and I love it!  It&#x27;s light and smells great.  Although it&#x27;s is a little pricey, it&#x27;s actually worth it.  My hair feels moisturized and this is something that you notice immediately.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with coarse, natural hair and have been searching for a good moisturizer for my hair. I settled in on this one because of all the natural ingredients and the lack of the \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; ingredients. At first I was a bit concerned once I saw the consistency of it - it&#x27;s not thick like I expected, it actually has a very light lotion like consistency but it does the job of keeping my hair moisturized. Once I put it on my hair, it detangles exceptionally well and I see less hair in my comb. My hair is so soft and manageable after using the product. Now, I know you ladies with the coarse, natural hair can relate, this type of product is invaluable for us especially after we wash our hair and let it dry! I towel dry and then use this product and let it dry naturally and I&#x27;m good to go! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had this product for two months now and it does detangle, but very slowly and it very watery in texture, so it doesn&#x27;t really stick or bond well to my very thick and course afro. It really didnt penetrate pass my ends, didnt really get my root areas very well, even when I pay close attention in  those areas. So now I just mix it with my Sunny Isle Extra Dark Castor  so that it can  be a better bonding and detangler  mixture for my hair. I would not buy this product again, because it seems to be design for those with fine or medium, hair structures.</li>
    <li> I used this on dry hair in hopes that it would add and keep moisture and luster to both my son&#x27;s natural hair and my relaxed air. It didn&#x27;t help either hair type. Both of our hair was left just as dry and as if there was nothing on it. Ths was an expensive waste for me.</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer for natural girl 4 type coils</li>
    <li> Moisturizing? I t dried my hair to a crunch! Detangler? It tangled my hair something terrible. Not for me and I have 4a/4b type hair that&#x27;s thick. I read that cetyl alcohol or alcohol of any kind is damaging to natural hair. I&#x27;m going to stick with Shea Moisture. They never disappoint.</li>
    <li> Good product with great ingredients, but didn&#x27;t detangle as well as other products. Definitely moisturizes, but too heavy for my child with thin, curly hair. Went back to kinky-curly and the shea moisture line, more affordable and now at Target.</li>
    <li> I have 4B-4C type very tightly coiled hair and my hair sucks up moisture like no one&#x27;s business. This leave in is absolutely amazing and my hair really likes it. It costs a bit more than I&#x27;m used to paying but I do believe in paying for quality!&lt;br /&gt;It loosens my curl just enough for elongation and makes my very soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST BUY EVER!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for fine 4/C hair. My hair is very curly/spirally and breaks easily. This product is not to heavy and not very light and does exactly what I need it to do. The smell is nice and I think the price is just about right. After I shampoo and condition my hair, I normally let it air dry for about 30 minutes, while still damp I&#x27;ll use this detangling moisturizer to loosen my curls and braid my hair up at night. When I wake up, I can easily unbraid my hair and shine and softness is just excellent to me. The product arrived very quickly, I believe I received it in 4 days, in a sealed box with bubble wrap. I rate this product a 5.</li>
    <li> I do not review products but this product absolutely deserves one. If you believe the previous reviews are fake at least read mine because I have not been paid to review this product. I am just a happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koko du lait is the best hair product for natural hair, period! I have very thick kinky hair (4a/4b hair type) which I could not manage until I discovered koko du lait. I am now able to style my hair in about 5-10mins every morning and my hair stays manageable and moisturized all day. It is non-greasy, has a very mild smell, light weight and does not weigh your hair down. I simply love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all my natural hair ladies out there, get this product: it will change your life. Please note: I sometimes apply small amount of coconut oil to my hair for sheen before applying koko du lait. I do not combine any other products with koko du lait. I find that this gives me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about this product is the price. It&#x27;s rather on the expensive side but koko du lait is worth every penny. I&#x27;ll rather spend $25 on one product that does the job than 10 cheap others that do nothing.</li>
    <li> I am Black and Italian with kinky hair and though I&#x27;ve been able to wear my hair natural, this is the BEST product I have ever tried. I have used Vo5, the Pink cream, Jojoba oils, Dudley&#x27;s and Mizzani products, etc. This truly does offer a moisturizing protection for my wet to dry hair. My hair stays soft, cute, strong and manageable, and I color and bleach my do. FINALLY!</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizer after washing the hair and as a night moisturizer and also  mixed with the Tukka hair nourishment.  You only need a small amount of each, just mixed them together in the palms of your hands and smooth through the hair and brush. I love it, the next morning my hair felt very hydrated and smooth easy combing.</li>
    <li> This is my go to detangler before I prepoo or wash my hair.  It works very well at getting all my tangles out and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> It detangles okay, but in the process leaves hair so soaking wet, that it takes another hour to get the hair ready for blow drying, and by then it is already tangled again. Stopped using it after 3-4 uses, having tried all methods to get it work. It may work for some, but not for me!</li>
    <li> Great for a temporary comb-out and style. This product did not work over three hours for my Twins or myself.  It made our hair shorter and very dry.  It was also hard. However, the beauty was that I received the product as scheduled and was very excited to try it out. I hope to find a great product one day that really works.  We have spent thousands of dollars trying to find the right product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but I do not think it liked my hair.  It always felt kind of dry after I rinsed it out.  I gave it to a friend of mine for her daughter who&#x27;s hair is a bit curlier and thicker.</li>
    <li> This works well on tangles. I only use it when I have a lot of knots in my hair. Smell is ok--nothing special.</li>
    <li> This line needs more products. It is wonderful, great to apply everyday especially for hair that sucks up moisture and is prone to dryness. I am very sceptical when coming to products for my hair and try to investigate every ingredient in products.... This was worth it!</li>
    <li> This product generally does what it says it will do.  And ... even though the products smell was particularly pleasant, it is tolerable.</li>
    <li> I have super thick, coarse, BUT fine 4c natural hair, and my hair NEEDS moisture and MUST be detangled at all times. This stuff was a fantastic find for me! It moisturizes, detangles, and smells amazing...and of course, it&#x27;s ALL natural! Love it. I use this while my hair is out, and when I do protective styling with braids or whatnot. It just keeps my hair happy, and continues to help my hair grow long and strong. In the winter (which is kind of now, at least here in Philly), I combine this with some castor oil just to make it a little heavier. Makes it even better and keeps my hair hydrated in the cold wind. Try this, your hair will thank you :)</li>
    <li> left my hair feeling dry and unmoisturizes</li>
    <li> I have long thick curly..curly hair and this moisturizer works great.  I get so many compliments how pretty my hair is and it&#x27;s because of this product.  Also, fast shipping.  Great experience with the product and seller :).</li>
    <li> I am natural and have very tangle prone hair. This stuff works, and I like the fact that it is made with natural ingredients. I just want to know why they keep raising the price. I guess this product&#x27;s in demand. I do hope they lower it back down though.</li>
    <li> I just used it for the first time. I am not sure if put too much because it doesn&#x27;t say on the bottle how much to put. I put couple of small squeezes (I have long hair; I used one squeeze at the roots and another through the rest of the hair). It detangles the hair very well and right away but I was turned off by the greasy looking hair :-(. Now, every time I run my fingers through the hair, I feel the grease on them. Hopefully, next time, if I put less, it will work better. As long as the smell and texture goes I like it: it&#x27;s kind of peachy/almondy smell and the texture is creamy/oily.  But I will have to rewash my hair even though I didn&#x27;t want to.</li>
    <li> I love this as a moisturizer on my damp to dry hair.  It is creamy with a thinner texture, but it provides great coverage helps with detangling, and sets my twists quickly.  I use a sealing oil over it on my ends, with that it provides lasting moisture.  Love the moisture, definition and  shine.</li>
