<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good Product.  Creates tight curls (not loose) but looks very cute and the curls last longer than any other iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying that I have never been that great at using a regular curling Iron and I feel like this is a lot easier to use.  It takes a little practice to get it down without a burn here and there (at least for me it did, might be different for people that work with hot irons like this more often than I do).  However, right from the start I felt that the wavy curls that it creates are perfect.  I get the waves that I want in a lot less time than a regular curling iron would have taken me.  Every time I use it I get a ton of compliments on how great and natural my waves look.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> My wife has very fine hair and it has always been a struggle to curl it. This has a nice mechanism for grabbing the end of her hair and then allowing her to roll it up gradually -- creating fun wavy curls every 30 seconds. With some strong hair spray she&#x27;s been able to get the curls to stay throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I got this in need of a new curler. I decided on this one because of it&#x27;s unique design and hoping that it&#x27;s curl is a bit different from the straight round 1inch barrel I&#x27;ve been used to for the last 20 plus years. The curl is so much different and looks more natural, it gives my hair a sexy celebrity wave. Its easy to use and works wonderfully with long hair; also to mention the curls stay in forever, even in humidity.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use it on my niece who has straight flat hair. I used it on her hair and it left the smoothest and prettiest curls. Was very pleased on how fast it works.</li>
    <li> WHAT FUN THIS IS!!!!!!! I have never had a styling wand like this one, and am having so much fun with it!! I have waist length blonde hair, and am having fun creating different styles with this Goody Heat Wave Creator Styling Iron. It does not burn your hair with this really GREAT COATING!! Heats up very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for granddaughter already, and am going to buy another soon for another granddaughter!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM Sold by A2ZLiquidators (NOT WHO THEY SHOW ABOVE.)</li>
    <li> I use this every day....my friends love my waves.....and every time i use it i fine a different way to make the cuties waves and curls</li>
    <li> POSITIVES: It heats up very quickly. It does a good job of creating loose, natural curls and I received many compliments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron works best with very long hair. I say this because I had trouble keeping my shorter locks of hair from falling off the iron. As you can see from the picture, the clip is very short. Compared to my older curling iron, which sandwiched my hair between two identically long clips, you must twirl long tresses of hair (like spaghetti round a fork) fully around the appliance to keep the hair from falling off. Otherwise you have to be careful not to accidentally touch a hot area when you&#x27;re holding the hair in place (ouch!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the clip, it is so short that it forces you to put your head very close to the heat of the iron, which I didn&#x27;t find comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing it was designed this way because a clip tends to flatten the volume a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL SCORE: Good but let your hair grow out for best results!</li>
    <li> That is a question I have never been asked before, since my hair is NOT naturally curly~ it is naturally stick straight and fine. However, this Goody Heat Natural Waves curling iron has gotten me so many compliments in the last few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls it produces don&#x27;t necessarily look like the sample image, but they are still very pretty. The unique shape of the barrel, which I kind of think of as a unicorn horn, gives you curls that are both loose and tight, depending on how you wrap your hair. If you spread the hair out more on the barrel your curls will be looser, and if you wrap it tighter on skinnier parts of the barrel, the curls will be tighter. I prefer to hold it above my head and wrap the hair from top to bottom, without using the handle clip. The handle is helpful when doing the back and underside of my head, so that I can wrap from the bottom up, but the top layers I always do by manually wrapping the hair from the scalp down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very simple to figure out since I&#x27;m used to wrapping my hair around my normal curling iron anyways (without using the clip part) but there are decent instructions included with tips on how to get the best results. One key I&#x27;ve found to really getting great curls is to make sure and unwrap the hair off the curling iron rather than just letting go of the end and letting it unwind on it&#x27;s own; that can result in a big ratty mess. Unwrapping it carefully helps the curl keep its shape and makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there were no suggestions on what heat setting to use for your hair type, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using the appropriate one. I&#x27;ve been keeping it on level 6 (there are 10 temp settings) and the curls hold all day. I&#x27;ve never had a curling iron that could set curls like this one unless I was using gobs of hairspray beforehand, which is damaging to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would note is that this curling iron won&#x27;t necessarily give you those Lauren Conrad loose and flowey waves, and it doesn&#x27;t give much volume since the barrel isn&#x27;t very big. I think something like the [[ASIN:B003F2T0M4 Conair Infiniti You Curl Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron, Colors May Vary]] is better for that. What this curling iron does is give you a head of beautiful natural looking curls that really last. I&#x27;ve even gone a couple days between shampoos and had the curls still look pretty decent on day two. My hair is to the middle of my back and with this tool I can have it curled in no time. Two thumbs up!much volume since the barrel isn&#x27;t very big.

Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I received a Goody&#x27;s Wave Creator to review approximately three weeks ago. I have used this styling iron a total of twelve times now and I have to say that I really like it.. a lot. At first glance the Wave Creator&#x27;s wand looks so funky and fun; this made me want to try the product right away.  When I received the Goody&#x27;s Wave Creator I was a little confused about how to use it because I have only used styling tools with a full clamp that held your hair in place. The Wave Creator was so simple to use. The curl clip is small but holds your hair so that you can wrap your hair around the wand. I enjoyed the ease of just wrapping my hair around the wand and creating the loose waves that I wanted in my hair. My hair looked great - even the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took less than a minute for the Goody&#x27;s Wave Creator to heat up. There were several features that made me like this product. First, there are MANY heat settings on this styling tool and that was really important to me because I like to be able to control the heat while I am styling my hair. Second, I was impressed that the cord was a swivel cord. This made it easy to wrap my hair around the wand because I didn&#x27;t have to hold the Wave Creator a certain way. Third, I love that Goody also added the automatic shutoff safety feature on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the Goody&#x27;s Wave Creator. It is a fun and easy to use product that delivers natural looking waves.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite styling tool! You can easily use it by yourself, no need of help from anyone. It is very light weight. It heats up VERY quickly and it has 10 different heat settings. It has a swivel cord. The curls look smooth and natural. It works perfectly on any type of hair. I have long hair, my sister has fine hair and my mother has very very long thick hair and all three of us look stuning. I have goten so many complements since I started using it. I would definitely recomend it.</li>
    <li> I normally either use a large curling iron (without a spring )to straighten my hair (in place of flat iron), or I curl my hair with the last couple inches left out of it so that it gets that beacy windswept look.  I thought the Goody Heat Wave Creator Styling Iron would be perfect for me to use on the days I wanted my hair curled like that.  Therefore, I tried using it without the clip and just wrapping my hair around the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is probably about 8 inches or so below my shoulders.  I found that this iron definitely isn&#x27;t good for hair as long as mine, at least not how I tried using it.  I would have to either double back (left a weird kink), or actually wrap a couple times in the same locations.  The shape of the barrel made this difficult, and I just couldn&#x27;t get the style I was trying for.  Maybe it would be good for somebody with medium length hair, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with my regular non-spring curling iron for now.</li>
    <li> Teens didn&#x27;t find this very easy to get results with.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product to get more natural-looking waves in my long, straight hair. I found that when I wrapped my hair around the barrel, it would just slide into all the smaller grooves and I would end up with odd shapes in my hair. Since then I&#x27;ve stuck to a standard curling wand.</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length hair and i love it! every curl is different and I always get asked how I curled my hair. It says Its a wave creator and i haven&#x27;t figured out how to get it to do waves, but for just curling your hair its perfect!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> I also received mine as a sample and I love it! I will say though it does take some getting used to in order to use it. It is the biggest iron I own and is the only iron that&#x27;s used mainly upside down (unless you want curls, then it would be right side up using the clamp). I have long, thick African American hair and was ecstatic that I didn&#x27;t need to have the iron very hot to achieve the look I wanted. Just halfway at a 5/6 setting worked just fine for me. Also, the power light blinks while it is in the 30 second start up mode. When it goes solid, it&#x27;s ready to use at the desired temperature setting and will turn off (the light) the longer the iron is in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous using the waving end because you kinda have to fool around with it since it points downwards as well as learning to get the ends wrapped around the bottom. The clamp on the curling end isn&#x27;t very long (which I didn&#x27;t like) but since it&#x27;s not an exclusive curler, I didn&#x27;t mind. I was afraid I would end up burning my arm/wrist/hands, but as long as you take it slow the first few times, you will be fine. For me, it does take quite a bit of time to get the look you want from either the wave or the curling end (for my entire hair, being that it is thick), so be sure to increase your general primping time a bit. Overall, this is another great, quality tool from Goody!</li>
    <li> My hair is very difficult to curl. It never comes out right, always has crimped ends and never holds. I was curious about the Wave Creator when I saw this at the store and decided it was worth a shot. It heats up super fast which is nice. It&#x27;s a little awkward to get used to this. I did not use the small clamp to hold the ends of my hair. I wrapped my hair from the handle end of the tool down to the tip and held it in place at the tip. There isn&#x27;t a lot of room to hold, so I burnt my finger tip a few times until I got used to it. It curls quickly, about 30 seconds for a 1 inch think strand of hair. The end result was a little messy, but I think that is because I was just getting the feel for it and not really trying to style my hair. The curls are wavy and beachy looking. They seem to be holding strong, which never happens for me! I would recommend a practice run before trying this for an event or going out. I will definitely try this again! I was hoping for more formal waves (hard to describe, something you could wear for a night out) and I think I could achieve that with practice. Overall, this seems like a great, fun styling tool. Not sure how it would work for shorter hair. My hair is just below my shoulders and that seemed to be the perfect length to wrap around the barrel. I think it would work for longer hair as well.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to properly use it, but I thought the curls turned out horrible</li>
    <li> Just tried out the wave creator and it works really well. Heats up quickly. My waves seemed pretty consistent. Like other reviews, I agree with the fact it seems better for long hair. I&#x27;m currently growing mine out, so it worked pretty well, but for my shorter layers my hair stuck out at weird angles if I wasn&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get hot real quick, and can burn your fingers if you are not careful. Just have to get use to using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. It heats up quickly and so far after over a week of of use - no damage at all to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really two ways to curl your hair. You can simply wrap the hair around the iron and hold it with your fingers, or you can secure the hair with the clip and then wind it around your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron makes beautiful tight  curls, and at first I thought it was limited to that. But if you spread the hair more loosely (pulling the hair further so it doesn&#x27;t cover all of the iron but leaves gaps) then it&#x27;s a looser wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. I am usually terrible getting the right curl with these type irons but this one was easy.</li>
    <li> I received this as a product sample and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out. I love it! If your not use to curling your hair by wrapping it around a curling iron, it might be a little difficult at first. But like they say practice, practice, practice. I have two daughters, one 19 and one 7. My oldest tried out curling my hair. She got the hang of it really fast. I loved the curl it left in my hair. I got those big movie star waves that I have always wanted. Next, it was my turn, I curled my youngest daughters hair. I usually curl her hair for school every morning anyways. I use the regular curling iron or the spiral curling iron on her hair. She leaves the house everyday with her hair beautifully curled, but comes home,after whatever 2nd graders do all day, with no curl. So yesterday I curled her hair for picture day. Guess what?  She came home with curls still, beautiful waves and curls in her hair. I was so amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am really confident that I can do my daughters hair. I was never really worried about that. What I wanted was to be able to do my own hair. At first I tried curling starting from the bottom. It left a tight spiral curl. Then I tried from the top and wrapped my hair, I loved the big waves it left. Like I said before, it&#x27;s a little awkward at first to get use to it, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll love the big waves and curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get so many different looks from Goody Heat Wave Creator Styling Iron, and the curls and waves last longer than they do with a typical curling iron.</li>
    <li> I received this curling iron as a sample to try it out. The waves it creates are very similar to the waves you can create with a flat iron, however a lot easier and faster with the heat wave creator. Also, you can make the waves loose or tighter for a bouncier curl. I would recommend this product it works great. I love the waves it makes and it is versatile.</li>
    <li> By way of my wife&#x27;s comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This is the first wave creator that takes me less than 10 minutes to create and lasts all day long. I can&#x27;t believe its so cheap and works better than most I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve owned many. The thing is that my hair is straight and it&#x27;s very hard to create and keep waves. This machine does the job quickly and efficiently with long lasting results.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this machine for my wife. She looks very pretty and is very happy with this product. The curls do last all day long.</li>
    <li> I can give my dead hair some volume. Curls, waves tight or loose its perfect for any hair. I used it on my sister&#x27;s straightened hair to get a bed hair look.</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time using this curling iron because you hold it in the opposite&lt;br /&gt;direction as a regular one. It was awkward and I can say I never really got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a different look for your hair than using a regular curling iron and tends to be a&lt;br /&gt;tighter look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most frustrating part of it is if you put the hair on incorrectly it gets kinked and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s hard to recover from that. I feel like if I had more patience I would be able to get&lt;br /&gt;it to work better but I honestly wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to take the time. I wouldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;recommend buying this - invest in a regular curling iron instead!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Goody heat waver but had to return it because I had purchased the  Miracurl by Babyliss. Ther is no comparison. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I honestly have no idea how to use this.</li>
    <li> This has the potential to be a great product for medium to long hair, but its extremely hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the manufacturer would have made the clip the size of the iron (like a regular curling iron) it would have been fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to use the product you literally have to wrap your hair around the wand which is very hard and extremely awkward.  The clip is so small it doesn&#x27;t hold hair very well and the hair constantly slips out.  I have long hair so this should have been easy for me to use, but it wasn&#x27;t.  The only way I could get it to work was to wind my own hair on the wand, which is very time consuming with long and thick hair.  I have had just as good results just twisting my hair damp and then clipping the twists until they dry.  This takes a lot less time and the results are basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the patience for this, you will get a nice soft curl that really stays.  The other thing I did like about it is that it takes the frizz out of your hair while curling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this product has not hit the shelves as the manufacturer realized they made a huge mistake in not making the clip bigger.  If this is the case this is a product that I would buy and recommend.</li>
    <li> even if you try to use it with longer hair, there is nothing to hold on to without burning your fingers.  Bad design</li>
    <li> First I must state that I did receive this product as a product sample but all opinions are my own!  I was really excited when I was told I was getting a product from Goody to try.  When I opended the box and this was inside, I felt like I hit the jackpot!  Beachy (is that even a word, lol) waves is all the rave right now and Goody has made the process very easy!  The iron has 10 different heat settings so, there is one for everyone!  I put it on a 6 and it did great and my hair is long and very thick.  You simply let it warm up for about a minute then in wrap sections of your hair around the iron and use the little clip to hold the ends of your hair.  Let it sit for a few seconds then release!  Very easy and your hair comes out great!  After I finished curling my whole head, I lightly spray hairspray to set it then run my fingers through it and I am finished!  I had no problem with the curls holding up for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this iron.  My only complaint is that I wish the little clip was a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample and love it.  At first I thought that the clamp would be hard to use... but it is genious!!!  I have thick hair and it never gets tangled.  the waves that it creates are smooth and natural!</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair and doesn&#x27;t usuaully keep curl for long, but with this I got tons of curl that lasted.</li>
    <li> This takes a little bit of work to learn how to use properly, but I suppose styling your hair always takes some practice. I use it several times a week on my short hair pixie hair to have rockstar waves.</li>
    <li> This has been such fun to use and I get compliments on my hair every time I do!  Great for random fun curls and a quick and easy way to make &amp;#34;beach hair.&amp;#34;  This would make a great Christmas gift for any long-haired female on your list!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that I think this would be a great curling iron for hair that is mid-back length. I, on the other hand, have hair the goes a little past my shoulders. The curls were tighter than I prefer them to be and I was hoping for more of a looser, beachy style of wave. Although, I didn&#x27;t care for the hairstyle this created on me, someone else with longer hair might really like it.</li>
    <li> Creates great waves more so than actual curls. Works better on longer hair -I have medium length and I can&#x27;t picture anyone with shorter hair having an easy time with this iron. Does heat up quickly and takes a few minutes to get the hang of it but so far so good. Not the best or convenient iron around, but for quick, every day styling it works!</li>
    <li> I love it!! It can make waves! And also curls if you use the clip!! I use it almost everyday! You can get curls for the morning and afternoon and your curls drop into waves!!</li>
    <li> their is no way to wrap hair around it, it went right in the garbage. DO NOT BUT THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> i received this iron as a sample. I have super long and thick hair. When I used this I got more of a curl then a wave. Also if you don&#x27;t pay attention to how you wrap the hair around it you can end up with a pretty funky looking strand. Using a wand is something you have to get used to. I have used them in the past so that wasn&#x27;t to big of an issue for me. I also have wavy hair to begin with and usually use the curling iron to help tame down the frizzy parts and smooth everything out. This iron will not work for that you must start with your hair smooth! I also used in my daughters hair which is also very long and thick. I used the clip at the bottom and wound it like a normal iron and it produced really pretty spirals! I would recommend this product but just know it will take some getting used to!</li>
    <li> I bought this right before going on vacation. I used it many times. I love the waves and curls it creates and it&#x27;s very simple to use. I would suggest using it on long hair though. It seems to work better with longer hair.</li>
    <li> My mother asked me to purchase this for her so I grabbed one at Target. Fast forward a year later and it&#x27;s only been used once. I asked her why and she said it was too hard to figure out. I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and I was very disappointed. I have very long and thick hair but it holds waves and curls very well. I normally just wrap my hair around the barrel of a 1.5\\&quot; curling iron without the clamp for my wavy look because I don&#x27;t want to invest in a marcel curling iron. This product left me with weird kinks and unevenly shaped waves although I&#x27;ve been curling my hair for about 15 years and I know what I&#x27;m doing. I kept trying sections over and over again with no luck. There were really no instructions included so I looked on YouTube and found a few tutorials, the best technique I&#x27;ve found is to hold it upside down, wrap the hair and wait for about 5 seconds and then slowly drag it through the hair until it is out. So after about an hour and 10 different burns on my fingers I got it down and I realized it pretty much looked exactly the same as when I just use a normal iron. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time on this one if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, and if you do know what you&#x27;re doing you already know there are faster options.</li>
    <li> When I received this Iron, I was very excited to try it. I have used both a traditional waver, and a styling iron. I love the look of waves and was eager to try it. After trying it a few times, I am confident in creating a beautiful, sexy, wavy look. However, unlike other wave irons, this iron creates a more curlier wave; but because of this tighter wave, my hair was still wavey the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up quickly, and I was able to get through my entire head in 20 mins! For someone with long hair, this is great timing. I love that I can sleep on my waves and wake up with them still looking sexy. I just finger brushed and sprayed my hair with a refresher spray and I was ready to go. If you are wanting a style that will last all day long and more, than this one is for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that at first, the instructions were a bit confusing and intimidating. I saw this knobby vessel and I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d figure out how to use it or if I&#x27;d be using it correctly. The first thing I noticed is that it has 10 heat settings. I left it at 10 because I have straight fine hair that usually has curls/waves falling flat rather quickly. I didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair after I had washed it, I just let it air dry and wrapped it in a bun. The second thing I noticed was that it had a very small clamp (am I supposed to use that?. I felt very akward working from the top down, but that is how the product is supposed to be used, so I went for it. At first, I was tightly wrapping smaller sections of hair around the smaller portions of the barrel, and noticed some lines in my hair, I didn&#x27;t like that. After one sting of the heat from the barrel as I accidently flipped it on my front of my hand, I decided to do larger sections and wrap my hair relatively loosely around the ENTIRE barrell. The results were phenomenal, this must be how I&#x27;m supposed to use it, because my hair looks so wavy and beautiful. I mean I only did the front and sides, my hair is rather long and I&#x27;ve achieved a different look than the norm. Overall I am impressed with the quality of this product. In the future, I might consider a lower heat setting, and being by parting larger sections of hair to be wrapped around the entire barrell vice the inner portions. If you&#x27;re looking to boost your hair in a different way, this product is for you. I&#x27;m sure that the more I use it and work with it, the more \\&quot;normal\\&quot; it&#x27;ll feel in my hands and I&#x27;ll be less inclined to accidently burn myself (I&#x27;m rather clumsy that way). But it does have a swivel cord to avoid such things, it heats up quickly (so you don&#x27;t have to wait forever like some other products have you waiting), but I&#x27;ll definitely pass on the \\&quot;curl clip\\&quot;, for now, I personally don&#x27;t see the purpose of it, but then again, I might just be using it incorrectly. I received this product as a sample by being a member of the Goody New Product Panel, but know that the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.ng it incorrectly.

    <li> Awkward to use on yourself. Have it away after it left a decent sized scar on my arm in one of my attempts to get it to do what it says it does. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to anyway who plans on using it on themselves.</li>
    <li> I bought this to style hair for a wedding and it&#x27;s wonderful. It creates beautiful curls and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> reflect the experience you hope to have. I bought this because of the good reviews. I could not get the hang of it even though I am a styling pro when it comes to irons...The nodes make for some awkward looking ends.</li>
    <li> I used this as if it were clipless.  I have thick hair to the middle of my back.  It took quite a while to curl all of it; however, it looked great.  I needed it for a special occasion on a Sunday, so I had to do my own hair.  I am not an expert in hair styling, so if my occasion had been on Saturday, I would have gone to a salon.  You need a heat resistant glove with this!</li>
    <li> The point of this device is to quickly render soft, flowing supermodel curls and waves. Think Heidi Klum rather than Heidi the Swiss orphan. Honestly, the last thing one wants is to look like an extra in Gone With The Wind and with this type of curling iron, things can go very, very wrong very, very quickly. It is for this reason, I have to admit, that prior to trying this styling iron, I was more than a little skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a bit of a learning curve here. The instructions are basic and leave many questions unanswered. Unless you live with a professional hair stylist, trial and error is the only way. I recommend you practice winding your hair (front, sides, top, and back) around the barrel of this curler before you plug it in. Get comfortable with it while it is still easy to handle, because once it gets hot, you want to work fairly quickly and with little hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have just revitalized my hair with Nature&#x27;s Way Organic Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce, I wanted to make sure that the heat of this curler would not burn or do any damage. I set the curler on to a heat setting of 5 out of a maximum 10. I found that was plenty hot for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions indicate that for loose, flowing curls, one&#x27;s hair should be wrapped around the larger parts of the barrel. The wand should be held vertically with the end facing down. This is only possible with very long hair, 7\\&quot; - 8\\&quot; or longer. Shorter hair can only wrap around both the wide and narrow parts. This turns out not to be a problem but one goes through several aborted winding attempts trying to accomplish the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend a back mirror to get the back of the head done. It&#x27;s very important to see what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sectioned my hair in 2\\&quot; sections. Starting at ear level, while holding the ends of the hair, I wound each section around the larger parts of the barrel and held it for no more than a second or two. I did the sides and as much of the back as I could comfortably reach while holding the wand vertically. I then very carefully did the hair around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is that you need to be very careful not to burn yourself while you are wrapping your hair around a very hot metal wand that you are trying to hold vertically. You can easily burn your fingers, your nose, your ears, or the back of your neck. Luckily, I only burned myself once. It was left wrist. It hurt but did not blister. Beauty is savage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was fairly decent beachy, bed head waves that have lasted all day. My wrist is healing nicely.r two.

    <li> I was intimidated when I first picked up this curling iron to use it. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to figure it out. I do have to say that my preferred curling iron, though, is a Marcel one. That&#x27;s the kind without the clamp on it. The \\&quot;professional\\&quot; one. But since my last one broke, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a decent replacement so I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is flat iron my hair first. Maybe you can skip this step, but since I&#x27;m African-American, and I wash, wrap, and air dry my own hair, it needs more straightening first. After I flat iron it, I&#x27;ve figured out that the easiest way to use this is to hold the hair I want curled with hard on that side of my head. So if I&#x27;m working on the left side of my head, then I hold my parted hair in my left hand, grab the curling iron with my right hand, turn it upside down, and the twirl my hair around the barrel using my left hand. The one thing you&#x27;ll want to do is leave about 1/2 to 1 inch of hair NOT curled at the very end of your hair. That avoids burns on your fingers. Ask me how I know this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve discovered - this is probably meant for longer hair than mine. My hair is shoulder length, maybe an inch past my shoulders. It&#x27;s not the easiest thing in the world to get the waves - but it works. I don&#x27;t see in the product description that it&#x27;s meant for longer hair, but the model does have longer hair. Smaller parts makes curlier curls. To avoid standing in front of the bathroom sink for hours, I only curled the \\&quot;top\\&quot; part, or crown, part with a few other curls surrounding those. Larger (wider) parts make wavier curls. To get this look it takes much less time. The problem for me with shoulder-length is that the wavier curls don&#x27;t make much curl at all. They&#x27;re there, just not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this curling iron. It works very well. You might burn your finger as you get used to it, but if you&#x27;re a quick reactor, it won&#x27;t be bad. For the length of my hair, a shorter barrel would be perfect!perfect!</li>
    <li> It make pretty waves n my family uses aswell n they like it too n its a good price too</li>
    <li> I am a former hairstylist and even I found this tool a little difficult to manuever.  I could only take very small sections of hair at a time and this would cause the curls to be very tight.  I have a lot of hair so it made for very big hair!  I was looking for something that would provide loose waves and this was definitely not the right one.</li>
    <li> I have freakishly long, straight, fine, color-treated hair.  If this gadget works for me, it&#x27;ll work for just about anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well.  I followed the suggestions provided--beginning the wave halfway down the strand of hair and then working back up.  The waves look natural and summery.  It doesn&#x27;t take all that long to use on your whole head, and is lots faster than blow drying with a round brush.  I always air-dry my hair and sometimes it gets kind of bent at weird angles.  The Goody is great for evening things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Count me very pleased!</li>
    <li> My hair is so hard to style no matter what i do. I have spent hundreds of dollars on other curling irons and different products trying to make my hair just do something and nothing worked. Someone suggested a hair wand to me and my hair finally stays curled for longer than 5 minutes</li>
    <li> Almost daily compliments on my hair -from friends and strangers -since I started using this curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, sort of wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t usually hold curls very well and gets frizzy when its humid outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this curling iron I don&#x27;t need any styling products - even hairspray- and the curls will stay looking great all day!&lt;br /&gt;The odd looking design makes perfect loose &#x27;beachy&#x27; waves.&lt;br /&gt;Iron gets very hot, so it doesn&#x27;t take long (less than 5 mins!) to curl all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small clip that holds hair at the end is a little tricky to get used to at first, but still much easier to use than the irons with no clip that you wrap the hair around (seriously - i don&#x27;t want to have to wear heat resistant gloves just to curl my hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Came on time..i do like it but i think it is a little difficult to use because the bubbles get in the way and sometimes form a weird curl.. other than that it&#x27;s pretty good for the price and if you know how to use it</li>
    <li> Sure, it&#x27;s funny looking.  My friends and I joke about its shape.  My husband was kinda weirded out when I pulled it out of the packaging.....  But this one styling tool has, seriously, changed my world.  I have the straightest, most baby fine hair in the universe that has always refused to hold curl.  THIS THING CURLS MY HAIR IN THE MOST GORGEOUS, LOOSE, &amp;#34;BEACHY&amp;#34; WAVES EVER!  AND IT ONLY TAKES 10 MINUTES!!  (I know I&#x27;m shouting there, but the situation calls for excessive all caps.)  I can curl my hair with this on Monday - and the curl is still there on Wednesday, with hardly any &amp;#34;touching up.&amp;#34;  That has never happened.  Like, my entire life.  Ever.  And I suck at styling my own hair, however, I figured this out from the first time I ever used it.  I watched a YouTube video of some 15-year-old giving instruction and was able to figure it out quite quickly.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying two more, just to have spares in case this thing ever dies.  It&#x27;s FAB.  Buy it.  You&#x27;ll be so happy you did!</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made.  The clip is short enough that it doesn&#x27;t hold hair, if you wrap your hair around the shaft you have to hold it there for a long time and that is impossible because you would have burned your fingers.  This product is poorly designed and it just doesn&#x27;t work. A consumer reports group should look at it. Shame on Amazon for selling it!</li>
    <li> If you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll love it. You can end up with all types of curls and waves because the barrel is oddly shaped. As far as looks, it looks ODD.. my mom thought it was (oh man are you ready to hear what she thought it was??) she thought it was a sex toy for your backside (I was mortified and then looked at her like eww -_- tmi)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ended up with all types of crazy curls and waves.. once I got the hang of it, It looked amazing!! And I used it with out hair spray and my hair lasted all day. Which was amazing for me because my hair has a tough hold! So i was all shocked &#x3D;-O but very happy &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. Hair looks so bouncy and curly afterward and stays in even after sleeping on it. The hair seems to slip a bit when trying to curl so it does take a long time to curl hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for a gift and this product produces very nice wave curls, my granddaughter loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I have no complaints. I have had this product about six months and use it at least four times a week.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is perfect. Works great in my hair. Curls nicely. It can make cute tiny curls or nice big bouncy waves.</li>
    <li> The little piece that holds your hair in place is too small.  I burn my fingers every time I use it.  It does get hot fast and if you can get your hair in the clip, it does curl, but the end doesn&#x27;t get curled very well</li>
    <li> This is soo much better than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever dealt with. It is easy to use, makes  beautiful curls and has a bunch of different heat settings too. I would recommend that every girl have one of these, its that great.</li>
    <li> Love this curler make different size in curls not so uniform like most curling irons make natural looking curls in different diameters throughout the curl. Great hot temperature for thicker coarser hair</li>
    <li> My daughter has very straight long hair.  After 30-40 minutes of curling, she has beautiful curls that last all day.  Be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
    <li> Really easy to burn yourself, does not curl my hair. Returned right away since I was not happy with it at all.</li>
    <li> My sister had one and i loved it, they stopped selling them in stores so i was very disappointed. However, i found it on here and i wish i would of bought 2-3 just to give them as gifts/have a back up just in case. The best curler i have ever had. I have thick, long hair and i can do my hair in less than 5 min. and it comes out perfect!  Best purchase ever!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who has been watching how to use it on YouTube.  She was able to use it right away and had a head full of cute waves.  It is easy to burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful, but for someone her age or older I think it is fine as they learn quickly to hold the iron tip.</li>
    <li> This Product was as described. Its a gamble to buy things on amazon. So to actually get what I ordered it priceless.</li>
    <li> It just isn&#x27;t easy to use. I wish there was an easier tool. I don&#x27;t want to spend that mush time for the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This definitely delivered.  I wanted something that would curl my hair but not uniformly, as I am over the &amp;#34;Goldilocks&amp;#34; ringlet look.  This heats up very fast, has an auto-shutoff so if you forget it the house won&#x27;t burn down, and can be used to make a lot of different types of curls.  I have tried curling the entire length of my hair as well as the bottom half, and both results were stellar.  The curls hang nicely and stay in for a long time (I have fine hair that can be difficult to curl and it still works for me).  The only thing I will say is it scratches easily - I packed it for an out-of-town trip and something in my suitcase put a scratch in the barrel covering.  Wrap it when traveling or storing and it should be great!</li>
    <li> At almost 14 years old she uses it daily fussing with her hair to look her best.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this product can give her the self confidence that a girl her age needs so badly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order another one just to have it ready for her.</li>
    <li> I love this item my hair comes out just perfect and it does what it says I have used it just about everyday</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift because we had one and it really makes great spiral curls. Best on long straight hair</li>
    <li> The Iron looks good but I have trouble using it.  Since I cut my hair shorter I think it&#x27;s too late to return.  I never use it.  Can I get a refund?</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and easy to use. Works great on shoulder length hair but didn&#x27;t work very well on my long thick hair. My daughters looked cute for picture day though! So thank you for the quick delivery and at a great price!</li>
    <li> i love it. It has made it easier for curling my hair. I received it promptly. Condition was like i had gone to the store to buy it.</li>
    <li> I personally have a hard time maneuvering a traditional curling iron and this is very easy to use and i get the exact sexy waves/curls i always wanted.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is very fine and doesn&#x27;t hold curl but with this curling iron it holds l day.</li>
    <li> This curling iron would be great if the band that held the hair in place were longer. There really is no way to keep the hair wrapped around the iron and style quickly.  I did try the iron and it takes a long time; however, it does give nice waves.</li>
    <li> I guess I don&#x27;t know how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!  Best one I&#x27;ve used in 25 years.  Holds the curl in my hair for days!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The clasp holds hair in place so the process is quick and easy.  No burnt fingers.  I have medium long hair and my entire head is done in 5 minutes.  I bought one for my niece on college because she liked it so much!</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t have the patience for this thing. But I did try it out more than once and just couldn&#x27;t get the look I wanted. The spirals weren&#x27;t uniform at all and it looked like I tried too hard to style my hair (total opposite if the natural, wave look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you want a simple, beachy wave look, go for a regular cone shaped curling wand. I purchased the Conair Infiniti Pro Curling Wand (mine is red), and it works much better and the hold is fantastic (I have normal to thick, long hair).</li>
    <li> Easy to use...has a short clip to hold the end of hair section, and you just twirl it up.  Makes nice spiral curls that hold their shape.</li>
    <li> i loved this i recremened it to many of my friends and they love it to the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it makes your hair smell weird but thats normal. Tip: do small strands it looks better</li>
    <li> I love this product. I bought it a little skeptical cause my hair never curls but it works amazing.  My hair will still wavy using this for days. It was a little awkward to use at first but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s a cinch! Using the bigger sections gets you awesome beachy waves, and I use the small sections for tighter curls. Totally recommend!!</li>
    <li> Excellent curling iron! I love this product! It heats up so fast and stays hot for as long as you want to use. You can curling all your hair in 20 min or less!</li>
    <li> My sister has this styling iron and after using hers I had to have my own as well. Works great. Curls look more long, natural, wavy. LOVE!</li>
    <li> My daughter is on cheer and is sometimes required to show up with curly hair.  She inherited her straight hair from me and this iron really works on her hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this iron.  Took me less than 5 minutes to curl my entire head, and I love how it makes beachy waves.  You don&#x27;t need a heat glove with this -- there is a clip.  Clip the bottom of your hair in the clip, roll up, hold for 30 seconds and unwind.  Perfect beachy waves!</li>
    <li> An ok piece of equipment. I don&#x27;t use to often but do work well. Was looking for something that work with my braids and this does</li>
    <li> It was okay, not very fancy but it does the job. I was just expecting more pizzazz I guess.</li>
    <li> I use a [[ASIN:B003V265QW Remington Ceramic Curling Wand, 1 Inch]], which is a smooth tapered wand without a clamp (and I really like it). But not being very knowledgeable or skilled with the art of curling, I thought it would be good to try out a different type of curling iron. This iron did produce a different type of curl, but I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with either the curl or the operating of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clamp is very short, which is good in some ways, and in other ways it makes it a little harder to clamp your hair in it. But the part I really didn&#x27;t care for was the big selling point of this iron - the bumps. My hair had more of a tendency to end up between them instead of over them. The design also forced the hair to wind higher up the barrel than I wanted, leading to most of the hair at the end of the iron instead of evenly distributed. I also found the controls very poorly designed. There is simply a power button and a temperature dial. Simple is good, but this design was annoying in two ways. First, the dial didn&#x27;t have an indicator to tell you which number was selected.  The center one I guess? Second, it was really easy to accidentally hit the button and the dial when curling. I changed the temperature several times this way and once turned off the iron completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that maybe I have yet to get the hang of this iron, so I will keep trying. But my other iron took all of two or three curls before I felt comfortable with it, so I don&#x27;t feel like this iron&#x27;s learning curve should be that much higher.</li>
    <li> I was a little intimidated by this products at first, before I tried it I though I&#x27;m not going to like this at all, it looks complicated, but I was so wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a medium length, it has a slight natural wave to it, nothing special. But once I used the heat wave creator it gave my hair a really nice natural waves, beachy hair waves. I&#x27;m also not one who likes to do much with my hair, which for me is a big thing when I purchase products because I don&#x27;t want to spend hours on my hair, I have kids and a busy life style, I don&#x27;t have the time. But when I got this I plugged it in and I was so surprised at how fast it got warm then hot. Speedy, just the way I like it, another pro in my book. Also what I did I just grabbed chunks of my hair in no particular order, I spent maybe a total of 20 minutes on my hair and that was it. I was beyond trilled at the results I called my sister up who is A-mazing at doing hair and make up and showed her on face talk, lol. She was so impressed, she came over and used it and loved it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no complaints about this product what so ever. If I had to choose something I would say maybe the clamp? The clamp doesn&#x27;t bother me at all when I&#x27;m curling my hair. I don&#x27;t use curling iron that have a clamp. Before I got the Goody Heat wave Creator, I was using an old curling iron that I had just removed the clamp to use the barrel portion only. Besides that I do recommend this product, I was reading some of the negative comments and I personally don&#x27;t think the negatives were directed at the product, I just think that this is a new unusual item and some people are stuck in their ways and not liking it because of the clamp, or because it doesn&#x27;t have a longer clamp. Adapt! it&#x27;s not rocket science, this is a simple tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who said it doesn&#x27;t work on short/long hair, I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is? I just got my hair cut it was long, long (a few inches from my butt long)and I was able to use it then and after just fine! I know this because I was worried the waves wouldn&#x27;t look as good if my hair was slightly shorter. But it works just fine either way. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for new hair products especially strange looking ones! If you could get past people making fun of you for having a somewhat x-rated looking appliance for a hair tool then read on :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron definitely gets the job done. It has a unique little clippy thing (a shortened version of the usual tong that clamps down on your hair) to hold the end in place. Divide a small section of hair, clip it in, twirl and hold for about 5-10 seconds and release. I had great curls that lasted a couple of days until I washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curls lasted much longer than most appliances I have tried. They did not fade or loosen and stayed much the same curliness until I washed my hair. I thought this was great considering I didn&#x27;t leave the curler on any section for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat was just right. I have stick straight, fine, difficult to curl hair. At level 10 and only 5 seconds I had very nice large curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair naturally rolls around curler in sprial shape (sliding in between each section on barrel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curler could be used as a wand as well without utilizing the clamp. Just make sure to wear protective gloves not to burn your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it difficult to wrap my hair around the larger sections of the barrel. My hair would just slide off and back onto the smaller sections of barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For very long hair (mine is waist length) you&#x27;d have to roll half your hair first and then the other half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the clamp, my hair would get caught every time by sliding too far down the apparatus or getting caught between the handle and barrel. I would have to yank my hair out and pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the clamp you can&#x27;t clamp much hair to it, only small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wave Creator was much better than I&#x27;d expected and performed well. Overall I highly recommend everyone try it!</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair so whenever I use a heated styling tool, my hair usually falls flat or becomes frizzy. It has been hard for me to get beach waves but this does the trick. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work the way that I thought it would. My curls were all over the place.  Maybe this item takes more practice.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new hair styling tool that would give me cute waves on a shorter hair style. I did not want to spend a fortune for this new tool but I did want a product that I could rely on. Seeing this styling iron I was immediately interested. I loved the idea of it giving more of a natural look than a normal curling rod. Seeing the Goody brand name made me worry a bit because I am use to them only making hair ties. After sleeping on the idea for the night I woke up the next morning and purchased the iron without even getting out of bed. I received the iron and used it that day. While it is not the easiest iron to use especially on shorter hair, it does leave my hair with some super cute waves/curls. I hope once my hair grows out more it will be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because like many others the clip is extremely hard to use, and I have burnt my fingers a few times. I would have preferred that Goody included a glove to keep from burning my fingers. I will probably end up having to purchase one separately which is an added expense to the iron.</li>
    <li> amazing!!! it takes practice to get the hang of the way you want your curls but after awhile its great! I can now curl my hair with this in 10-15 minutes. its a simply, cute and quick way to complete you daily look!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of this iron, because I&#x27;ve tried alllllll kinds, and not many do much for my hair, but this was a delightful exception. I was amazed at how well it worked, and how natural (and gorgeous!) my hair looked afterward. One caveat: The heat goes up pretty high, so my hair smelled slightly fried afterward! Try it on a lower temp before you crank it all the way up. I used this for waves, but it also makes really cute sausage curls (if you&#x27;re in the demographic that that looks good on -- I&#x27;m not!).</li>
    <li> I initially saw this item at Wal-Mart, for $30 and considered buying it several times. I looked it up on Amazon to read reviews, and noticed that it was significantly cheaper here ($19). I ordered it for my daughter, who loves it. Definitely for longer thinner hair...my hair is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t give same effect that my daughter gets on her long thin hair.</li>
    <li> Plan to give this to my grand daughters who all have long hair.  May rate it higher if it works for them.</li>
    <li> I GAVE IT TO A 13 YEAR OLD GIRL AND SHE SAID OVER A DOZEN TIMES HOW MUCH SHE LOVED IT.</li>
    <li> This is great for the days you dont blow dry your hair and already have a little wave to it, but need to polish them up a little. Gets really hot, so its very effective.</li>
    <li> Not your &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; waves, but not too bad. The iron was hard to use at first, but finally I got the hang of it. Overall it does a pretty good job!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift and the person receiving it likes it. Easy to use in a jiffy and curls as you want them.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas because she had asked for it.  It is difficult to use, but once she got the hang of it, she really liked the curls it made.</li>
    <li> Hard to use &amp; easy to get burnt (IT GETS HOT QUICK).  Plan to practice more, but can&#x27;t do many strands of hair at a time.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I do not like it and probably will go in the drawer with everything else I buy and then don&#x27;t use.  No clamp on it so it is extremly hard to use and not burn your hand.  I can get the same results and better with my small bore curling iron and not burn my hand</li>
    <li> very nice hair curler, especially for the price.  Very easily pins down only the ends of hair and you can twist and curl you hair the way you want it.  The shape also lets your hair look more natural since the curls aren&#x27;t uniform.</li>
    <li> Ive had so many compliments and had so many friends want to buy one. Love this iron!! And I dont think its hard to use ... just a little different than your regular iron. Just be patient and give it a try.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d be better off using a curling iron or wand.  As a hairdresser  I am always trying new products. This was a dud. If you wrap your hair around where the iron is smallest you end up with a very tight curl. And the length of the barrel is very short. Which may work well for someone with short hair. But those with longer, thicker hair like myself would have a hard time using this. Hope this helped...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Chrismas and it was a big hit!  It creates curls with ease and is so much easier than her previous curling iron.  It takes little time to heat up also, which is a big plus.</li>
    <li> nice but its very hot and I could not hold it I burned my hand and my sister many time</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rating online and i am glad i did. The curls stay for a long time without hairspray and it is actually very easy to use. invest in a glove though, or else you wil burn yourself a few times!</li>
    <li> I read and watched TONS of reviews on this. I was torn between this and one of the Bedhead Curlipops or their Rock n Roller which is similar to this one. This one was a good price and overall had great reviews. This is my first clipless type curling iron. I&#x27;m not skilled with traditional ones because I can&#x27;t seem to curl without getting the crimps at the end, so I wanted to try one of these. The videos make it look so easy and it probably is IF your hair is longer (which I probably should&#x27;ve figured but I was hopeful). My hair is lightly layered and the longest layer falls at about my collarbone (~1-1 1/2 past my shoulders in the back). I couldn&#x27;t use this like it was intended by holding it upside down and wrapping the hair around. My hair isn&#x27;t remotely long enough to accomplish that without burning the hell out of my hand, wrist, arm, and face. Burns aren&#x27;t cute or fun. Or beachy. So I have to use this like you would the traditional curling iron, holding the iron facing up and using the small clip on the base to hold the ends and twist hair around the barrel (which is nice that this is one that has a clip so that girls with shorter hair CAN use it). It provides pretty nice looking waves/curls but not anything I couldn&#x27;t do with a flat iron (where I have less chance of burning myself). I&#x27;ll continue to practice, but I think this will go into the retirement hair appliance bin until my hair grows out a little more and I try it again. Long haired ladies will probably have better luck and get the look that this is designed to give.</li>
    <li> Being a tomboy all my life, I was never taught how to curl or do my hair properly. I have successfully curled my hair ZERO times before i got this product. The curl ive been looking for is a loose beachy wave. And with this wand, i got it. Its fast, easy and works well. I couldnt have asked more : )</li>
    <li> I had ordered the Chi styler for $139 from QVC however it was difficult to use and very expensive even though it came with both a travel and full size styler. This styling iron heats up quickly and is so easy to use. The curls are perfect. The styler also comes with easy to follow instructions and you cannot beat the price plus a 3 year warranty. You can&#x27;t go wrong treating yourself to this styler!</li>
    <li> The design  of the new Goody Heat Wave Creator is not only beautiful but it allows you to make perfect loose and free flowing curls. This curling iron heats up really fast and allows you to style your hair in a hurry without any frizzing of your hair. The rod doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair even with styling products on it and this is so important because it won&#x27;t damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I had with the Heat Wave was the clip was too short and you had to hold the hair to curl and it was somewhat difficult because you had to use both of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Goody Heat Wave and love the way it makes my hair look.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has been using this.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.  She has medium-long hair.  The waves are beautiful and last well.  She really likes the Goody Heat Natural Waves Curling Iron.</li>
    <li> What a joke. U have to hold the iron upside, hold your hair with your fingers against the hot iron and it still doesn&#x27;t work for nothing. Piece of crap.</li>
    <li> When using this, you can tell the quality is not high. Hard to get a nice looking curl out of this. Takes some practice.</li>
    <li> if you have the time this is a must you can do just the ends or your whole head but you def need the time because its not as thick so your curls come out a little tight</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curler/wave maker. I have medium/ long hair that does not hold curl at all, not even with hairspray, until now..This product is easy to use and creates all different types of curls, from tight spirals to beachy waves. I don&#x27;t even have to use hairspray for the curl to hold all day. I could rave about this product all day. Just want to say its the best there is. Every woman should own one.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a new style of curl for my hair. I love this curling iron, it gives more of a straight end hair curl.</li>
    <li> This heats fast and is very hot! Makes great curls that last all day long! Shipped to me fast! thanks!</li>
    <li> I have never used one of these irons before and it is extremely hot and hard to use.  Needed better instructions for use.</li>
    <li> great!!!! I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> The Goody wave creator makes nice waves and curls, too. It is light and heats up fast. Easy to store anywhere. Depending on how close and tight you roll your hair you can make loose curls/waves. The closer you wrap the hair the curler the curl ends up tighter and more defined. The looser you wrap the hair the more it makes a wave.  You can definitely play around with hair styles with this product.</li>
    <li> my hair is pin straight and i can almost never get it to curl. i&#x27;ve tried wands and other brands of spiral curlers, and this one is the easiest to use and leaves my hair curly all day. i bought a backup one just for travel.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use and it creates such loose, lovely curls. My hair is long and the curl stayed in all day. Such a great new look!</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand! Amazing curls!! I have thick hair, tacks at most 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> First off I need to mention that this was crazy fast shipping. I purchased it around 3-4pm and received it the following day before 11am!!&lt;br /&gt;This styling iron works amazing. Beautiful curls. You can either use the clip or opt to no clip. I honestly found it easier without clipping the hair to the styler. It has several different settings as well. Great product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to get my hair looking fun! I have straight flat hair and this styling iron made it easy for me to have waves and bounce!</li>
    <li> I have multiples of the following: flat irons, curlers, curling irons, the In-styler . . . you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. I received the Goody Heat Wave Creator Styling Iron today and I am thrilled with it. I want to take all the other hair care stuff and fill a giant garbage bag. This is my favorite hairstyling tool ever. The Wave Creator heats up quickly and is soooo easy to use. It gave my super-fine &amp;#34;Annie-Afro&amp;#34; curls smooth, shiny, spiral curls. You can pull the curls down to create gentle beachy waves or rock cool corkscrew curls. Love it! Might buy another one to keep as a spare.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for me but ended up giving to my granddaughter. I could not get it to work for me.</li>
    <li> I loved it! I used it on my self and one of my daughters and we got lots of compliments on our hair! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This does give your hair a great wavy look.  I have very fine, super straight hair and I have tried a ton of different ways to make it look wavy or curly.  This works as well as most products do for me.  There are 2 ways to use it so read the directions.  If you use the clip and curl from the bottom up then you get tighter curls. If you use it like a wand and curl from the top down then you get looser curls...and might burn the bleep out of your hands so get a glove if you do that.  Like I said, I have very fine hair so the second method did not work for me at all, but using the clip did give me loose enough curls that looked very natural.  I like it a lot, but because it is so small, it take a long time to get all my hair curly.</li>
    <li> So I got this because I like a messy curl look. It gave me just that. It does NOT make your hair wavy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for 29.99 a year ago. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes that they raised the price to 79.99. I wanted to buy this as a gift. It&#x27;s not worth 79.99. Go buy a chi air curler for that price!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Performance surpassed my expectations. Curls last all day and it&#x27;s very easy to use even on my thick hair. I would definately recommend it to anyone as a great alternative to getting perms!</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron.  It&#x27;s easy to use and makes nice curls.  My only small issue is that I have very fine hair so the curls can come out a little too tight.  If you don&#x27;t have baby fine hair it would probably make fuller curls.  Other than that I really like it.  If they had one just like it with a larger barrel I would definitely get it!</li>
    <li> So far this has been my favorite curling iron ever. I have long hair (past my shoulders) and I can curl it up super quickly with this — in around 15 minutes. My only gripe is that the design of the iron puts the on/off button right near where I grip it to curl, so it can easily get turned off while I&#x27;m working with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is quick and easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this curling iron to my friends.</li>
    <li> Note: I have medium-length, very thick, naturally wavy layered hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret missing the return window on this; it took me about a month to try it out between traveling/life craziness. Anyways, I burned myself a lot with the itty-bitty clamp, and the ends of my hair turned out weirdly stick-straight compared to the &amp;#34;curl.&amp;#34; I use that term lightly, because I&#x27;m not sure what exactly this thing creates... but it&#x27;s not the expected wavy curl. I&#x27;d say some sort of mutant cousin. It&#x27;s definitely not a precision instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up nicely, and the swivel handle works well. If I had fine, stick-straight hair, it&#x27;d probably work better (just a guess). I will keep trying it, just to see if I can get more comfortable with it, and thus have better results. I&#x27;ll update this if I do. But save yourself some effort; Go to bed with braided wet hair, and run a flat iron over the braids before you take them out in the morning. You&#x27;ll achieve the same effect this wand is attempting to do, with much less hassle.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and I love the curls! I recommend this for anyone! It also heats up really fast and the clip is pretty easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product did NOT work as stated. It said curls would stay in for more than one day, that was false. Save your money and buy a small barrel curling iron it works MUCH BETTER! Your ends end up straight as they cannot go into the barrel. I am also a hair dresser.</li>
    <li> does not grip my hair and there is not enough hand space at the tip. I burnt my thumb.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at getting something that would create natural-looking curls/beach waves, and it delivers.  There are instructions for how to do natural or spiral curls, but really any way you handle the iron it works, due to the changing barrel size.  I was able to create long curly locks where all the curls were varied in size, creating a natural, beachy look in the middle of the winter!  I love this iron, as well as its power-down attribute; if you walk away and forget about it, it turns itself off!</li>
    <li> Not bad for the given price. My hair is long (till my waist), and very thick. I would say for people who don&#x27;t have thick hair--it can work well and probably quicker. The product does the job, I&#x27;m not overly in love with it, but at the same time I would recommend it. It does create nice waves--but be warned, have some time to do your hair!</li>
    <li> This makes curling my hair so much easier then when I used a standard wand. Curls are natural looking, not too tight, and hold all day.</li>
    <li> Clip arm so small it doesn&#x27;t hold hair securely to iron....unfortunatly resulting in burned fingers. It went straight to the junk pile.</li>
    <li> I use it often and reallly like it! My favorite features are the super-short warm-up time and the swiveling cord. I watched YouTube tutorials to learn how to use it, and through my own experimentation I&#x27;ve learned how to get a few different looks from this iron. I spend a little less time and get much more appealing results than with a traditional curling iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present and she loves it.  This wand works very well, producing either tight or loose waves that stay in her hair all day.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I never do reviews, however i have to give my 2 cents about this. I have tried everything from flat iron, curling wands, curling irons and the hot rolls to curl my hair yet it never holds. I tried this once and had curls for two days. They are beautiful as well and can be tight or loose curls depending on how you use it. I have medium/shoulder length hair and it still works perfectly. Not sure about how it would do on long hair but it was exactly what it promised to be and worth every cent.</li>
    <li> When I received this product I was so excited to use it, however I was shocked to see that it did not come with a heat resistant glove, like most other similar products do. Needless to say, using the iron was a little tricky. Even after I was able to successfully use the iron, my curls became very tight spirals, not the natural curls I was promised. Overall I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the iron but I could not get this to work right. It made my hair look frizzy and almost curly but not quite.</li>
    <li> I am finding it a little difficult to hold and wrap my hair.  Also, there is no glove so if you hold the tip of your hair, you need to be careful.  Also, holding your hair makes the tip of your hair straight and not part of the curl.  I prefer to clip at the bottom and work my way to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it works, it works well, but a hard device for anyone with shoulder issues.</li>
    <li> I really like this! It&#x27;s fun to use once you get used to it, but it does take a bit of practice.  I have naturally wavy hair, and this is great to put in a few fast curls in a hurry that fit in with my natural waves- would highly recommend to girls who want to enhance natural waves!</li>
    <li> I love the type of wavy curls this iron makes. It heats up quickly and makes great curls. However, the clamp to hold the hair ends is too small and the covered tip is also too small. I have long hair six or so inches past shoulder length, so I need to hold the tip while rolling my hair around the iron. Because the tip is so small, I have burned my fingers several times. So it&#x27;s makes wonderful curls if you can put up with a few burned fingers. Then again, maybe you&#x27;re more coordinated than I am.</li>
    <li> I looked like an idiot when I used this on my hair. I have fine, blonde hair that is quite straight on it&#x27;s own. Therefore I am always curling my hair. I had hoped this would give me a nice, beachy wave, but it turned out kinky &amp; too uneven. I think it would probably be great on a talented, thick-haired creature, but not so much with this less-talented, fine-haired creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives - the curls are much more &#x27;organic&#x27; looking - they also held for a L O N G time. Which ended up as a con for me, because with my hair being so fine they were really tight &amp; crazy, ha! That being said - this went off to a friend with thick hair &amp; she has had better luck. I&#x27;ll stick to a regular wand with a larger barrel. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine.....if you have HOURS to wrap individual curls around &amp;#34;ONLY the narrow sections&amp;#34; of a blistering hot iron and then hold them in place till they set because the thing only has a one inch clip. After a shoulder cramp from holding the thing &amp;#34;upside down&amp;#34; not to mention multiple burns from hitting the element as I wrapped each curl...I decided at my age I wouldn&#x27;t live long enough to get all my hair done in one sitting! This product demonstrates why salons charge so much for &amp;#34;spiral&amp;#34; styles! The product itself is well made, but it is definitely not for the inexperienced.</li>
    <li> Good fast heating, holds curls well and gets done fast even for big chunks of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only if you sold a 220v version as well.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but wanted something that would give it a little extra wow with minimal effort, and this gets the job done. I have gotten so many more compliments on my (mostly) natural hair. I&#x27;ll never straighten my hair ever again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product! It works just as described! Love the temperature control and the clip so it is a step above a standard wand!</li>
    <li> This product is not that great. The instructions on how to use it were non existent. The product is difficult to use on yourself, maybe doing someone elses hair would be easier. Not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I did not like this waver it left weird dents in my hair. it looks ugly on short to medium hair!!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves to curl her hair in different styles.  This is so much easier than plain curlers. She was so pleased to get this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of girl who curls her hair every day; my hair is thin and stick-straight and doesn&#x27;t do much.  Usually I just blow dry it quickly in the mornings, but on special occasions I&#x27;ll take the time to curl it, using tons of hairspray to make the curls stay.  Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect of the Wave Creator.  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I was able to curl all of my long hair, and especially by how long the curl stayed!  I went out on a humid night, danced, and even put my hair up for a while, and by the end of the night my hair was still wavy and full.  I didn&#x27;t even use any hairspray, just a leave-in volumizing spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things about this curling iron is the variety of curls and looks you can do.  If you hold your hair tightly wound around the barrel, the curls are very small and a bit kinky, but if you just loosely wrap a larger piece of hair around it for a few seconds, the hair comes out beautifully wavy and subtle.  I can do my entire head of hair--which reaches almost all the way down my back--in about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never reach for my curlers or my curling iron anymore--the Wave Creator has taken their places!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what is describes. I love it, I just wish it had a wider barrel so I could do bigger curls</li>
    <li> HAVE TO SAY BASED ON THE REVIEWS i WAS EXCITED TO GET THIS PRODUCT - WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I THINK THIS STYLER WORKS WELL IF YOUR HAIR IS ONE LENGTH BUT IF YOU HAVE LONG ANGLED LAYERS LIKE I DO IT DID NOT WORK WELL AT ALL. HARD TO HANDLE AND TO GET HAIR TO WRAP AROUND AND LEAVES ENDS GOIMG EVERY WHICH WAY WITH A VERY UNFINISHED LOOK. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I BOUGHT THIS IN PLACE OF MY FIRST CHOICE A DUPLICATE REPLACEMENT OF A SPIRAL IRON I HAVE USED FOR YEARS AND HAVE HAD INCREDIBLE RESULTS WITH. THOUGHT I WOULD TRY SOMETHING NEW AND SAVE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY. GUESS IN THE END YOU GET WAHT YOU PAY FOR. GOING BACK TO MY OLD FAITHFUL STYLER AND ORDERING &#x27;S BACKUP ON LINE TODAY AS I SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD OF WASTING MTY MONEY ON THIS.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an iron that will make the perfect curls or waves, look no further! This product curls my hair better than my regular curling iron! With 10 different heat settings that heats up to 410 degrees in 30 seconds (or less), it&#x27;s amazing! The curls are tight and flawless and look fabulous when brushed through to get the perfect beach wave effect! I highly recommend this to anyone who has problems curling their hair or just looking for flawless curls or waves! I have issues curling my hair because the piece that&#x27;s supposed to hold your hair doesn&#x27;t for me because my hair is so thin and fine, but the hold when you wind your hair around this iron was impressive! Love love love!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others, but my wife likes it. Would recommend this to others. . .</li>
    <li> Just got my new wave stying tool I think I may have to wait aliitle while my hair is a little to short but it does make great waves my niece tried It and lOVED it and the waves in her hair look sooo nice can&#x27;t. Wait to try it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron doesn&#x27;t have enough reviews. I recently cut my hair, and the techniques I used to get the &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; curls weren&#x27;t working on my new length, so I invested in this since it was the best priced curling iron with the little clip feature which is what I wanted. I opened the box immediately and tried it out, my hair is super straight and a bit on the thick side, and it&#x27;s my first time using a wand style iron, and I LOVED it!!!! It heats quickly and the tip is cool to the touch, I found I get better curls by twisting it a bit to get all the way to the ends and better volume at top. I seriously am thinking of buying a second one to have as back up.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love it , you just wrap your hair around it and wind up with beautiful curls. I would highly recomended it.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I own. I have stick straight hair and this holds curls all day.</li>
    <li> My hair is usually impossible to hold a curl, but this curling iron gives my hair great curls &amp; I only have to hold it in my hair for a few seconds to curl each piece, so it is a breeze. My hair is about midway down my back &amp; it takes about 5 - 10 minutes to curl all my hair. I love that you can twist your hair through both the larger &amp; smaller parts of the barrel &amp; get different sized curls. Looks so natural.</li>
    <li> I am really, really not good at curling my own hair. I also have fine, stick straight hair. I found it easy to curl using this and that the curl lasted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an iron like this for the longest time. It makes perfect waves, even in thick hair. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it does. That said, the power button is in a place that almost guarantees you will accidentaly turn it off when you&#x27;re using it on your hair. I have to keep reminding myself to be careful not to grip it too hard or I&#x27;ll turn it off. They use an on off switch that is too easy to turn off during normal use.</li>
    <li> I use this curling iron almost every day and it is awesome! Gives natural looking waves that last all day.</li>
    <li> This works well if you don&#x27;t wrap hair too tightly and you use on only part of the hair or on super long hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has 3 layers and the shortest layer looked pretty bad with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me several tries to make the waves even close to consistent but when I take the time (don&#x27;t try it in the morning if you are in a hurry) it looks pretty good.  Wish the barrel were bigger for loose wave look not spiral wave look</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to curl my hair with this but I was disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought.  First of all, it was hard to curl the end of the hair because if you got your fingers too close they would get burned.  Second, it was ackward trying to get the hair to wrap around it so that it would curl right.  I can&#x27;t return it now cause I took it out of the package but I would have sent it back in a heart beat and go back to curlers.  Definately do not recommend unless you are a pro at curling hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product, recommended if you like curly hair. I use it on my remi wig. It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and the curls didn&#x27;t last and I&#x27;m scared to leave it on tooling and burn my hair, I&#x27;m p.rican I have thick and long hair not a good curler for me</li>
    <li> This particular curling wand is fast and easy to use and does not require a protective glove. I get compliments on my hair EVERY TIME I use this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old daughter.  She has very long, thick, fine straight hair and it does not hold a curl or a wave.  This wave iron, not only produces perfect waves, they also last for 2 days!  I would highly recommend this product to any one, whether or not they have difficult hair to  curl!</li>
    <li> Initially I wanted a wand but I am pleased with the product and look forward to using it to style my hair.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about this curling iron - sadly they do not make anymore. I spent $50 buying an extra in case my original one ($25) kinks out - makes really pretty wavy type curls. Heats up great and so easy to use. Wish goody would start making again!</li>
    <li> the product arrived in new condition as promised however due to the type of curling iron it is it is imperative that the instructions would be provided.I can not blame the seller because I may not have saw that there was no instructions when I read the condition of the item.Liked the curling iron but I went to target and looked on a box of a new one and then went home to try it again.it takes practice to use the iron and I recommend it to be included in a wardrobe of styling irons but not as a stand alone iron.I have fine straight hair and it took me about 20 minutes to get a  a soft spiral.I think it will curl better with practice and more time.</li>
    <li> Awesome wave creator, I highly recommend it! Gets very hot, I used heat setting 5-6 for best results. Style lasts for 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I love the curls i get from this wand. I love the small clamp at the base. It holds the curls well and works great with my long straight as straight can be hair. :)</li>
    <li> This worked phenomenally well for me.  I was eyeballing the $100+ curling barrels when this caught my eye.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this first; I had much better luck with it than I ever have with other curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and fine, but there is a ton of it.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well (and I live in Florida, which doesn&#x27;t help).  But I curled my hair with this and got lovely waves, instead of the curly-q look I absolutely hate from a lot of irons.  The best part is that the curls HELD.  I even napped on them, and got up hours later to go out, and they were still going strong.  (Full disclosure:  The styling products I used were the Pantene volumizing mousse, Garnier Moroccan oil, and then misted with L&#x27;Oreal Elnet hairspray before I curled.)  I got tons of compliments. which has never been the case when I curled my hair with other irons in the past.  I think it&#x27;s because my hair looked way more like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model instead of the limp, meh curls I&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little clamp (it&#x27;s about an inch long) is supposed to be used to clip the end of your strand while you wind it, but I don&#x27;t use it at all.  I might even remove it.  The very end of the barrel is a cool tip, so I just rest my fingertip there while my hair is curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said, this iron has earned a permanent spot in my arsenal!</li>
    <li> I really love this heatwave creator. Originally I found it at Target for nearly 100 dollars, the same model; however after going on Amazon in purchasing this one for almost 30 dollars with shipping and handling, I found that it truly works well I love the way that the waves are created in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 10 different levels of heat settings on the unit. I currently keep my set at six. Just be careful not to burn your fingers when you&#x27;re wrapping your hair around the barrel when creating the waves and curls.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and I really love it! I see most people wrap their hair around the barrel by hand but I have shorter hair and it&#x27;s easier to use the clamp at the bottom, like a normal curling iron. For this purpose I wish the clamp was a little bit longer and the cool tip at the other end was larger as well or else I&#x27;d give this a 5 star rating. My waves last all day with no product in my hair and they are so fun. Lots of volume and depth to my hairstyles.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. What more can I ask for? I have long curly hair so I use this after I straighten and it looks do effortless. The best thing is that this takes 10 min max and you look like you walked out of a salon. Worth a try for the price if you have long hair. My friend with shorter hair tried it and she wasn&#x27;t able to get it to work.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my 12 yr old granddaughter.  She loves it.....says it does a beautiful job on her long floing hair.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter have been using this. Here are their notes and observations on this product:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;It took them a while to get familiar enough with the device to make consistent curls.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Dont expect curls like in the product description images, but overall it gives a decent curl that lasts</li>
    <li> thank you so much for the umbrella i love butterflies thank you for helping my habit very happy can&#x27;t say enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair with about 6 different curling irons (2 regular barrel irons, the Instyler Rotating Curling Iron (it&#x27;s heavy so your arms will hurt after awhile), 2 clampless irons and my Chi flat iron) with ok results when I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I&#x27;m kind of a novice at curling my hair but this one actually created the loose beachy waves I was going for and didn&#x27;t take as long as the other irons I used.  I like that it has a clamp to hold the ends because when I was trying to use the clampless wands, I was constantly burning myself (didn&#x27;t use the heat gloves that came with the clampless irons because they felt weird).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wished that this came in a bigger barrel size hence the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This curling iron makes nice wavy hair. If your looking for a tight curl its not the one you want.</li>
