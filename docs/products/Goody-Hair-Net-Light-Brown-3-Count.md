### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for dance recitals or working in the food industry</li>
      <li>They are perfect for her to wear&lt;br /&gt;and protect her curls when she sleeps.</li>
      <li>These hair nets work great as a ballet bun cover.</li>
      <li>worked great for my daughters bun at her recital.</li>
      <li>I use these when I&#x27;m cooking, I like to make sure everything I cook is very good without any surprises.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more!</li>
      <li>I bought these for my daughter, who needs to keep her hair tidy as a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol.</li>
      <li>I love the product but the advertising is off.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found them.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re not ugly like most hairnets either.</li>
      <li>The mesh is really fine</li>
      <li>Turned out to be a blond color rather than light brown</li>
      <li>did the free return.  </li>
      <li>Also really cheap for that amount.</li>
      <li>you have to have a huge head for it not to fit.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stay on super well</li>
      <li>Would return the rest if it were worth the hassle of doing so.</li>
      <li>First of all I received 2 packs of 3.  </li>
      <li>I got this item on time &amp; though it was labeled as black on original package, inside was the light brown I ordered.</li>
      <li>We find them to be a quality product, and they last through a few uses, which is great.</li>
      <li>product itself is very flimsy.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really hold the hair up</li>
      <li>Secondly, they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>I need the same nets in bun size, but this is fine enough to work doubled and price is right.</li>
      <li>I am somewhat pleased with these new nets, but I feel they are not made as well as in the past.  </li>
      <li>They do last a long time and do not get holes easily . .</li>
      <li>I am not sure it will work for most people.</li>
      <li>Usually use 2 at a time for better hold.  </li>
      <li>My 88 year old mother has been searching everywhere for these.</li>
      <li>This net doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
      <li>not even worth half the price I paid for them.  </li>
      <li>The elastic seems too weak to to last for more than a couple of wearings.</li>
      <li>colors not true - light brown is actually dark blond - does not match my hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very delicate you don&#x27;t feel them on your hair. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is the color. I&#x27;ve ordered brown  color - they turned out to be blonde/beige color.</li>
    <li> My 88 year old mother has been searching everywhere for these. I am so glad I found them. They are perfect for her to wear&lt;br /&gt;and protect her curls when she sleeps.</li>
    <li> First of all I received 2 packs of 3.  Secondly, they don&#x27;t fit.  While reading the reviews I thought how can they be small. ..you have to have a huge head for it not to fit. But it didn&#x27;t.  I have long hair to my mid back and it did not fit at all.&lt;br /&gt;I did the free return.  Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you have a tiny head and very little hair.</li>
    <li> colors not true - light brown is actually dark blond - does not match my hair but so little money to return.</li>
    <li> the website and product label promise a &amp;#34;3 count - pack of 6&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Most people will understand that this is a pack of 6 individual containers, each containing 3 nets for a total of 18. Instead I got 2 containers each with 3 nets for a total of 6 nets only.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very flimsy. I am not sure it will work for most people.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the advertising is off. They made it seem like you were getting 3 packs of six when it reality you only get 3 total</li>
    <li> Just ordinary hairnets and do the job.  Usually use 2 at a time for better hold.  One doesn&#x27;t do it at bedtime.  They do last a long time and do not get holes easily . . I have none as yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair, these nets keep my hair in place while sleeping. I have a small head so I have to change the size by tying a knot at one end to make them work. Of course that is not a problem and it helps me remember which way it goes on my head with the knot in back.</li>
    <li> Way WAY too small,  unless you have the head size of a child.  Worthless!</li>
    <li> I ordered these hairnets because I have used the same brand and type in the past.  I am somewhat pleased with these new nets, but I feel they are not made as well as in the past.  The elastic seems too weak to to last for more than a couple of wearings.</li>
    <li> I use these when I&#x27;m cooking, I like to make sure everything I cook is very good without any surprises. Especially when I have guest over.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dance recitals or working in the food industry</li>
    <li> Extremely thin and flimsy.  Net simply came off while I was lying down.  Would return the rest if it were worth the hassle of doing so.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair net to hold my twists out of the way while I shower but still let the steam from the shower moisturize my hair. This net doesn&#x27;t really do the job. The mesh is really fine and it doesn&#x27;t really hold the hair up so it&#x27;s like wearing nothing.</li>
    <li> Turned out to be a blond color rather than light brown</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter, who needs to keep her hair tidy as a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol. We find them to be a quality product, and they last through a few uses, which is great.</li>
    <li> very flimsy, and does not fit my head.  not even worth half the price I paid for them.  never again.</li>
    <li> These hair nets work great as a ballet bun cover. Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> These are alright. They don&#x27;t stay on super well but they&#x27;re not ugly like most hairnets either. It doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing it but it&#x27;ll fall off then you won&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> They are not big enough for someone with a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I need the same nets in bun size, but this is fine enough to work doubled and price is right.</li>
    <li> I got this item on time &amp; though it was labeled as black on original package, inside was the light brown I ordered. Only problem was I expected 6 packs of three &amp; only got one pack of 3. When I wrote to Amazon regarding the guarantee, they refunded me 40% and gave an apology but I think my refund should have been for 5/6 of my purchase price, not 40%. Oh well, mistakes happen.</li>
    <li> worked great for my daughters bun at her recital.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stand in place at all...I have curly hair and wanted this to keep my hair in place when I lie down. No such luck!</li>
    <li> Must have for long hair!</li>
    <li> It is Thinner than I thought, but does the job well, could be reuse several times if you&#x27;re careful. Also really cheap for that amount.</li>
    <li> my hair is curly and medium long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when I wear this net it keeps my hair up off my neck (cooler)&lt;br /&gt;and keeps it from getting all tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks a little old fashioned. , , ,,  but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only needed two . . . but 3 packs of 6 &#x3D; 18. So I have shared them with my friends.</li>
