      <li>This product is just wonderful, it helps with my curly, baby fine hair more than anything else I have ever used!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like seaweed at the beach, but the good kind of smell, the rotten seaweed smell.</li>

      <li>i can&#x27;t believe its not the most popular product in the world.</li>
      <li>Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff......</li>
      <li>When you buy hair products with Keratin make sure its is NOT hydrolyzed.</li>
      <li>I mix it in with another better smelling conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain keratin.  </li>
      <li>My hair is more shiny, smooth, soft, and smells so good after using this product.</li>

      <li>It really leaves hair super soft and supple!</li>
      <li>It may just be me, because I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells...</li>
      <li>Do not pay big bucks at a salon for smooth.</li>
      <li>My hair is blond/wavy/frizzy and it tames it as much as anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I now alternate this conditioner with a moisturizing hair mask and my hair is now soft and strong.</li>
      <li>It does seem to make my hair feel strong, but not very moisturized.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I have used liquid keratin and it will not be the last.</li>
      <li>This condition is good in de-frizzing my hair, and you only need a little to condition short hair, so a bottle will last a long time .  </li>
      <li>I am nearsighted and the print is so small and light that I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the shampoo and the conditioner when I am in the shower unless I put my glasses on.</li>
      <li>I did leave it on about 30 minutes and my hair was extra soft and shiny</li>
      <li>As a Lady with curly hair, I am always on the lookout for a really smoothing conditioner that does not weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>For long lasting manageable hair....I can actually let my hair dry naturally without being self conscious. ...</li>

<li> only criticism, and it is a big one, is that the packaging uses gold lettering on a brown bottle and it is impossible to read when one is in the showerl  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll probably use it up but not sure if I will buy it again.    </li>
<li> It is actually very difficult to read when one is in broad daylight.</li>
<li> the bottle is tiny and so expensive :(</li>
<li> Not a good product!</li>
<li> It just robbed the wrong way.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it makes no difference for my hair at all.</li>

    <li> Great for my baby fine, wavy hair, but the smell literally makes me gag...I mix it in with another better smelling conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain keratin.  It may just be me, because I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells...I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for results though.</li>
    <li> Excellent product love all of their products</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great! It smells great and I can use it as a co-wash or a leave-in depending entirely on what I feel my hair needs.</li>
    <li> This product is just wonderful, it helps with my curly, baby fine hair more than anything else I have ever used!</li>
    <li> My hair is noticeably smoother and softer, and it smells good.  My hair is blond/wavy/frizzy and it tames it as much as anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Not a good product! Does not deliver as advertised</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The results were great, after 2 uses, left it in 15 min, my hair was smooth</li>
    <li> I like the product- it smells great and leaves your hair smooth. My dislikes are in the packaging. I am nearsighted and the print is so small and light that I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the shampoo and the conditioner when I am in the shower unless I put my glasses on. The bottle itself doesn&#x27;t feel right in your hand. It is too wide and pointy and doesn&#x27;t dispense well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times. It does seem to make my hair feel strong, but not very moisturized. I&#x27;ll probably use it up but not sure if I will buy it again.    Update: I&#x27;ve decided that I will continue to use this product. I now alternate this conditioner with a moisturizing hair mask and my hair is now soft and strong. I&#x27;ve also noticed a decrease in breakage.</li>
    <li> Hope they never stop making this stuff! It help with frizz and make hair lay nicely!&lt;br /&gt;Takes the puff out of my hair and adds such shine!</li>
    <li> This made my hair soft and smooth, but the smell. A lot of people liked it, but it literally turned my stomach. It just robbed the wrong way. It&#x27;s like seaweed at the beach, but the good kind of smell, the rotten seaweed smell. Salty and strange smell.</li>
    <li> As a Lady with curly hair, I am always on the lookout for a really smoothing conditioner that does not weigh my hair down.

    <li> This conditioner works well, good price</li>
    <li> AMAZING.  best hair product i have ever used, hands down, ever.  and my hair is notoriously problematic. no hairdresser has ever known what to do with my mop until someone passed this little gem along.  i can&#x27;t believe its not the most popular product in the world.</li>
    <li> This is a keratin product that will smooth the cuticle of the hair without irritating my scalp.  I use it a couple of times a week.  I have extremely wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> There is not much product in the bottle and I found it to be drying to my hair. The smell is not bad though.</li>
    <li> skip this- not worth the money spent</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell but it isn&#x27;t bad like some of the other reviews stated.  I did leave it on about 30 minutes and my hair was extra soft and shiny, I think it is def worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works great! Saved me $150 every 2 months</li>
    <li> As part of this line of products, this conditioner works perfectly without making my hair feel greasy and weighed down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any deep conditioner that works as well as this product. It really leaves hair super soft and supple!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff......the bottle is tiny and so expensive :( my hair is really long so I use a lot of it</li>
    <li> Awesome product and shipping/packaging was good.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have used liquid keratin and it will not be the last. This conditioner smells so so good! It also made my hair so shiny, I have gotten tons of compliments. My hair is more shiny, smooth, soft, and smells so good after using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product line! Do not pay big bucks at a salon for smooth. hair!! For long lasting manageable hair....I can actually let my hair dry naturally without being self conscious. ...</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the raving reviews. Unfortunately it makes no difference for my hair at all. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> Silky. smooth, shiny frizz free curls. Hair finally feels conditioned after trying everything. When you buy hair products with Keratin make sure its is NOT hydrolyzed. It won&#x27;t work the same.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good conditioner. However, it did not moisturize my hair as well as I would have expected it to, based on the advertising.</li>
