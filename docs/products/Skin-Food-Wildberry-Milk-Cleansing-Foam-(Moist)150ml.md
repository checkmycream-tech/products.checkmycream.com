      <li>I LOVE this cleanser!</li>
      <li>Discovered the product in South Korea and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent to it too!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The scent of this one is not berry scented like you would think, but kind of a citrusy floral.</li>
      <li>this cleanser lathers really nicely</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell all that great (not bad either) in the bottle, but once I had it lathered on my face</li>
      <li>I love love love this!</li>
      <li>Favorite face cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Lathers great and feels very creamy.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like berry, has more of a floral scent.  </li>
      <li>The quality of this cleanser is on par with some of the more pricier brands that you can buy from sephora.  </li>
      <li>leave a good clean feeling after use, really controls oils and leaves your face matte.</li>
      <li>This has a really perfect balance and isnt heavy.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a great product</li>
      <li>There were free samples included,</li>
      <li>Worth the wait!</li>
      <li>This is one of several washes I have tried from Skin Food and by far, this is the best one.</li>
      <li>And it gives my skin clean and thorough wash</li>
      <li>mild smell, just smells like soap.</li>
      <li>Both are great and can be used for all skin types but there are extra benefits to each one that might be better for specific people.</li>
      <li>My face feels so fresh even after quick cleansing.</li>
      <li>I really dont see a huge change or difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>It has a strange smell but works phenomenally!</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin and get rashes easy from products but have not had any issues with Skin Food items.</li>
      <li>Great price, the scent is a bit on the floral side, but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Very rich and does not dry your skin.  </li>
      <li>it foams up pretty well</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel clean and soft as well.</li>
      <li>my skin has been producing some oil (although my natural skin condition is super dry😓.)</li>
      <li>I was able to go about 10 mins without putting on my cream but not because my skin was dry, had to get my day going...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as moisturizing in my opinion as the egg white version, but it works out fine with a moisturizer for me.</li>
      <li>Several samples were included (and luckily, some of them were on my wishlist already!).</li>
      <li>I usually go straight for my cream because I can feel my skin drying up like a piece of leather.</li>
      <li>It cleans very well, almost too well.  </li>
      <li>It cleanses and lathers very well.</li>
      <li>it smelled very yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>I dont really know if this cleanser really does something</li>
      <li>My skin is clear and feels clean and soft after I use it.</li>
      <li>Love this product and other Skin Food products.</li>
      <li>It will lather up and create a true thick, creamy foam which leaves your skin very very clean but feeling very smoother and  moisturized as well.</li>
      <li>but it does leave me skin pretty soft.</li>
      <li>and it works pretty well to make my skin soft.</li>
      <li>My favorite face wash hands down.</li>
      <li>If you have DRY skin, this is FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>I can only recommend this to super oily skin but to anyone else look for something else.</li>
      <li>I am a big fun of Skin food products and this is very creamy and soft in the skin.</li>
      <li>This is good for ALL skin types but maybe an extra bonus with those who have sensitive skin or who struggle with dry skin but get breakouts with other moisturizing products.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way which is nice.</li>
      <li>It has help to clear up my cystic acne and minimize my scars.</li>
      <li>and my face becomes soft after using it.</li>
      <li>I have used other cleansers and finally decided to take the plunge and order something from Korea and it was worth it!</li>
      <li>It left me with the squeaky tight skin clean feeling.</li>
      <li>nice big amount of product will probably last me at least 6 months, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product, I use it daily.</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and refreshed without feeling tight and dry, which is amazing, as even &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers like Cetaphil dried my skin out to the point that it felt tight even with moisturzing (which I also switched to a Korean brand).</li>
      <li>Ok but not good enough for me to buy again.</li>
      <li>Pros: creates a thick and substantial foam with a pea sized amount + smells clean</li>

<li> my face was dry</li>
<li> Not for dry skin.</li>
<li> It was being shipped internationally and was going to take close to 40 days to arrive, it arrived in less than 20 days.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a non-irritating and thorough cleanser but is not kind to my mature skin.</li>
<li> I recommend, the only down side is that takes few weeks to arrive, if you don&#x27;t mind to wait.</li>
<li> I had high hopes for this cleanser, but unfortunately it dries my skin out a lot.</li>
<li> I ordered this on a saturday night and it literally got delivered in less than 24 hours!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a few Skinfood products and this Wildberry Milk Cleansing Foam is one of my favorites!</li>
<li> I think that the formula feels a lot like clearasil but without the hard to apply problem.</li>
<li> Very thick creamy lather, like shaving cream.</li>

    <li> Ok but not good enough for me to buy again.</li>
    <li> Favorite face cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. Great price, the scent is a bit on the floral side, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like berry, has more of a floral scent.  The quality of this cleanser is on par with some of the more pricier brands that you can buy from sephora.  Lathers great and feels very creamy.  It cleans very well, almost too well.  It left me with the squeaky tight skin clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Love it! I am a big fun of Skin food products and this is very creamy and soft in the skin. I recommend, the only down side is that takes few weeks to arrive, if you don&#x27;t mind to wait. Also, smells good!</li>
    <li> I love how it cleans my face! My face feels so fresh even after quick cleansing. I don&#x27;t even need to use makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This is one of several washes I have tried from Skin Food and by far, this is the best one. It&#x27;s a foaming milk pack which is different than their other foam washes without milk. You only need a tiny a amount on your hands. It will lather up and create a true thick, creamy foam which leaves your skin very very clean but feeling very smoother and  moisturized as well. This is good for ALL skin types but maybe an extra bonus with those who have sensitive skin or who struggle with dry skin but get breakouts with other moisturizing products. This has a really perfect balance and isnt heavy. Your skin will feel clean and soft as well. Recommend this one for everyone and also the Skin Food Aloe Vera Foaming Cleanser for people with acne-prone, oily or combo skin. Both are great and can be used for all skin types but there are extra benefits to each one that might be better for specific people.</li>
    <li> Not for dry skin. I like Skin Food but this one is misleading. Thought it would be moisturizing with milk and moist in the description, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a non-irritating and thorough cleanser but is not kind to my mature skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a saturday night and it literally got delivered in less than 24 hours! Amazon rocks! The product itself is what I expected, no less. I use it daily wothwith an exfoliating buff and it works pretty well to make my skin soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> Discovered the product in South Korea and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent to it too!</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash hands down. Love this product and other Skin Food products. My skin is clear and feels clean and soft after I use it. I also have very sensitive skin and get rashes easy from products but have not had any issues with Skin Food items.</li>
    <li> I received this product earlier than predicted. It was being shipped internationally and was going to take close to 40 days to arrive, it arrived in less than 20 days. There were free samples included, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A litte goes a long way! Very thick creamy lather, like shaving cream. No phony sulfate lather here folks! Didn&#x27;t smell all that great (not bad either) in the bottle, but once I had it lathered on my face it smelled very yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my face was dry i waited to see how my skin would feel. I usually go straight for my cream because I can feel my skin drying up like a piece of leather. I was able to go about 10 mins without putting on my cream but not because my skin was dry, had to get my day going... Overall it is a great product and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cleanser! It has help to clear up my cystic acne and minimize my scars. I have tan skin so they showed up alot. I love love love this! A little goes a long way which is nice. Great value. Would totally recommend it to friends and family and strangers!</li>
    <li> Very rich and does not dry your skin.  Only need a tiny portion (about size of watermelon seed).  Good for once a day cleansing for one year.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it.</li>
    <li> Pros: creates a thick and substantial foam with a pea sized amount + smells clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons: drying on the skin! since it&#x27;s summertime and I like in a humid environment my skin has been producing some oil (although my natural skin condition is super dry😓.) this cleanser lathers really nicely but when I wash it off my skin is totally stripped of moisture. my hand won&#x27;t glide over my cheek but instead catches and tugs it along (idk how to explain it.) I can only recommend this to super oily skin but to anyone else look for something else.</li>
    <li> If you have DRY skin, this is FANTASTIC. I have used other cleansers and finally decided to take the plunge and order something from Korea and it was worth it! My skin feels clean and refreshed without feeling tight and dry, which is amazing, as even &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers like Cetaphil dried my skin out to the point that it felt tight even with moisturzing (which I also switched to a Korean brand). Several samples were included (and luckily, some of them were on my wishlist already!). Worth the wait!</li>
    <li> It cleanses and lathers very well. Skinfood&#x27;s cleansers are my favorites. The scent of this one is not berry scented like you would think, but kind of a citrusy floral. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing in my opinion as the egg white version, but it works out fine with a moisturizer for me. The biggest thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin. I do like it.</li>
    <li> I dont really know if this cleanser really does something but it does leave me skin pretty soft. it foams up pretty well and I use it with my clarisonic. I really dont see a huge change or difference in my skin. I will keep using it until I use it up, but I probably will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> mild smell, just smells like soap. leave a good clean feeling after use, really controls oils and leaves your face matte. nice big amount of product will probably last me at least 6 months, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product, I use it daily.</li>
    <li> It has a strange smell but works phenomenally!</li>
