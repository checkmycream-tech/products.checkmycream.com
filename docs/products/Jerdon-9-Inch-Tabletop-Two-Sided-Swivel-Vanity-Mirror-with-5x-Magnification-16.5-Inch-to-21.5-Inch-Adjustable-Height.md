      <li>love these to replace those..good choice if you are considering</li>
      <li>Love this mirror.</li>
      <li>I am pleased.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I could raise the mirror neck</li>
      <li>I purchased this free standing mirror for the top of my vanity since I could not attach one to the wall.  </li>
      <li>I took it everywhere with me (easy dissembling).</li>
      <li>it is nice looking and has held up very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>I did not have any problems with it being wobbly or unsteady after I tightened the collar securely.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for something better; fits just right on my dressing table.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is just fine, good value for the money!</li>
      <li>When I unpacked it and put it together, I was so excited, I used it immediately.  </li>
      <li>The face of the mirror is large, so just make sure it fits in your space.  </li>
      <li>Since the diameter is so large, there is no distortion like on so many others.</li>
      <li>the stand rod a bit flimsy at full extension but overall good.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this as the perfect makeup and hair mirror as It is large enough to do your hair with it as well.</li>
      <li>It is well made, easy to adjust, and matches satin nickle hardware exactly.  </li>
      <li>really well ours is extended out completely and has been since we bought it 2 months maybe good product</li>
      <li>Nice stuff for my various hat events.</li>
      <li>I do think the mirror is pretty and the flip feature still works.</li>
      <li>I considered a mirror on a retractable scissors-style arm, but I am glad to have this one as the retractable ones are not nearly as solid or attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is unique in that the height of the mirror is completely adjustable.</li>
      <li>This mirror has a hefty base weight, good quality mirror, and an attractive nickel finish.  </li>
      <li>The only issue is the tightening device is not as good as it could be so you need to exert greater force on it than should be necessary, otherwise it does not hold the rod in place firmly.</li>
      <li>She really likes it.  </li>
      <li>After cataract surgeries very close vision was gone.</li>
      <li>This item was received as promised and works very well.</li>
      <li>I purchased the warehouse option because I simply didn&#x27;t believe in buying this mirror at its original value.</li>
      <li>Decent construction.</li>
      <li>Just had cataract surgery and couldn&#x27;t see anything, so I highly recommend this for everyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this mirror.  </li>
      <li>I got a little adventurous and used the magnified side...</li>
      <li>This mirror is large enough to see your whole face at 5x magnification.  </li>
      <li>Never having done that before, I was concerned that the product would have some flaw, but it is just like new</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have stated, you need to use the grip of a bodybuilder (mild exaggeration) to fasten the knob for the mirror height to keep it locked in.</li>
      <li>an additional note, the 5x magnification is just the right strength for those who have reached a certain age and don&#x27;t want to reach for their reading glasses every few minutes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is sturdily built and of good quality with a nice heavy base for stability.  </li>
      <li>if I really wanted to; it simply wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
      <li>Just the right height for me at the smallest adjustment with a little tilt, so may be too high for some short people as I am tall.</li>
      <li>I am 5&#x27;5\\&quot;, which is not an uncommon height for a woman, but finding a tall enough mirror on a stand for this purpose was nearly impossible.  </li>
      <li>I read the complaints regarding the difficulty keeping the mirror at its proper height, and yes, from the first seconds the neck of the mirror slid down.  </li>
      <li>It has a sturdy base and a beautiful brushed metallic finish which does not show fingerprint marks.</li>

<li> Not very sturdy.</li>

<li> Extremely flimsy mirror.</li>
<li> Set height and tighten and mirror still slides down.  </li>
<li> Heavy on bottom keeps from tipping.</li>
<li> I just bought this mirror and a few weeks past the return date the item broke at the place where the mirror is held on to the stand.</li>
<li> Built well, adjustable, reversable and takes up a small amount of space.</li>
<li> I was hesitant to buy this based on other reviewers&#x27; disappointment with it being wobbly.  </li>
<li> The reflection is clear and the magnifying is beyond frightening; but my bad; I bought the thing to torture myself--</li>
<li> it was scary time.</li>
<li> the screw that tightens the adjuster has stripped so the adjustability feature is now useless.</li>
<li> we work in a office and had bad mirrors that use to fall..</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> Very unhappy with mirror</li>

    <li> I purchased this free standing mirror for the top of my vanity since I could not attach one to the wall.  It extends perfectly to the desired height and is stable.  Good job Jerdon, my make-up application is flawless.</li>
    <li> functions as described. the stand rod a bit flimsy at full extension but overall good.</li>
    <li> It wobbles, but I still use t!</li>
    <li> I purchased the warehouse option because I simply didn&#x27;t believe in buying this mirror at its original value. As other reviewers have stated, you need to use the grip of a bodybuilder (mild exaggeration) to fasten the knob for the mirror height to keep it locked in. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great mirror! I took it everywhere with me (easy dissembling). I got a little adventurous and used the magnified side... it was scary time. Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. It&#x27;s a nice large 9 inch diameter and the height is adjustable, which is absolutely perfect for me. Just had cataract surgery and couldn&#x27;t see anything, so I highly recommend this for everyone. When I unpacked it and put it together, I was so excited, I used it immediately.  Since the diameter is so large, there is no distortion like on so many others. It&#x27;s a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully for me but I&#x27;m seated on a stool.  I read the complaints regarding the difficulty keeping the mirror at its proper height, and yes, from the first seconds the neck of the mirror slid down.  Still, as I mentioned the view was not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re standing or tall, this is probably not the mirror for you.  I&#x27;m seated at a tall countertop; I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;, the mirror is at it&#x27;s lowest point and it&#x27;s perfect.  The reflection is clear and the magnifying is beyond frightening; but my bad; I bought the thing to torture myself--it&#x27;s not the mirrors fault.  These should be against the law!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a clean view and a wide picture in which to apply your make-up, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  I&#x27;m sure I could raise the mirror neck if I really wanted to; it simply wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> we work in a office and had bad mirrors that use to fall..love these to replace those..good choice if you are considering</li>
    <li> Extremely flimsy mirror. Set height and tighten and mirror still slides down.  Very unhappy with mirror</li>
    <li> extension makes it the perfect height.  very happy with the purchase and would recommend it.  excellent price and quality.  aloha</li>
    <li> Nice stuff for my various hat events.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what I needed for applying makeup.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for something better; fits just right on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> The quality of both the regular mirror and the magnifying side are both excellent. The problem is that the &#x27;collar&#x27;  where you can adjust the height, does not hold properly and so the mirror is unstable and wobbly. I thought I had received a defective one and sent it back, but the next one was just the same. It&#x27;s too bad, because I&#x27;ve bought this brand of mirror before and have been 100% satisfied, but not  this time.    KS</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality mirror.  The mirror is excellent as well, no distortion.</li>
    <li> This mirror is large enough to see your whole face at 5x magnification.  It is well made, easy to adjust, and matches satin nickle hardware exactly.  I did not have any problems with it being wobbly or unsteady after I tightened the collar securely.</li>
    <li> After cataract surgeries very close vision was gone. This product corrected that issue. Built well, adjustable, reversable and takes up a small amount of space.</li>
    <li> very happy with this some people say want stay up it does stay up you just need to tighten nut really well ours is extended out completely and has been since we bought it 2 months maybe good product</li>
    <li> The only issue is the tightening device is not as good as it could be so you need to exert greater force on it than should be necessary, otherwise it does not hold the rod in place firmly. Other than that it is just fine, good value for the money!</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Heavy on bottom keeps from tipping.</li>
    <li> Took a chance and bought this for my wife.  She really likes it.  Good clarity.  Decent construction. Have to see how well it holds up.</li>
    <li> Very nice but came with a dent.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mirror. Just the right height for me at the smallest adjustment with a little tilt, so may be too high for some short people as I am tall. The magnified side is just fantastic, you can see more of your face than you ever wanted to see! I would highly recommend this as the perfect makeup and hair mirror as It is large enough to do your hair with it as well.</li>
    <li> I just bought this mirror and a few weeks past the return date the item broke at the place where the mirror is held on to the stand.</li>
    <li> Not very sturdy. Wobbles when I adjust it and the screw that tightens the adjuster has stripped so the adjustability feature is now useless. Very disappointing. I do think the mirror is pretty and the flip feature still works.</li>
    <li> This mirror has a hefty base weight, good quality mirror, and an attractive nickel finish.  But as other reviewers have stated, the only flaw becomes obvious when the mirror is extended to near maximum height and then keeps slipping down due to a weak grip by the tightening ring on the shaft.  Solution: wrap the thread with one or two layers of Teflon tape et voila, the extended shaft stays in place after tightening the ring.</li>
    <li> This product is unique in that the height of the mirror is completely adjustable. It has a sturdy base and a beautiful brushed metallic finish which does not show fingerprint marks. The mirror is of enviable clarity and rotates in both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no downsides to this product</li>
    <li> For years I had been looking for a mirror that would extend in height.  This is it!  The mirror glass appears to be of high quality, it is easy to put together, and the base is well-weighted.  Even my husband loves it.  The face of the mirror is large, so just make sure it fits in your space.  Highly recommend this mirror.  Great as a gift too!</li>
    <li> Worked Perfect and seems good quality.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Because I have the taller height vanity in my bathroom, I have trouble leaning in close enough to the wall mirror for makeup application and other close-up tasks.  This looks great on my counter top and, when extended to its full height, it is perfect for someone who stands for their grooming routine.  I am 5&#x27;5\\&quot;, which is not an uncommon height for a woman, but finding a tall enough mirror on a stand for this purpose was nearly impossible.  You would think that others would also have the same need.  I considered a mirror on a retractable scissors-style arm, but I am glad to have this one as the retractable ones are not nearly as solid or attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is sturdily built and of good quality with a nice heavy base for stability.  I am pleased.  I was hesitant to buy this based on other reviewers&#x27; disappointment with it being wobbly.  Mine is very slightly so (the reason I gave four stars instead of five), but when the adjustment cuff is tightened down adequately, it is not a problem, even when extended to its full height, which is how I leave it.  I purchased mine from Amazon through their \\&quot;open box warehouse deal\\&quot; for a substantial savings.  Never having done that before, I was concerned that the product would have some flaw, but it is just like new and I would purchase in this way again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an additional note, the 5x magnification is just the right strength for those who have reached a certain age and don&#x27;t want to reach for their reading glasses every few minutes.  Just be forewarned that you may see more than you bargained on!  &#x27;Nuff said!</li>
    <li> This item was received as promised and works very well.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a mirror.  I it is nice looking and has held up very well.</li>
    <li> it was just what I wanted  in a makeup mirror I would recomend this to any one that needs a close up mirror&lt;br /&gt; Jerdon Table Top Mirror</li>
