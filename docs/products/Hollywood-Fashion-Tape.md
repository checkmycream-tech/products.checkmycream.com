### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>While it worked perfectly, when I took it off after about 8 hours of use, it hurt and took some skin off.</li>
      <li>I bought this tape because of all the great reviews I had read about it.  </li>
      <li>Gotta love that!!</li>
      <li>It never slips, its strength is impeccable, and it stays even when you get sweaty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved these since I originally discovered them years ago.  </li>
      <li>I love this tape.  </li>
      <li>I love not having to worry about my bra or cami straps showing; these work like a charm.  </li>
      <li>It holds most of the time.  </li>
      <li>Some of my favorite clothes were fussy...</li>
      <li>I use this tape for all these things and more, can&#x27;t get dressed without it on many days.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you pull the tape off before washing your clothing.  </li>
      <li>I love this tape-</li>
      <li>It also is great to make sure the back of the bra isn&#x27;t showing on an evening out.  </li>
      <li>it was good for a quick fix for when my niece&#x27;s hem came off the stitch.....not so much for clothes to stay close to the skin.</li>
      <li>It holds securely all day without leaving any residue or mars in fabrics like a pin would.</li>
      <li>It keeps my lines clean and \\&quot;together,\\&quot; and the darling tin makes packing the tape easy.</li>
      <li>this stuff fantastic  </li>
      <li>These strips are fabulous.</li>
      <li>I purchased this primarily for use holding blouses together where buttons gape over the bust (though the rest of the blouse fits well).</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy and fast to use; I can put them in place under a minute!</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
      <li>so I rarely wore them.  </li>
      <li>You can never get any clothing to lay right with these.</li>
      <li>Love the little metal case they come in, it&#x27;s easy to pop in your purse to take</li>
      <li>I love it  in the summer when I don&#x27;t want my bra to show in certain tank tops and in the winter when my camisole is not being pulled up high enough.  </li>
      <li>I can use the tape to position my ta-tas in a certain dress, or undergarment.  </li>
      <li>they showed my bra straps or too much cleavage...</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this tape if you really want it to hold something in place.</li>
      <li>This tape really comes in handy - love it for my button down blouses that pull in some areas, tape is super easy to use and can be cut to different lengths for those areas that are smaller or just need a little closing.  </li>
      <li>strips are pretty long but you can easily cut them into smaller pieces - works well!</li>
      <li>Totally undetectable and kept a dress just exactly in place where I wanted it!  </li>
      <li>But you would need a few more to prevent wardrobe &amp;#34;malfunction&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Little canister it comes in makes it easy to carry with you.  </li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t even last walking across the street from where we got ready to the church.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re no longer relegated to the back of the closet thanks to HFT.  </li>
      <li>I wish I had anything like the success of the other reviewers on this page.</li>

<li> It holds my strapless dress in place over my VERY flat chest for an entire day without any issues.</li>
<li> should have known about this a long time ago</li>
<li> They stay in place and stick well to both skin (as long as you haven&#x27;t used lotion or anything like that) as well as fabric.  </li>
<li> Does your blouse gap open between buttons, bra strap won&#x27;t stay put, scarf keeps falling down, lost a hem and no time to mend it?  </li>
<li> I saved my cousin from embarresment at a wedding when her dress kept slipping</li>
<li> , I place it carefully, I don&#x27;t pull or tug once the tape is in place...</li>
<li> I find you can use  1/2 a piece of tape to hold the blouse gap closed.</li>
<li> this tape just doesn&#x27;t have the oomph required to hold a blouse closed against the forces of an average-size bustline.</li>
<li> I understood when the tape didn&#x27;t hold to my dress due to the length of the dress.  </li>
<li> My other brother who was also standing up had forgotten to get his pants hemmed so we decided to use the tape on the bottom of his pants.  </li>
<li> In some spots it pulls too tight, in other spots too lose.</li>
<li> If you have very sensitive skin be wary when buying this product.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a tape allergy, but it was a little tender removing the tape.</li>
<li> My friend also used this to stick an arc reactor to his chest for a Tony Stark Halloween costume, and this tape lasted ALL night!</li>
<li> No more dress slippage.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and have recommended it to friends and family!</li>
<li> I wore two small strips on my chest to hold a dress in place for a wedding.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s invisible, thin and flexible.</li>
<li> What a pain these annoying little strips are.</li>
<li> I always hate when bra straps show, or there is \\&quot;gap-age\\&quot; on lower cut tops.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Totally undetectable and kept a dress just exactly in place where I wanted it!  Saved me from worrying about tugging at it all night!!</li>
    <li> Used it once while out for the night.....doesn&#x27;t stick well.....ended up peeling all of them off</li>
    <li> I love not having to worry about my bra or cami straps showing; these work like a charm.  I have several friends and my daughter who are now using them based on my recommendation.  It&#x27;s easy and fast to use; I can put them in place under a minute!</li>
    <li> I bought this tape because of all the great reviews I had read about it.  I was standing up in my brother&#x27;s wedding and didn&#x27;t have enough to fill out the strapless dress.  I understood when the tape didn&#x27;t hold to my dress due to the length of the dress.  My other brother who was also standing up had forgotten to get his pants hemmed so we decided to use the tape on the bottom of his pants.  They didn&#x27;t even last walking across the street from where we got ready to the church.  I would not recommend this tape if you really want it to hold something in place.</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitive skin be wary when buying this product. I wore two small strips on my chest to hold a dress in place for a wedding. While it worked perfectly, when I took it off after about 8 hours of use, it hurt and took some skin off. I was left with a red rash in the shape of the tape for a week or so.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic  I recommended for all! I keep in my travel case at all times!  I saved my cousin from embarresment at a wedding when her dress kept slipping and her bra kept showing.  I whipped out my hollywood tape and saved the day. No more dress slippage.  At the end of the day you simply peel off the tape and throw away with damage done to your clothing!</li>
    <li> I always hate when bra straps show, or there is \\&quot;gap-age\\&quot; on lower cut tops.  In a pinch - Fashion Tape can even hem a garment!  It keeps my lines clean and \\&quot;together,\\&quot; and the darling tin makes packing the tape easy.</li>
    <li> it was good for a quick fix for when my niece&#x27;s hem came off the stitch.....not so much for clothes to stay close to the skin.</li>
    <li> This tape really comes in handy - love it for my button down blouses that pull in some areas, tape is super easy to use and can be cut to different lengths for those areas that are smaller or just need a little closing.  I&#x27;ve used it for a temporary hem on pants as well in a pinch.  Little canister it comes in makes it easy to carry with you.  Just make sure you pull the tape off before washing your clothing.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and have recommended it to friends and family!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved these since I originally discovered them years ago.  They stay in place and stick well to both skin (as long as you haven&#x27;t used lotion or anything like that) as well as fabric.  Some of my favorite clothes were fussy...they showed my bra straps or too much cleavage...so I rarely wore them.  They&#x27;re no longer relegated to the back of the closet thanks to HFT.  I carry some in my work tote, have them in my desk drawer and of course at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my bra straps show with some scoop neck tshirts.  I use the strips to stick the bra strap to the shirt.  It holds most of the time.  Now I don&#x27;t have to constantly check to see if my bra strap is showing or not!</li>
    <li> I love this tape.  I&#x27;ve tried others and this is the strongest and easiest one I have found.  I love it  in the summer when I don&#x27;t want my bra to show in certain tank tops and in the winter when my camisole is not being pulled up high enough.  I can use the tape to position my ta-tas in a certain dress, or undergarment.  It also is great to make sure the back of the bra isn&#x27;t showing on an evening out.  I would recommmend this to any woman or girl.  It&#x27;s like having a tailor in your house when you need them.</li>
    <li> You can never get any clothing to lay right with these. It looks so unnatural. In some spots it pulls too tight, in other spots too lose. What a pain these annoying little strips are.</li>
    <li> this stuff fantastic  should have known about this a long time ago</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second box, they last for ever. I find you can use  1/2 a piece of tape to hold the blouse gap closed.</li>
    <li> Does your blouse gap open between buttons, bra strap won&#x27;t stay put, scarf keeps falling down, lost a hem and no time to mend it?  I use this tape for all these things and more, can&#x27;t get dressed without it on many days.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it harming any type of fabric and it leaves no residue when I pull it off. It&#x27;s invisible, thin and flexible. I know there are others that are cheaper but I like this one so well I&#x27;m not going to try anything else.</li>
    <li> These strips are fabulous.</li>
    <li> I use this to temporarily \\&quot;hem\\&quot; my pants, hold up strapless dresses, and to hide bra straps. My friend also used this to stick an arc reactor to his chest for a Tony Stark Halloween costume, and this tape lasted ALL night! It never slips, its strength is impeccable, and it stays even when you get sweaty. Overall, I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
    <li> I wish I had anything like the success of the other reviewers on this page. I purchased this primarily for use holding blouses together where buttons gape over the bust (though the rest of the blouse fits well). I have been trying for years, but I have never found this product to work whatsoever for this purpose. I&#x27;ve tried using multiple strips of tape, I place it carefully, I don&#x27;t pull or tug once the tape is in place... this tape just doesn&#x27;t have the oomph required to hold a blouse closed against the forces of an average-size bustline. I will continue to hunt for a solution to this problem that actually works.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from flashing when I dont want to!! Gotta love that!!</li>
    <li> I love this tape- I use it quite often for gaps in between buttons. It holds securely all day without leaving any residue or mars in fabrics like a pin would.</li>
    <li> It holds my strapless dress in place over my VERY flat chest for an entire day without any issues. I do think the next time I use it I might apply a barrier product to my skin before. I don&#x27;t have a tape allergy, but it was a little tender removing the tape.</li>
    <li> Love the little metal case they come in, it&#x27;s easy to pop in your purse to take anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;The strips are pretty long but you can easily cut them into smaller pieces - works well!</li>
    <li> Will work well to hold up strapless anything. But you would need a few more to prevent wardrobe &amp;#34;malfunction&amp;#34;.</li>
