<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Info: 22, ghost pale, oily and congested/acne prone skin that is prone to dry patches. I apply a topical retinoid/anti-bacterial (Veltin) every night which is helping to clear up my skin, but does make my skin sensitive to most everything. Makeup tends to look patchy in dry spots and non-existent in oily spots. I also have a fair amount of acne scarring on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before ordering I hemmed and hawed over which version to go with, Gold or Pink. Seeking out zillions of reviews, I figured that Gold would probably be a better suitm due to the dry patches of skin I tend to have. I ordered this off of amazon but fearing a ripoff, I spent the extra money and bought it directly from the Skin 79 seller, so I know for sure it&#x27;s the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason I&#x27;m obsessed with this is the reason why lots of people have a hard time with BB creams: the color. I have the skin tone of Casper, and finding a light enough color is often impossible; MAC&#x27;s NW/NC15 are too dark for me. This color of this BB cream, however, is PERFECT. It has a slightly gray tint, but oxidizes and takes on my pinky skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply with my hands, letting the warmth melt the product into my skin. I just put a light layer on first, probably only half a pump, and then go back and use it as a concealer. No, it&#x27;s not full coverage, and no, it does not completely mask the spots, but it does conceal quite well. It makes my skin glow and look NATURALLY healthy, which is more than any foundation or tinted moisturizer has ever done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the skin care benefits, it&#x27;s a little hard to tell. I&#x27;ve been using this since January (five months) nearly every day. My skin felt smooth, and my acne has subsided. However, that could be attributed to the topical retinoid I use every night. BUT, I&#x27;ve gone the past three weeks without it and I have broken out here and there, so may it was helping more than I realized?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I think that it&#x27;s a bit strange that the VIP gold comes with a free sample of VIP gold. It seems silly to market a product that I&#x27;ve already bought. I&#x27;d rather have a sample of something new, perhaps Skin79 skincare. Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> Does cover redness but once it dries I scratch my nose or something and it comes off like flakey paint. Ew!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t completely tried it on my face (because I&#x27;m off to a work out in a bit) but I did work a tiny drop on my left thumb area and yes it looked grayish. BUT.....within a few minutes it blended with my skin color (olive over 50) and wow! It gives a slight sheen not highly noticeable but the area feels smooth although not greasy. Can&#x27;t wait to fully try. It also came with a pack of trial sizes. I will be paying close attention to the moisturizer one now.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I order this regularly.  On my last order, the pump action didn&#x27;t work well.  I contacted the company and they immediately sent a replacement.  Can&#x27;t ask for better service than that!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best BB cream products I have ever bought. The tone is good for people who have a fair to medium skin tone. It&#x27;s very light like lotion and keeps your face protected like sunscreen. If your in a rush or not a big make up fan, I would totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream in an attempt to streamline my make-up routine.  I am 40 years old, very fair-skinned, and always wear a moisturizer, and a separate sunscreen which usually made me oily, so I used a primer over that, then my make-up to cover some issues.  So when I heard about BB creams and the all-in-one claims, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived in 10 days - more than a week before I expected - and that was a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *love* the product packaging - the pump allows you to be very precise with how much product you dispense, and keeps air out.  This is a real plus because a little bit of this stuff goes a long way - I can cover my entire face with a pea-sized blob.  I estimate it will last at least 6 months, so the aseptic packaging is a real plus.  Also, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best to work in smaller amounts, as this stuff seems to \\&quot;set\\&quot; quickly and becomes harder to smooth out the longer it&#x27;s exposed to the air - so I take a tiny bit, do one cheek, another tiny bit, do the other cheek, and another bit for forehead/nose/chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It offers what I would call &#x27;medium&#x27; coverage, but still looks natural on my fair skin.  It&#x27;s very light in color, so I doubt anyone without fair to medium skin tone won&#x27;t look a little chalky.  It wears like armor - when I wash my face at the end of a 10 hour day, I am clearly removing this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 days, and already I&#x27;m noticing some fading of an acne scar along my jawline, that&#x27;s been there for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is the scent.  It&#x27;s not horrible, but I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t like added scent in anything I put on my face, so that&#x27;s something I always criticize.  However, given the fact that it works well and has replaced 4 products at an extremely low price, I&#x27;ll get over the smell!</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about BB creams for a few months now &amp; did my research. The newer ones sold in the US aren&#x27;t the real thing. A friend told me about Skin 79 and I chose this one according to my skin type &amp; shade, though it only comes in one color. It goes on so smoothly, there is a grey cast at first but it blends in beautifully to match my own skin. It has a beautiful but not overwhelming scent. I use a translucent finishing powder after but you don&#x27;t need to. I&#x27;m giving up my foundation, I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this BB cream. This one is for more anti aging. I recommend the Hot Pink jar for younger or combo/oily skin. This is for all skin types, but it works great on my mildly dry skin. You also need very little to cover your face, use your fingers to apply, no brushes or sponges. I purchased from Pink Gelee &amp; got great service!! Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> I keep stocked up on this product. Feels and looks so good on my skin.</li>
    <li> First I must specify that I have combination skin that tends towards the dry side and I live in a dry climate.  I hate wearing makeup and I don&#x27;t like using a lot of products on my skin because most products are too harsh and make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking that into consideration, here&#x27;s why I like this product.  It has everything I need all in one product.  It moisturizes my dry patches enough without making my oily patches look greasy.  It keeps my skin feeling nice and smooth and firm and protects it from the sun.  It provides just enough coverage like a makeup but does not look heavy, which makes it perfect for everyday use.  Yes, it&#x27;s not your special occasion (wedding, or date night) type of coverage or for major spot coverage (bad acne), but it blends in well and if you want to just put on a light coat, some mascara and a little blush, it&#x27;s perfect for everyday (or for work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found a product like this sooner.  I spent way too much money on a lot of expensive crap I didn&#x27;t need and didn&#x27;t use (either because it went bad, or I didn&#x27;t like the look/texture).  It only takes a little bit of this stuff and in 5 minutes I&#x27;m out the door.  Plus who doesn&#x27;t want to see an improvement in their skin?  I&#x27;m definitely buying more :)</li>
    <li> This BB is amazing. It makes your skin glow without giving it a whitish sheen. It oxidizes well and gives medium to full coverage. I threw away my foundation because of it. I threw away my concealer because of it too. I don&#x27;t even use powder to set it because you don&#x27;t need any. I use moisturizer under and I apply it with a kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> This was the thickest, nastiest most discusting product that I have ever tried.  Gave a gray cast to skin.  I threw the whole thing away after 1 application. It was like applying plaster.</li>
    <li> It is like a foundation. Plain and simple. My skin is rather dry and this stuff does not further dry it out, although it would be nice if it moisturized just a little bit more (even if I use primer or lotion). The most wonderful thing about it is that it is not \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; and it still disguises my freckles quite well. Also, there is no evidence that I am wearing it (i.e. you can&#x27;t see the diff in face and neck color) I have not noticed any whitening effects from it which is fine with me. The only thing about it that bothers me is that, for me anyways, it makes the wrinkles on my face noticeable and I don&#x27;t even really have any because I&#x27;m only 20. It actually LOOKS like it has dried out my face even though it does not feel like it-- which is why the wrinkles on my face show up. Even still, I love this stuff. I recommend it  :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product specially for Asian/ Oriental ladies. Not too fair, and great alternative to tinted moisturizer and foundation. Highly recommeded and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I needed light winter makeup that would also help with some of my skin troubles and not dry my skin out (I have combination skin). This BB cream does it all. It&#x27;s super nourishing and goes on nicely with a matte finish (which is really nice). I had a few dark spots on my face that are almost gone and I do not break out from using this product. The only thing I would worry about is the fact that it does contain \\&quot;whitening ingredients\\&quot; which you may not necessarily want.</li>
    <li> relized when i got it only had about 2 months left to use before expiration so lame! and the coverage is very light. not worth it</li>
    <li> I never tried a bb cream and thought I would never do so. The products reviews made me curious and so did the packaging. Once I received it I used it right away. At first it goes on a bit gray but don&#x27;t let this fool you. Once you blend it in the grey blends into your skin color. It brightens, hydrates and leaves your skin looking smooth and silky all day long. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Goodbye foundation. This is all you need.</li>
    <li> hi, this is the first time i used any product as fundation on my fice bcuz my skin tyb is T-zone so i used the combact foundation powder.  today i but this bb cream and my skin look waaaaw  , really i like it. Now i will use it as a suncream. I will try it for a week and we will see ^_^.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 3 star for one day used,</li>
    <li> every morning I won&#x27;t forget to use this bb cream ^_^  it brighten my skin and protected it from UV light.  I live in Indonesia, so it&#x27;s a big help.  the cream long lasted till night.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time deciding between the and the BB Pink.  I chose this because it isn&#x27;t as heavy and has a slightly darker tone.  I thought that would be better for summer.  You don&#x27;t need much and it does go on a little gray, but that goes away quickly and it looks like I have no make up on. Powder sticks to it well and it lasts all day.  My skin is soft, the tone looks even and it hides some of my lighter freckles. Other than a small breakout, I haven&#x27;t had any acne since I started using this in May.  I usually get a large pimple somewhere once ever few weeks.  I plan to purchase this again, but might get BB Pink for midwinter.</li>
    <li> This is the second Skin 79 bb cream I have purchased!  I used this for my dry areas, mixed with a drop of True Match N6 foundation to keep me from looking like I have a auto- immune disease, because it is very light in color, and it is seeming to work very well  I put a nourshing cream under it Astral, and wear a higher spf sunscreen, and it is so far doing good!</li>
    <li> I gave the product two stars. I had received the product about a month after purchase and it was in a small plastic package. I am very unhappy with this service because the bottle was completely smashed. Also, within the bag was a cute letter which I did appreciate, it seems that the sellers do care for customer service. However, I did not receive any samples as promised. Therefore, I deduct two stars.  I was able to salvage about 1/5 of the product and decided that to be fair to the sellers, I would review the product as well. The cream is thick in consistency and about a half shade lighter than I am when applied, along with a grey cast. This diminishes once blended. I like the bb cream however, I don&#x27;t think that the whitening agents promised really work. One more star deducted. Finally I do love how luxurious it feels and that I do feel my skin is protected. Since it will be sumer soon, I am planning on purchasing a new bb cream by Skin 79 (maybe the purple or orange bottle?) but I am unsure about this seller. I may give them one more chance, but if another bottle comes smashed, I will demand a refund.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second bottle of this bb cream and I really like it, the color it&#x27;s a little bit gray, I don&#x27;t recomend this product for dark or medium skin because it&#x27;s very light, it doesn&#x27;t have too much coverage but you can layer the product or use a good concelear on the spots or veins, perfect for every day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic and inexpensive. I&#x27;m on my second full sized bottle now. I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t really like makeup - I don&#x27;t normally even wear foundation - but I *love* this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly light skin (olive-toned, I&#x27;ve been told, but I can&#x27;t tell). This is a bit greyish when it goes on, but it lightens my skin and evens out my tone, which is nice since I&#x27;m not really a fan of the redness I can get. It&#x27;s got excellent coverage for my acne, without making it look like I&#x27;ve caked something on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face, moisturize, and then apply this. The only other thing I&#x27;ll use is eyeshadow and maybe mascara. I don&#x27;t bother with powder. If it looks a bit odd, give it a good half hour and look at it again. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real downside is that you don&#x27;t know when you&#x27;re running out since there&#x27;s no way for the bottle to indicate until it&#x27;s out - so if you like this, I&#x27;d suggest buying another bottle after about 2 or 3 months. Mine lasted me probably 5 or 6 months, I think, with gentle daily use. It&#x27;s hard to say how long it&#x27;ll last you. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seoulglamour is a fabulous seller!</li>
    <li> Love the product wrote a review althatbeauty.blogspot.com. I will be repurchasing. Great coverage medium and is build able. Can wear alone or with foundation. Love the amount of SPF</li>
    <li> I purchased this BB Cream about a year ago after amarixxe on YouTube recommended it. I have never been more happy with a beauty product! It goes on flawlessly, has really good coverage, and never looks cakey. I have extremely fair skin and often have difficulty finding products that match my skin tone so I was a little worried since before it&#x27;s blended this product is at least 5 shades too dark but it blends incredibly and adapts to pretty much any skin tone! It also lasts forever! I have used it almost every day for about a year now and I haven&#x27;t run out yet. I&#x27;ve compared it to a few brands commercially available in the US and nothing even comes close. Definitely one of the best BB creams on the market!</li>
    <li> I like the BB gold cream. Covers very well my blemishes and my uneven skin tone. I have dry skin so it moisturized it as well. Good for the winter time in my opinion and for women with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s excellent.  I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon. It met all my expectations, it&#x27;s better than foundation.</li>
    <li> I am a recent convert to BB Cream. I&#x27;ve tried most of the ones available in drugstores in America. I wanted to try the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; so I ordered this product after trying and loving the &amp;#34;pink bottle&amp;#34; Skin79 BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the consistency of this cream and how well it covers blemishes. I usually just wear the cream with out any other foundation or powder, and my oily face is shine free for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I think it makes me break out. I didn&#x27;t notice this with the other creams I&#x27;ve used. I think I am going to stick with the &amp;#34;pink bottle&amp;#34; Skin79 BB Cream</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned that it was white when I put it on, but after blending on my face, it is a great concealer.  Much better than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product.  Full coverege, your face looks healthy, not oily. I just love it.  It takes longer to get it , but totally worth the wait.  I have this gold one and a pink bottle one. Lasts forever since it&#x27;s more on the thick side,  buildible.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this BB cream. It offers a little more than light coverage, but not medium, which is great when my skin behaves. It does start off really gray looking, but adjusts within the length of my commute (15-30 minutes). When I started using BB creams years ago, I didn&#x27;t like this one as much because the coverage was light but the cream felt a bit thick and heavy. Now, I find that the heavier consistency offers a lot more hydration and the color doesn&#x27;t cling to the dry spots or crease where my skin is oilier. There is just one shade, so generally, those with lighter skin tones will find that this works with their skin. When I was  slightly tanner, it did make my skin look a little light, but when I mixed in a dab of concealer a shade darker than my skin tone, it matched perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Here are comparisons to other BB creams in terms of consistency, coverage, and color):&lt;br /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s pink label BB cream has a similar consistency, offers slightly less coverage, and has the same color option.&lt;br /&gt;Etude House&#x27;s precious mineral BB cream has a lighter consistency, offers slightly more coverage, and has 4 color options, closest is N02 Light Beige (I use W13 Natural Beige, which is a perfect match).&lt;br /&gt;Missha&#x27;s M Perfect Cover BB cream has a similar consistency, offers more coverage, and has 5 color options, closest is #21 Light Beige (I use #23 Natural Beige, which is still a tad light and is heavily scented!!).&lt;br /&gt;Skinfood&#x27;s Peach Sake BB cream has a much lighter consistency, offers similar coverage, and has 5 color options (I think, the website only shows 2 but I have #2 and #3), closest is #2 Natural Beige (I use a mix of #2 and 3 to get the perfect shade).&lt;br /&gt;Skinfood&#x27;s Mushroom BB cream has a similar consistency, offers more coverage, and has 2 color options, closest is #2 Natural Skin(I use #2 Natural Skin, which is still a bit light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just starting out with BB cream, have drier skin, and only need a light coverage, this isthe perfect BB cream for you! I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This one is more moisturizing than the pink BB cream from Skin 79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin so that does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that this BB cream is a bit too gray for my complexion. After about 30 minutes (sometimes an hour) it does oxidize and blend in better. I also use a finishing powder so it&#x27;s more matte and not so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the coverage is buildable but like I said I wish it wasn&#x27;t so gray.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite out of the Skin79 BB cream line (have a couple of others but not as nice as this one).  Love the packaging, decent coverage and very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> First of all I was surprised how fast I got here. At first I was worried about authenticity of this product because I have seen a lot of fake ones from other sellers on Amazon, but once I received the product I checked out the seal and the packaging and I can confirm it&#x27;s 100% authentic! I purchased this on a Monday and received it that following Friday, I paid for expedited shipping and it got here a lot faster than I expected. USPS sent me a email saying that it wouldn&#x27;t ship until that Thursday and wouldn&#x27;t get to me until 1 week and a half, I was upset at that because I did pay expediting shipping on it. Nevertheless it got here very quickly and I am quite pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product, the VIP Gold was a lot creamier and soft to smooth on. All I needed was one pump and it would give me a good amount of coverage. I have dry skin and this is pretty hydrating. When I opening the packing it had 2 thick green bubble wraps, so the product was extremely secure, good job! I will order from this seller again, possibly another type of BB Cream.</li>
    <li> I love love love this BB cream and can&#x27;t live without it. I ordered this through Authentic Skincare and i received it super fast!! Thanks again 😀</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent service and well priced! Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is great people with fair skin, otherwise, if you have a skin tone darker than light beige, you might want to reconsider purchasing this. My skin tone changes dramatically with the seasons. In the winter its obviously lighter and that&#x27;s when I love busting out my BB cream! It makes your skin look healthier and has a shine to it that makes it look like your skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> It blends in evenly with my skin tone, but it clogs my pores. A small hint of shine. Coverage is ok to almost medium. I think the hot pink one is more suitable to me and it&#x27;s less &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; but it clogs my pores too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time and it is magic!! It covers what it should cover! Does what it promises and more!</li>
    <li> This BB cream is shipped from China. It takes a little longer to get to the US.  I have a concern of getting body products that are expired.  I would like you to be sure to keep the box as it will show you a Manufacture date AND ALSO THE EXPIRATION DATE. THE BOTTLE OF BB CREAM  will only show the Manufacture date. this is confusing. take a permanent marker and mark your bottle as to the expiration date then throw out box if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has good coverage and it says \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; somewhere on the bottle. What happens is that it pumps out a shade of, gray-white-tan. When you start to apply it, it appears not to match your skin tone. As the Product warms to your skin temperature, the color will start to match and that \\&quot;off-shade\\&quot; goes away. I use it with a sponge applicator and pounce the sponge, not wiping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  when the pump squirts its last, you can dissemble the jar and scoop out the remaining. Try this, it works as there is still 4-5 applications left in there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Gentle Readers and Responders in the Review section, Please remember that Reviews are for the Product, first and foremost.

    <li> Best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried. Skin79 makes the best BB creams for asian complexions. Also love the BB bubble cleanser.</li>
    <li> I am currently trying out different Korean skin products. This had great reviews so I decided to try it.  The reviews were really accurate and it turned out to be exactly what had been described. I love it and will continue to use it.  It works way better than more expensive products.</li>
    <li> Acne, gone!!! Used Mary Kay for years, always struggled with acne along the chin and jaw line, used more makeup to cover up the acne, got more acne. This product has been a dream not having the fight the monster size pimples anymore. The coverage is decent, took a little getting used to the initial look, but once it set it was nice. Still have to use powder to cover the shiney look, but worth it. Only four stars because it doesn&#x27;t last all day and night, touch ups needed after work, but still a good overall product, can live with minor touch ups for not having the breakouts!</li>
    <li> Came in on time  and was packaged well. Product is nice , color doesn&#x27;t match exactly to my skin but i add in a bit of foundation.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty finding concealer and foundation that work, since I have skin that is both very pale and not at all pink in tone.  I bought this because I finally decided that at least the too pink problem could probably be avoided if I purchased products made in Asia.  I&#x27;m a skeptic by nature, so I expected this to function like a medium-weight foundation.  I use it daily, instead of moisturizer, concealer and foundation.  It has improved my skin tone, and reduced pinkness around my nose and fine lines around my eyes.  I could not be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle cream! It makes me skin look flawless. It has replaced my tinted moisturizer, primer, foundation, concealer and highlighter! Cuts down on 10 minutes of makeup time. It will not cover up anything really bad - like a huge pimple, but I only get those once in a while, and nothing covers them up anyways. It will take out the redness though. I normally have a very sallow ruddy complexion and this stuff makes my skin look absoloutely gorgeous. I got this one because it&#x27;s for dry skin- and mine is VERY dry, and this feels great on it. I still use a regular oil-free moisturizer underneath because my skin is so dry. Using a moisturizer underneath will give you a nice little bit of dewyness on your cheekbones- very youthful! I love this product and try to get all my friends to buy it now.  BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> I had heard good and bad about BB creams in general but I wanted to give this a try.  This product is great.  A little bit goes a long way and after applying it, patting it gently in the skin really gives it an even, polished look.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Made my skin so soft bright.  I have few broken capillarys on my face it covers it pretty well.  Just add a little more on those areas.  Plus no acne brake outs, so happy.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> ...and it&#x27;s amazing! It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused any problems. I love that it has SPF and my skin looks noticeably better since I&#x27;ve started using this! My skin tone is a medium and yes it does go on a little pale at first, but this is skin-matching, so you need to give it some time to oxidize and match you! Very build-able coverage and I always set this with a powder and it stays on all day. The seller was also extremely quick with shipping! Thanks :D</li>
    <li> blends well on my asian skin. however is not long lasting as my skin is oily even at my age of 59.needs to be reapplied or touched up with sheer powder. i am ordering the compact form though</li>
    <li> BB CREAM love these I bought several for I have given to my mom and my sister at my face as they ask me what using my beautiful skin  this BB CREAM contains snail babe  has many properties for the skin</li>
    <li> Better than expected... Really covered. Little grayish but difuses fine on skin, wash your face really well in the end it may bring pimples..</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my sister and she satisfied, having same skin color after use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for dry skin and hide the acne in case found&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it&#x27;s having SPF25 &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; and make the skin color as sane as</li>
    <li> as I expected it to be. I will order more. and I was able to give my sister the samples and now she wants to order her some.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s moistrerizing , but in the winter you should wear a moisturizer befor applying since it&#x27;s not enough. It makes my skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;Smells lovely.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from it because if I did, I was scared that I was going to be disappointed. I was impressed. It did everything that I expected it too, though I don&#x27;t know if I can give it credit it for whitening my face or not, because I also use other products such as facial masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does everything that it claims and the packaging is so cute x] It oxidizes really well and matches my skin perfectly (I&#x27;m considered kind of pale for an asian)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with light, dry skin, especially if you have that (annoying) yellow undertone like me :D</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, a few sun spots and no pimples or visible blemishes or scar that I need to cover up with foundation. I am looking for a product that BB cream claims to provides: nice coverage and even out skin tone and make skin looks radiant.  Between the Gold and the Red bottle, I believe the Gold bottle works best for my skin. It brightens up my skin and I looked radiant. The effect is long lasting well into the evening and my make up stays. I often receive compliments about my skin.  In comparison, the Red bottle BB cream is inadquate for coverage because I didn&#x27;t feel I have it on even I was a bit more heavy handed with it - they say it builds up but it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen to me.  It also melts away quickly in a few hours after application so my make up slides as a result. I don&#x27;t think the Red bottle is good for oily skin at all.  I would recommend you buy a few different ones to try on and compare in order to find the right one that works best for your skin.  We are all different and our skin changes over time too.  I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m chinese (light brown skin) and have really red cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using concealers for years to hide them but the makeup always left my skin looking and feeling not natural. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past month and my family and co workers have been telling me &amp;#34;your skin looks better without makeup&amp;#34;. Little do they know I am wearing makeup. I apply once in the morning right before work and my skin looks perfect by the time I get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shipping I used Seoul Glamour. Shipping was fast and product authentic.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed. I have combo/dry skin. I was hoping for a dewy/sheen effect but this cream failed to deliver. It feels a bit heavy on my face and the result looks more &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;. However, it does a pretty good job even out my skin tone, great on the pores. If your skin is on the dry side and flake easily, proceed with caution. This thing has an overwhelming cheap perfume smell to me. Maybe some find it okay.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream,but it&#x27;s no way it has 50 ml,maximum 10 maybe even less(((,but I buy again,because I just need it</li>
    <li> I liked the product for all of the 4 times i got to use it. I can&#x27;t believe how fast it is gone! I will definitely be asking for a refund! :(</li>
    <li> will buy it again in the future. It has great coverage and it helps smooth my skin making it feel as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything. Plus it lasts all day</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have always been very conscious of feeling like I had bad skin and would always wear a foundation with concealer for my dark circles, Very often I wore no other make up, but I always used concealer and foundation from my teen years on.. My skin is not actually bad, just not peaches and cream either. I love this. It does not settle into or highlight wrinkles like other foundations do, I am 58 so that is a big concern, I was excited about the mineral powders, but no joy there. So this was a great find. None of the national name brand BB creams are anything like it.. The Swiss or Swedish Lumeine? brand is the closest and the best next to this. But this is my favorite hands down. It won&#x27;t cover my dark eye circles so I still use concealer, the Laura Geller. But I don&#x27;t expect it to cover those. What it does do is make me seem more even toned and dewy in a good way, once in a while I powder over it, but I live in the Southeast, so there is very high humidity. I have never had a problem with packaging. It arrives in about a week in a half. The jar lasts a good amount of time, it is easy to pump out what you need. And it comes with other fun samples. I have been using it about 3 years now and have had not complaints at all.</li>
    <li> One of the best BB creams out there! I prefer the orange one only because it has a higher SPF.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by this product. I normally use L&#x27;Oreal BB cream and I tend to stay away from creams that have SPF in them because I find them too greasy. This cream is not heavy or greasy all, it gives a good medium coverage and blends well with my tan - red toned skin. When I first put it on, it looked like full coverage and about 5 shades too light for my skin. But as I rubbed it in, it left a semi-sheer coverage that matched my skin tone. I would order this again!</li>
    <li> This review is a comparison with the Hot Pink one.  I rubbed a bit of each on the back of my hand and a small portion on each side of my cheek.  Here are my comparison:  My skin type: Incredily fair with yellowish tone (I am Asian).  I have combination skin that is extremely sensitive.  I use cetaphil to cleanse my skin and cannot use store brands since I itch easily or get acne flare ups.  Hot Pink: applied lighter, seamless coverage  Gold: thicker slightly heavier coverage  Hot Pink: almost invisible, makes scars less visible, but less coverage on dark areas.  Gold: more coverage on dark areas, but seems to have a bit of a gray tone under yellow light, but it could just be that my complextion is too light for it  Hot Pink: non oily on my skin, very smooth texture  Gold: non oily on skin, sllightly thicker texture  Hot Pink: zero reaction, very gentle.  Gold: tingly on my skin but no red, less gentle I suppose.  Overall, if you are thinking of buying a Skin 79 BB cream, go for it because the product is really good.  However, I think Gold one is for medium tones and for people who have less sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are very fair like me, where Hot Pink is more suitable.  The seller, Pink Gelee sent me an authentic item.  It is newly made with high quality packaging, box and stamp.  They also sent me small samples!  Very happy with seller. I am not as pleased with gold one but I ordered Hot Pink from them since I know they can be trusted.  .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  After trying other brands that looked dull and dry this does give you a little glow and will blend in to your skin after a short time even though it looks a little light when first applied.  Having older skin (I&#x27;m 62) I like the way it gives a more even look and I think the skin lightening and wrinkle aspects even though it is not a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Goes on with a pasty color but auto corrects to your skin tone within a few seconds. Makeup and skin treatment in one!</li>
    <li> I first bought this BB cream as part of a Skin 79 BB Cream sample set, and I love it.  I am a redhead in her 40&#x27;s and have fair skin with cool undertones and some darker patches from sun damage.  This product does not provide full coverage.  What it does do, and does it very well I might add, is give your skin a more even tone.  A little bit of this goes a long way.  I used one of the sample tubes daily for about a month before I ran out.  While it does have SPF, I don&#x27;t really think that I apply it heavily enough to make it very effective that way.  I usually put on my toner, serum, moisturizer, super sunblock, and then the BB cream last.  So far I haven&#x27;t needed to set it, but that may change as the summer heats up.  I will say that it is the only tinted product that I have ever used on my face that hasn&#x27;t made me break out.  I am very happy with the product, and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really like the Super BB Gold. It comes out sort of grey and blends into your skin tone. I have pink undertones and always have trouble finding the right color foundation but this looks natural. It is lightweight and moisturizing. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage.  Great price.  This is so easy to use with fingertips or beauty blender.  I prefer the beauty blender to avoid some streaking, but if followed with powder then srteaking isn&#x27;t noticed at all Love Love love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to two years although i did not buy this bb cream from this seller previously. This is great for the dry winter months but definitely too moisturizing and oily for summer/tropical climates. I don&#x27;t even need any powder to set this. Light to medium coverage, but I use two layers with some concealer and i&#x27;m good to go. item arrived in heavily bubble wrapped-packaged, with a lovely note hand-signed by the seller. Very sweet and thoughtful of them!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! I&#x27;m so happy! The shipping was really fast and the product is really good. I have mild acne and really dry skin, so this is terrific. It has high SPF which I really like and it has great coverage. I use a little bit of Almay smartshade concealer with it. It&#x27;s nice and moisturizing, but it has slightly less coverage than the pink one. I like this one better, but I may use the pink during the summer. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is what I use in the summer and winter. It is my moisturizer and sometimes just my makeup. I usually use foundation over it tho if I go out. I am a older woman so I need to hide the sunspots and some wrinkles. I have tanned and abused my face and skin for so many years and this has made a huge difference the that year I have used it. My spots have almost disappeared and my wrinkles are smaller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a high end name BB Cream (Boscia) for a couple of years and wanted to try something that was slightly less expensive since people rave about how much better the Asian brands are. I did not find a miracle in a bottle as I do with my normal brand; the coverage was so-so, it felt and looked very oily on my skin (NOT in a great, dewy way as others have proclaimed-in a guuurrrrl you need to wash your face way), had a strong perfume smell and stung a little bit on my skin. I&#x27;ll try out the samples to see if any of the other products are better, but the smell alone would probably keep me from using the product on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This works best for someone with normal to dry skin as it can get a little oily over time. I set with a translucent powder and am good to go. Have repurchased several times.</li>
    <li> My bottle came without the authenticity sticker, so I&#x27;m anxious to put this on my face..... did everyone else&#x27;s come with the sticker on the bottle?</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, I read the feedback of other customers...and I found out that most of them were positive. When I received the BB Cream, I opened the package, not only has the cream in the box, but the seller also added several packets/sachets of other creams, which is good for me, because I always travel a lot, these packets are good for hand carry items in the airport. I was so excited that I immediately used it on my clean face. True to what the customers said.....it blended well on the face. I did not even have to use any concealer, the last step was using only my powder foundation. That&#x27;s it. Thank you for  this invention :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for one and half a year and I really like the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with its quality.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried BB cream and I love it! It takes a while for it to take the color of your skin but when its done then it looks like your skin is perfect. I would recommend it for those who have, like, medium to tan skin. I would suggest the oink one for those with fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;P.S&lt;br /&gt;Dont worry if its grey, it&#x27;ll change in a few seconds!</li>
    <li> I previously bought the hot pink bottle of skin79 bb cream. Loved it, was running out, went to reorder and found the gold bottle.  So, after reading a few reviews of this gold one, decided to give it a shot.  Most definitely \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; of coverage without being \\&quot;cakier\\&quot;, when in fact is exactly the same consistency.  (I did do a side-by-side comparison of the pink and gold.)  The setting time for the  cream to oxidize on the skin is the same.  When the cream has set, it leaves the face with that dewy effect that should be desired.</li>
    <li> as for coverage its ok...does it do what it claims i doubt it. i dont recommend it. the pump stop working about not even half way thru the product. its not very sanitize if u have to break the bottle open to use the thing</li>
    <li> Love this bb cream...</li>
    <li> this product i think does it&#x27;s job. it gives a semi matt look, and it&#x27;s not oily at all, at the end of the day, my skin looked great. you will have to blot a little of oil out though, but definitely a good product. it runs a little light so i don&#x27;t really recommend this for darker tones.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on my skin when I wear this BB cream.  I have tried other BB creams from the United States and they do not feel as good or cover as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that when you first put this on your face it doesn&#x27;t match and looks weird.  Give it 10 minutes to blend into your skin and then it looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type:&lt;br /&gt;Combination (more dry/normal than oily).&lt;br /&gt;Fair skin, but this BB cream still blends well when I get a natural tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Wow wow wow! I just got it yesterday and I used it right away and I really love it!</li>
    <li> SOOOOOO glad I read the reviews &amp; decided to take a chance on this BB creme! The shipping was VERY timely from Korea &amp; the product is great! Love it! They sent 2 different free samples too! I am a woman of \\&quot;mature\\&quot; years and this product fit the bill for my skin-type. I didn&#x27;t use any moisturiser underneath, the first time I tested it, &amp; my skin looked great! WITH moisturiser is even better! I applied a small amount of BB, a little blush &amp; some mineral veil &amp; I was ready to go! Easy &amp; good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is almost like a light clay and holds all day but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Great base for eye make up also.</li>
    <li> it covers blemishes well, but the color is a little too dark for my skin tone and so is the hot pink.&lt;br /&gt;I think I like the orange one the best.</li>
    <li> I was using the Skin79 Super Beblesh Balm BB Triple Functions BB cream (Pink) and liked it very much but it was more of a light coverage cream.  I was still needing to use my concealer more than I wanted to since I have lots of discoloration (dark spots) on my face.  I read the user reviews for the Gold Label and they said it was more of a medium coverage so I thought I would go ahead and give it a try.  I absolutely love it!!  It gives me the medium coverage that I need and goes on just as nicely as the pink label.  I hardly have to use any concealer now which is really great!  Like the Pink BB cream, it doesn&#x27;t come off when I sweat which is a huge plus for those with facial hyperhidrosis or if you sweat a lot while exercising or anytime.  It goes on very smoothly and I like more of a matte look so I use pressed powder over it.  It feels just as lightweight as the Pink BB cream when I&#x27;m wearing it.  I was worried that it might feel a little heavier and it doesn&#x27;t at all!  I purchased it from Pink Gelee and they shipped very quickly!  I&#x27;m so thankful for everyone who left a user review on this product letting me know that it was more of a medium coverage product!  I absolutely love it and it&#x27;s the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used hands down!  :)</li>
    <li> I am 50+ with sensitive, dry skin and I put this on with my moisturizer to thin it and by the time that it dries and sets the color disappears and it looks like I have perfect skin, but not like I am wearing any foundation.  My 16 year-old daughter with perfect skin has started using mine with moisturizer and it makes her look even better, if that is possible since she has no age spots, wrinkles or blemishes.  I think that this is the best way to use sunblock and to have a more finished look.  My daughter has normal skin with oily t- zone, but still needs the added moisturizer to thin out the rich BB cream to blend.  Her skin is a shade or two darker than mine, but the BB cream works for both of us.  Would purchase again and I hope that I am using authentic product as it seems to have all the right packaging, etc., that I had researched concerning the prolific business of BB cream fakes!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i got this in the mail! It works amazingly by making your skin look more youthful and clean. When you put it on make sure u dont just cover your whole face in it. Apply it to the back of your hand and dot it onto your face and then smear it in.. You only need like 1/2 a pump!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for at least two years, and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried. For the most part, you have to have a pink-undertoned light skin color for this to blend well. I am light-skinned but I have yellow-undertones, so sometimes, when the BB cream melts off, I look really....weird. Like, I have different shades on different parts of my face lol but the cream will stay on longer with a good pressed powder. and only apply a little amount of bb cream, for it goes a long way. i&#x27;m looking to try other bb creams because lately, this one makes my pores a bit more noticeable and it gets stuck in my pores.... ;; however, i am not discontent enough that i dont use it everyday... it gives me a dewy look and covers up decently. i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad but i&#x27;ve relied on it for so long so I can&#x27;t say anything horrible about it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews, but in this case I thought I would.  When I ordered  the Skin79 Super+ Beblesh Balm Bb Cream VIP Gold (Gold Label), I had no idea it was coming from Seoul, considering it arrived within 10 days, I think that&#x27;s pretty fast shipping.  When I first opened this I left the product on the bathroom counter as I didn&#x27;t have time to test it.  My niece got a hold of it and left a little smear of the BB cream of the outside of the bottle.  Later, I took this small amount and wiped it on the back of my hand to see the color - it was grayish-white and super thick.  I thought I&#x27;ll never be able to wear this, it&#x27;s way too light and wrote it off as lesson learned.  A few days later I was back on the Amazon website and started reading some of the reviews of this product and decided to give it a try.  First of all, one pump from the bottle is way too much, a little goes a long way.  It went on grayish white and didn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all.  But then as I started rubbing it in, it turned sheerer and didn&#x27;t look too bad and since I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, I decided to leave it on.  Later on when my girlfriend came over for a glass of wine, she asked me what I had done to my face, that my skin looked really great.  I went to the mirror and sure enough, the Bb cream had blended in and made my complexion look flawless.  I rubbed it in a little more along my jawline and have been wearing this as my foundation ever since. I get complemented on my skin every time I&#x27;ve worn this for the past week.  I use it with a little cream blush but don&#x27;t set it with powder as I don&#x27;t mind the dewy look.  This stuff really surprised me and the price can&#x27;t be beaten.  I ordered some for my sister to try along with a couple of other products to try as well all sold by SeoulGlamour.  The only down side of the experience is trying to figure out how their many Bb creams differ from one another because the product descriptions can be a bit confusing and unclear.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite BB cream. I have sensitive skin and there are chemicals that will cause me to have an allergic reaction. This doesn&#x27;t. It goes on well and lasts all day without having to touch up.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday after i moisturize and top with powder</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time now. I just like how natural this make my skin looks and still cover up the imperfection. Yes, it does go on grey looking. But if continue working and blending it into your skin it will no longer be grey. A littler goes a long way. It is a bit dewy. That is when I set it with translucent powder to set it in. My skin is very finiky. Since useing, my skin has been brighter, youthful, and my skin tone has even out. Also, I have not broken out. I use this item every other day. I need to let my skin breathe. It is still makeup. It will help with some imperfection. But you would still have to treat your skin, like you do normally after removing any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would is that I wish i didn&#x27;t have to work so hard to blend it into me skin. I would like it to be easy applied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 3 years now and just love how it makes my skin looks and feels. It is the best.</li>
    <li> This was the first BB cream I ever tried. I was complimented RIGHT AWAY! covers redness, pores and discoloration like it&#x27;s nothing! for convenience I tried several other brands after it including but not limited to Neutrogena, Aveeno, L&#x27;oreal, Rimmel, Garnier...None of them compare to this one. Yes, it only comes in one shade so it won&#x27;t work as well if you are paper white or very dark, but I would still encourage you to try it to improve your complexion and give your face a bit of a glow to it. Shipping takes a while, so I order before I run out. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The only makeup I will wear now. I mix it with St. Tropez wash-off bronzing gel (for face) to get a darker tint in the summer, but in the winter this is a perfect color. I&#x27;m a fair skinned caucasion with very red &amp; pink undertones, Rosacea, and uneven skin tone from acne, sun tanning, etc. I have horrible skin! But this stuff makes my skin look flawless ALL DAY and the color is amazing. I can&#x27;t say enough for it. This stuff cancels the red, events the color, provides SPF, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just a side note- I&#x27;m a snobby makeup guru that shops at Sephora and wears some of the world&#x27;s most expensive lines like Cle de Peau from Neiman Marcus and this stuff can&#x27;t touch anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I still use high end blush, mascara, etc.. but when it comes to foundation this is one product I can&#x27;t live without. THE BEST way to set this BB cream that I&#x27;ve found is with NARS Light Reflecting Pressed Setting Powder. It it divine! Just don&#x27;t wear this stuff out at night and take pictures using a flash, as the SPF in the BB cream will cause a white cast due to high levels of metal. This is your daylight foundation- and not for photos or studios.</li>
    <li> What a difference between Korean BB and American BB  creams!  I have tried numerous American BB and CC creams, this product is far superior, it works perfectly for my skin.  It goes on light, kind of a grey tone, as mentioned on the reviews.  But once it absorbs, it becomes invisible, but provides prefect coverage, even for hyperpigmentation and acne scars,  without feeling heavy or greasy.  My skin is fair, although I am Asian; I am  slightly dry, and I think this particular product is perfect for me!  Very happy, and in addition, my order arrived ahead of when I was expecting it.  It was in perfect condition and I am very very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of BB creams out there and this one fell flat. This leans more towards a tinted moisturizer than a BB cream. If you need coverage this isn&#x27;t for you. The color also oxidizes on my skin leaving me grey and sad. Literally and figuratively. Overall I&#x27;m disappointed with the product and will be going back to Missha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: Light&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: Barely any&lt;br /&gt;Color: Mostly for fair skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 3 stars because even if it didn&#x27;t work out for me, it might work for you. The product is legit and the shipment was fairly quick.</li>
    <li> I love both this and the Skin79 Pink bottle. I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in color or coverage; I buy them pretty much interchangeably. If I run completely out in between bottles for a while, my skin definitely can tell the difference. I wear this every day as my foundation - I will be a lifetime customer. I usually order from SeoulGlamour, which is a GREAT shipper, but their shop was down when I made this purchase. This shipper (Pink Gelee out of California) was great, as well. I was a little worried having it not come from Korea itself, but it was 100% authentic and as great as ever.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this product.  This may be it...  The perfect makeup I&#x27;ve been searching for!  I was a bit taken aback when I first put it on as it looks like a thick clay. I am very fair and it was extremely dark and tannish gray going onto my skin.  After reading the reviews, though, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and wait a bit.  However, I was skeptical because I have used similar foundations that were supposed to magically turn into your perfect color and that never happened.  But, I waited a few minutes and the color was truly exactly my shade of skin.  Amazing because I&#x27;m so tired of orangey foundations.  Not, only that... to get the coverage I desired I applied it fairly heavily (have to cover up some stubborn freckles) but it still looked like skin! It looks and feels just like perfect skin.  I can&#x27;t believe it!  Forget mineral powders... I will never mess with those ridiculously messy products again.  I am 100% sold on this stuff.  The finish is matte but not so matte that it looks like you&#x27;re wearing makeup.  It truly just looks like beautiful skin. It doesn&#x27;t sit in the lines like the mineral make ups I&#x27;ve tried either.  I cannot believe my search is over.  Just thrilled over this stuff!</li>
    <li> This bb cream is okay. I was previously using brtc jasmine water and decided to try this. I won&#x27;t be buying this again, I don&#x27;t like that it looks more grayish tone. It&#x27;s also slightly darker than my skin tone. The worst part is if I wear sunglasses, it leaves marks/lines on my face. WHAT? That makes me sad. The coverage is medium, it does its job. You can still see my freckles and dark spot though. The good part is I have dry skin and I feel moisturized with this more than my brtc brand. Shipping and packaging was delivered fast and solid so brownie points to that. On to my next bb cream adventures!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and I&#x27;ve never had break outs or any irritation because of this.  I am quite fair skinned (asian skin) and I admit it does make me look paler sometimes.  Like many reviews have mentioned, it does tend to settle in and the &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; effect fades away.  It is quite moisturizing and overall it has a nice light coverage - pretty good for girls who don&#x27;t like to wear too much make up.</li>
    <li> ...and I&#x27;ve tried other BB creams in between, but this is the one I come back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my (mature) skin, it gives the best coverage with the least amount of hassle. For weekend and casual days, I use it alone. For work or nights out, I combine it with a bit of liquid mineral foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own, it looks a bit grayish going on, but soon seems to settle into my natural color. I have a medium complexion with olive undertones. It is very thick and creamy and can fade rather quickly, especially in humid weather, but the addition of a bit of all-day liquid mineral makup gets me the benefit of the BB cream with a bit more longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the benefits? My skin glows! My pores disappear! It evens out the inevitable blotchiness that age and product sensitivites bring on. I love that it&#x27;s a multi-product: moisturizer, coverage, age defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really tell you why it&#x27;s better than the other BB creams I&#x27;ve used except to say that it just seems to be the right product for my skin. I would guess that everybody is going to have a different response to BB creams, but for my mature skin that needs light to medium coverage and that is usually ridiculously sensitive to cosmetics, this works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on reviews while I was on the hunt for the best bb cream for me.  I tried other american brands and had to return all but one.  I barely squeeze out 1/3 of a pump onto the back of my hand.  Then I dot it around my face and blend (either using hands or I use a stiff brush).  Give it about 5 minutes and the makeup melts into your skin leaving it feeling moisturized and dewy.  I do have dry skin so that is why I got this one because it says it is better for drier skin.  When I have a blemish - instead of using concealer -- I just dot and blend a little dab onto the blemish and it is better than covering with concealer.  The coverage is light, but enough to feel like you&#x27;ve got makeup on.  I love that it has SPF in it, too.  Great product and I will be purchasing this again, however, I think this bottle will last me quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am a very fair caucasian. I have wrinkly acne ridden ugly skin. This is the first foundation that has ever made me just look good. I don&#x27;t look like I am wearing foundation. It isn&#x27;t cakey. Pores disappear. I get a soft fresh dewy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loads of US companies are making BB creams now. But I am sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> Covers well, goes a long way, and lasts throughout the day! Makes my skin look great. This is the fourth time I have ordered this.</li>
    <li> This creme is so smooth and light.  It blurs my imperfections, and my skin is less flaky since I started wearing it (double bonus!).  I&#x27;ve had several people comment that my skin looks really nice - which has never happened before.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Skin79 Super+ Beblesh Balm Bb Cream VIP Gold (Gold Label) is seriously the best bb cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That being said, it does appear kind of grey-ish at first. A lot of bb creams do this - you just have to blend a little extra and let it set. After a minute or two of setting, it warms up and looks great. It isn&#x27;t going to apply the same way a foundation does; it applies more like a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like it is because it has great coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or too greasy. The pink label by skin 79 matches almost exactly if you&#x27;d like a dewier finish with less coverage. I like that I can wear it by itself; a lot of companies that make bb creams assume you only want it as a primer and therefore don&#x27;t make it with any coverage whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a paler shade of skin, and it&#x27;s always been hard for me to find a makeup that matches well. I hate the way regular foundation feels, so I usually try to go with a bb cream. Other bb creams I&#x27;ve tried either look too pale on me, or too orange. Orange label by Skin 79 was too dark, Oriental Gold by Skin 79 was too pale. Too Faced and Tarte (my two favorite brands) both only offer options that are either too light or too dark for me. I haven&#x27;t tried Dr. Jart or Smashbox yet, but honestly I liked this one enough that I really have no need to try those. The Gold Label by Skin 79 matches my skin tone perfectly, and that is nearly impossible to do for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend buying one of the sample packs from amazon if you want to try out bb cream for the first time. That&#x27;s how I was able to figure out that this one is my favorite. Also, I highly recommend a trip to Ulta or Sephora so you can try out some of the other brands as well. Sometimes finding the right shade for you will take a little extra research when it comes to bb cream, and it sucks to have a whole container of one that doesn&#x27;t match (I have more than my fair share of those, hahaha.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final tip: a little bit goes a long way with this product. Start small (like half a pump) and work your way up or you may end up with a lot of wasted makeup and/or too much on your face!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time reviewing this but I have bought it a couple times already. Its my favorite BB cream hands down. Love the pump, it keeps it sanitary. The cream is of a thick consistency and it glides on my face nicely. Great coverage for my acne scars. Have tried the Pink label and I like that as well. I don&#x27;t really need a full pump on my face but I will if my skin is especially bad that day. This BB cream is amazing.</li>
    <li> SKIN 79 puts out several different options for beauty balms at reasonable prices. My mom and I have always used the pink and the only thing we wish were different was the amount of coverage. Enter gold! The gold is for aging skin but offers more coverage than the pink. I have a lot of red pigmentation in my skin and my mom has older skin that just needs more help. This option works well for both of us, we love SKIN79 and wish they still had a North American website. I feel that we received authentic products but since we can&#x27;t order from a reputable North American supplier, we might never know!</li>
    <li> This product was better than I expected! My skin is clear, but I do have a little problem with uneven tones and dryness. After using this for 2 weeks, I noticed my skin looks more even and hydrated. I love this product and will deff be back to order more!!</li>
    <li> I am new to the BB creams or any type of make up that is more than a pressed powder. Since I was getting annoyed with my freckles/sun spots, I wanted to get something that will cover it up. I have never applied foundation myself nor have I ever owned one. So after all the research I made online, I went to Sephora to test these products out. It felt awful on my hand! I can only imagine that I would hate life if I used it everyday! I have used foundation, just never applied it myself. I asked someone in there for some advice and she suggested some BB creams. I tried them and didn&#x27;t know which one would be better for what I wanted out of it. So I went back online and did my research. After ALL the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I decided to take a chance on Skin79 brand. This was one of them that I bought and I love it! This is I think medium and not at all full, like what people have reviewed. In order to get Full coverage, you have to add a layer or until you are satisfied. In the beginning, it scared me. As my face looked really pale, however I did wait (after reading reviews on giving it time to oxidize), it blended on my skin. I then use the Skin79 skin all day sun powder after this and all I can say is WOW. It just makes my skin look like itself, but better. It still makes me oily, which is okay since I have oil blotting sheets. This also doesn&#x27;t make your pores noticeable unlike the Triple functions (orange) one. I think when spring/summer/sunnier days hit, I will have to probably add a higher spf sunscreen that I used to use. After 8+ hours of this, all I do is blot the excess oil and maybe use the sun powder again and I am good to go. I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does take some getting used to applying this. This is the first cosmetic item that own and use that is liquid based. Previous to this, I was only using pressed powders. I needed something with a bit more coverage, which is okay for sensitive skin (I have extremely sensitive skin), anti-aging and makes skin better. My dark spots/freckles seem to be lighter with this on. I really haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference without this on yet.</li>
    <li> Skin79 Super+ Beblesh Balm Bb Cream VIP Gold (Gold Label) it wes very Excellent proudect for face and safe to use</li>
