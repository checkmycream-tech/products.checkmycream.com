      <li>Light citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>The first clue I had that this product might be better than others</li>
      <li>and I was not disappointed at all.  </li>
      <li>Even this lotion has a coconut derived alcohol, but most lotions would burn very strongly in the cracks, this lotion only gave a very mild burn.  </li>
      <li>dont know how else to explain other then great.</li>
      <li>I am a diabetic with fair skin, also sensitive, and this cream gives fast soothing healing care.  </li>
      <li>glad that this product is available at Amazon.com; I was beginning to think that the bottle I have now would be a short, sweet dream once it was gone.</li>
      <li>Earth therapeutics whole line is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking every time I went there without success.</li>
      <li>I love this it worked great on my dry rough hands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affect on dry skin is amazing.  </li>
      <li>My hands have really started to show the difference after using other products and not in a good way.</li>
      <li>I let my co-workers use it and each time on the first time around</li>
      <li>and they keep coming back for more..</li>
      <li>I have been using other &#x27;top quality&#x27; lotions that are readily available without near the results I obtain with Earth Therapeutics hand remedy.</li>
      <li>It clears up my dry skin and keeps my nails healthy.</li>
      <li>This thing really helped my hands.</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t have a strong \\&quot;girly\\&quot; smell, but rather a slight hint of tangerine rind oil and that fades quickly.    </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>When used frequently it has really improved the appearance of my hands.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say this is the only cure, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>All natural ingredients, a nonperfumy scent, and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>was that the first ingredient might be water, but it&#x27;s water infused with tons of herbal extracts:  chamomile, comfrey root, echinacea root, fenugreek, garlic, lemon peel, propolis, sage, spirulina, white oak bark, and yarrow root.  </li>
      <li>She stated that she was surprised that it made a difference in the appearance of her hands as well.</li>
      <li>I smashed my finger in a door and my nail was completely ruined.</li>
      <li>I really cannot say enough about this product.</li>
      <li>are so soft and it doesnt leave my hands feeling greasy either..</li>
      <li>I gave this as part of a gift basket I made up for my 67 year old mother.</li>
      <li>Three days later, the cracks are almost gone, the red spots are a light pink, the rough spots are almost all gone.  </li>
      <li>I have used many lotions over the years and have settled on only a few that help:  plain old Vitamin D3 oil from the capsules, Dermarest salicylic acid lotion, sometimes Eucerin, and this Earth Therapeutics Hand Remedy.  </li>
      <li>But with kids, I ended up washing my hands and other things much more, so when the winter months came my hands have been itchy, with little clear fluid spots, irritated, red, raised rough spots with bleeding cracks around my finger segments.  </li>
      <li>Like the other reviewer&#x27;s it has really made my skin look so much younger and smoother, it is like a miracle.</li>

<li> /&gt;The reason I endorse it is because I battle psoriasis on my elbows, knees, and on a few fingers at a time (that pesky psoriasis decides what fingers at leisure, bastard disease...).  </li>
<li> I found this product at Ross a few months ago and bought it on a whim for $3.99.  </li>
<li> I got it at Ross a few years ago</li>
<li> Until a few years ago I had not given a thought of treating my hands at all.  </li>
<li> I expected a thicker lotion - this one is a little thin.</li>
<li> I used to pick this up at my local Kohl&#x27;s, but unfortunately they no longer carry it.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  </li>
<li> I have horses and my hands are constantly exposed to the cold weather when I do farm work.</li>
<li> I tried wearing gloves whenever possible and still my hands were painful.  </li>
<li> I know that I have been guilty of this as well.   </li>
<li> The crazy orange smell is just a plus.  </li>
<li> It was really painful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this hand cream. All natural ingredients, a nonperfumy scent, and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin. My only hand cream.</li>
    <li> My fingertips used to crack all the time. It was really painful. I just use this cream nightly and haven&#x27;t had the cracks in years.</li>
    <li> I love this it worked great on my dry rough hands. I tried other lotions and oils but I got the best result with this one and put moisturizing gloves at night.</li>
    <li> Until a few years ago I had not given a thought of treating my hands at all.  Just wash and go.  But with kids, I ended up washing my hands and other things much more, so when the winter months came my hands have been itchy, with little clear fluid spots, irritated, red, raised rough spots with bleeding cracks around my finger segments.  I tried wearing gloves whenever possible and still my hands were painful.  Even coated my hands with petroleum jelly at night with marginal improvement.  My wife found this lotion and within the first day of using it, my hands showed dramatic improvement.  Three days later, the cracks are almost gone, the red spots are a light pink, the rough spots are almost all gone.  I sure wish I had this lotion years ago!!    Even this lotion has a coconut derived alcohol, but most lotions would burn very strongly in the cracks, this lotion only gave a very mild burn.  I can&#x27;t say this is the only cure, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  I doesn&#x27;t have a strong \\&quot;girly\\&quot; smell, but rather a slight hint of tangerine rind oil and that fades quickly.    My wife bought the gloves too, but I didn&#x27;t need them.  A one to two pea size application after each time my hands got wet was all that I needed.  I don&#x27;t think any parent can religiously coat their hands every time after getting them wet, but it still has worked wonders.</li>

I have been using other &#x27;top quality&#x27; lotions that are readily available without near the results I obtain with Earth Therapeutics hand remedy. Like the other reviewer&#x27;s it has really made my skin look so much younger and smoother, it is like a miracle. I love the way this lotion makes my hands feel. When used frequently it has really improved the appearance of my hands. I read an article where a dermatologist said that we don&#x27;t moisturize our hands often enough. I know that I have been guilty of this as well.   I gave this as part of a gift basket I made up for my 67 year old mother. She stated that she was surprised that it made a difference in the appearance of her hands as well. She said at her age she didn&#x27;t think anything would help, but this product did.  I really cannot say enough about this product. Earth therapeutics whole line is fantastic. I have used the reflexology foot massage and foot peel on a regular basis as well. Again receiving fantastic results. I am planning to purchasing multiple tubes today so I do not have to worry about going without again.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well, not greasy.  Light citrus scent.  Feels great on feet and hands.</li>
    <li> This cream works well with the Earth Therapeutics gloves. I slather it on, then put the gloves on &amp; wear them overnight. It has a light citrus smell. I have horses and my hands are constantly exposed to the cold weather when I do farm work. The combination of the gloves and this cream keep my hands looking good.</li>
    <li> I recommend this skin conditioner for all over body dry areas.  I am a diabetic with fair skin, also sensitive, and this cream gives fast soothing healing care.  I am 72 yrs of age and have always had skin prone to dryness and sensitivity.  This is the better of all the creams I have tried.</li>
    <li> does what is says and smells good doing it. hands elbos and knees soft and perfect. dont know how else to explain other then great.</li>

Furthermore, methylparaben is listed way down in the ingredients list.  This product is not made of chemical fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I endorse it is because I battle psoriasis on my elbows, knees, and on a few fingers at a time (that pesky psoriasis decides what fingers at leisure, bastard disease...).  I have used many lotions over the years and have settled on only a few that help:  plain old Vitamin D3 oil from the capsules, Dermarest salicylic acid lotion, sometimes Eucerin, and this Earth Therapeutics Hand Remedy.  These are the only lotions that keep the scales to a minimum and reduce the cracking and flaking that accompany psoriasis.  The crazy orange smell is just a plus.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it is noticeable, and since I love oranges I don&#x27;t mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that this product is available at Amazon.com; I was beginning to think that the bottle I have now would be a short, sweet dream once it was gone.</li>
    <li> I expected a thicker lotion - this one is a little thin. I like Mary Kay nighttime emollient cream better</li>
    <li> I really like this hand cream--does not have a strong fragrance and am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> my daughter asked me to get this for her as a christmas stocking stuffer. she tried it at a friends house said it felt so nice. So, I thought I would get it for her and myself since I have very dry skin in winter. this works great. not greasy at all</li>
    <li> I have tried many hand lotions but this one is the BEST I have ever used my hands are so soft and it doesnt leave my hands feeling greasy either..I let my co-workers use it and each time on the first time around they ALL say OMG, this stuff is wonderful..and they keep coming back for more..so, it&#x27;s not just me, it&#x27;s really some great stuff.!!</li>
    <li> The comments on this product caused me to buy it and I was not disappointed at all.  This thing really helped my hands.</li>
    <li> I use this cream with Earth Therapeutics hand gloves for deep mosturizing and keeping my arthritic hands warm obn cold nights.  It&#x27;s affect on dry skin is amazing.  I also use on my feet and cover with a pair of socks before going to bed.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product the whole family loves it because it works great and smells good! I buy it for my husband every year for Christmas when he gets close to running out.</li>

I used this lotion everyday at least twice and within six months, my nail grew back normal.  It clears up my dry skin and keeps my nails healthy.</li>
