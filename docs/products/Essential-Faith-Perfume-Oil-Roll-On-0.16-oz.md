### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Leaked a great deal during the shipping process.</li>
      <li>SMELLS GREAT.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a good smelling oil for quite some time.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>so I feel I have to spread the love and pay it forward!</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this!</li>
      <li>My friend was wearing it and it smelled AMAZING on her.  </li>
      <li>Love this smell more than anything!  </li>
      <li>I love the way it smells</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
      <li>, after I had told her repeatedly how much I love that scent.</li>
      <li>I am ABSOLUTELY in LOVE with this scent.  </li>
      <li>i was very excited to find it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Although I will admit that the very creator of this amazing perfume oil scent is a friend of mine, this is not why I am writing this review.</li>
      <li>i first tried this at isla boutique in laguna beach and fell in love</li>
      <li>, I love its name, I love the tiny shells that come in the package, I love the compliments I get on it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll travel better, and will be more of a body spray than essential oil (just make sure to shake it up everytime before use).  </li>
      <li>I use a million perfumes and this is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not something i would have bought.</li>
      <li>Very curious because it smell great on my friend.</li>
      <li>This is a best kept secret .</li>
      <li>&quot; I even went for a manicure wearing it one time and the manicurist kept stopping midwork, and repeatedly said \\&quot;Wow, I just love that scent, I can&#x27;t get over it, it&#x27;s distracting\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I really liked this oil but third times a charm.</li>
      <li>Although this is the third time I have ordered and only when I order the very first time (many years ago) was I very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Great scent for both male and female.</li>
      <li>I love essential faith.  </li>
      <li>In the three day span that I wore this sample of Essential Faith, I never received more compliments on how well I smelled.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I have finally found my signature scent!  </li>
      <li>At least customer service was great</li>
      <li>My bottle lasted over a year and the scent was just as strong the last time as the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, but a week later, the smell completely gone from the bottle.</li>
      <li>It smells just a little different on everyone, but always has this warm, inviting scent that makes me smile.  </li>
      <li>Best fragrance ever and last forever despite how small it is!!!</li>
      <li>However, the last several times I&#x27;ve purchased it, the magic is gone.</li>
      <li>While Essential Faith is lovely, it is quite pricey especially for the size.</li>
      <li>But even with large gaps of time and ting new bottles, this scent no longer has the soft, but intense seduction it once did.</li>
      <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on name brand cologne filled with toxic chemicals and never received the response that I get when wearing this product.  </li>
      <li>Quality has dropped tremendously since I first purchased a few years ago.</li>
      <li>I have bought 3 so far!  </li>
      <li>One of those little spray bottles will be more than enough for even a month of jet setting.</li>
      <li>She gave me a bottle of Essential Faith as a birthday gift last September (she is an absolute sweetheart!)</li>
      <li>Apparently the fragrance does not work on everyone.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light and subtle.</li>
      <li>It is unique and subtle.</li>

<li> It is unique and subtle.</li>
<li> Watered down, fragrance does not even last for 30 minutes until it is completely gone.</li>
<li> It is a subtle scent that says alot ,I really should not divuldge</li>
<li> I guess this product has fallen victim to the ways of the world as well.</li>
<li> only down side I&#x27;ve found is that flying with it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> I only use a little bit and as soon as I walk into the room everyone can smell it.</li>
<li> It is a small bottle but because it is so concentrated, it will last a LONG time.</li>
<li> however, it doesn&#x27;t smell the same which is pretty disappointing.</li>
<li> Less money for 1/2 bottle and smells like EFaith with even a little extra kick.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.  </li>
<li> , I literally had ladies follow me down Santa Monica Blvd.</li>
<li> She even asked me to write down the name and website address so that she could buy it for herself.</li>
<li> If you (like me) find yourself needing this scent daily, just pop the roller ball off, and pour a few drops of the oil into a small spray bottle with a little water.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s over half gone already.</li>
<li> Bottle leaks a little though, so</li>
<li> The creator must have either sold out to a larger company who now only cares about the money or maybe I just received a bad batch?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too expensive for just tiny oil with no smell!</li>
<li> stop me and say &amp;quot;we&#x27;ve been tracking your scent for the past block and must know what it is.&amp;quot;  </li>
<li> I hardly use the bottle.</li>
<li> I would buy again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
<li> Being a man, I was skeptical to try this product.  </li>
<li> Hello, I&#x27;ve been buying this fragrance reluctantly after my go-to perfume became impossible to find.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s too bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance! It lasted me an entire year. I swear I will never use anything else. I only use a little bit and as soon as I walk into the room everyone can smell it. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I guess this product has fallen victim to the ways of the world as well. Quality has dropped tremendously since I first purchased a few years ago. Watered down, fragrance does not even last for 30 minutes until it is completely gone. Yet the price has somehow risen. The creator must have either sold out to a larger company who now only cares about the money or maybe I just received a bad batch? Although this is the third time I have ordered and only when I order the very first time (many years ago) was I very pleased with this product. That&#x27;s too bad. I really liked this oil but third times a charm.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but a week later, the smell completely gone from the bottle. I thought my nose become used to it so I asked my friends if they can smell but they don&#x27;t.  I hardly use the bottle. It&#x27;s too expensive for just tiny oil with no smell!</li>
    <li> Hello, I&#x27;ve been buying this fragrance reluctantly after my go-to perfume became impossible to find. But I just learned that my go-to is back so I feel I have to spread the love and pay it forward! While Essential Faith is lovely, it is quite pricey especially for the size. If you like this one, try to find Eden Fragrance to give it a shot. Less money for 1/2 bottle and smells like EFaith with even a little extra kick.</li>
    <li> Years ago I bought and *adored* this scent. So did others; I was constantly complimented. However, the last several times I&#x27;ve purchased it, the magic is gone. I contacted the company and they told me it was my olfactory senses. But even with large gaps of time and ting new bottles, this scent no longer has the soft, but intense seduction it once did.</li>
    <li> Apparently the fragrance does not work on everyone. I could not smell it on me nor could my husband. I returned it and the company sent me another bottle.  Still no smell.  Very curious because it smell great on my friend.</li>
    <li> Love this smell more than anything!  Bottle leaks a little though, so it&#x27;s over half gone already.</li>
    <li> i first tried this at isla boutique in laguna beach and fell in love but they were out of it, so i was very excited to find it on amazon. however, it doesn&#x27;t smell the same which is pretty disappointing. it&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not something i would have bought.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT. The smell reminds me of Hawaii.  I would buy again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Great scent for both male and female.</li>
    <li> Being a man, I was skeptical to try this product.  One of the sales reps let me have a sample.  I rubbed it on my arm and neck.  Then went on with my day.  In the three day span that I wore this sample of Essential Faith, I never received more compliments on how well I smelled.  Buddies were asking me if I had changed my detergent, I literally had ladies follow me down Santa Monica Blvd. stop me and say &amp;quot;we&#x27;ve been tracking your scent for the past block and must know what it is.&amp;quot;  I am not making these stories up.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on name brand cologne filled with toxic chemicals and never received the response that I get when wearing this product.  Trust-  You MUST have Essential Faith!</li>
    <li> It is a subtle scent that says alot ,I really should not divuldge This is a best kept secret .</li>
    <li> No scent detected, by me or by anyone else when I wore it. Leaked a great deal during the shipping process. At least customer service was great and I was refunded.</li>
    <li> I only wear this scent. It is unique and subtle. My bottle lasted over a year and the scent was just as strong the last time as the first time I used it. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good smelling oil for quite some time.  My friend was wearing it and it smelled AMAZING on her.  I decided to buy one from their website.  I have bought 3 so far!  I am ABSOLUTELY in LOVE with this scent.  I will never wear anything else. Every time I wear it, (which is every day) people come up to me and ask me what I am wearing. I am glad I have finally found my signature scent!  I will never wear anything else!</li>
    <li> Best fragrance ever and last forever despite how small it is!!!</li>
    <li> Although I will admit that the very creator of this amazing perfume oil scent is a friend of mine, this is not why I am writing this review. She gave me a bottle of Essential Faith as a birthday gift last September (she is an absolute sweetheart!), after I had told her repeatedly how much I love that scent. Every time she would walk into the room, I could smell it from several feet away, and it is truly intoxicating. Every time I wear it, people stop me and ask \\&quot;WHAT are you wearing? It&#x27;s amazing!\\&quot; I even went for a manicure wearing it one time and the manicurist kept stopping midwork, and repeatedly said \\&quot;Wow, I just love that scent, I can&#x27;t get over it, it&#x27;s distracting\\&quot;. She even asked me to write down the name and website address so that she could buy it for herself. If you want heads to turn as you walk by or enter a room, order this perfume oil! It is a small bottle but because it is so concentrated, it will last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I use a million perfumes and this is by far my favorite! I get tons of compliments when I wear it yet it&#x27;s light and subtle.</li>
    <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last.  Eventually doesn&#x27;t smell at all.  Not worth the money.  Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I love essential faith.  I love the way it smells, I love its name, I love the tiny shells that come in the package, I love the compliments I get on it.  It&#x27;s my favorite.  It smells just a little different on everyone, but always has this warm, inviting scent that makes me smile.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 2 years and when I pull on a scarf that smells like it, I still find myself nuzzling and sniffing it all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side I&#x27;ve found is that flying with it doesn&#x27;t work.  The roller ball doesn&#x27;t seal, so it leaks in the cap.  If you (like me) find yourself needing this scent daily, just pop the roller ball off, and pour a few drops of the oil into a small spray bottle with a little water.  It&#x27;ll travel better, and will be more of a body spray than essential oil (just make sure to shake it up everytime before use).  One of those little spray bottles will be more than enough for even a month of jet setting.</li>
