### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best flavor.</li>
      <li>I guess is the best way to describe it.  </li>
      <li>It may not be the BEST tasting mouthwash</li>
      <li>Seller was great too!</li>
      <li>Totally worth it!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great, things I say...</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>I understand if it&#x27;s whitening your teeth, it&#x27;s not gonna taste great, but this is unacceptable.</li>
      <li>Lol there must be a lot of hypochondriacs doing reviews....</li>
      <li>great product arrived on time  </li>
      <li>Great product, good results</li>
      <li>I noticed the Alcohol Free label on the front and thought it would be perfect for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even if it does whiten teeth, how could the side effects be any good for oral health?&lt;br /&gt;Skip</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the taste of whitening mouthwashes, but this one has almost a tangy flavor (not in a good way).</li>
      <li>but it smells really good</li>
      <li>ingredient that is causing people to be put in the hospital on IV&#x27;s (lol at that review) or spontaneous gum bleeding the likes of Niagara falls ha ha.  </li>
      <li>Surely, if the toothpaste is awesome, the mouthwash would be awesome as well, right?  </li>
      <li>, I experienced what felt more like</li>
      <li>I love this product, it works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m brushing more than ever now!</li>
      <li>Absolutely hilarious!</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t honestly say I see an improvement in the color of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>have to say that you can feel this product effectively working in your mouth.</li>
      <li>To each their own though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth were almost glowing when I smiled.</li>
      <li>Really a great Product, keeps the mouth fresh and does keep my teeth from showing coffee stains.  </li>
      <li>Seeing as taste is very important to me</li>
      <li>My favorite on this line is the toothbrush and whitening brush.</li>
      <li>Everything ok EXCEPT it kills your taste buds.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite mouthwash.</li>
      <li>so they assume that it doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t know better, I&#x27;d think this product had been tampered with and some poisonous chemical was added to the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE CREST 3D BETTER, JUST SAYING,</li>
      <li>and you sure can&#x27;t tell it.</li>
      <li>I have a healthy mouth</li>
      <li>purchased this mouth wash based on my hygienist’s recommendation as she lives by Colgate Optic White and claims that this is the best mouth wash and whitening agent ever.</li>
      <li>I JUST LOVE THE TOOTHPASTLE</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Now week 2 I feel as if I have my wisdom teeth in still located on my bottom and top jaws.</li>
      <li>For starters theres better whitening mouthwash out there.</li>
      <li>Love this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>refreshing after cleaning</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
      <li>I actually really enjoy the burn, because I feel like my mouth isn&#x27;t getting as clean otherwise, and it tastes really good.</li>
      <li>for a whitening mouthwash, it tastes pretty good, you can tell it has peroxide</li>
      <li>This stuff is really good, you just have to get through the first week of it, after that its smooth sailing.</li>
      <li>Also use Colgate Optic Cool Mild Mint toothpaste which is very refreshing and not too strong.</li>
      <li>To provide a fair point of reference, I&#x27;ve tried the whitening kiosks at the mall, where I experienced little to no discomfort.  </li>
      <li>The Colgate seems to clean and whiten better.  </li>
      <li>strong mouthwash</li>
      <li>/&gt; I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST USING THIS MOUTHWASH if you have&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used all 3 and been fine with those.  </li>
      <li>This product surely helps your teeth achieve a whiter shade, no doubt about it, but at day 3, I am not sure this product is the best option for teeth whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, as most of the other reviewers have stated the mouthwash isn&#x27;t the most pleasant tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and that is what is really important to me.</li>
      <li>Now she&#x27;s feeling so much better and has fresh breath too.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t use those words lightly.</li>
      <li>I think it honestly tastes really great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>IN CONCLUSION, STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF UNLESS YOU REALLY ENJOY PAIN AND</li>
      <li>bought this item just because its alcohol free...</li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t expect it to work as a good professional dentist whitening.</li>
      <li>Combine that with the feet flavoring, and I think that 3 stars is a fair rating given that it did end up delivering modest results.</li>
      <li>It is very powerful, BUT it whitens and cleans like</li>
      <li>The first time i used it i filled the cap all the way to the top.</li>
      <li>I made my wife try it after she bought it and wouldn&#x27;t use it, and the results were pretty hilarious.</li>
      <li>In terms of taste, this mouthwash is still not the first thing to come to mind when I want a tasty beverage, but then again, neither are most mouthwashes.  </li>
      <li>The first three days where okay i had no discomfort</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure that the 8 ulcers in my mouth are from this product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m never going to try it again....</li>
      <li>feeling really clean.  </li>
      <li>I have super sensitive teeth and can’t use most whitening stuff, but my teeth seem to love this one, and I’m hooked.</li>
      <li>One was that i wan&#x27;t sure how much to fill the cap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true though, you have to have balls for this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved my Colgate Optic White toothpaste.</li>
      <li>product is so sweet it hurts my teeth.</li>
      <li>There are no warnings anywhere on the bottle warning that this stuff is really strong at first.</li>
      <li>It does make my mouth feel clean and fresh</li>
      <li>, my mouth looks clean and fresh and I do believe my yearn are a shade or two whiter...</li>
      <li>I always do a quick water rinse after I&#x27;ve used it and</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s hurting them in the first place because most people can&#x27;t get through the first week of using this stuff</li>
      <li>This mouthwash is too strong for me to use straight.  </li>
      <li>I also wasn&#x27;t expecting an amazing taste for a whitening product that actually works anyway...</li>
      <li>But when I received this mouthwash complimentary from Influenster</li>
      <li>You will not feel minty fresh when you&#x27;re done using it.</li>
      <li>, I now know, it&#x27;s not always worth the savings.</li>
      <li>I detected distinct notes of mint, bleach, a dissolved penny, and athlete&#x27;s foot soaked in brine.    </li>
      <li>Be patient and learn how to use this powerful whitening product....</li>
      <li>i do not feel the side effects are worth it.</li>
      <li>this right</li>
      <li>Something just isn’t right here folks…</li>
      <li>The mint flavor overpowered me but it worked great for the first few days.</li>
      <li>sensitive teeth,&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive to strong mouthwash,&lt;br /&gt;Open</li>
      <li>It will most likely ends up in trash.</li>
      <li>At first this product seemed to do exactly what it was supposed to do - whiten my teeth.</li>
      <li>My tooth sensitivity is absolutely unbearable!</li>
      <li>I love the Optic White toothpaste from Colgate, so I decided to try the mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Well, this is exactly what this rinse did for my gums.</li>
      <li>OK so there&#x27;s alcoholic mouthwash that&#x27;s challenging because of its burn.  </li>
      <li>I would love this product if my food tasted the same.</li>
      <li>Because there is peroxide in the mouthwash, swishing only causes more foaming, and you will feel like gagging.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mouthwash is disgusting!!  It tastes like a mix of peroxide/aloe/bleach/sweaty socks and the sourness...gross!! I tried it 2x and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m never going to try it again....however, the optic white toothpaste tastes minty fresh!  Not sure where this rinse came from....nasty!!</li>
    <li> this mouthwash i got the small bottle TRUE TRUE as said it taste gross really REALLY bad it stays in your mouth gross its not FRESH as said it doesent taste like it smells but it smells really good but TASTE!! horrible! IT DOES WHITEN AND I JUST LOVE THE TOOTHPASTLE IT FOAMS UP AND THE MOTHWASH BURNS WORSER THAN really sorry about caps  any way anything! thankyou..</li>
    <li> Looking at the other reviews, I can only assume that it depends on the person. Everyone thinks it is disgusting, but some people can&#x27;t tolerate it. I made my wife try it after she bought it and wouldn&#x27;t use it, and the results were pretty hilarious. I said I think it&#x27;s about as bad as a fluoride rinse at the dentist, and her response was, \\&quot;I would rather do a fluoride rinse every day for the rest of my life than do that one more time.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to go ahead and finish the bottle (I&#x27;ve used it maybe 5 times in 2 weeks), but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again unless the whitening is extremely noticeable. DO NOT use this in place of your normal mouthwash--it&#x27;s for whitening, specifically. You will not feel minty fresh when you&#x27;re done using it. I can sleep after I use it, though, unlike my wife.</li>
    <li> This is the worst whitening rinses that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. DO NOT waste your money.  I ran out of Listerine&#x27;s Whitening rinse (which is MUCH better)and bought this one to try it out. Bad choice.  This one tastes awful and I wanted to be sure to warn other consumers before I pour my practically full bottle down the drain!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It was recommended my my dental hygienist.  Seller was great too!</li>
    <li> After a week of use..... Yes my teeth are whiter!!  The taste is horrible and it leaves a film in my mouth and makes my tongue foamy I have to brush it off.  My tongue on the edges are sore and it burns my tongue when swishing.  Although I do like my whiter teeth i do not feel the side effects are worth it. I am discontinuing use.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I was really motivated by the commercials for this &amp;#34;Optic White&amp;#34; mouthwash. I was a victim of the promise.  Maybe it does work, but seriously, this is NASTY stuff.  NASTY.  I would force myself to use it (white teeth&#x3D;life&#x27;s problems solved!), but then end up spitting it out short of ten seconds.  I hate that I bought a four pack and am stuck with two unopened bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a wimp with flavors, but this is gross. Hate.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so horrified by a product. Let me start by saying I brush and floss twice a day and get a checkup every 6 months. I have never had dental concerns other than slight yellowing, which is why I purchased this rinse on a whim at a local store. Had I read all the negative reviews beforehand, I would have tried something else. I didn&#x27;t have the pain others described, nor did I find the taste especially disgusting, so I was able to use the rinse for a full minute, but just once a day instead of the recommended two. After three days, I noticed slight gum sensitivity and a canker sore. I used it one more day before noticing a big problem. Without getting too gross, I brushed my teeth as usual one night and, to my dismay, my gums were bleeding - severely. I have NEVER had sensitive, bleeding gums before. After discontinuing the rinse, my gums returned to normal in a couple days. The rinse did slightly whiten my teeth in just the short time I was able to use it, but needless to say, the negligible whitening does not outweigh the problem it caused.</li>
    <li> This is the foulest tasting mouthwash I have ever tried. I have been trying to find an alternative to my Crest Pro - Health which I have used for some time, but am now concerned with the negative  comments regarding staining. I am really trying to fight staining on my teeth, and from the description this seemed to fill the bill. It may work, but the taste is disgusting. I gave it to my husband - asked him if he would like to use up my bottle of horrible mouthwash - it&#x27;s mouthwash, how bad can it be, he asked. Then he found out. He spent five minutes trying to rinse the taste away. Foul and disgusting - and I don&#x27;t use those words lightly.</li>
    <li> Lol there must be a lot of hypochondriacs doing reviews....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or people with a lot of bad teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply a whitening mothwash, yes it has peroxide and there is no &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; ingredient that is causing people to be put in the hospital on IV&#x27;s (lol at that review) or spontaneous gum bleeding the likes of Niagara falls ha ha.  Truly some crazy stuff people are posting on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for a whitening mouthwash, it tastes pretty good, you can tell it has peroxide so it does leave your teeth and mouth feeling really clean.  It does not taste as harsh as Listerine or some other &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; strong mouthwash Overall I like it, I will follow up in a few weeks if it whitens my teeth like it claims.  I am also using the optic white toothpaste as well which is also fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DID NOT cause my mouth to burst into flames upon contact, it DID NOT cause me to spew blood like an infected victim of the bubonic plague and I am still alive, able to post this review over 10 minutes later after using both products.  Therefore I am either a superhero from an alien planet brought here to save the universe or there are some people of &amp;#34;questionable&amp;#34; sanity posting some strange reviews with wild claims stating that the crest optic white line of tooth care products cause you to end up in the hospital on IV&#x27;s and have a mouth full of plague invested gums and teeth that bleed profusely and cause near death experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU DECIDE!</li>
    <li> At first this product seemed to do exactly what it was supposed to do - whiten my teeth. But after using it for just over a week I noticed my gums starting to bleed, becoming extremely sensitive, sore and swollen and my teeth were becoming very sensitive too. At the end of the second week any contact with crunchy foods or extremely hot foods nearly put me in agony. I decided to do some Internet research and discovered I was anything but alone with this problem. I found numerous, numerous reports submitted by people all across the country who encountered this exact same problem after using Colgate Optic White mouthwash. This product does in fact whiten teeth, but I, and from what reviews I&#x27;ve read on the Internet apparently many others, have found it to be exceedingly harsh to gums, teeth too and I for one could not possibly continue to use this product unless I wanted to continue to be in pain on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash. It has whitened my teeth, kept my breath fresher longer and did not dry out my mouth, which can be a cause of bad breath. It doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it which does dry the mouth. My mother is undergoing chemotherapy and had really bad halitosis. I gave her a bottle and now she doesn&#x27;t have any mouth odor at all. She also suffered very badly from dry mouth which even caused her lips to stick to her teeth. Now she&#x27;s feeling so much better and has fresh breath too. Don&#x27;t worry about the taste which is just a little different than other mouthwashes. I actually like it much better because it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my mouth as much as other mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase my mouthwash from Amazon but after seeing the ridiculous reviews on here I have to do one myself. The taste! I can&#x27;t believe how that is the reason this product has bad reviews. It&#x27;s really not that bad at all... I also wasn&#x27;t expecting an amazing taste for a whitening product that actually works anyway... Also the burning that people are experiencing is probably do to them having sensitive teeth or gums. In that case those people shouldn&#x27;t be using a harsh whitening agent anyway... Give this a try in the travel form and see if you like it before freaking out on here. I would definitely recommend this to anyone without an extemely sensitive mouth.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Colgate products but this is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so sweet it hurts my teeth. Even if it does whiten teeth, how could the side effects be any good for oral health?&lt;br /&gt;Skip this product, it hurts!!!!</li>
    <li> I admit, the first week of using this stuff is rough. It burns like hell, and shocks your tastebuds. But i still continued to use it. After that first week of using it the burning wasn&#x27;t so bad and it no longer effects my tastebuds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff did whiten my teeth about shades whiter, which is enough to make me satisfied. But don&#x27;t expect it to work as a good professional dentist whitening. This stuff is really good, you just have to get through the first week of it, after that its smooth sailing. haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star off because of two things. One was that i wan&#x27;t sure how much to fill the cap. The first time i used it i filled the cap all the way to the top. Boy was that a mistake, i swallowed half of it and the rest went all over the mirror. hahaha The next day i realized that there is a VERY faint line in the cap that you are supposed to fill it to. But that really isn&#x27;t a big deal so i would take off half a star for that. The other thing that i think could be improved is that this stuff is pretty harsh when you first use it. There are no warnings anywhere on the bottle warning that this stuff is really strong at first. I think that&#x27;s hurting them in the first place because most people can&#x27;t get through the first week of using this stuff so they assume that it doesn&#x27;t get any better. Oh well, i guess it separates the boys from the men eh? lol</li>
    <li> After I brush, I rinse with this mouthwash and it is so terrible that I need to brush again to get that taste out of my mouth. I&#x27;m brushing more than ever now!</li>
    <li> The other comments are quite hilarious, but I would take the comments with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think it works really well.  Yes, it has a taste to it- I would equate it to the taste of teeth whitening strips after removing them.  But bleach?  Far be it from me to judge, but if you have tasted bleach before I wouldn&#x27;t take your advice or recommendations anyways.  To each their own though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it works extremely well for me (especially when used with Optic White Toothpaste).  I had no burning or sensitivity issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I LOVE CREST 3D BETTER, JUST SAYING, THE TASTE IS JUST NOT FOR ME  BUT MY BOYFRIEND SEEMS TO LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> My favorite on this line is the toothbrush and whitening brush. The toothbrush has tons of bristles in the right places, making it easy to reach the back teeth. Plus a tongue cleaner as well. Then the whitening brush that comes with it, that slides into the toothbrush from the bottom, making it one piece holder. Just take it out when you need it, and put it back in. The whitening brush has formula in it, and just squeeze the tube and will go on the pen for rubbing on your teeth. I have super sensitive teeth and can’t use most whitening stuff, but my teeth seem to love this one, and I’m hooked. The toothpaste is express white platinum, for white teeth to help make your teeth look more white and help build it up. I didn’t notice a difference until like a month in, using it. The mouthwash, which is another teeth whitening stuff. The flavor is icy mint, and isn’t very strong in the mouth, and the taste isn’t to bad, and works great on my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> The product never burned my mouth but it did give me constant mouth soars, especially on my tongue (those little white things that look like zits) and it felt like the insides of my cheeks were deteriorating. I&#x27;d constantly spit out or remove pieces of what I believed were thin strips of skin. I stopped using after a week.</li>
    <li> Yes, as most of the other reviewers have stated the mouthwash isn&#x27;t the most pleasant tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been using it for awhile and I can see the whitening effects. I do think that the mouthwash is odd, possibly even unique in it&#x27;s flavoring. I believe this comes from the peroxide. However, it&#x27;s not terrible. And, weighing it&#x27;s pros and cons, I think I&#x27;d continue to use it. I think the taste of this honestly isn&#x27;t as bad as the burn of Listerine. I do like that I can see the fizzing of the mouthwash between my teeth cleaning away bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this one is a personal call. I don&#x27;t think that the taste is enough to kill the use of the product, as I can see the positive results in both whitening and cleaning.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to be working so far on my teeth but is painful on my gums and tongue. I have a healthy mouth and i decided to try this mouth wash. I did exactly what the instructions said and i only left it for 60 seconds in my mouth. The first three days where okay i had no discomfort but on the fourth day it was hell on my tongue . I did have a horrible burning sensation on my tongue and i think it hurt my gums because now when i brush my teeth my gums hurt to the touch and i can&#x27;t stand the feeling of the toothbrush against my gums. when i put it in my mouth it burnt my tongue it felt like i had acid on my tongue. I used this everyday but im going to use it every three days now. if your going to use it don&#x27;t use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. This stuff has a horrible taste</li>
    <li> I fail to understand all the bad reviews.  I have used this product for nearly two years.  My teeth are stain free, and I am a heavy coffee drinker.  This mouthwash should be placed in the mouth, no swishing, and patiently waiting for one minute. Because there is peroxide in the mouthwash, swishing only causes more foaming, and you will feel like gagging.  When you are finished, you will see the foam around your gums where stain normally accumulates.  Be patient and learn how to use this powerful whitening product....my teeth are as clean after 3 months as they were the day I had them professionally cleaned.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months and I can&#x27;t honestly say I see an improvement in the color of my teeth.  I guess, it gets rid of bad breath (at least no one has complained about mine).  The taste is not good.  Probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I apologize for being rude, but to me this mouthwash tastes like a bad experiment on the first day someone went to bartending school.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using this product and have noticed the difference in color, although its not a HUGE difference. It&#x27;s true though, you have to have balls for this product. It feels like someone is hammering your teeth, seriously its painful. At first i didn&#x27;t know how to react because this has never happened to me before, then I felt like my teeth were eventually going to disintegrate so i had to spit it out.  There should be a warning.. There isn&#x27;t. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> For starters theres better whitening mouthwash out there. Bad after taste, leaves a white residue throughout the mouth. Another thing i noticed was, after a couple of days of using this my teeth started hurting. It couldn&#x27;t be a problem with my teeth since a week before i started i had gone to dentist for checkup and cleaning. Just use the toothpaste and a different brand whitening wash like listerine. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> After using it twice in one day my bottom lip feels like it&#x27;s swelling.....I&#x27;m hoping it goes down but I am not using it again, not happy with this...</li>
    <li> Great product, good results</li>
    <li> Tried for one week despite the stinging .  It works, but it has left white spots and sores on my tongue. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me along with the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 4 days, and I do see the whitening change on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;But... It burns... It doesn&#x27;t burn like Listerine alcohol type burn.&lt;br /&gt;It burns like quietly and silently. Meaning after using it twice, I no longer can taste much of anything. 8am gargle, 1pm lunch, can&#x27;t taste the lunch.&lt;br /&gt;On the forth day, it continues it&#x27;s numbing effect on my tongue and I can now see the redness and the burning effect on the taste buds. I won&#x27;t continue using this. It will most likely ends up in trash.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great. I suffered no lesions, no blisters, no&lt;br /&gt;flesh eating diseases. Just white teeth. My dentist even noticed.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t taste like apple pie. It taste like you would expect an oral hygiene product to taste. Its for rinsing, not for drinking.</li>
    <li> I love the Optic White toothpaste from Colgate, so I decided to try the mouthwash. Gargling with this mouthwash made my gums raw, and if you have ANY cuts or sensitive markings in your gums-- just hang it up. We know how peroxide works: it eats away at openings in your skin. Well, this is exactly what this rinse did for my gums. It leaves white spots on the openings and makes it burn real bad. The same thing happened when I used Crest 3D White mouthwash, so it isn&#x27;t personally Colgate that has this problem. It&#x27;s overall any mouthwash that has hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash DOES whiten your teeth, but it&#x27;s the pain and sensitivity that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Please dont use this product. It causes Canker Sore.. It happened twice for me..My friend also complained the same.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item just because its alcohol free...But never again.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve never actually tasted bleach, but the aftertaste is horrible and smells like bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am a HUGE fan of Colgate Optic White toothpaste (by far my favorite), I was sorely disappointed when Colgate came out with this.  I have been using Crest 3D White rinse as part of my regimen, and I had high hopes for this based on the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that it is effective, possibly on the order of or even a hair better than the Crest 3D White in terms of cleaning/whitening, but the offensive taste is just not worth it.  Also, I feel it is stronger and can lead to a burning sensation if I rinse too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I will stick to Crest 3D White Glamorous White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I do NOT like Crest Pro-Health (clear blue bottle) or their Pro-Health Clinical.  I am pretty obsessed with dental care and try about everything and am surprised at how much of a difference there is between products.  I hope my experience helps you.</li>
    <li> I used this Colgate Optic White mouthwash twice daily, one minute each time.  Yes, it burns like hell.  Woke up two weeks later and my mouth felt fuzzy.  Looked in the mirror and my TONGUE WAS BLACK!  Looked on WebMD and said is caused by bad oral hygiene (not the case with me) and peroxide.  Will never use again.  Did this happen to anyone else?</li>
    <li> what can I say, amouth wash is a mouth wash. I don&#x27;t see ny teeth getting any whiter but they are 71 years old and really can&#x27;t expect much. It does make my mouth feel clean and fresh and that is what is really important to me.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different whitening mouthwashes and decided to try this one.  This one causes pain and sensitivity to the teeth.  All whitening mouthwashes will do this if you use them a lot, for example twice a day.  But this one seems to hurt every time I use it, even if that is only once a week.  Using it daily would be unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend alternative whitening mouthwashes by Crest, Listerine and Scope.  I have used all 3 and been fine with those.  But this Colgate one is no good.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is too strong for me to use straight.  I dilute it half and half with drinking water and still get a great whitening effect without the burning sensation.  Noticed whiter teeth within a week and they are continuing to lighten gradually.  Also use Colgate Optic Cool Mild Mint toothpaste which is very refreshing and not too strong.</li>
    <li> Not loving the taste, but I&#x27;m LOVING that, coupled with the optic white toothpaste, my teeth are looking much whiter!! A little stinging but no bleeding after days/nights. Totally worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved my Colgate Optic White toothpaste. But when I received this mouthwash complimentary from Influenster I had never tired it. It&#x27;s unlike any mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It doesn&#x27;t have the best flavor. (It sort of tastes like what white strips would taste like if they foamed up in your mouth.) But that being said, you only have to rinse with it for a minute and the way it foams up in your mouth is a sure sign that it is doing its job. I always do a quick water rinse after I&#x27;ve used it and the taste is gone. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks and have noticed my teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I noticed the Alcohol Free label on the front and thought it would be perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt; I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST USING THIS MOUTHWASH if you have&lt;br /&gt; sensitive teeth,&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive to strong mouthwash,&lt;br /&gt;Open sores,&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS- I AGREE WITH EVERYONE WHO SAYS IT TASTE AWFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are gargling with Hydrogen peroxide with this product. It is clear but foams white when u spit it out. JUST LIKE PURe PEROXIDE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;ve been using for 3 days and notice a difference, my mouth looks clean and fresh and I do believe my yearn are a shade or two whiter...so the product works for me and I will use the bottle up but will look elsewhere for a mouthwash brightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps I use sensodyne toothpaste with this product and a sensitive/extra soft colgate toothbrush. I use those products regardless of the mouthwash,</li>
    <li> I have always used Colgate over Crest toothpaste and mouthwash.  The Colgate seems to clean and whiten better.  This mouthwash WORKS!  It is very powerful, BUT it whitens and cleans like you just left the dentist office :)</li>
    <li> Another reviewer described the pain as a kick in the teeth- it&#x27;s more like a kick in the teeth while biting down on aluminum foil... My tooth sensitivity is absolutely unbearable! I actually tried to use it several times over a few months, each time hoping for a less painful outcome. The second this stuff touches my teeth, I have to spit it out and rinse with lukewarm water. Stick with the Listerine and natural whitening products. This stuff is scary.</li>
    <li> Just tried Colgate Optic White Mouthwash.  Everything ok EXCEPT it kills your taste buds.  Do not recommend if you like to taste food!  I&#x27;ve noticed other non-alcoholic mouth washes have same problem.  To bad because alcohol kills all bacteria in mouth-  good and bad.  What to do...</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my local store seeing that it was about two dollars cheaper than my long time favorite Listerine whitening mouthwash. The mint flavor overpowered me but it worked great for the first few days. My teeth were almost glowing when I smiled. Great, things I say...until two mornings ago I used the stuff and went on about my day. Breakfast tasted funny, lunch tasted crummy and dinner was so-so. Listerine taste always rinsed out after I brushed. Even my water tasted suspect. That stinging feeling is STILL with me! It&#x27;s awful! I think my tastebuds are dead. Seeing as taste is very important to me, I now know, it&#x27;s not always worth the savings.</li>
    <li> I tried this tonight for the first time. It tastes worse than what I imagine drinking bleach tastes like. It also burns immediately, as soon as you begin to use it. It is the most disgusting mouthwash I have ever used. Will be replacing it first thing tomorrow and dumping this straight down the sink. Nasty.</li>
    <li> All seriousness.. I have an amazing pain tolerance but this stuff has been super painful after one week of usage I notice my teeth getting a little sensitive to hot and cold things. I ignored it thinking it was nothing. Now week 2 I feel as if I have my wisdom teeth in still located on my bottom and top jaws. I have a dentist appointment tomorrow and have been told to discontinue the usage of this product. My cheeks are swollen, my gums are as well, and never in my life have my teeth been so sensitive to hot and cold things; such as the cool FL air..of which isn&#x27;t that cool. Everything hurts my teeth now it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> refreshing after cleaning</li>
    <li> Seriously this stuff is NASTY! I have used Crest&#x27;s whitening mouthwash before and even some generic stuff and none of it was this awful. I understand if it&#x27;s whitening your teeth, it&#x27;s not gonna taste great, but this is unacceptable. Literally DISGUSTING.</li>
    <li> *** PLEASE SEE UPDATES BELOW ***    I love the Colgate Optic White Toothpaste, and was uber-excited to see the mouthwash on sale at my local Walgreens.  Surely, if the toothpaste is awesome, the mouthwash would be awesome as well, right?  The answer, dear shopper, is an emphatic NO!    THE TASTE    As other reviewers have pointed out, the taste of this mouthwash is horrid.  I&#x27;m not a mouthwash connoisseur, but if I were, I would probably describe it as having a distinct minty-bleach bouquet that belies a sour palate.  I detected distinct notes of mint, bleach, a dissolved penny, and athlete&#x27;s foot soaked in brine.    THE AGONY    I did not experience a burning sensation as some other reviewers did - instead, I experienced what felt more like (I imagine) getting kicked in the teeth by Chuck Norris.  The pain was immediate - as soon as I made the grevious error of putting this stuff in my mouth, my teeth were in near unbearable pain - like getting a nail hammered through my teeth.  Of course, rather than spitting it out like a sane person, I pulled up my big-boy pants and toughed through the pain in the name of vanity.  I figured that perhaps the pain would subside if I let this awful substance kill all the nerves in my mouth.  My theory, turned out to be incorrect - I made it through about 30 seconds of gingerly swishing it around in my mouth before I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.    I know what you&#x27;re thinking - \\&quot;this guy just has wussy teeth.\\&quot;  Maybe so, but I don&#x27;t typically experience tooth sensitivity on a day to day basis.  To provide a fair point of reference, I&#x27;ve tried the whitening kiosks at the mall, where I experienced little to no discomfort.  Likewise, I&#x27;ve also used Crest 3D Whitestrips \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; and suffered little ill-effects (though there was some intermittent and minor aching and sensitivity approaching 20ish minutes).  Still, neither of those experiences was anything like the instant and intense pain I got with the Optic White Mouthwash.SECOND TRY    Just because I&#x27;m extra \\&quot;smart\\&quot; I figured that I would try it again the next day (just in case I was having a bad day for tooth sensitivity) - I was greeted by the same blinding pain; this time, it was even worse.  My \\&quot;be a man\\&quot; and \\&quot;tough it out\\&quot; mantra lasted all of two swishes before I had to spit this stuff out.    IN CONCLUSION, STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF UNLESS YOU REALLY ENJOY PAIN AND THE TASTE OF SWEATY SOCKS!    *** UPDATE 09/02/2014 ***  So, like any mature adult, I like to occasionally take selfies on other people&#x27;s phones while making monster faces.  In doing so, I was shocked to discover that the back of my teeth were yellower than the front.  Thoroughly grossed out, I reluctantly decided to give this mouthwash another try.     I may be a jerk given the harshness of my initial review, but I&#x27;m a fair jerk in that I&#x27;m back to provide an update after giving this product another chance. Long story short, the painful Chuck Norris sensations did not occur this time around, and I&#x27;ve been using the mouthwash for a couple of weeks now.  As far as effectiveness, my teeth do seem a little whiter, though not to the same extent as whitening strips. In terms of taste, this mouthwash is still not the first thing to come to mind when I want a tasty beverage, but then again, neither are most mouthwashes.  The difference isn&#x27;t too noticeable - its just enough so that I&#x27;m fairly sure that my teeth are slightly whiter rather than it just being in my head.    Nevertheless, I&#x27;m boosting my initial rating from one to three stars.  The product has some merit in that it delivers modest results for minimal effort and cost (just substitute for your daily mouthwashing routine).  The fact that the product did cause me an intense degree of unpleasantness and pain the first time around is sufficient for me to take off a star or two in itself.  Combine that with the feet flavoring, and I think that 3 stars is a fair rating given that it did end up delivering modest results.</li>
    <li> It may be a good product for your teeth, but my husband and I could not get past the awful taste!!! We tried it a couple of days, and we threw it away.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s in your mouth...not so bad, but the taste that lingers afterwards will have you dreading the next morning&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> The taste is so horrible and the burning is so bad that I can&#x27;t use this product long enough to see if it whitens teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried three nights to swish the mouthwash in my mouth, but it tastes so horrible I spit it out immediately.  I&#x27;ve even tried adding it to the water in my waterpik (very diluted), and I still can&#x27;t stand the taste.  I&#x27;m dumping out the rest of the bottle.  I wasted my money, don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
    <li> I tried it the first time, and spit it out immediately because the taste was absolutely foul.  Two weeks later, I think to myself, let me try it again. Same thing.  If I didn&#x27;t know better, I&#x27;d think this product had been tampered with and some poisonous chemical was added to the bottle.  It was that god-awful.  I have never experienced a more horribly-tasting product in my life.  I can&#x27;t imagine what the focus groups reported before they released this product.  I am a lifelong Colgate customer, but this product truly misses the mark.  Does it whiten teeth? I couldn&#x27;t tell you, since I can&#x27;t use this product repeatedly. Going back to Listerine!</li>
    <li> I think it honestly tastes really great.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to tell if it&#x27;s whitened my teeth. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that the 8 ulcers in my mouth are from this product.</li>
    <li> My first thought was that the product had been tampered with.  There was absolutely NO mint taste to it.  The taste of chemicals was overpowering.  After I spit it out, I could taste hydrogen peroxide.  After checking the ingredients, hyd. perox. is listed as the 4th ingredient down. So it probably does kill germs, but the minty fresh breath claim is wrong at best and an outright lie at worst. Okay...I&#x27;m off to brush my teeth (again)...</li>
    <li> OK so there&#x27;s alcoholic mouthwash that&#x27;s challenging because of its burn.  Then there&#x27;s this stuff which challenges you with is flavor; another reviewer correctly equated it to bleach.  I&#x27;m going to muscle through this bottle in the hope that it makes me a better person much like a Native American rite of passage manhood journey.  And maybe my teeth will be whiter, too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mouthwash. I actually really enjoy the burn, because I feel like my mouth isn&#x27;t getting as clean otherwise, and it tastes really good. I had no problem with my taste buds afterwards. Actually does whiten your teeth, as well. It&#x27;s honestly not that bad a burn. I had gingivitis when I started using this, and now I don&#x27;t, and I didn&#x27;t change the type of toothpaste I was using.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this mouthwash after using the toothpaste for a few weeks, very disappointed I&#x27;m afraid to say. At first it was just the taste putting me off, tastes nothing like mint, more like a pungent fake berry flavor... was going to put up with the taste until I noticed that my mouth was bleeding every time I used it, very disconcerting. Looked like I had cuts all over my tongue and/or gums. Wish I could say it worked and I would keep using it, but not going to keep using it anymore so can&#x27;t say if it actually whitens teeth...</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is awful. It tastes so bad. I don&#x27;t mind the taste of whitening mouthwashes, but this one has almost a tangy flavor (not in a good way). I used it for about a week because I hate to spend money on something and then waste it. But I ended up throwing it out after that. Also, it burns the inside of my mouth really bad. I can&#x27;t keep it in for more that 10 seconds or so before my mouth starts to hurt so bad I have to spit it out. Crest 3d white mouthwash is 1000 times better than this. This is simply terrible.</li>
    <li> great product arrived on time  i recommend it to everyone shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Really a great Product, keeps the mouth fresh and does keep my teeth from showing coffee stains.  I drink a lot of coffee and you sure can&#x27;t tell it.</li>
    <li> I understand this is mouthwash and not supposed to taste like candy, however, the taste is very gross and chemical-like. I will not be purchasing this mouthwash again.</li>
    <li> The rinse is thick and has a unpleasant taste and burn to it. It also foams up in your mouth. not my type of thing but everyone is different. The overall results were the same as all other mouthwashes when used as directed.</li>
    <li> I bought the mouthwash only because it was on clearance and now I see why it was on clearance.  I first thought my bottle was tampered with because it is so strong that it does leave a burning effect and the taste is just horrible!! I thought about returning it for a refund but then decided to come on here to read the reviews.  I do believe it caused a small bump on my tongue that lasted about a day or two but nothing serious.  My daughter used it this morning (before I read the reviews) and she is complaining about how bad her teeth hurt because she has sensitive teeth.  I would just say if you do have sensitive teeth and/or can&#x27;t tolerate bad tasting wash, then it&#x27;s not a good idea to use this product.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and I&#x27;m not sure if I will see any difference in my teeth getting any whiter since I have really white teeth already.</li>
    <li> This product really whitens my teeth. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> I wanted whitening mouthwash because I used some of my boyfriend&#x27;s and it seemed easy enough to whiten my teeth. This was the cheapest bottle I found, so I bought it. It tastes exactly like other kinds of mouthwash like this. It does not burn as others are saying. I only give it four stars because I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in color of my teeth, and I&#x27;ve went through almost the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> BUYERS BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this mouth wash based on my hygienist’s recommendation as she lives by Colgate Optic White and claims that this is the best mouth wash and whitening agent ever. This product surely helps your teeth achieve a whiter shade, no doubt about it, but at day 3, I am not sure this product is the best option for teeth whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels raw and burned. To the point that I cannot taste my beloved chocolate cookie dessert or the buffalo chicken sandwich, whereby any food tastes super mild and bland. Not sure what is in this formula which strips all sense of tasting from your mouth, but I’m telling you- my pearly whites do not compensate for the lack of taste as of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that you can feel this product effectively working in your mouth. The fizzing/burning sensation is no joke and I indeed sucked it up with the 60 second swishing. I would love this product if my food tasted the same. Something just isn’t right here folks….. Let’s just pray that my ability to taste comes back.</li>
    <li> It may not be the BEST tasting mouthwash but it&#x27;s by no means bad tasting!  I like the thick, frothy feel of the mouthwash and felt it was really cleaning and find all the spaces that needed cleaning in my mouth.  I could definitely tell a difference in my teeth in just 1 week after using this with the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Absolutely hilarious! I thought I was the only one who thought there must have been some tampering with the product to make it taste so foul; two swishes and I spit it out!!! I even went back and double checked the safety seal on this product because I felt that something that tasted this horrid had to have been altered in some way! Rancid, rancid,and rancid!</li>
    <li> I will make this very brief.  I have been using the Colgate Optic White toothpaste and then the mouthwash.  I really do like the toothpaste, and maybe I&#x27;m hallucinating, but my teeth look a bit whiter, but it&#x27;s definitely not because of the mouthwash!  I have been using these products for the past month or so religiously, and I have read all the negative reviews about the product and basically, could not understand all the poor ratings.  Well, I do now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What brightens the teeth for me is probably just the toothpaste itself, because the mouthwash can&#x27;t have any whitening praises on its own, simply because it tastes way too chemically, too nasty, too rancid I guess is the best way to describe it.  Swishing it around for more than a few seconds causes a \\&quot;OMG, gotta spit this right out\\&quot; type of reaction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a month&#x27;s use, I have been wondering why I can&#x27;t put any pressure on my top back teeth when biting down, and the gums behind the top teeth are kind of swollen and sore, and feel odd when running my tongue behind them, just a very strange feeling that something is amiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been getting progressively more sensitive with the past week.  I now stopped using the mouthwash only, but continue to use the toothpaste, just to see if it&#x27;s the entire 2 products causing this sensation, or to single out the nasty mouthwash.  For the past 3 days, I stopped, but in order to get my gums back to normal, I have to use my trusty old natural Eco-Dent Ultimate mouth rinse, and WOW!, I&#x27;m kind of back to normal.  So, it&#x27;s a wait and see right now, to see if I have to stop using the paste in the future.</li>
