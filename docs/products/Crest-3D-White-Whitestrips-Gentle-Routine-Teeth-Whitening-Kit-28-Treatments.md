<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice and I leave &#x27;em in for 1 hour before taking &#x27;em out. If your teeth are really yellow, just keep in mind that patience is the key. Your teeth won&#x27;t start getting whiter until the 2nd week. But that is if you&#x27;re leaving &#x27;em in for a hour per use. I did this for about 3 weeks and my teeth were white enough, didn&#x27;t even need the whole box. I recommend this product, but just be sure that you have that needed 1 hour. I don&#x27;t think leaving them in for 5mins will make any difference in whiteness.</li>
    <li> If you look closely at the picture, this has a 1 highlighted.  This means that it is the least harsh on your teeth,  That is because the instructions say to leave on your teeth for 5 minutes.  But you can leave it on longer and get a little more of the effect.  If you want a brighter smile sooner then get the 3 or higher rated box.  They cost more but may give you the results you desire sooner.</li>
    <li> I stopped using whitening strips years ago when I started getting the knock-you-to-the-floor &amp;#34;zingers&amp;#34; that would shoot through my front teeth. I&#x27;ve been through two boxes of these, and they have yet to cause a zinger! I leave them on for about 30 minutes (not 5 like the instructions say), and they really do work - people have actually said, &amp;#34;Did you whiten your teeth?&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they&#x27;re not perfect - they taste gross, irritate the tip of my tongue, and make my teeth a little sore if I use them for more than a week at a time. But considering how well they work and the fact that they don&#x27;t give me zingers, I&#x27;d say these are better than I ever expected from a whitening product.</li>
    <li> the price can&#x27;t be beat. It works quite well but not as strong as I thought it would be. However, it is very gentle on my teeth and gum.</li>
    <li> I like these, they don&#x27;t make my teeth hurt, BUT i do see a better brighter smile with the original crest whitestrips.</li>
    <li> gentle whitening, perfect for sensitive teeth - even when i leave it on longer than 5 mintutes (sometimes closer to 20) it still doesnt hurt my teeth.  good product for those who want gentle,consistent whitening as opposed to a 3 day miracle fix.</li>
    <li> This product is precisely what the company espouses that it is.  The strength of the peroxide is lower vs other strips.  You can indeed use it for a longer period of time if you so choose, although the efficacy of the product will be diminished.  It won&#x27;t hurt your teeth as much as faster regimens.  That&#x27;s it.  Either buy the more expensive ones, use these ones for less time, or stop complaining.  They&#x27;re not expensive anyway and if you feel that they are, spend your money on something more productive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using crest whitestrips since high school and have always got compliments on how beautiful my teeth are which I always used the original crest white strips that you wear for 1/2 hour these were more expensive and you only wear for 5 minutes but I did not notice much of a change at all!</li>
    <li> I have never used any other white strips before, but the gentle formula is definitely gentle. I bought these to whiten my teeth because I already have a little sensitivity and didn&#x27;t want to make it worse. They didn&#x27;t make my teeth anymore sensitive but also didn&#x27;t whiten as well as I was expecting. The amazon price is great though just to try them out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon as this was the best price I could find. I really liked the idea of it being gentle. It does take longer to use (28 days) but it&#x27;s only on for 5 minutes a day so it isn&#x27;t really a problem. Product whitened teeth about 1-2 shades and just enough to brighten them a bit but perfect for me as I have crowns that do not lighten with natural teeth so you have to be careful of how light you go. I didn&#x27;t experience any of the typical side effects as sensitive teeth usually do so I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me. I wear braces but he said that was okay because the bleach is just gonna go through my brackets anyways. They work great! Happy I took his advice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how quickly these work compared to other (non-gentle) products, because with other products I&#x27;ve had to quickly rip the white strips off my teeth due to intense pangs of sensitivity pain, so I&#x27;ve never been able to really use them. These gentle strips DO NOT hurt at all. I wear them for 30 minutes at the advice of other reviews. I have been using for about 5 days and can see a huge difference already. I had some coffee/tea/etc stains especially in between my teeth and they are almost completely gone and my smile is noticeably whiter!! So glad I found these.</li>
    <li> I use them for 30minutes at a time. I am halfway through the box and I can see a difference on my teeth. There has been very minor sensitivity. I will probably go for a stronger version of Create strips next time but needless to say I am very happy with the result. Go Crest!</li>
    <li> Just finished the last strip today. I would say the results are average at best. Teeth did lighten but not to the degree I had hoped. May need another box to get true teeth whitening instead of teeth lightening.</li>
    <li> I have had problems in the past with the original Crest Whitestrips hurting my teeth (even while brushing with Sensodyne).  These Gentle Routine strips have been amazing so far.  I have always been self-conscious about my teeth and these have greatly improved my confidence when i smile. (yeah, yeah sounds cliche, but its true!)    Pros:  -only have to wear them for 5 minutes so it takes less time than other Crest Whitestrips products  -haven&#x27;t given my teeth any sensitivity problems  -cost much less than dentist-strength whitening products (I paid $30.00 at Target).    Cons:  -28 treatments take longer than the 10 day treatments  -Whitening is less dramatic    Bottom line: If you have sensitivity problems and you don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars at the dentist these are the product for you.  The whitening is noticeable but if you&#x27;re going for that Julia Roberts look you may want to try the original formula first.</li>
    <li> I have been using this one for 6 days, my tooth seemed become very nice and white, also didn&#x27;t sensitive at all. love it...</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried the original Whitestrips on more than one occasion but they caused me extreme sensitivity, regardless of if I had used them less often or for a shorter amount of time.  I was hopeful that these would not cause me to ache, I had neglected the thought that they might not whiten.  The original strips did show whitening after the first use, but those had given me blisters on my gums and cracked my teeth!    These I used at night no less than one hour after brushing my teeth to prevent sensitivity.  I was even able to use them up to 15 minutes on occasion, but generally had them on for 10 minutes.    I noticed the toothpaste I used was very important: I started with Colgate advanced whitening (no ache) then for a short while used Crest pro health (caused slight sensitivity) then went to Colgate Total (no ache).  Because of the varied sensitivity I did skip a total of 4 days (not consecutive).    My disappointment does not particularly arise from the fact that they didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but that they primed my teeth to attract stains.  A month ago: my teeth were two shades away from perfectly porcelain white teeth (according to the spectrum teeth shade at the dentists office), so they aren&#x27;t/weren&#x27;t very noticeably stained, now they possibly can be 3-4 shades away.     My experience with Crest Whitestrips have been a complete failure, the originals have damaged my teeth to no repair (several internal crack, visible in bright light), and the sensitive whitestrips ironically stained my teeth.  Meanwhile, I also learned that Crest toothpaste causes me sensitivity.    I gave it 2 stars because it did work to its expectation of not causing sensitivity, also, the box does say it doesn&#x27;t offer dramatic whitening, but I never expected it to assist in worsening my teeth -_-</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED CREST WHITE STRIPS BEFORE BUT I NEVER HAVE USED THE STRIPS 3D THAT YOU ONLY HAD TO LEAVE ON FOR FIVE MINUTES. I LEAVE MY STRIPS ON FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET MY TEETH WHITER.  IT REALLY WORKS.  THE FIRST DAY I SAW A DIFFERENCE.  IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE GUMS OR TEETH IT MIGHT BE TO HARSH FOR YOU.  TRY THE OTHER CREST WHITING STRIPS JUST NOT THE 3D.  THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.  I SAVED MORE THAT $12.00 THAT IS SOLD IN THE STORE.  IT IS A MUST BUY PRODUCT. ALSO SHIPPING WAS FAST.</li>
    <li> I been using the gentle crust regularly and just finished my box.... Here&#x27;s the results:   - My teeth seams to be whiter but not alot. Please look at the back of the box it&#x27;s indicate that there will be NO \\&quot;Dramatic Whitening Results\\&quot;    - I didn&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity which I felt with the other regular crust strips.  - I&#x27;m about to go back and use the other crust because I do want to see dramatic shades difference and try to put it for 4 min 30 sec instead of 5 min.  Beside... There is Satisfaction Guaranteed so I&#x27;ll return this product (package &amp; invoice within 60 days of purchase) and use the money to buy the other strips.</li>
    <li> Crest whitestrips have always done the job!</li>
    <li> I switched to Gentle Routine when I began to feel pain from regular Whitestrips, even though I was using Sensodyne ProNamel toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  I use them about 5 times a week for 6-8 minutes.  While my teeth are not a dazzling white, they are bright and natural-looking, which I prefer.  In combination with ProNamel, these strips cause only the occasional painful twinge.</li>
    <li> I used the original Crest White Strips and ended up in horrible pain from sensitivity, pain so bad that OTC pain meds did nothing to help it.  It was terrible!  I can use these gentle strips nightly with no problem and used in conjunction with the 3D White toothpaste, my teeth look nice and bright.  The difference is noticeable without the pain - total thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive to whitestrips... although I keep going back and back since I really like my smile to be bright.  I thought this would be the answer to all my sensitivity problems but even after 2 days I was experiencing the same symptoms that I did with the regular Crest 3D Whitestrips.  They do seem to work just as well as the regular strips too, but I think it&#x27;s false advertising to say they are any \\&quot;more gentle\\&quot; on your teeth...</li>
    <li> After using this product for more than 20 days, I have failed to observe any sign of improvement in the tonality of my teeth. I have tried other teeth whitening product before, they make my teeth very sensitive during usage but works great. For this product, it causes no pain to my teeth, but simply shows no effect of whitening them after almost a month. Maybe a roll of adhesive tape would work better than this..................</li>
    <li> At first I didnt like the way they went on , they kind of slipped around when placing them, but the stayed once they were in place, the stayed. after a few times of usage i did see some results. My teeth are whiter but next time i will purchase a stronger method</li>
    <li> I would recommend these whitestrips.  They work great on my teeth.  They are also easy to remove.  I use them once a day for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time.</li>
    <li> Eh. Small difference, worth the price. (Leave on for at least 30 minutes for any change) Best is Zoom, but -- expensive!</li>
    <li> I should have ordered the Crest 3d White Advanced Vivid Teeth like I usually have done in the past faster and better results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product just because I wanted whiter teeth but everything else I&#x27;ve used caused my teeth to hurt so bad it was painful to talk or breathe out of my mouth. The other crest vivid white ones really hurt my teeth. So I bought these hoping they would do the job but not cause teeth sensitivity. After following the directions and using for 3 days things were okay. It wasn&#x27;t until the fourth day that I started to have irritations. So I stopped for a few days and continued after a few more and so on and so forth. I&#x27;m doing the strips every other day and it seems to be okay in the sense that my teeth don&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m half way through the box and things are starting to look a little brighter. So overall I would recommend with the caution that if your teeth hurt, move to every other day.</li>
    <li> I have such sensitive teeth I can barely use whitening toothpastes for very long.  But I was able to use these strips easily, and I read a lot of reviews and decided to build up to leaving them in for up to half an hour.  I&#x27;ve had great success from the first time with whitening, and no pain or sensitivity.  I brush with sensitive tootpaste and avoid very hot drinks during whitening period.  For those with small mouths/small teeth, these strips are easy to cut in half, I get four strips per pouch.  In a little over a week and a half and a half hour each time and my teeth are noticebley whiter.  Taking a couple days off then finishing the whitening.  They haven&#x27;t been this white since high school, pre coffee, pre smoking, etc.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a pretty decent product. They&#x27;re a little gross to remove from the packaging and insert into your mouth, but for five minutes of the slimy little things, it&#x27;s not much to endure. I have not experienced any sensitivity whatsover but I&#x27;m not doing it every single day, either. Maybe taking a day or two break now and then is preventing the discomfort that some others talk about. Anyway, my teeth appear to be getting whiter. I&#x27;d rather take this very gradually and pain-free to get the desired results.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that if you HATE tooth pain and you have extreme tooth sensativity, then this is the product for you ... I have to admit I&#x27;m finally leaving feedback on this product after having purchased it several months ago ... I bought it and still didn&#x27;t dare to use it, because I thought for sure it would still be way too painful ... I finally started using the product, and I felt no pain!! I&#x27;m very excited, I even left it on for about 20 minutes (the second night) and there has been no pain! I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still wimpy, I brush my teeth before and after with sensodyne just to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve been putting off teeth whitening, now&#x27;s your chance to jump back in!! Go for it!</li>
    <li> THEY REALLY DON&#x27;T WORK VERY WELL</li>
    <li> Does the job, but gotta stick to the plan.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D Whitestrips Gentle Routine have worked well for me.  My teeth are sensitive so I was mindful to follow the directions provided by the manufacturer for this product.  Very little discomfort was experienced and the whitening effect has been quite noticeable to my smile, especially when wearing colored lip glosses.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results of this product.  If you&#x27;re looking for magic-white-overnight you may want to pay the price for that service to be done by a professional.  If you&#x27;re on a budget and don&#x27;t mind the process taking a few days for first results, I would recommend this product.  The whitening continues with use and I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used several kinds of Crest Whitestrips, from the original to the pro to the advanced and other varieties.  I love them, even the original strips work great.  These 5 minute strips, however, I was not impressed with and found them to be pretty much ineffective.  My advice to those with sensitive teeth:  rather than buying these strips, buy the originals or an upgraded version and use them less often than as directed to reduce sensitivity.  Use them once every few days or once a week rather than the recommended once or twice a day.  You will still get great results, but giving your teeth a break in between uses will dramatically decrease any pain from sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I give this item 3 1/2 stars. If you wear the strips for 5 minutes as directed, you won&#x27;t feel any discomfort at all afterwards. However, after reading some of the reviews here, I decided to keep them on for 15-30 minutes each day for a better whitening effect. I did experience some slight tooth sensitivity after wearing them for 30 minutes on consecutive days, but I would just skip the next day and the discomfort would go away. The first time I used Crest Whitestrips, I got amazing results without tooth sensitivity, but I&#x27;ve had sensitivity problems ever since and can&#x27;t use the normal strips anymore. The whitening effect with the Gentle Routine isn&#x27;t very noticeable yet and I&#x27;m almost done with the pack, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting as big a change as the normal strips provide. The info for the Gentle Strips says that the whitening effect isn&#x27;t very great (given you wear them 5 minutes a day), so you know what to expect!</li>
    <li> This is for sensitive teeth, but it still created pain and discomfort for me in the long run.  As for whitening, I&#x27;m not sure what 3D is supposed to be, but my teeth whitened only somewhat.  The 5-minute time period for the strips was okay, though the pain came long after the strips were removed.  Stick with the dental office if you want white teeth.</li>
    <li> It is an affordable product, but even though I only needed a slight whitening, I have not yet seen any results. I will try the regular strips next time.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I have felt no pain or sensibility at all.</li>
    <li> i have been putting off using teeth whitening kits for fear of the pain that i frequently read about. So when I saw these strips i had to try them.  I haven&#x27;t used these every day, maybe three times a week and i leave them on for 20-30 minutes and i can honestly say that my smile is much whiter on after using about half of the strips.  I really have had no pain, except for very very mild sensitivity that is tolerable!!!  Very pleased with these results!!!</li>
    <li> 1 month using this and still haven&#x27;t see any change, it worked at first a little but i stopped seeing improvement</li>
    <li> Ok so I would have to agree that wearing these for 5 minutes per strip is basically the equivalent of throwing a buck in the trash every time you use one. It&#x27;s going to provide much less dramatic results than other whitestrips. My suggestion? Leave them on for 10-30 minutes each time, and be sure to use Sensodyne or some other sensitivity toothpaste along with this. If your teeth start hurting, skip using them one day and try again the next day. This can save you money, if you opt to use these and just leave them on longer. I actually have an event coming up and I&#x27;m doing two treatments a day, totaling one hour each day and my teeth are already MUCH whiter, and it&#x27;s only been three days. My teeth hurt a little today and I&#x27;m probably only going to do one 30 minute treatment tomorrow. I spent $23 on a box of these vs. $45-$50 for other whitestrips. My mouth and pocketbook are happy</li>
    <li> totally waste money. i have been using it everyday . but it doesn&#x27;t work at all . waste money !waste tiime.&lt;br /&gt; I want my money back . !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used crest whitestrips before with impressive results, but I don&#x27;t know about this gentle routine. It seemed to make my teeth appear whiter right after wearing them, but after my daily coffee and tea intake, back to off white. I have been through all of them now and see no difference. I think I&#x27;d rather have my teeth ache all day with good results than no pain with little or no results. I will stick with premium strips from now on, thank you!</li>
    <li> I guess the difference is quite subtle. I did notice some whitening when I kept up with my routine. Instead of 5 minutes, I leave them on for 30 minutes. My gums only very rarely felt irritated but of course, I didn&#x27;t leave them on for the recommended time. I still have more than half the box left just because I&#x27;m lazy. But they&#x27;re alright for subtle whitening.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product before my wedding last September. My teeth really aren&#x27;t overly sensitive, but I&#x27;ve tried several brands of whitening strips in the past, and have experienced almost unbearable pain with all of them. The first time I tried this product, I must have been distracted by the TV or something, because the recommended 5 minutes came and went and I ended up leaving it on for about a half hour. No pain. So I continued to do 30 minutes a day up until a week before my wedding. There was a very small amount of sensitivity once in a while when the strips were actually on my teeth, but nothing worth complaining about. I had beautiful white teeth on my big day.</li>
    <li> Seriously, these work! And no problems with pain (I have sensitive teeth).</li>
    <li> Worked Great took less time then i expected it to.</li>
    <li> These strips do not have the sticking power of another type of Crest strips.  I presumed they did and am very disappointed.  Be careful to verify what you are purchasing.</li>
    <li> Overall I loved these!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: They&#x27;re pretty simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;They do whiten your teeth (even if it is more subtle).&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth at all (which is great!).&lt;br /&gt;They have already whitened my teeth some (even though I haven&#x27;t used all 28).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The white strip that is supposed to be on the bottom teeth doesn&#x27;t fit the best...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as someone else already mentioned you should try and put on the strips for 20-30 minutes. I think it does work better that way.</li>
    <li> I have used white strips on and off for a couple years.  There are so many to choose from.  I chose this one because it said \\&quot;gentle routine.\\&quot;  Crest is a very trusted brand so I have only bought that brand so far.  When I am done with these, I am going to purchase the Crest maintenance strips.  Maybe if I stopped drinking coffee I wouldn&#x27;t need to use this so much!  There is no chance of that so I will continue buying them.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these teeth whitener strips. Work great.</li>
    <li> ...it weren&#x27;t so darned expensive! I sure won&#x27;t mind when the exclusive patent expires and we can buy it for a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D white strips are easier to use than they were a few years ago--better adhesive. My dentist recommended them; these did take a month.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that these work!!&lt;br /&gt;I had a wonderful experience with these. From my teeth to a light shade of yellow (nasty, I know)&lt;br /&gt;to a crisp white smile.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results &amp; its something that can be useful to all. A++</li>
    <li> Teeth whitening is extremely important these days.  I am a Crest toothpast user and decided to try this version of their whitening products.  It is safe for sensitive tooth enamel and delivers fantastic whitening results.</li>
    <li> These are very reasonably priced. I buy these for my kids for stocking stuffers at Christmas. They love to unwrap these strips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still about halfway through the 28-count box. Yes, I&#x27;ve missed a few days but I do see a small change in the color of my teeth. My teeth are sensitive and though this is not as strong as the other ones i&#x27;ve tried this doesnt leave my teeth hurting afterwards and its so easy to leave it on for only 5 minutes. I will update this later and write about how it went towards the end.</li>
    <li> Have only used half so far and the wife is noticing improvement. Slow but sure and very little sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the same results as the crest advanced BUT these don&#x27;t hurt or temporarily stain my gums and they are still effective!</li>
    <li> These whitening strips do what they are supposed to do. they are a really gentle cycle and take some time to get the whitening done. these aren&#x27;t the advance seal, so they have a tendency to slide around some. I will purchase the quicker results strips with advanced seal going forward, but wanted to give these a try.</li>
    <li> I guess I have SUPER sensitive teeth? I got this for my fiance and me and it works well for him but for me, I feel a burning sensation (not tingling, BURNING) in my gums and afraid of damaging them, I stopped using them.I realize I must switch back to the classic strips that dissolve (nastily) in your mouth because it&#x27;s less intense and I really don&#x27;t mind the fact that it takes twice a day for a longer amount of time before my teeth get super white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it all depends on your teeth :)</li>
    <li> I was not to sure about this kind of product. Kind of a should I or shouldn&#x27;t I. Well I did and am very pleased with the results. The Gentle routine is all I needed. It may not be for everyone. From what I read some of the Crest whitening products are intense. Check out the info before you purchase. For my use this one is just right. Amazon is on the higher price side for this product, you decide. Highly recommended and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I have a professional bleaching kit with custom molds for my teeth from the dentist but I like these, They deliver a great bright white and they are so easy to use, seriously 5 minutes! I definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> I decided to try these strips because I do have sensitive teeth, and also like one reviewer had suggested, you get more for the money and can just leave them on longer for better whitening. That part is true. After leaving them on for 30 minutes, my teeth were about as white as after 15 minutes with other Crest Whitestrips. They also hurt just as bad, but I was expecting that. What I was not expecting, however, is the fact that these gentle whitestrips do not stick as well as the other kinds. I actually had to put a retainer over them to get them to stay on my teeth, otherwise they just bunched up. Using the retainer- and I&#x27;m sure a whitening tray would have had a similar result- caused the peroxide to also be held against my gums, which made for a more painful experience than using regular strength 3D Whitestrips. The difference, I&#x27;m guessing, is that these strips do not have the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; that the other ones do. I don&#x27;t know why not, I had assumed that was what set the Crest strips apart from other brands and warranted such an outrageous price. From now on and until another less expensive alternative comes along, I will be sticking with the other 3D White strips.</li>
    <li> I bought the whitestrips back when they first came out a few years ago.  Those worked great, my teeth where as white as could be, but they hurt my gums.  These take a lot less time, don&#x27;t hurt, and are much more subtle.  I haven&#x27;t finished the pack yet, but I can already tell a difference.  I would recommend to any first timer.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the stronger strips but I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause sensitivity. They don&#x27;t whiten as well as the others.</li>
    <li> I ordered these whitening strips because I drink coffee every day and noticed my teeth were not so white and bright.  I had bought a professional whitening kit from my dentist about 10 years ago (at that time, about $300), but my teeth and gums are so sensitive, that after using the professional kit for just a day, my teeth hurt for 2 weeks.  Sure, the professional kit did the trick and whitened my teeth after just one application, but the pain just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  And frankly, I&#x27;m 40-something, and I don&#x27;t want my teeth to be so white and bright that they glow!  So I read all the reviews and decided to give these a try.  Okay, so the whitening is gradual - you don&#x27;t get that immediate satisfaction of whiter teeth - but they do work.  And what&#x27;s even better, there is absolutely no pain in my teeth and gums with this product.  I follow the directions to the T.  Leave them on for 5 minutes each night and no longer.  Then I brush with Sensodyne after.  I&#x27;m really pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
    <li> I found the packaging to be very excellent. No complaints. Will continue to order this product when the need arises as I know too much whitening ain&#x27;t good at all.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help me. Probably I should&#x27;ve given up drinking black tea while using this, but anyway didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> Super gentle whitening and is really made for people with sensitive teeth.  These are also great touch up strips to maintain a healthy smile.  I use these in conjunction with the Crest profession strips (sticky ones) to get the right amount of whitening and not cause too much sensitivity to my teeth.</li>
    <li> They work so well. I always get compliments about how white my teeth are. Even from my dentist. They do make your teeth a little sensitive though.</li>
    <li> These worked ok...i did tell a difference but not a huge difference.  I will probably use the advanced ones next time</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love white teeth?! Plus its sensitive enough to leave on for more than 5 minutes, doesn&#x27;t burn the gums like some of the other strips.</li>
    <li> Have used at least 21 of the 28 count carton and don&#x27;t see much improvement. However, tooth sensitivity was a concern and these do not cause sensitivity.  Will use them all and then purchase whitening strips next level up until I find those that whiten without causing too much tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I swear that Crest works better than generic and other brands...I chose these because I felt that the 7 day (and less) kits didn&#x27;t work that well. These 28-day strips worked pretty good, but not as good as their original 14-day kits. The major upside: no tooth sensitivity at all, only takes 5 minutes a day (I left them on longer).  Downside: Not the blinding white I wanted for my teeth.  I would buy again!</li>
    <li> These DON&#x27;T HURT!  I took my dentist advice and did a month of  brushing with sensodyne. that, combined with this lower power whitening strip is proving to be a pain free experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave them on for half an hour.  No pain. I haven&#x27;t finished the course so i dont&#x27; know if the whitening is what is says but first things first, no pain after use!</li>
    <li> Worked great, easy to use, takes 5 minutes, then brush your teeth and then that is that. Highly recommend, great!</li>
    <li> You really see a difference after a couple days..I love this product</li>
    <li> I can not use the regular strips, my teeth/gums are WAY to sensitive. I thought I&#x27;d give these a go. After using the entire box according to instructions my teeth looked exactly the same. My teeth were also a bit sensitive to this product and my gums would hurt for a few hours after. It didn&#x27;t have that effect at first, but after about 10 days of usage this happened with every use.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t in bad condition, they&#x27;re pretty white. I drink coffee like it keeps me alive though and the effects are starting to show and it bothers me. I was hopeful this would help, but it didn&#x27;t do anything but inflame my gums (however no where near as bad as the regular strips).</li>
    <li> I thought I would try these Crest 3D Whitening Strips because they are less expensive than retail stores. They work great, and they only need to set for 5 minutes. I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in the whiteness of the teeth as compared to those that stay in for 30 minutes. They seem to have the same great whiteness with less time. I would recommend these strips for anyone looking to get whiter teeth and a brighter smile. I also use Crest 3D White toothpaste as a follow-up to the strips, and it gives a brighter appearance to my teeth. I will purchase this product again. Delivery was very fast as well.</li>
    <li> I get sick from regular crest strips. The sensitive whitens my teeth but doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous! Good whitening product.</li>
    <li> Gentle formula was great. Did not feel any tenderness or soreness in teeth or gums.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. The original white strips used to work after a few uses but you won&#x27;t see a slight difference with these ones</li>
    <li> A total waste of money. This did nothing to whiten my teeth. After the 28th day, I had sensations of tooth and gum sensitivity from these \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; strips with absolute zero whitening effects. Never again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I could stand using these things on a daily basis - the intended method of application makes it unavoidable to get some of the gel on your fingers, getting them very sticky. Then you get your fingers sticky again getting the thing off your teeth. Plus the strips don&#x27;t even cover more than 50% of my teeth, and I&#x27;m a small-ish person with a regular set of teeth. So...meh. Don&#x27;t care for them, and the difference is just a tiny bit noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love these gentle routing, 3d whitestrips. They do not hurt your teeth, and they do work. They do not work as fast as the regular ones, but your teeth do not hurt. My daughter said hurt teeth still hurt, so she used Sensodyne, or the like, or the rinse,  for a week, morning and night, and before she applied the strips, and she was fine then.</li>
    <li> The whitening strips are great! I have sensitive teeth so I do not use them all the time one or twice every other week. I notice a difference almost immediately after using them. I do not see such dramatic results like the crest commercials boost about but the results are noticeable. Def worth it!</li>
    <li> light good quality big quantity easy to use it i used and give my wife to tried it  . love it because the size and efficiency</li>
    <li> This is gentle on my teeth and works just as well as the professional/luxe ones. No sensitivity after 30mins and my teeth were noticeably whiter after the FIRST treatment!</li>
    <li> it really does work, i absolutely love it and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all if you follow the instructions</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive teeth. I can leave them on longer than suggested and I have very, very sensitive teeth. I always notice instant whitening effects. I just refresh my smile once a month.</li>
    <li> This product made my teeth whiter but did not make them hurt like the professional whitening strips do, even if I was using Sensodyne as well. Highly recommended for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I really like the results after using the strips for a while. They don&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive &amp; people have noticed a difference in my teeth.😁</li>
    <li> It was very good for me it works well I&#x27;m happy so much that I can find it from USA in French there are nothing.</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this product.  I need whitening but, until these, have been unable to use whitening strips or gels because my teeth and gums too sensitive.  These do take longer but really work. No pain or sensitivity.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic if you have sensitive teeth. The results are real! I started noticing my teeth were whiter after 7 consecutive days of use</li>
    <li> So, do you have to have super gross stained teeth for this to work?  Cuz my teeth are just normal...don&#x27;t drink coffee, smoke, and don&#x27;t even drink soda much.  I just wanted to brighten my teeth up.  I used this faithfully and NOTHING happened.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> A great product comes with affordable price. My teeth never felt pain when I put this on. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> The strips work well, do not cause me any toothache, but seem to show very little result even though I am using it on daily basic as recommended.</li>
    <li> These gentle strips do not stay in place like the regular ones, and also do not whiten as well.  I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> they work within a couple of days. my boyfriend noticed a difference in about 3 days.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; to work. I&#x27;ve been using daily for almost one month now and I have 4 more days to go. I leave them in for 15 to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;They ARE a lot less painful than the full strength strips in my experience.</li>
    <li> Work great but I leave them on 30-60 minutes</li>
    <li> Only used them twice, 40 minutes each time and already see results!</li>
    <li> not sure if this helped or not. i wasn&#x27;t able to notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;but that doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t work. the verdict is still out.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective. While using these takes much longer than the normal routine strips, these are much easier on your teeth and gums. Highly recommend these over others if you don&#x27;t mind the longer routine.</li>
    <li> Still continues to be one of the more effective WhitStrips offerings.</li>
    <li> I just used them for the first time. The box says leave them in for 5 minutes but I left it in a little longer. When I took them off, I automatically noticed a difference. It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference but I  could notice. I&#x27;m very  happy, considering I&#x27;ve only used it one time. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Really works, I saw &amp; felt immediately the formula working. My advice would be, follow directions. Please Dont leave on longer than suggested time, this product can cause gum irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every tooth whitening strip out there, I think. Anyone who was given tetracycline as a child can relate to the yellow teeth! These whiten the best and are easy to use. You can get them anywhere, but this seller has great prices and ships quickly, no need to leave the house!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest 3D whitestrips that whiten teeth over 28 days. They only need to stay on the teeth for a few minutes each day and I notice results within a few days. In fact, I&#x27;ve even used 1/2 of the package and saved the other half for 6 months later. This whitening system does not cause me tooth pain (like a nail being drilled into my gums) the way the faster systems have. It is gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this purchase. However, once I was finished using the strips, I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all, nor did anyone I know. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use the product as instructed but I don’t see many results when compared to a similar product I used YEARS ago. Considering the price, it may not be worth it since the bleach whitening gel is essentially the same thing but with an applicant. I like that it’s a strip so I don’t have to find something to apply to my teeth and there is certain amount of the gel on it already so….The product, again, I’d say is below my expectations.</li>
    <li> These are just great so far, I&#x27;ve only used then a couple times so far, but they seem to be working! I got them at such a steal! :)</li>
    <li> I honestly think they work better than the regular Crest White Strips. They&#x27;re quicker, --  only five minutes -- easier to use, and gentle on teeth. I have really sensitive teeth and I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity using these. Plus, my teeth are ridiculously white now, so they work.</li>
    <li> Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> My brother offers expensive whitening in his office but swears that Crest white strips do just as good and last longer.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and am unable to use regular whitening strips without being in a lot of pain. These show great results and don&#x27;t hurt my teeth at all! I&#x27;m not sure what the recommended time is, but I usually use them once a week for 30-45 min.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Go this item on time and will order again. Thumbs up on this product !</li>
    <li> I purchased these strips because they specifically indicate they are for sensitive teeth.  However, after using them for just 1 week, my sensitivity returned.  I use Sensodyne regularly and no longer feel the sensitivity....but like I said after using these for 1 week, my sensitivity returned.</li>
    <li> saw some results and did not make my teeths or gum really sensitive</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because it did not even whiten my teeth at all. I do have sensitive teeth so while using this, it didn&#x27;t burn or hurt but didn&#x27;t whiten.</li>
    <li> My teeth&#x27;s whiteness did not make any visible improvements after the treatment. Even though I followed some recommendations from other reviewers of wearing the strips for a little longer than the instructions say. The strips wiggle around in my mouth a lot so I end up tasting some of the product. My teeth experienced some sensitivity, but nothing very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying Gentle, I saw that Crest was promoting their Professional Effects strips with a $10 rebate, so I gave those a try.&lt;br /&gt;Professional Effects is amazing! I&#x27;ve only been through half of the treatment, and have seen amazing whitening results. I did not experience as much sensitivity with Professional Effects as I did with Gentle. These strips stick firmly to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;--I wasted my money on the Gentle Routine:&lt;br /&gt;No results, wiggly strips, some sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--With the $10 rebate, Professional Effects costed me less than the Gentle Routine:&lt;br /&gt;Amazing results just halfway through, strips stick firmly, less sensitivity than Gentle.</li>
    <li> Finally a teeth whitening kit that doesn&#x27;t leave me in pain!  That I really like!  I even left them on for 10 minutes &amp; still no pain.  As far as how well they whiten, I really don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
    <li> It is ok..as ok..but not super efficient. I don&#x27;t know why but this product didn&#x27;t work that great like I used to have years ago.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have gotten the &#x27;originals&#x27; I used to use years ago.  They always worked great in the past.  Now it&#x27;s either these or a super high-speed type.  They did not do much at all!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Some sensitivity toward the end of the box but I just skipped a day instead of using them everyday and it helped.</li>
    <li> I suppose everyone&#x27;s teeth are a bit different but for me these have worked great.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely no sensitivity while using them and in the beginning i was using  two packs a day as opposed to only one like the directions say. I figured it&#x27;d get me  to the level of whitening i wanted a bit faster and it did. I&#x27;d used one pack about an  hour after brushing and another about an hour before bed. I&#x27;ve had great results and I  haven&#x27;t even finished the box yet. I will purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used teeth whitening products before, but eating foods with lots of sugars and drinking tea a lot I suppose can take a toll on the whitness of your teeth. I haven&#x27;t even used about half of my white strips and they have worked really good for me, and very quickly. I saw results after about the fourth or fifth time I used them. I leave them on for a little longer than 30 mins, but I don&#x27;t think it matters.     Only two very minor issues so far; yes there&#x27;s a little sticky stuff on your teeth after you pull them off, but they easily wash away with rinsing your mouth. 2; The taste while you&#x27;re wearing them is bitter and nasty, and you can&#x27;t help but get a little bit of the taste in your mouth. But it&#x27;s not very strong.     These work great for me so far. Definitely worth more the low price offered. I would recommend them for someone who wants quick and noticeable results. :)</li>
    <li> Ordered this product 2 weeks back and have been using it since then and noticed some improvements, will have to wait and see if this product works in the long run.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a tip, buy these Strips instead of the more expensive other 3D strips and instead of leaving them on for the recommended 5 Minutes, leave them on for a full 30 minutes and experience a whitening that is 90% as good as the professional stripes.   To me they are almost identical cleaning and much more worth the price then the others. I just can&#x27;t believe the huge margins that crest must be making on these things therefore I bought these on subscribe and save and with a $5 off coupon for $12.50.  That price seems much more reasonable for a product like this.    Anyways, I absolutely recommend these stripes as they have really cleaned up my coffee/tea/red wine stained teeth!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s damned good. Have used for just 5 days and my teeth is getting much white. No doubt will get more. never felt a pain while using that. The only problem is the length is not enough for me, as I have a BIG mouth.</li>
    <li> Finally! Whitening strips for sensitive teeth!  I&#x27;ve had the worst luck with other strips I have bought because my teeth are ultra sensitive, but not with this new gentle formula!  I can leave it on longer than the recommended 5 minutes, and I still do not experience any sensitive whatsoever. The strips are easy to apply and stay in place. And though the whitening process takes longer over time and is more gradual than other more concentrated formulas, it still does its job, and I noticed a difference in my teeth after a week. However, what many people don&#x27;t realize is that to keep your teeth looking white, you should use these strips often along with a sensitive whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great whitening strips...they whitened my teeth without making them sore.  I did leave them on for a full half hour and only used them a few times a week as opposed to five minutes every day.  Recommended for those with sensitive teeth!</li>
    <li> Works well for my sensitive teeth. I don&#x27;t use them for 30 days straight, but instead just use them once a week for maintenance. It says to leave them on for 5 minutes, but I usually leave them on for 10 and still don&#x27;t have problems with sensitivity. You can see a difference after one use!</li>
    <li> I like the product, you need to watch your smoking and coffee behavior.</li>
    <li> It does not stay in! I will not buy this ever again. I will not sending it back, because I have used so many of the strips already.</li>
    <li> Worked great! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Product was priced good and arrived promptly.  I used the product as instructed everyday.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in my teeth.  Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I like these as they don&#x27;t hurt my teeth.  You won&#x27;t see a dramatic difference but will see some with continued use.</li>
    <li> It really works if you use it according to the instructions no skipping a day. Warning! While wearing your teeth may hurt alot. After using these i felt my teeth have become sensitive. My sister and her hb both used it and they are really happy with the result. I have been recommending this product since ive used it myself. And lots of people compliment me and some people i used to know ask me how i did it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these strips. I only finished half the box but I noticed my teeth were whiter. I&#x27;m paranoid about enamel loss but did not notice any sensitivity.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product I thought it&#x27;s just gonna be as great as any other Crest products I&#x27;ve used before.  But apparently this stuff doesn&#x27;t give you amazing result, my teeth are now still the same and I have only 4/28 strips left.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt that this product works.  When my teeth began to yellow, I started it using it and will never stop.</li>
    <li> whitened great, had to wear them for five minutes the plastic on my teeth bothered me and I wanted to drool all over myself as to not swallow the whitening stuff. slightly discolored my gums but I think going through those things, the effects were still worth it. A little uncomfortably for great results.</li>
    <li> Used these for 28 days, once per day for 30 minutes, and had no pain or sensitivity (unlike full strength White Strips which I couldn&#x27;t use bc of pain).  However, now at the end of the 28 days I see absolutely no difference in my teeth (I even took before and after photos to compare).  So they didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I order this for my sister because she tried it before and it really works and it is safe for using also</li>
    <li> Bought the product and tried it only on my upper teeth to see if it worked. There was no difference between my upper and lower teeth after using the whole box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for a refund, but instead of sending a cheque they sent a debit card that did not work. After 7 phone calls to try and find someone at either P&amp;G or Citi (company debit card) I gave up. They seem to have no one to help customers. On my last call I insisted on a supervisor, and she gave me a number and told me that I would have to leave a message because they don&#x27;t have anyone answering the phone. Some of the sorst customer service I have seen.</li>
    <li> I have never tried white strips of any kind because 1) I have sensitive teeth and 2) my front tooth has a fake portion on it and I was told by my dentist it would not whiten with the rest of my tooth.  I decided to try these because it said it was safe for sensitive teeth.  I have to say this product really delivered!  I did not experience any sensitivity and my teeth were not whitened to the point that my dental work was noticable.  It does not provide the vivid white results of a full strenght white strip but does remove stains and provides a subtle whitening.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the gel that is left on teeth when the strip is removed!  I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive teeth!</li>
    <li> havent really seen the result but its really good for sensitive teeth, its not harsh on the teeth at all</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very effective.</li>
    <li> Strips are just ok at whitening.  Because they are for sensitive teeth the whitening agent is less which will take longer to work, ok I get that.  What I don&#x27;t care for is how flimsy the strips are thus making them somewhat difficult to handle.&lt;br /&gt;How many times did these things wrap around the tips of my fingers or twice I dropped a strip and the darn thing folded in half.  Don&#x27;t know if the other strips are as flimsy but I won&#x27;t be buying this type again</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well these worked. after one use I could see a noticeable difference in my teeth. they are very effective at whitening. The only issue is that they do make my teeth very sensitive. they feel fine while they are on, but about an hour or 2 after taking them off, my teeth become very sensitive and it usually lasts for the rest of the day. Overall pretty good if you can deal with the sensitivity. I will not that it has 3 application recommendations: 5 minute, 30 minute, and 2 hour increments. As you may suspect, the longer uses work better but make your teeth more sensitive as well. I recommend at least 30 minute sessions if you want good results (I usually go for at least 1 hour).</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. It is gentle with subtle whitening. I had absolutely no problems with it. I am satisfied!</li>
    <li> These are working very well for my teen daughter.  It&#x27;s easy and they only need to stay on for 5 minutes.  She leaves them on for up to a half hour sometimes.  She&#x27;s used them for a few weeks now and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I tried one and my mouth got so itchy!! I just don&#x27;t use it anymore!I don&#x27;t recommend it at all!</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I have tried the regular Crest 3D White strips in the past. I have actually tried them multiple times, without any success. That is not to say that they do not work. Rather, they didn&#x27;t work for me because I simply could not use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 to 5 minutes of applying the regular Crest strips, I experienced severe shooting pains in my teeth. Those pains were sudden and completely unexpected. It was like one second my teeth felt great and the next I was wincing in pain. I tried over and over again, but each time I just had to stop using them because it hurt so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I seem to have found a solution. I have now been successfully using the Gentle Routine Crest 3D white strips for two days. I applied them the first time almost expecting the pains of earlier attempts to resurface again. Needless to say I was a bit anxious about it hurting again. Then five minutes went by. Then ten. Then thirty. No pain at all. I was very surprised and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a day off between applications and did a second round using them for 35 minutes this time. Still no pain. Both days I decided to stop wearing them once I felt a slight tingle in my teeth. Again this only happened at 30 and 35 minutes after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I am very happy with this product. I don&#x27;t know yet how much it will improve my teeth&#x27;s appearance, but at least I can actually use it! I would recommend the gentle routine to anyone who struggled with the original version. Start out slow and see how you react to it. Take a day or two in between uses to give your teeth a little break, and hopefully it will work well for you too.</li>
    <li> I use these off &amp; on when I feel I need to brighten my teeth &amp; they work great!  I would &amp; have&lt;br /&gt;recommended these to other people.  The price thru Amazon is better than any other place you may&lt;br /&gt;want to purchase these stips from.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY GRAND SON AS A GIFT.  PRICE IS GOOD COMPARED TO DRUG STORE PRICES.  I&#x27;M GOING TO PURCHASE SOME FOR MYSELF.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying these because the other crest product cause so much tooth pain.  So far even these are causing some discomfort, but even using it for 5min a day i do see some improvement.  i asked the dentist if the in office whiteners were better but they all work the same way and would probably cause me pain.  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my parents fault that i have such sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half walf through the box and see no results. I&#x27;m very disappointed because I keep them on for 20-30 mins. I will finish the strips and if no results, get a full refund.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste and works well at keeping your mouth clean. I would just say be careful because I had a very bad reaction to it it caused my mouth to have white stuff grow on it so different people have different reactions to it.</li>
    <li> The product is the best we have found.  It is quick and effective.  Our only complaint is that the strips occasionally vary in the quality of the gel on the strip and some are more difficult to remove from the plastic backing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips before and I&#x27;d say that they are a convenient alternative to the time and expense of going to a professional whitening session. They do get my teeth a lighter shade though not gleaming white. I gotta cut back on the tea, but it&#x27;s my vise. All in all, these are better from the earlier generation of this product I purchased where you had to leave the strips on for 30 minutes thus in my case causing tooth sensitivity. I don&#x27;t get that from these and they only have to be applied for 5 minutes. I do 10 minutes and I still don&#x27;t get any aches or sensitizing. Perhaps for this reason, these might not be as effective as the original Crest strips, but I can&#x27;t make that assessment. I have not tried other application gels, teeth trays or any of the sort so I can only rate them based on previous experience with the same product.</li>
    <li> I regularly use this product and really quite like it. Product was also well received and in in good time.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says!  I only use this brand because I have sensitive teeth; otherwise, I would use the 2 hr Express but that is too much for my teeth.  This method takes a little longer but eventually does the job!</li>
    <li> I would and have recommended Crest White Strips to friends. Yellow to white teeth so quickly and easily done. To have such an improvement after nearly seventy years is amazing. They are easy to use at home and where ever I travel and convenient on my busy schedule. They do not affect my sensitive teeth and gums. I have used this product for over two yeaars. I am sold on this product.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for people with sensitive teeth. No aching of your teeth and they do get whiter. Only downfall is it takes a few extra days to really show results. That is just a result of it having smaller amounts of whitening.</li>
    <li> Was very impressed with the white strips.  I had a month to whiten before prom and they turned out great!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive teeth and cannot use the regular whitening strips so I ordered these instead. They did not bother my teeth too much but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference as far as the whitening aspect. Neutral.</li>
    <li> I have always used crest whitestrips. I find this product to be amazing. The one thing to take into consideration is that these are good for sensitive teeth, but this also means they don&#x27;t whiten as fast or noticeably as the other whitestrips. Every once in a while I get the stronger whitestrips but sometimes they make my teeth get extra sensitive. These are great for my somewhat sensitive teeth, and overall they do a pretty good job whitening my teeth. I would recommend these whitestrips, just don&#x27;t expect them to make your teeth instantly white.</li>
    <li> Product is disappointedly bad.  I have used this type of Crest strip before &amp; been pleased, but this particular &amp;#34;gentle routine&amp;#34; type is cheep cheep cheapo!  Strips will not stay in place.  I used double application &amp; did get whitening but will not buy this again. These strips will not adhere well at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Bought it of my daughter for Christmas, she loved it.  Great product, would definatley recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These really work, and good price too.</li>
    <li> I used the Crest 3D white vivid strips. I have very sensative teeth so 20 minutes before I apply them I use either a toothache or mouth sore OTC medication. I leave it on for the 20 minutes or so and then wipe it off before I apply the strips. It does not effect the whitening effects at all. The first time I couldn&#x27;t keep them on for the whole time and I couldn&#x27;t even apply it to the bottom teeth it hurt so bad.....but now I&#x27;m able to get the whitening effects I wanted!</li>
    <li> I tried the regular 3D and its a little too strong for my teeth. I tried it and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was pretty disappointed with my results...or I should say lack of results. I&#x27;ve always been a little self conscious of my teeth so I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. Well after a month I haven&#x27;t been able to notice much of a difference. Satisfaction guaranteed didn&#x27;t follow through this time &amp; I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I knew these were supposed to be used for more subtle results, but the results were too subtle because they did not remove stains from my teeth as well as I needed them to. I will stick with the original from now on because those have always worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> Work as intended and very well. These strips also do not cause my gums to be &#x27;sore&#x27; after use or my teeth to feel slightly sensitive to things after using them, yet they still seem to work just as well as the non-sensitive whiteners by Crest.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was pleased. On-line I can pay half the price as in a drug store. As a maintenance product it works very well.</li>
    <li> Love these! They&#x27;re perfect because my teeth are super sensitive and they don&#x27;t make my teeth sore. Love them and my new smile!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m day 3 into the 28 day routing with these white strips. I haven&#x27;t experienced any pain WHAT-SO-EVER. I have even took the advice from other reviewers and left them on for approx 30 min a day. Pain was my main concern when I was looking for whitestrips. I have sensitive teeth and was not gonna make my teeth and gums hurt just to get them whiter. As for if they work or not I cannot attest to that since I&#x27;ve only used them for 3 days but I think I can tell a little difference already and the MOST important thing is NO pain!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I usually end up with sensitive teeth after whitening and less than stellar results. Not so with product. Not only do my teeth not hurt, but after only 2 days I am noticing whiter, brighter teeth. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and the normal white strips are unbearable for my teeth. These are great, you only use them for five minutes everyday. I have had no gum or teeth pain and have already noticed a difference in my teeth in 3 days. I will stick with the gentle version from now on.</li>
    <li> I have major tooth sensitivity to whitening strips, so I tried this gentle routine and love it! No sensitivity problems, but still getting good whitening results.</li>
    <li> For me, leaving these strips on for a mere 5-10 minutes showed no results after 2 weeks.. So, I tried to increase the time I would leave them on to 20-30 minutes, and I saw whiter teeth - but any &#x27;gentleness&#x27; was out the window - my teeth were in aching pain for hours after each use. These are essentially the same exact strips as their basic ones, they just ask you to leave them on for a shorter period of time. Another frustration for me is it makes my bottom teeth look cracked, dull and and awful because it brings out any flaws in your teeth and makes them pop. I still use them occasionally, but the more I do the less I like them.</li>
    <li> I have supersensitive teeth. I tried the crest whitening strips vivid White program, and two days following the directions left me in excruciating pain, so much so that I could not continue using them.  Before that, I had tried other products as well with similar experiences.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give these a shot and I&#x27;m glad that I did so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After noting that others had stated the five-minute direction time was too short, I decided to increase my time gradually.  I tried five or six days of five minutes at a time, and when I didn&#x27;t feel the excruciating pain I had felt with other types of strips, I gradually increased my time. I now do about 10 minutes every day or every other day. I have noticed some increased sensitivity now that the weather is getting cooler, but still nothing compared to what I had felt with other strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, these are a keeper. The results are not at all dramatic; in fact, for a while I questioned whether they were working at all. However, I have looked back at pictures of myself before I used the product, and there is a difference.  Given the fact that I am unable to use other products, this is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. Three years ago, I used the more aggressive whitening product from Crest Whitestrips. It did an amazing job of whitening. However, I hated the feel/taste of the gel for 15-30 min/day, and my teeth felt sensitive after use. I just finished using the Gentle formula, and I liked that I only needed to leave it on for 5 min/day, and it did remove stains that have gradually built up over the last three years, kind of like a mild polish. No tooth sensitivity. I think this product accomplishes what it advertises.</li>
    <li> These do work good on sensitive teeth, but I didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference. Maybe I didn&#x27;t leave them on long enough..</li>
    <li> This product was purchase in order to try and see if it really works. Till today I am sure, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Crest 3d White Gentle Routine Teeth Whitening Strips 28 Count&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product as describe. But I would prefer to buy a stronger ones next time.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth (even to the point of having gum surgery), so when I whiten my teeth, I prefer to buy the gentle routine version. I think they work wonderfully, even after just one use! I do feel a tad sensitive after using, but that is typical with any teeth whitening product you buy. Just make sure to dry your teeth with a towel before placing on the white strips, and they should stay on. This is also the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen this product.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for sensitive teeth. I use every other day and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth.  They work great</li>
    <li> my teeth get stained from drinks, etc. easily, plus i do have sensitive teeth. That&#x27;s why i wanted to buy this product. However, the result seems to be a little too weak. I left it on for 30 mins to an hour. The results are pretty much the same. I guess if you want a quick result, try a stronger one!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t hurt your teeth but results are only 2-3 shades lighter. Barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> These strips did not work for me.  They were very irritating to my gums even though they are supposed to be for sensitive teeth, but everyone is different.</li>
    <li> I use these because the longer application ones make my teeth hurt. These do the job and I get complemented all the time on my smile!</li>
    <li> Shipping took a LONG time....other than that all was good!</li>
    <li> great product works amazing</li>
    <li> They do a great job of whitening.  They are very pliable and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used past whitening strips and they would make my teeth hurt, I got this gentle kind and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth, BUT you see little results.</li>
    <li> My boyfriends has been using it and it seems to work quite well.  So far it hasn&#x27;t worked as well as professional teeth whitening but it works.</li>
    <li> I found it to be very gentle but didn&#x27;t feel that it removed stains, I have heard you can keep it on longer then the 5 minutes and still didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> All white strips work the thing is will it hurt ur teeth these dont and u only where them for 5min so thats good. Only problem which is important it&#x27;s messy smh yup messy after u use it . it leaves this glue feeling on ur teeth which u have to spit out which is nasty but the product does its job which is whiten ur teeth so</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gentle Routine before. They work great, without causing too much sensitivity. I&#x27;ve used other Crest 3D white products and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years they work well lower cost here than most stores,I get 2wks out of these</li>
    <li> I agree with many reviews, you need to leave them on longer. I leave them on for 25 minutes instead of 5, because that honestly that wouldn&#x27;t do anything. The notice is very subtle, and I might try another crest whitening with more results next time.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth, to the point where the water pic during a dentist&#x27;s cleaning usually makes me jump. So, I tried these strips with some hesitation, as I would worried they still wouldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; enough. I&#x27;m happy to report I haven&#x27;t had any problems! While I don&#x27;t see a drastic difference in my smile, I think they definitely work to remove the daily stains that accumulate (I&#x27;m a coffee drinker), and I like that they are quick and easy to use. After about a month of leaving them on for 10-15 minutes every night, I believe my smile is a shade or two whiter. If you are expecting a dramatic change, these probably aren&#x27;t for you. But if you, like me, want something that can subtly improve your smile without aggravating your sensitive teeth, these are worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love the product and it is work with me&lt;br /&gt; now  i have white teeth , thank you for this</li>
    <li> I can see these working and making a difference and I notice no increased sensitivity which has been a problem for me in the past! Plus I love that they are meant to be used for only five minutes, I can always fit them into my busy schedule.</li>
    <li> These definitely noticeably whitened my teeth but my teeth still were sensitive. I wore them for a couple hours at a time, though, which I don&#x27;t think is suggested but that way I got more teeth whitening for my money.</li>
    <li> This is the best teeth whitening I have ever used!! Great product recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Beyond thrilled with the results.  And my guns are not sensitive after using.</li>
    <li> Good for people with receding gums that leads to sensitivity when bleaching</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the time to go through all of these reviews to make sure that this comment has not already been offered, but these Crest products have an expiration date.  I think with a lot of products it doesn&#x27;t really matter if one uses them beyond the expiration date, or not, but my conclusion about these products is that if you use them beyond the expiration date, they will not work.  Considering that one of the ingredients is peroxide, and that most people never think that peroxide expires, it was a revelation to me that I think once this product is beyond its expiration date, it is useless, and for the price, you don&#x27;t want to end up with a worthless product.  This may be one of the reasons that people are seeing such variation with this product.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as original classic.  Wish they were made again.</li>
    <li> I have always been concerned with the appearance of my teeth being I have contact with numerous people on a daily basis. The price of the whitner strips keeps going up higher and higher in price; the ones I found on amazon were a great deal.</li>
    <li> I have used the Crest Whitestrips for years. I cannot use the new CD Whitestrips I just received.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t stick to my teeth.This never happened before. I like to return them since they are useless.&lt;br /&gt;Up to now I was very sastisfied with the results of my Crest Whitestrips.</li>
    <li> RESULTS ARE AMAZING! My teeth are SO WHITE! I never get sensitivity using these strips. With the regular strength strips my teeth would ache. These are the best and so effective!!</li>
    <li> I recommend getting advanced vivid for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;-does whiten SOMEWHAT if left on ~30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;-whitening looks natural: far from total whiteness you get from other products.&lt;br /&gt;-NO sensitivity at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;-takes the whole box for full results&lt;br /&gt;-takes longer&lt;br /&gt;-doesnt make teeth very white (for those who want it)&lt;br /&gt;-strips needs time to adhere to teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-strips can slip off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on for ~30 minutes a time. I suggest using two strip packs at a time occasionally to cover more teeth. will make teeth color look consistent</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this type ... prefer the professional effect , because this is toooo thin like a plastic bag ...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really good. Use them before you go to sleep and take them off the next day. You will see results.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and this seems to be the solution. I sometimes forget and leave them on for 15 - 20 minutes, but have experienced minimal increase in sensitivity and my teeth seem whiter. I&#x27;m only using them every few days too; my teeth didn&#x27;t need that much help (just a little added whitening).</li>
    <li> I am overall pretty happy with these strips.  Every time I used the regular white strips my teeth would hurt terribly after a few minutes.  When I use these, I do not get that feeling at all.  They whiten pretty well, probably not as effective as the regular white strips, and by that I mean I will probably have to use these for longer than I would use the regular ones.  They do work though and I will continue to use them for as long as I feel it is necessary.</li>
    <li> These work great and do not cost too much. I used them once a night, but more for the recommended amount of time, about twenty to thirty minutes, and felt no discomfort or sensitivity with my teeth or gums, which are usually quite sensitive. Started seeing results very quickly and loved the end result. Great for a gradual whitening or touch ups.</li>
    <li> It does work, good price, good product.</li>
    <li> Avid strip user. These will not hurt your teeth at all, I&#x27;ve left them on for 45 mins and no pain. But they are super flimsy and tenth to slide off more than the more intense treatments.</li>
    <li> I really did not notice any real difference is using this item. I am hesitant to give one start since this is the &amp;#34;gentle routine.&amp;#34; I have used Crest Strips in the past and have had much better results. I would recommend trying a stronger strength. Overall Crest makes really good products and I am sure I won&#x27;t have this problem again.</li>
    <li> No pain and slightly whiter teeth. But they could still go a shade or two whiter. After 2 full boxes of Gentle Routine I&#x27;m not seeing further improvement. Gonna try the Advanced, if no improvement from there I&#x27;ll assume my teeth are as white as they&#x27;ll ever be.</li>
    <li> Finally, a whitening system that does not hurt. This stuff is great! With time you can def. see the difference. I am a huge coffee drinker and by the end of the week I could see the difference. The instructions say to leave for 5 mins, but I leave it on for 30 mins and I feel that it helps. The price is kinda high, but not as high as what the retail pharmacies have it for.</li>
    <li> even though it is for sensitive teeth , i found some pain after use it . i leave it 30 min not 5 min as directed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitestrips for almost ten years now on and off again for everyday whitening and for special occasions. These are the first ones I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or pain AT ALL. Usually I can&#x27;t do a whole hour with the other versions from crest because I get a shooting pain or am really sensitive to cold the next day. Not with these. I use them two to three times a week for ten minutes versus the five recommended. It&#x27;s taken longer than the others but that&#x27;s to be expected. After about two weeks I really noticed the difference. I also drink a lot of coffee and it fights through those stains!</li>
    <li> Years back, I purchased a teeth whitening in a box.  It wasn&#x27;t for sensitive teeth. My teeth got noticed, but I would get some pretty good zingers and decided, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it. I have a front left tooth dental implant which was matched to my teeth long ago. I have noticed for some time now that my other front tooth looked shades off from the implant. I was hesitant on buying Crest 3d White Whitestrips Gentle Routine because I read comments where it &amp;#34;took too long,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Didn&#x27;t see a difference.&amp;#34; I thought that I would give it a try because it was better than nothing and I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to get the regular brand that caused pain. Today is day 16 of using them. All of my teeth that I used the product on match my dental implant exactly. So there is my proof that this product did work. I am such a SKEPTIC! I will say though that I used it every day for an hour a day for 16 days. Also, I don&#x27;t drink anything but spring water and I use milk on my cereal. Once in a great while I will have a Ginger Ale when I go out to eat. So even though my teeth were a few shades off from my implant after years of not treating them, my teeth were not stained with coffee, tea, or smoke. Not sure if I would have gotten these results as I did this quickly if my teeth were stained. I&#x27;m sure it would have taken a lot longer. I am going to stop using this every day now because there is no need too. I have plenty left to use once a week for maintenance.  I will definitely buy this again. Bottom line, this product does work.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended to do, long as you brush/floss you&#x27;ll get the white teeth you&#x27;re looking for in a good amount of time</li>
    <li> I cannot use these unless I want my exposed roots to be hyper sensitive for many days after using them.</li>
    <li> Worked great. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> my teeth had grown quite yellow from smoking and drinking copious amounts of coffee.  im not even finished with the box yet but there is a --substantial-- difference in my teeth.  they&#x27;ve worked excellently.</li>
    <li> We bought these not being sure if they would really work, but we are seeing a difference. I would recommend these to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have tooth sensitivity and need a product that takes this into consideration . This fits the bill perfectly . It&#x27;s all in how long you leave it on and how often you use it. Have patience and the product does exactly what it advertises !! I also use it with toothpaste and mouthwash that is for sensitive teeth. It&#x27;s very reasonable in price through Amazon , much more so than in our local stores. I noticed a change in one use and I left it on for 10 min. And used it 3 times the first week but cut to 2 times the second week due to very slight sensitivity.  Perfect for me !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note to add: 2-26-13&lt;br /&gt;I still rate this product as perfect, but it was much MORE perfect when it sold for 20.64 in January 2013 just a month ago. This has happened to me several times recently on Amazon to products I tried at a great price and went to reorder and noted a signifiant price increase. I&#x27;m not sure if this a bait and switch or free enterprise! I just had to say it. Mostly you can&#x27;t beat Amazon prices. Just know your prices !!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a whitener that would not irritate my extremely sensitive teeth. This definitely does not. As everyone says, it is less powerful than a non-gentle formula. I was even able to wear them up to 20-30 minutes a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned from my dentist awhile back to use Act mouthwash when you have sensitive teeth (because it doesn&#x27;t dry out teeth like Listerine). I do think this is an important step. I notice on the days when I haven&#x27;t been using it sometimes the strips do seem a bit irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though they&#x27;re the gentle formula, they still hurt if they come into contact with the gums. This means I have to position the top strip below the gum line and cut the bottom strip in half to avoid the gumline. I also line my gums with Vaseline to avoid getting any of the gel on them. However the strips are much better at getting around this problem than gel tray type whitening products in which it is very hard to prevent overspill on the gums.</li>
    <li> Before this product I used Crest classic whitening  112 pkg  and this last one Crest whitening Gentle  was not as good. And would not order that again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda</li>
    <li> works with time...they really do work...</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make your teeth any whiter... Waste of money.. If you want to get whiter teeth just go to a dentist and get them whitened!</li>
    <li> These worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I used these until I discovered a UV teeth whitener, these made my teeth really sensitive but did the job so I put up with the sensitivity but they are no longer in my daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this review you&#x27;re obviously in the market for a teeth whitener give the UV whitening a try, you simply paint a special gel on your teeth with a small brush  (about the size of a nail polish brush) on your teeth and apply an Ultraviolet light mouth piece that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results &amp; hope I was helpful!&lt;br /&gt;THUMBS UP</li>
    <li> They work, be patient but it won&#x27;t even take that long to notice a diff. I use after brushing. I bought a lot..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product that does what it says without being too harsh.  I would buy it again.  Just don&#x27;t expect a sparkling white smile.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product religiously and, I have to admit, with good results since her teeth look nice and white.  She likes the fact that it does not take too long so she can wear the strips while putting on her make-up.  A satisfied customer, for sure!</li>
    <li> everyhing was perfect-  Came in a sealed box as described-  Worked perfect!!  I couldn&#x27;t use the newer brands because they hurt my teeth but this was perfect!</li>
    <li> Those whitening strips are great but actually one of my teeth stared to hurt in the fifth minute of using this and then I realized that happened because it was touching my gums in in that area now it does touch my gums on other teeth bun I don&#x27;t know what is wrong whit that one .&lt;br /&gt;Now when I use it I just don&#x27;t let the step to touch my gums near that tooth not the front part or the back.</li>
    <li> Does the job, and gently</li>
    <li> Still hurt my teeth. Had to stop after two uses.</li>
    <li> I would recomend to u, that u use it in the evening. I used to do the 30 min option every day. After 20 min the strip for the downteeth was away, but the upper one was still and much longer there. I would also recommend to u that u drink a lot before using it, a half an hour is longer that it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it do what it should do, but not more. If u want really white teeth I would say, go to the dentist ;-)</li>
    <li> They were gentile enough that I didn&#x27;t have much problem with sensitivity. I used them 3 days in a row then took a day or two off. Great results without the pain.</li>
    <li> I just finished my last one and I think I see a difference.  I have sensitive teeth so I tried this for my first whitening experience.  I&#x27;m not disappointed but not that impressed.  Maybe I will try the stronger type next...</li>
    <li> I worn the strips for several days now and so far my teeth appear to be getting whiter. The application was easy and the removal was not a problem. I wear the strips in the evening after eating my last meal so it does not interfere with my day activities. It does leave a glue type substance but that is easy to remove by brushing your teeth. So far, I like the product.</li>
    <li> I am a dental assistant, I have straight teeth and always get compliments, but I wanted my teeth to be white. These work great! What I do is wear them for 20 min and do it twice a month instead of everyday for 5 min. I saw results the first time I did it!</li>
    <li> I bought the gentle strips because I read another&#x27;s review on Amazon.  The other reviewer was correct; use these strips and leave them on for 45-60 minutes and you (I did) get the same results as the more expensive, stronger strips. My program is to use them after my last bit of food (around10pm) then my final brushing after removing the strips.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I reached the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; level I wanted I then skipped a few days until the coffee stains reapeared. I am 72 and like having nice white teeth. Oh yeah, and all my teeth not just a few. :):)</li>
    <li> they didn&#x27;t say good deal for the price. I don&#x27;t know what else to write about this.  It&#x27;s okay is all I have to say.</li>
    <li> these are a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest White Strips for years and have not been disappointed.  I constantly get compliments about how white my teeth are.  I will continue to use this product until I can no longer purchase it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a more powerful whitening system, but I just got the basic. I wish it had been maybe a couple levels higher, the level one is made of cheap strips when the level 3-5 are on point</li>
    <li> I used the strips everyday for about a half an hour instead of the 5 min it states in the directions. I never really felt any sensitivity (which was great) but I didn&#x27;t really see to much of an improvement either. Maybe next time I will try a stronger product.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for the slight tea/coffee stains on my lower teeth.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and have used the regular whitestrips before with terrible pain. These don&#x27;t hurt me at all. I do find that they&#x27;re less effective, though, too - but I&#x27;m okay with less whitening and no pain. Might try these twice a day moving forward to get the same results as regular.</li>
    <li> Great product without all the expense of the dentist.</li>
    <li> So &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; it doesnt do anything :P Perhaps if you have super sensitive teeth and are reeaally set on using a whitening product do this, but I use Sensodyne whitening toothpaste and have excellent results. If you feel the need for extra whitening, just use the regular ones infrequently/ shorter times.</li>
    <li> mush easier on gums versus regular which is irritating</li>
    <li> Product works fine. Recieved quicklyafter order.</li>
    <li> these whitening strips were easy to use,there just was not a hugely noticeable difference in teeth whiteness though. oh well</li>
    <li> Perfect for people that have sensitive teeth! Gives you that white shine without the additional pain</li>
    <li> this product is great for sensitive teeth! i sometimes leave them on for 10-15 minutes abd have NO pain. the original strength strips used to have me in tears after only 1 minutes.</li>
    <li> The price is a little too high on this and patience will find it cheaper, however the seller shipped it fast and the product is good for weekly whitening or even a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try the strips to see what they do. They do lighten some. I will try the higher number next time.</li>
    <li> no problems delivered as promised. Works well. I have sensitive teeth. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth go for vivid for that really bright smile.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. will continue to buy this</li>
    <li> I should have spent the extra money and gotten the original professional whitening strips. These strips do not adhere well to your teeth; they shift as soon as your lips go over your teeth and when your lips move. I have no clue how well these work since I can&#x27;t get them to stay on longer than 30 seconds. Take my word... spend the extra money and get the original.</li>
    <li> These work great on my teeth.  I wanted to try the gentle one since using the regular one made my gums sensitive.  I ended up leaving them on a little longer and they work great.  I don&#x27;t even have to use the whole box to get pearly whites.  These are also a great deal on Amazon.</li>
