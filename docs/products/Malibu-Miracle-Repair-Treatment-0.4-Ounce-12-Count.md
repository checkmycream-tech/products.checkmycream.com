      <li>and oh so happy to have my hair back (and even better)! :)</li>
      <li>After 1st application made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>In fact, I still felt like I had to lightly condition my hair</li>
      <li>Lightened my blonde hair, softened,  made shiny and felt great.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>When I use Malibu Miracle treatment, my hair is shining and smooth.</li>
      <li>Given our extreme water situation I believe this is a very good conditioner, I have seen results despite the water here.</li>
      <li>My scalp was better my hair was softer by far and way more manageable.  </li>
      <li>My hair has never looked healthier than when I use this product to clean it up.</li>
      <li>I feel like this is a good buy, I will buy it in a bottle next time however.</li>
      <li>It felt really good after use, and definitely will keep using.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and works I will purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>I love the feel and the way it makes my hair looks,being a natural</li>
      <li>I love Malibu products in general.</li>
      <li>Soft, smooth....</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says, repairs damaged and overprocessed hair.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.</li>
      <li>Conditioner works very well...</li>
      <li>Use this product once/week and hair is much stronger and healthier</li>
      <li>This build up my hair again when I really needed it.</li>
      <li>With as much hair as I have, I had to use 5 (of the 12)</li>
      <li>This product did improve the elasticity of my hair...and the overall quality and feel of it.... didn&#x27;t completely reverse all the damage but have purchased 12 more... will continue to use once to twice a week.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely headed in the right direction now!  </li>
      <li>It smells suspiciously like a vitamin C serum, which is typically used in lotions/serums that have more of a drying affect than moisturizing or conditioning.  </li>
      <li>My new hair stylist turned me onto this product.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair so soft!  </li>
      <li>use it weekly and my hair is getting stronger with less shedding after each application.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to buying more for future use.</li>
      <li>Hair is soft and non-greasy after use.</li>
      <li>Wow, is all I can say.  </li>
      <li>and I used this conditioner after to help keep the natural minerals from drying out my highlighted hair.  </li>
      <li>at least most of my hair had the product on it.  </li>
      <li>this eaves my daughter&#x27;s hairy silky soft after using the Swimmer Repair Weekly treatment.</li>
      <li>I color my hair, blow dry it and use a hot iron every day.  </li>
      <li>The hard water and dry climate of my beautiful mtn village have left my hair looking and feeling coarse and dry.</li>
      <li>I just live this product I will be purchasing in the bottle next time</li>
      <li>I just used this last night on my 6-yr old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be perfect, but it leaves my hair really dry and puffy and still red at the ends and damaged :(  </li>
      <li>That said, after this last high/low light I noticed my hair being less shiny and feeling dry.  </li>
      <li>The hair repair changed my dried out hair the first use.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, silky and shiny all day long!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it work on my hair type I have silver and black hair</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I have very dry hair and I also have it colored!  Instead of adding moisture I felt it dryed my hair even more!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend but my experience with it was bad, bad, bad. The first time I used it, it dried out my hair terribly. The second time I used 2 packets instead of 1 and left it in over 15 min. thinking it would increase its effectiveness. Same result...dry, brittle and frizzy hair! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product at all.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that keeps my hair from feeling like straw from daily pool use. I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! We recently moved to a home with softened water and my hair always felt dry and not quite the same as when I washed my hair with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; water. In one treatment, I have softer and silkier hair! I was shocked and oh so happy to have my hair back (and even better)! :)</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product, especially if you swim a lot.  I use the weekly swim solution and the swimmer&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Wow, is all I can say.  My hair has never looked healthier than when I use this product to clean it up.</li>
    <li> I just used this last night on my 6-yr old daughter&#x27;s hair.  This morning it was so silky and I could just run my fingers through - no tangles!  The summer swimming really made her hair bad. It&#x27;s definitely headed in the right direction now!  Great product.  I also have the leave-in conditioning mist now and swimmer&#x27;s wellness pack I&#x27;ll use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use when I travel.  I went on vacation to the mineral springs of Costa Rica and I used this conditioner after to help keep the natural minerals from drying out my highlighted hair.  I also use this product after coloring my hair and it has improved the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> Ive used the treatment about 5 or six times now. It makes my hair feel silky and smooth. I use it after swimming in the ocean.</li>
    <li> This product did no better than using a generic conditioner.  I was very disappointed with it.  I had heard it was great, but did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Feels like a deep conditioning treatment. I am happy with the product and the ease of using it, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This works great at repairing damaged hair and I will purchase more of it</li>
    <li> Saw a difference after the first use the shedding decreased immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I use it weekly and my hair is getting stronger with less shedding after each application.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to buying more for future use.</li>
    <li> LOve it! Same treatment as at salons!! Great value for the money! Use this product once/week and hair is much stronger and healthier</li>
    <li> this eaves my daughter&#x27;s hairy silky soft after using the Swimmer Repair Weekly treatment. Great addition to after pool regimen.</li>
    <li> This build up my hair again when I really needed it. Works great and smells great. Love Malibu miracle repair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take the red out of my hair that my well water was leaving in it.  Based on other reviews I thought this would be perfect, but it leaves my hair really dry and puffy and still red at the ends and damaged :(  Not at all what I thought.</li>
    <li> This product did improve the elasticity of my hair...and the overall quality and feel of it.... didn&#x27;t completely reverse all the damage but have purchased 12 more... will continue to use once to twice a week. will purchase in the future and will recommend to friends! hair type- oily, dry, damage, thin</li>
    <li> This treatment brought my hair back from the brink due to hard water at home</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have ever used on my fine hair.  I use just a dab in the mornings, leave in, and style.  My hair is soft, silky and shiny all day long! Has more body and looks fuller than ever.</li>
    <li> Best hair repair! After 1st application made a huge difference in my hair. Lightened my blonde hair, softened,  made shiny and felt great.</li>
    <li> This product was definitely a miracle for my over processed-weak hair. It made it softer, stronger and it feels like hair again instead of straw.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product!  It does exactly what it says, repairs damaged and overprocessed hair.  It is easy to use and works I will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> When I use Malibu Miracle treatment, my hair is shining and smooth. I only wish it came in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have well wAter dries out my hair ... Conditioner works very well... Would recommend this product.. Why do I have to say this  recommendation in so many words!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair so soft!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this one-felt like it did nothing for my hair!</li>
    <li> Love this love this love this!!!  My youngest spends her entire summer in the pool, which means so does her dad and I.  This is a great weekly treatment that helps prevent crunchy pool hair!!  Hair is soft and non-greasy after use.</li>
    <li> awesome product and very good price it is very effective on the hair  mine is dry and with one application I had felt and seen the difference....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40, with long (waist length) hair that is brown and professionaly high/low lighted every 6 weeks.  My hair is not over-processed; I wash it every other day.  When left curly, I&#x27;ll use mousse/sleek serum and a little hair spray to &#x27;scrunch&#x27; before using a diffuser to dry.  When straightened, I&#x27;ll use mousse/sleek serum and a paddle brush with boar bristles.  That said, after this last high/low light I noticed my hair being less shiny and feeling dry.  So I went in search of some help and found this product.  With as much hair as I have, I had to use 5 (of the 12) packets just to get my fingers through it and feel like all or at least most of my hair had the product on it.  I covered with a plastic bag (while in the shower) and then wrapped in a towel while I went ahead with the rest of my shower, then rinsed.  I&#x27;ll admit I was hoping for a miracle, yet none transpired.  In fact, I still felt like I had to lightly condition my hair once I rinsed this out, even though the directions read as if this product were the last step.  It smells suspiciously like a vitamin C serum, which is typically used in lotions/serums that have more of a drying affect than moisturizing or conditioning.  I&#x27;ll use the rest of what I have some other day, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was, but I still use it to deep condition my hair.  I bought it because I thought it was the cleaning crystals used for hard water and pre-color treatment.  I love Malibu products in general.</li>
    <li> It has helped my hair a lot</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product.  Made my hair feel absolutely wonderful and soft.  It felt really good after use, and definitely will keep using.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff on my hair</li>
    <li> I just live this product I will be purchasing in the bottle next time I love the feel and the way it makes my hair looks,being a natural I need the nutrients without the hard chemical stuff.And it has amazing slip. 👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I thought this was the crystals to repair and take out chlorine!  Just a deep conditioner!  My bad</li>
    <li> I feel like this is a good buy, I will buy it in a bottle next time however. I am hoping I see a better result after we move to a place with much better water. We live in an area with a lot of mineral and hard water issues. There is softeners here but that is just adding salt to make the water bearable. Given our extreme water situation I believe this is a very good conditioner, I have seen results despite the water here. I recommend this for anyone with damaged hair or just to help protect hair.</li>
    <li> The hard water and dry climate of my beautiful mtn village have left my hair looking and feeling coarse and dry. My new hair stylist turned me onto this product.  Soft, smooth....my hair and I are happy to have joined up with this Malibu product.</li>
    <li> I like all the Malibu products. I color my hair, blow dry it and use a hot iron every day.  The hair repair changed my dried out hair the first use. This is by far the best hair repair/conditioner I have ever used.  It isn&#x27;t just a wax to coat your hair to make you think it is better (Pantene).  My scalp was better my hair was softer by far and way more manageable.  My hair dresser said they charge $20 for each Malibu treatment! I&#x27;m too happy to be able to buy it here for about a dollar a treatment instead!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have curly hair and my curly haired goddess of a hair stylist had me get this for after I color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM NOT OKAY WITH THE PRICE ALMOST DOUBLING SINCE I LAST ORDERED! SHAME ON YOU, AMAZON!</li>
