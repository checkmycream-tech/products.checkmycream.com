      <li>and I immediately ordered the full size.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>Smooth locks from that line is worth trying if you like this Bumble and Bumble product.</li>

      <li>Fantastic product, I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s worth five stars.</li>
      <li>Lasts forever so worth the price.</li>
      <li>it is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>and I always end with Invisible oil to tame fly aways.</li>
      <li>I prefer Prep and/ or this Invisible primer spray, then Styling lotion/ spray, followed by Straight or Full form mouse depending on the look</li>
      <li>Personally, I Like ColorProof line better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s A 10 - light texture and leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>but you always get free stuff when buying with BB direct site FYI</li>
      <li>This does exactly what it says</li>
      <li>I get absolutely zero frizz with either product, even when the humidity mounts.  </li>
      <li>My style held it&#x27;s shape really well, thanks to the BB products I used.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.</li>

      <li>With these few products, I have a good hair day nearly every day.  </li>
      <li>This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that has conisistently made my hair feel healthy and strong each time I use it, and is allowing it enough strength to actually grow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair that has been chemically processed.</li>
      <li>only problem I will say is that when I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is still very brittle - meaning it only works as it is being used and doesn&#x27;t penetrate for long term repair - but still, it is worth applying each day for the healthy look and feel it brings.</li>

      <li>This stuff is totally keeping the cold weather static at bay and doesn&#x27;t flatten my fine hair at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. My hair has been damaged beyond repair for over a year now and I have gone through product after product trying to find something to revive it. Each time I thought I found a good one, it would help my hair temporarily then end up weighing it down and damaging it worse after multiple uses. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that has conisistently made my hair feel healthy and strong each time I use it, and is allowing it enough strength to actually grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I will say is that when I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is still very brittle - meaning it only works as it is being used and doesn&#x27;t penetrate for long term repair - but still, it is worth applying each day for the healthy look and feel it brings. Oh, and it smells tropical and calming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this product and would recommend it time and time again.</li>
    <li> Seems to work, will find out</li>
    <li> Ordered this by accident but figured, &#x27;ah what the hell..&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Now everyday I look in the mirror and think to myself, &#x27;Bitch, I&#x27;m fabulous&#x27;</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive, but it really makes my dry hair feel soft and adds some shine to it. It also has a really nice, light smell.  A little bit goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, so pricey but so good for my blond damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;Just smells de-lish!</li>
    <li> Best heat protectant I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair an doesn&#x27;t make it crispy an it actual works. I have noticed a dramatic difference in my hair I haven&#x27;t had a trim in months an still no split ends.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair feel silky.  It smells like summer!!  My new go-to hair product.</li>
    <li> Nice product, delivered as promised. Seller recommended !!!</li>
    <li> This product completely eliminates frizz!  I live in Florida where the humidity is ghastly and it really does what it promises. Today the humidity was 92% and I had absolutely no funky ugly frizz! My style held it&#x27;s shape really well, thanks to the BB products I used. This primer is concentrated so it doesn&#x27;t take much..  It also leaves my hair really shiny and it protects against the damage cause by heated styling tools.  I use it on damp (not wet) hair and let it dry overnight.  The next day I use Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Does It All spray and use a curling iron to create loose waves.  The combination of these two B and B products gives me shiny, bouncy hair that&#x27;s soft and supple and not dried out at all.  I use a separate finishing hairspray, Nexxus Comb Thru or Toni and Guy flexible hold hairspray, so I can conserve the B and B spray which is really expensive.  Comb Thru and Toni and Guy both give me touchable, brushable hold that even works on my hard-to-hold hair and lasts into the next day.  With these few products, I have a good hair day nearly every day.  Granted, the B and B products are pricey but my years long search for hair products that actually do what they claim is over.  I no longer have to stash the ones that don&#x27;t work under the sink or in the hall closet. Now  I can actually throw out a bunch of stuff that never lived up to the hype.  I recently got my hair cut and I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to style it like I wanted.  However, with these products my hair actually looks like the picture I gave my stylist!  So I&#x27;m a customer for life.  I buy my B and B products at Sephora, where the prices are better than on Amazon.  I&#x27;m not taking any stars off for the price because, unlike other high end and drugstore products I&#x27;ve tried, this stuff really works and that&#x27;s worth five stars. I definitely recommend this primer (there&#x27;s nothing like it!) as well as the other products I&#x27;ve mentioned.but perhaps not quite as shiny as BB primer.  It too is very lightweight and would be suitable for fine hair.  When money is an issue, I use Smooth Criminal.  I&#x27;ve noticed that whichever primer I use, my styling products seem to work better.  My hair also seems to dry faster.  I think the trick is to spray them on damp (not wet) hair that&#x27;s been towel dried well.  I get absolutely zero frizz with either product, even when the humidity mounts.  Smooth Criminal is not as thick as BB but they do pretty much the same thing, although SC comes in a somewhat smaller container.  BB is more concentrated though. If you&#x27;re hair is especially frizzy give one of these primers a try. They won&#x27;t weigh your hair down like silicone serum will.  Smooth Criminal runs about $8 at Sally&#x27;s but much to my dismay, my local stores seem to be out of stock quite frequently.  You don&#x27;t have to spray a lot of it for it to work beautifully.  If cost were not an issue (when is it NOT an issue?) then I definitely recommend BB.  I think it&#x27;s the addition of the oil in BB that makes a difference.  But if you&#x27;re watching your pennies, give Smooth Criminal a shot.  Hopefully, you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> A this point I have only used a few times and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Great sun protectant and easy to apply, does not leave oily look.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair stylist to help with dry hair from styling. Ever since using the Invisible Oil Primer, my hair has look so much healthier even with blow drying and styling tools. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product a lot, and plan to buy more. The customer service was okay, didn&#x27;t seem to have any problems. Wish it were easier to find, seems to be a popular item</li>
    <li> Works great before I blow-dry making my hair soft and easily manageable.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It does not weigh my hair down at all. It keeps it so soft and manageable and smells great. I have long, fine hair that has been chemically processed.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair silky with no oil residue, I love that it is a spray</li>
    <li> Love this product. I feel my hair has protection and volume now!</li>
    <li> My hair looks great after using this product. I highly recommend it! it is definitely worth the price. My hair is softer and smells really good after using it.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair so I don&#x27;t want to weigh it down, but it gets sooo staticky in the winter. This stuff is totally keeping the cold weather static at bay and doesn&#x27;t flatten my fine hair at all. Helps damaged hair behave like it&#x27;s not damaged by reducing friction between hairs.</li>
    <li> This is great to keep your hair in good condition from heat and styling.</li>
    <li> Great smell and feel. Concentrated so it doesn&#x27;t take much. Helps protect hair from the heat of a blow dryer and straightener. Only gave it 4 stars because of price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Makes your hair feel so soft and serves as a heat-protectant!</li>
    <li> This is the best spray! Keeps the frizz down ( I live in humid north Carolina) and makes my hair smooth and silky soft. Smells wonderful too! Lasts forever so worth the price. Seller shipped fast and on time. :-)</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  It&#x27;s lightweight, smells like candy and leaves hair frizz free!  I spray this on my hair after I&#x27;ve washed it and sometimes before I use heating tools!</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble products are the BEST for my hair with my well water. I worked in a salon for 10 years and none of the products delivered the results I have received with using BB products. Finally my search is over. I get salon style blow outs every time I use their products. Their products work better when layered. I prefer Prep and/ or this Invisible primer spray, then Styling lotion/ spray, followed by Straight or Full form mouse depending on the look I&#x27;m going for and I always end with Invisible oil to tame fly aways. I find using their shampoos first, a must to achieve perfect hair everytime. Finally. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is great but you always get free stuff when buying with BB direct site FYI</li>
    <li> My hair gets greasy quickly so I absolutely needed a product that would protect, without making it oily.  This is the perfect solution!</li>
    <li> Helps tame and style hair!</li>
    <li> Great product! I blow dry and straighten my hair a lot, so I need good products to hydrate and protect. This is similar to It&#x27;s A 10 - light texture and leaves hair feeling soft. I like that it protects against heat and UV rays.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample and I immediately ordered the full size. I have curly, frizzy color treated hair and this product worked like a charm. Love it.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but works. Personally, I Like ColorProof line better. Smooth locks from that line is worth trying if you like this Bumble and Bumble product. Both smell amazing too!</li>
    <li> Brilliant. Gives just enough shine without weighing my hair down. It&#x27;s not sticky and has a nice fragrance. I bought it for use on my ends, but now use it all over because it leaves my hair silky and I find blow-drying/styling to be easier.</li>
    <li> I am a runner and my hair ( under my pony tail) nots up into a sort of dreadlock. It takes a long time to comb out the knots. Now I spray this in before I put my hair up and, no more knots!!! And it smells great too !</li>
    <li> Works well in preventing frizz.  I have thick curly frizzy hair.  Keeps it shiny as well.</li>
    <li> I am really glad I tried this product. It smells wonderful, and leaves your hair feeling so soft and silky. All day! Sometimes I will lightly spray a little on again in the afternoon, just to freshen up. Its not heavy or greasy. I spray it on my hair when its damp, then style. Depending on what look I&#x27;m going for, I might even spray a little bit again on after I&#x27;ve finished flat ironing it so that my hair doesn&#x27;t look too &amp;#34;done.&amp;#34; The only thing I can complain about is that the price on Amazon is the same price as on Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s website ($27). And I think I have heard Bumble and Bumble will give you coupons or deals every now and then when you buy their products from their website. So, economically, this isn&#x27;t such a deal on Amazon. The seller should take that into consideration.</li>
