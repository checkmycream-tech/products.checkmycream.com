      <li>Disclaimer: This is an honest customer review.</li>
      <li>The views in this statement are strictly my own and I am not affiliated with any of these companies.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>nutrients and vitamins that are included here are a lot, it&#x27;s more like a multivitamin kind of pill, but more focused on the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have been using Hairsentials for a bit now, and I am quite pleased</li>
      <li>I love these vitamins.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for a company?</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll keep at it and hope for better results each time</li>
      <li>, my hair is more manageable and it&#x27;s not freezy like it used to.</li>
      <li>I will order another bottle to give it more of a chance to work.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>If taken, this product will help to nurture your hair when thinning and if that is not a problem continue to provide you with healthy hair that is thicker.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this product</li>
      <li>I am very excited and will keep you informed.</li>

      <li>love it, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good hair growth supplement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>- Exciting!</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to look into the mirror and see lots of new hairs growing in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right about how great my hair looks.</li>
      <li>taste it for a full 30 seconds</li>
      <li>Most that I&#x27;ve heard didn&#x27;t seem real</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>I give this my full recommendation!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was honestly quite surprised when I took out the measuring tape to see if I had</li>
      <li>There was no bad odor smell or aftertaste either which I have found a lot of supplements to have.</li>
      <li>The pills are coated in a yellowish-orange coating and a couple hours after taking this, my urine will come out super bright yellow.</li>
      <li>She asked me to mention that the tablets go down a bit easier with a glass of milk or coffee, but she&#x27;s had no problems taking them and would gladly take tablets twice this size if it meant more hair growth!</li>
      <li>thank you for putting out such an amazing vitamin</li>
      <li>So far this has been my favorite hair</li>
      <li>I was kind of thrown off by the smell, but I only have to smell/</li>
      <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m completely floored at this and just the right combination of everything, was worth the wait in getting it, with it came in more than a 30 day supply</li>
      <li>I have a natural glow without makeup and it looks very healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more more happier with this product, especially since there are many other &#x27;hair growth&#x27; supplements on the market.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pleased to say my sister is very happy with her progress with this product as she says she is already noticing are marked difference in the thickness and softness of her hair, which is usually wire-thin like mine!</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s also noted an increase in growth in just two weeks, particularly around the nape of her neck where her hairdresser recently trimmed a bit shorter than she would have liked.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really know there was a vitamin targeting your hair growth and health of your hair specifically!  </li>
      <li>My hair overall feels thicker, it has a bit more body</li>
      <li>Noticeable changes in the first month of using this product.  </li>
      <li>bottle comes in a pretty purple shiny box and holds 60 tablets.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d much rather takes these supplements than go through another chemical treatment!</li>
      <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>So I’m going to give this a fair shake for a few months.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m super excited to see a result after a month because progress is already starting to show</li>
      <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
      <li>my daughter still took them and nothing was positive about them</li>
      <li>I adore this really nothing like a Vitamin that does exactly what it claims been taking it for two days and my hair seems shinyier than it has</li>
      <li>My hair grows to a certain length and then it starts to breaks.</li>
      <li>already feels soooo much healthier.</li>
      <li>I take a high developer to my hair!</li>
      <li>My hair feels much nicer too</li>
      <li>I really empress with the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Another perk to this product that is not even mentioned on the bottle is that while taking you will find that your nails will grow at a much faster and healthier rate.</li>
      <li>The results I&#x27;ve gotten have been absolutely stellar.&lt;br</li>
      <li>am beginning to bald in one spot at the very front of my head.</li>
      <li>primary objective with this product was to restore my balding spot..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best vitamins for your hair ever</li>
    <li> I love these vitamins. I have noticed my hair getting thicker. There is also less shedding and breakage.  I will continue to use these vitamins. I really like the bottle is cute too!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. After 2wk I noticed a big change in my hair length. I haven&#x27;t been experiencing any breakage since I&#x27;ve been in using it. Even my nails have been looking and feeling stronger. I wish the pills weren&#x27;t so big. But, for the results they&#x27;ve been giving me I can deal with it. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I adore this really nothing like a Vitamin that does exactly what it claims been taking it for two days and my hair seems shinyier than it has my nails are getting stronger from one day of taking it, not only is that weird but wow! i&#x27;m completely floored at this and just the right combination of everything, was worth the wait in getting it, with it came in more than a 30 day supply though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine! I am not being paid by any of the mentioned companies or designers to make this review. The views in this statement are strictly my own and I am not affiliated with any of these companies.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t started using this yet, but from what I can tell from the ingredients and based off of previous products I have used, I think this is actually going to really work for me.  I was kind of thrown off by the smell, but I only have to smell/taste it for a full 30 seconds so I&#x27;m not too worried about that.</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairsentials by Flawless Botanics is a scientific formula with biotin, vitamin and nutrient components all designed to deliver 22 ingredients to your body for faster hair growth. If taken, this product will help to nurture your hair when thinning and if that is not a problem continue to provide you with healthy hair that is thicker.  Each ingredient has been ensured to provide nutrients for the roots to the tip. If you have ever suffered from having your hair cut too short or maybe you damaged your hair by coloring it too much or you simply want to grow your hair from short to long this is the product to help you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes in a pretty purple shiny box and holds 60 tablets. The dietary supplement is to be taken two times a day with at least 8 ounces of water. If you want to see results, remember this is not going to happen for you overnight. This is going to take time. Results are expected typically within three months time frame. This bottle is full of ingredient servings such as Vitamin A, C, E, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-6 and Biotin. The product is guaranteed or your money back. This bottle should last a full month and is made in the USA. Upon trying the pills, they were easy to swallow but not small in size and did not have a real bad taste to them. There was no bad odor smell or aftertaste either which I have found a lot of supplements to have.Another perk to this product that is not even mentioned on the bottle is that while taking you will find that your nails will grow at a much faster and healthier rate. I have short nails (because I bite them) and this almost instantly started to produce stronger, healthier and longer fingernails.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD. THANK YOU .</li>
    <li> Noticeable changes in the first month of using this product.  My hair is shedding less and bald patches are starting to grow in.  I couldn&#x27;t be more more happier with this product, especially since there are many other &#x27;hair growth&#x27; supplements on the market.</li>
    <li> I loved the product but am extremely annoyed of the fact that I was told I would receive an email for my $1 bottle and never got it!</li>
    <li> The yellow tablet were all cracked and broken my daughter still took them and nothing was positive about them I would not recommend them or purchase them again</li>
    <li> This is my first time taking a hair growth supplement (I didn’t know such a thing existed until recently!) I was intrigued, so after a bit of background reading on other supplements, biotin and dht… and some “should I, shouldn’t I” deliberating, I decided to give this one a go. There’s a lot of ingredients combined into this one supplement rather than having to buy them separately, including some antioxidants which I’ve only seen listed in ‘boutique’ (i.e really damn expensive!) skin &amp; beauty products.  So is my hair growing faster? Yes! And thicker too. I’ve been taking Hairsentials every morning, before breakfast, and I’m pleasantly surprised to see what I’d call “baby hairs” appearing at the front of my hairline after the first 3 and a half weeks - Exciting! My hair typically doesn’t seem to grow past a certain point at the back and sides but for the first time in ages I’ve started noticing fewer stray hair when tying it into a bun. My hair overall feels thicker, it has a bit more body and I’ve not changed or added anything else to my haircare regime… Pleased to say I’m impressed with my results! So I’m going to give this a fair shake for a few months. It’s now the end of March and I want to grow out some good length in time for our family holiday in June. Seems I’m on track to do that so long as I keep remembering to take my hair growth accelerator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference... and quickly. If you are looking for thicker hair, this is the product for you. I am thrilled to look into the mirror and see lots of new hairs growing in. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product this is day 3 and i have no side affects except bright neon urine but my body feels fully energized not only is it a vitamin for hair but it helps nourish my body i dont feel so tired and lazy especially with have a 3yr old... I chose this product because its cheaper then hairfinity and the reviews on amazon totally convinced  me and i was sold... thank you for putting out such an amazing vitamin and im hoping to keep up with this product for 3months.</li>
    <li> I am beginning to feel some new hair in different areas of my scalp.  No much yet but something is happening.  I am very excited and will keep you informed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased because up until a few weeks ago I was losing handfuls of hair after washing and drying. I was like a cat shedding its fur! MUCH less of a problem since I&#x27;ve been taking the hairsential pills. My hair feels much nicer too, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s as silky as it would be after a brazilian blowout but I&#x27;d much rather takes these supplements than go through another chemical treatment! My hair&#x27;s naturally curly / wavy and I can now run my medium density brush through my bed head without the brush snagging half as much. Thank you Flawless Botanics!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try vitamins that would help my nails, hair and skin look great. Most that I&#x27;ve heard didn&#x27;t seem real BUT these pills actually work. It&#x27;s only been a few days but my skin looks healthier already. I have a natural glow without makeup and it looks very healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I really empress with the quality of the product. It helps my dry hair a lot. Now no hair line splitting. It is a good product. Thanks Gamil</li>
    <li> Awesome customer service. I&#x27;m still taking them, my hair is better but it was so badly that it will take some time. I can say shedding is less and it&#x27;s healthier .</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of hairsentials for my sister as I&#x27;ve heard her mention biotin for hair growth in conversation. After flicking through a couple of similar products I decided on this one as the list of ingredients seemed very complete. I&#x27;m pleased to say the customer service from the seller is excellent, as I asked a couple of questions about the dht blockers and received good, prompt responses. Always a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased to say my sister is very happy with her progress with this product as she says she is already noticing are marked difference in the thickness and softness of her hair, which is usually wire-thin like mine! She&#x27;s also noted an increase in growth in just two weeks, particularly around the nape of her neck where her hairdresser recently trimmed a bit shorter than she would have liked. She asked me to mention that the tablets go down a bit easier with a glass of milk or coffee, but she&#x27;s had no problems taking them and would gladly take tablets twice this size if it meant more hair growth! All in all, very happy and I&#x27;ll be re-ordering in a week&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> I love them!!! I&#x27;ve only been taking them a month and I&#x27;ve already experienced great results!! Getting ready to start my second bottle..I highly recommend these..</li>
    <li> I recently bleached my hair and cut it all off and my hair looks so damaged now and I&#x27;m so mad at myself for cutting it so I&#x27;m super excited to see a result after a month because progress is already starting to show and I love it! :) already feels soooo much healthier. definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> So far this has been my favorite hair vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;The nutrients and vitamins that are included here are a lot, it&#x27;s more like a multivitamin kind of pill, but more focused on the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking biotin everyday of my life because i am so prone with hair fall and hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;But we all know that biotin is just one of the good stuff that we need to take if we want to grow a healthy and stronger hair.&lt;br /&gt;This particular pills includes biotin and all the necessary nutrients and vitamins that helps us grow our hair faster and better.&lt;br /&gt;I use to take separate vitamins along with my daily biotin, but now I do not need to that anymore as this is already complete.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good hair growth supplement.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: This is an honest customer review. I was not paid or offered money for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beginning to bald in one spot at the very front of my head. It was recommended to me by 2 of my co-workers to try Hair Infinity. Both (one female and one male) like the product and said it helped restore growth in areas of their head that were balding or receding. I tried this product (Hair Essentials) instead because the ingredients were similar but this was $5 cheaper than Infinity. I purchased 2 bottles for 2 months worth as I read in the reviews that changes are visible only after the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hair did grow and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Facial hair grew in quicker any time I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;Nails grew back quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Did not salvage bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My primary objective with this product was to restore my balding spot.. This product claims to have DHT blockers that would prevent hair loss/balding due testosterone and ALSO to restore hair in areas were there was hair loss. The balding spot at the very front of my head only GREW LARGER despite taking these pills for 2 months straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional, each bottle comes with a coupon for a free bottle. I registered my coupon but never received a free bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have since started Hair Infinity and will be starting my second bottle soon. I will leave a review under that product if my bald spot improves.</li>
    <li> I have only been taking this product for ten days, and I can already see a difference in my hair. It&#x27;s not falling out as badly as it once did, and I can definitely tell a difference in how it is starting to come back thicker. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right about how great my hair looks. My hair has been thinning due to illness and taking a lot of medication. This supplement has started the process of reversing the damage and giving me my confidence back. If you are losing your hair for any reason, illness or age, I think you should at least give this product a try. The results I&#x27;ve gotten have been absolutely stellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given a voucher to try this product at a reduced price through Bloggers Required. This in no way changes my view on this product, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> USED IT FOR TWO MONTHS NO CHANGE IN MY HAIR  :(</li>
    <li> I have been taking these pills faithfully twice a day once at breakfast time and then at dinner time for the last 3 1/2 weeks, unfortunately I can not say that my hair loss has minimized, I still continue to lose as much hair as I did prior to taking hairsentials. I have noticed my urine to be very yellow almost fluorescent yellow in color. I will order another bottle to give it more of a chance to work. I do hope it gives me the same or slightly the same results that some other reviewers have stated.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that&#x27;s almost down to my waist. I refuse to get it cut short because I just like how feminine my long hair makes me feel. However, the weight of it plus the styling products/tools I use causes hair fall. I started using Vitamins for Hair Growth and hair Loss - and I must say that this one from Flawless Botanics is amongst my favorite brands! It works well and I can tell because I don&#x27;t clog my shower drains really bad like I used to! My hair has also been looking shinier and much more healthier! A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; supplement for people who want healthier hair like myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> These vitamins are interesting and work awesome! Until I tried these out I didn&#x27;t really know there was a vitamin targeting your hair growth and health of your hair specifically!  Since I started taking it I&#x27;ve noticed thicker, healthier hair that seems to shine a bit more! I have not had any negative side effects and the pills are a pretty average size! I&#x27;m pretty happy with how my hair has been feeling and looking! This is a pretty power packed vitamin that has helped my hair start to look awesome in a short time! I dye my hair often and do some crazy colors that leave my hair pretty damaged, I&#x27;m taking a break between dye jobs and this is making my hair recover amazingly. I think I&#x27;ll keep at it and hope for better results each time I take a high developer to my hair! The packaging is super pretty too, although it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with how great the product is I&#x27;m always happy when a product works great and looks great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> I received it quite fast, properly packaged. Can&#x27;t wait to see if there is any results. I already have long hair, ( down to the middle of my butt)  my hair is thin, I plan on cutting my hair and then see if there&#x27;s any difference in the thickness, and length.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep every updated.</li>
    <li> I worry about my hair a lot. I mean, it&#x27;s one of the first things people see. So I was offered a free bottle of hairsentials to try out. It is great. My hair grows to a certain length and then it starts to breaks. After taking these vitamins, I have noticed less breakage. My hair seems to have gone past that certain length slowly, but that is great progress for me! The capsules are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t leave any kind of bad taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I am delighted .Through week stopped hair loss</li>
    <li> To weeks into the vitamins and they are definitely working! I see baby hair growing all over my head, my hair is more manageable and it&#x27;s not freezy like it used to. My hair still falls but is not as bad as before and i do need to trim it. But if in two weeks it has improved this much I can only imagine how better it will get in the future as long as i keep on using this pills!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this Hairsentials supplement for a couple of weeks now, and I have already started seeing results. My hair is medium to long length, and lately it seems to grow at a slower pace than it did a few years ago. I have been looking to try something to help my hair and boost up the growing process. I have been using Hairsentials for a bit now, and I am quite pleased so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about my hair, it is baby fine, color treated, dry, damaged, and brittle. I am on the quest for healthier hair, and I am finally on the right road now that I have been taking this supplement. My hair has grown almost a half inch already, and I am still not done taking the supplement. I was honestly quite surprised when I took out the measuring tape to see if I had results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any side effects from this supplement, no after tastes, or anything. For some this may be a bit of a TMI moment, but I will say that the pills did effect the color of my urine. The pills are coated in a yellowish-orange coating and a couple hours after taking this, my urine will come out super bright yellow. Nothing to be alarmed with, so if it happens to you, don&#x27;t worry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the Hairsentials supplement. It is doing wonders for my hair! I give this my full recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I have only tried 2 different types of Hair Supplements, these and Nature&#x27;s Bounty. The comparison between the two is drastic but work equally the same. However, I like these better because I feel like this focuses 100% more on your hair and works very quickly if taking 2 a day. Packaging is very girly and cute, these supplements smell reminded me of the hard Flinstones Chewable vitamins I use to take as a little girl. Best thing about Flawless Botanics, they give you a coupon to claim your 2nd bottle JUST FOR $1! THATS BASICALLY 2 BOTTLES OF HAIRSENTIALS FOR THE PRICE OF 1! What more can you ask for a company? They&#x27;re amazingly amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
