    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH ORDER, BEAUTIFUL</li>
    <li> It fell apart after 3 uses.</li>
    <li> this barette is a compliment getter. every time i wear it i&#x27;m asked if the stones are real and am told how beautiful it is</li>
    <li> grand daughter liked this....guess she ran straight to my sons girl friend to put it in.</li>
    <li> This product is so lovely I would consider getting it in many other colors if available. The stones are nicely set</li>
    <li> Would have preferred something smaller.  This piece is about 4&amp;#34; long, although the overlook is not bad. Just understand it is not petite.</li>
    <li> TThis clip is pretty, but I found it to be too heavy and it sticks out too far from my head</li>
    <li> Nice metal barette with a bit of sparkle from the rhinestones &amp; some gorgeous color also.

    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair barrette as it is a very nice one and pretty as well. I have long hair and needed something&lt;br /&gt;to pull my hair back. This is both helpful and pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to wear for a dance recital. It looks cheap but is a nice size.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these hair clips and they are inexpensive and very pretty.  Delivery from China takes a little long but once they arrive you will not be disappointed.  Jewelry for your hair, perfect for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Very fancy elegant barrette for the excellent  price,looks pretty in my long auburn hair.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap, but haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. Goes good with just about any outfit I have, but looks better against a darker background. Would probably order it again.</li>
    <li> this a beautiful barrette..  gave as gifts..  really nice</li>
    <li> the clip looks like it is much more expensive than they were</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but too heavy.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is small. The deep red color is very nice but the rhinestones don&#x27;t do anything for it.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty.  Great clip, holds my thick hair quite well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Poor quality NOT highly recommended. this hair clip is broken when I received ( straight in to the garbage can ). It just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, she was ecstatic. She absolutely loved it&lt;br /&gt;she wore it to work and she said that all her friends loved it. the quality&lt;br /&gt;is good, a very nice piece. the price is good.I would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> This barrette is solid and very shiny. Perfect for glam and glitz. Holds my fine blonde hair very well and stays put.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but did not hold my very thick hair well.  Get lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be just a little larger with a better holding clasp.</li>
    <li> I like this hair clip!</li>
    <li> So pretty and very well made.  I am impressed.  I decided to give it to my grand-daughter and may order another for me.</li>
    <li> Size is little big for me. Other then is good.</li>
    <li> This barrette is pretty, light-weight and holds my hair well.  The rhinestones are set tightly in the barrette and none have fallen out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Came quickly and in perfect condition. The service was great. I would recommend it to anyone and is perfect for those special occassions when you need a little bling.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest, the barrete is prettier than it&#x27;s picture and I purchased this to add as a decoration to a gown.  I have gotten several compliments.  They all think the gown came with the accent.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely accessory to add to my hair pieces. I don&#x27;t wear many things and am very pleased with this barrette. It has great sparkle, not cheap looking, and I specifically ordered it because it is a barrette and not a hair clip. I wanted it for Christmas and it made it. The item ships directly from China so it does take a while. The color is a deep red more than a maroon or Burgundy color. It looks well made, heavy, not fragile, so I am not concerned with it breaking when using it. It&#x27;s a nice size but may be too large for children. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> bought 4 of these all together (got the green too) they work well with fine hair.  helps keep my hair which is thick and fine out of things easy to use as well</li>
    <li> One thing you should know about this barrette: you can&#x27;t wear it on the top of your head or on the sides. There is a sizable gap between the decorative part of the barrette and the clip. When you wear it on the top of your head (like I do with barrettes when I pull my long bangs back), it looks goofy. There&#x27;s a gap big enough you can put your finger through it. Likewise, it&#x27;s too big of a barrette to wear on the side. I use it as a pony tail holder. I bring back all my hair and this barrette holds it firmly in place in the back.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for putting up the front of my hair, and the sparkles are always a plus for me</li>
    <li> Looks a bit cheesy!!! Not something I will recommend to others unless maybe for kids.</li>
    <li> I like this medium size prettu hair clip. It looks bright red than a&lt;br /&gt;Picture. But way prettier. I like it especially for hoilidays it looks really good</li>
    <li> These barrettes are so beautiful! So many compliments! It feels comfortable too. I bought 4 different color&#x27;s They hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> delivery was on time,  actual item was a little bigger than expected.  It is a very nice hair clip and my niece loves it. I have ordered several and each time I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful pin.  Rhinestones were nice and clear; not cloudy. It was purchased as part of a gift and my friend loved it!</li>
    <li> Very beautiful barrette, bright colors and will look good on any color hair.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present and my daughter loves it.  It came quickly and exactly as ordered, I would order again.</li>
    <li> I should have ordered a pair of red and another pair of green clips. It just looks AND works perfect.</li>
    <li> Hairclip very small, cannot do a ponytail.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair Barrette bought for getting my hair done for a wedding. Elegant, brautiful, and great price. Looks awesome in my hair.</li>
    <li> I got my barrette today. The red color is a lot brighter than the picture. It is too small for my pony tail because I have tick hair. It would be more suitable for a kid, or you can use it for lifting up some hair on the side. It is pretty and a good price</li>
    <li> Very cute. Was what I expected. Took awhile to get here though.</li>
    <li> This is such a beauty, very well made, looks great with ever thing, wearing this clip you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and stays well in my thin hair.</li>
    <li> In addition to how pretty and feminine this is, the quality in this barrette is amazing.  Very well made and securely holds my hair. I get compliments every time I wear it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful and versatile piece of jewelry that can be used for everyday wear as well as for the situations requiring a bit more of dress-up.  It perfectly holds a moderately sized ponytail and is bright and sparkly without gaudiness.</li>
