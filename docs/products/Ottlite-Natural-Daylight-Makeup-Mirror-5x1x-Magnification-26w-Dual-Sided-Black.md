      <li>Good light, no shadows, magnification when you want it.  </li>

      <li>it is just okay.  </li>
      <li>I am now enjoying my mirror.</li>
      <li>I feel myself contorting my head and neck to be able to see well.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased on how this lights up my face and moves into different position&#x27;s, the magnifying side is perfect.</li>
      <li>I typically love anything Ottlite.</li>
      <li>When you have it on the non-magnified mirror, you better have a stopper wedged at the bottom, or it will spin on you.</li>
      <li>And stylish too</li>
      <li>I have tried a couple of different make up lights and this one is the best.</li>

      <li>I could not have asked for anything more.</li>
      <li>I just asked her how many stars she would give this mirror</li>

      <li>the four stars--the light is bright enough to put on make-up effectively, and that is all I ever needed/wanted from a make-up</li>
      <li>As one grows older, one needs a magnifying mirror with bright light.  </li>
      <li>I can read just fine without reading glasses provided</li>
      <li>Bright, natural light that starts immediately.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this makeup mirror, great light ,but would like the one side to be a ten magnifier.</li>
      <li>when i hit the off button, it went into strobe light effect</li>
      <li>The lighting is great, and I like that there is a regular mirror side and a magnification side.</li>
      <li>But overall, it&#x27;s still a great mirror.</li>
      <li>I like the ott-lite because it has light bulbs which can be changed by the owner.</li>
      <li>They make it sound as if the mirror is not serving it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
      <li>but so far so good.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to me that the light is bright enough or it is not the right kind of light.  </li>
      <li>a pink lighting is so much more pleasant.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking to replace my 35 year old GE model that had florescent lights on each side. This OTT light is fantastic! I am not disapointed!</li>
    <li> I have to disagree with someone&#x27;s comment: \\&quot;If you&#x27;re not sitting 2 inches away from the magnified mirror it looks like a fun house view of your face\\&quot;.  They make it sound as if the mirror is not serving it&#x27;s purpose. If you have ever used a magnified mirror, yes, your face looks funny if you are not close to it.  This in no way makes it a bad mirror!! The light is great!!! The only reason I gave it a 4 star is it does not have the \\&quot;door\\&quot; mirrors I&#x27;m used to having on my old mirror. This is very useful for seeing things on the sides of your face really well. The mirrors are good quality.</li>
    <li> This is my third try on a makeup mirror and I absolutely love this one! As soon as I turned it on I could see the difference. It creates an even natural light that allows me to apply my makeup without using a desk lamp. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty big. It feels sturdy and the lighting is very bright. Not sure if it&#x27;s \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; but at least it&#x27;s not office light.     The big problem is the mirror. It&#x27;s really more like polished metal than a mirror no glass on this entire thing. And it&#x27;s kind of warped, polished metal and the warp is REALLY obvious on the (slightly) magnified side. If you&#x27;re not sitting 2 inches away from the magnified mirror it looks like a fun house view of your face. Really unattractive.    Not really magnified if it necessitates sitting so close.     Returning this thing.</li>
    <li> The mirror would have been rated excellent except for the poor design making the mirror turn/swivel right out of the box.  For some reason the 5x side stays put but the regular side swivels down.  I got some sticky felt and bumpers to put on the mirror and it fixed the problem.  Thanks to all the other reviews I knew what to expect.  Other than that the mirror quality is very clear even on the 5x side.  I have seen many mirrors where the quality of the magnification side is blurry and this one is perfect.  The lighting is very bright and the best I have seen on any mirror.  Your eyes have to adjust but this is what I was looking for.  As long as you look into the mirror and not into the light it illuminates what you want to see very well.  Many lighted mirrors illuminate the edges of your face and you can&#x27;t see the middle, or they blind you by focusing the light in the wrong area. This is the best makeup mirror I have seen.</li>
    <li> The white lighting was too strong...almost like fluorescent.  And we ALL know what fluorescent lighting does to our well made up face!  NONONO. ....a pink lighting is so much more pleasant.  I have decided to give it to my 14 yr old niece .&lt;br /&gt;Her skin is perfect...and can battle the scary fluorescent light.  Her day will come!  Giggle</li>
    <li> Great mirror! And stylish too</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of different make up lights and this one is the best. My daughter first got it and I would have used my mirror and then gone over to her house and tried her mirror and saw all that I had missed in plucking away unwanted facial hairs. I was able to get it at Joanns fabric store for 49.99. This is worth the money and I wouldn&#x27;t mess around with the smaller battery ones.</li>
    <li> At last a makeup mirror with enough  light.  As one grows older, one needs a magnifying mirror with bright light.  I looked at several mirrors before I bought this one, and none was as clear and bright as the OTT--even in a poorly lit room. I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews, but this one deserved a 5-star review.</li>
    <li> I bought the Ottlite to replace an old magnifying mirror.  I am very impressed with the light and the magnification.  I would recommend this to friends and family 100%!!!!!</li>
    <li> Round 2! I bought one of these in magenta and had to send it back because the on button would not stay pressed when I wanted to use it. I bought the black one in hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t have that gaudy pattern finish on it and guess what? It does! I had hoped it would be solid black like in the picture, but I guess I can get over that. It seems to work pretty well so far and the lighting is SUPERB!!! Talk about being able to see EVERY PORE! You can&#x27;t get out of the house looking like a pancake face with the lights on this mirror. I love that!</li>
    <li> Nice and bright. Really like the normal and magnified mirrors. Just what I needed to put makeup on on those dark mornings. And I don&#x27;t have to lean over the bathroom sink!</li>
    <li> Best lighted make-up mirror I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had trouble getting the right one delievered and had one delivered that had a defective 5x mirror.  Amazon staff helped me until I recieved the correct order and a great mirror.  So glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my a friend(who does make-up professionally) after the one year old  unit she had failed, made by Jerdon,junk! I like the ott-lite because it has light bulbs which can be changed by the owner. also unit is very bright. China made but well built.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because most of the reviews said that the light was really good and I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding make up mirrors with good lighting.  The light, though bright, is not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as advertised, and the 5X magnification mirror is a joke.  As another review stated, it&#x27;s like looking in a fun house mirror.  The regular mirror is okay, so I&#x27;ll be keeping this make up mirror only because it is the least awful out of the four that I&#x27;ve bought recently.</li>
    <li> We had one of these in a B&amp;B in Hawaii. I spent some time everyday there cleaning chin hairs, lip hairs and eyebrows. It has amazing magnification for these chores!</li>
    <li> So ever since I did the Lasik Surgery to correct my Astigmatic blind as a bat eyesight I have not had very good up close vision. I expected this since I am at that age where people begin to need reading glasses. I can read just fine without reading glasses provided the print is not too small but I will need prescription reading glasses to have clear vision for small detail work. I decided it was time to get the old lady magnifying makeup mirror so that I could put on makeup without glasses. I ordered an Ottlight makeup mirror and it is really nice. I can see everything! I had thought my face had been really clear lately but that was not the case! I just couldn&#x27;t see it LOL!</li>
    <li> The mirror was distorted.  I could not see my face due to the wavy appearance.  I returned it as I was unsure if that was the case with all of the mirrors.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  It was actually better than expected.  Very durable.  Great lighting.  I could not have asked for anything more.</li>
    <li> you can actually see your face with this.  It the best mirror I&#x27;ve had.  I bought an extra one for when this one dies.  Gives off some heat tho.  Good light, not like the others</li>
    <li> The left light didn&#x27;t work, the mirror is much smaller that you think and the magnification is so distorted it can&#x27; be used unless you are 2 inches away from it.  Of course I returned it!</li>
    <li> Would recommend this makeup mirror, great light ,but would like the one side to be a ten magnifier. So I added a small round one and works perfect.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect item for about a month, and then it loosened up so that the mirror wouldn&#x27;t stay in an upright position - it would fall perpendicular to the stand no matter how hard I tried to adjust it. My husband even took it apart to try to find something to tighten, but no luck (and he&#x27;s a handy guy). The light was bright and natural, so I&#x27;m really sad to toss it in the trash, but that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s going.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. The lighting is great, and I like that there is a regular mirror side and a magnification side. The mirror does start to flip sometimes on it&#x27;s on while I&#x27;m putting on my make-up, and I have to adjust it. But overall, it&#x27;s still a great mirror.</li>
    <li> Great lighted mirror, easy to flip for magnification and the lights are a lot brighter than I expected. Good deal.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been looking for a table top mirror so that my daughter doesn&#x27;t leave the house every morning looking like she&#x27;s going clubin&#x27;.  After trying different (and yes, cheaper models), we finally found one that WORKS!</li>
    <li> Larger mirror than any other that I found. Bright, natural light that starts immediately. Perfect magnifying side.  I have used it for a month</li>
    <li> I love ott light products so I was really excited to find this mirror. They were out of the black, but contacted me and substituted the white. They sent it promptly and I really love it. A great product and a great seller.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves it.  The light is perfect bright white.  The mirror is a good size so she can see her whole face at once.  She uses the non-magnified side of the mirror and it is clear and focused.  I just asked her how many stars she would give this mirror and she eagerly shouted FIVE!</li>
    <li> This is a must buy. It&#x27;s true to light and you will not be disappointed. It does get hot after 40 mins but nothing that will affect the application of your makeup. I paid $49.99 at the target website</li>
    <li> Its way too bright but all i had to do is wrap and tape 2 plies of computer paper over the lights and its at a good barable lighting that wont hurt your eyes.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Mirror wont stay put.  You have to stick items underneath so it won&#x27;t move.  Regret purchase and now I can&#x27;t return it because I stuck it in a corner and forgot about it until it was too late to return.</li>
    <li> I typically love anything Ottlite. I use 2 others for beading and a third on my work desk. This was a big disappointment. The 5X magnification is so distorted that I can&#x27;t use it at all. One of the lights on the right hand side will not come on until I shake or gently bang on it. I finally removed the plastic casing covering the one light so I can get right to it. I use the lighting on this, but another makeup mirror to apply my makeup. The lighting is good as always, but the mirror is awful.</li>
    <li> I had read and seen alot of reviews on this mirror and most all of them were positive.  I don&#x27;t completely dislike the mirror but I&#x27;m not as happy as I would like to be.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to me that the light is bright enough or it is not the right kind of light.  Can&#x27;t exactly put my finger on what the problem is but I&#x27;m just not happy with the light aspect.  It also seems sort of awkward to adjust the angle of the mirror.  I feel myself contorting my head and neck to be able to see well.  I guess overall it is just okay.  Nothing special.</li>
    <li> I just received my Ottlite Makeup Mirror and the lighting is terrific. In the last 2 years, I&#x27;ve gone through 2 other make-up mirrors (Jerdon and Conair) both which had bad lighting and both burned out. The Ottlite is VERY bright, which is what I prefer. Have my fingers crossed that this one will last longer than the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later... As someone else wrote, the mirror sometimes doesn&#x27;t stay put and tilts. And I believe that writer taped the mirror to the frame to keep it in one position. My mirror also moves on its own. BUT, I put up with this because I still love the bright light.</li>
    <li> I bought two makeup mirrors and found that this one didn&#x27;t give as much light as the other one (Jerdon Classic Tri-fold Light), so I returned it..</li>
    <li> The magnifying side of the mirror is so much heavier than the true to size side that it tilts. I have to use a cotton ball wedged between the mirror and the frame to steady it.  Also, the magnifying side makes me feel like my eyes are crossing. I do like the lighting the mirror provides.</li>
    <li> I have bought a number of make-up mirrors over the years and none of them had adequate lighting. I would get in the car to go to work and look in the rear-view mirror in the sunlight and realize my blush was garish or there were small globs of mascara on my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror arrived and had more than its fair share of drawbacks: came with broken light, when i hit the off button, it went into strobe light effect so i had to unplug to turn it off, mirror won&#x27;t stay in place without wedging something between the the mirror and the frame (really, for 50 bucks), couple of nicks in the frame (when will we bring back the manufacturing jobs to the USA so consumers can be assured of some quality control), and I don&#x27;t find it to be particular attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the four stars--the light is bright enough to put on make-up effectively, and that is all I ever needed/wanted from a make-up mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the defective mirror, but I miss it. I&#x27;m ordering another and hoping the first one was a fluke.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  Good light, no shadows, magnification when you want it.  It is simple and does not take up too much counter space.  She says she cannot put on her make-up without it now.</li>
    <li> mirror is nice but it shipped without the rubber washer  that holds the mirror in a stationary position. The mirror should ship with two washers, and even with that the design is not the best in the world. I do like the lighting</li>
    <li> I almost sent this back when I first started using it as the lighting is brighter then I was use to. Then I started to get many compliments about my makeup being natural etc. and had to keep it. My husband noticed that my eye makeup seem much more natural which I attribute to the Ott Light. I have had it now more then 2 months and can&#x27;t believe I almost sent it back.</li>
    <li> Great bright light and big enough mirror to see your whole face.  I wish it came in an 8x magnification but otherwise I really like it.</li>
    <li> Everything works fine except one key thing - the mirror won&#x27;t stay in position.  The mirror flips - one side normal, one side magnified.  If you flip it and position it so the angle is where you want it, it won&#x27;t stay... it always rotates back to a near vertical default position.  I can adjust the frame and lock it in any position I want, but that is useless if I cannot hold the mirror firm within the frame, and I can&#x27;t.  Have to wad some tissues in there to brace it.  There are no screws to tighten it, seems like an obvious and monumental flaw.  Otherwise, nice piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> The light is natural and sufficient. The magnified side is hard to use. Facial features are not clear and I have always used this magnification on other mirrors. Tried to call company to return and was just put on hold for ever with no answer.</li>
    <li> I have only had this a week so I can&#x27;t comment on durability but so far so good.  It was not as sturdy as I had hoped as it is all plastic and the mirror itself is a little small, but the light is perfect and my makeup has never looked better.  I hope it holds up.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased on how this lights up my face and moves into different position&#x27;s, the magnifying side is perfect.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find a makeup mirror advertising natural light.  When I plugged in the mirror, it was soooo bright, you really had a hard time seeing.  When I turned it over to the 5x side..it was like being in a fun house.  You really could not even focus, let alone try to put your makeup on.  I unplugged it, packed it up and returned it.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for a Christmas gift. Quality is very good, bright light and good magnification. I am confident it will last.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to be negative, but I would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone. The lighting is horrible- it&#x27;s like artificial fluorescent white light which washes out my skin tone in the mirror. I was looking for lighting that was similar to sunlight so I could see how I would look when walking around in public.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the magnified mirror sucks. You have to be 1-inch away from it otherwise it&#x27;s SO blurry.&lt;br /&gt;My money was poorly spent on this item!</li>
    <li> I love my makeup mirror.  This is my third Ottlite product.  I love the daylight look.  It has the lighted two magnified sided mirror.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews and cautiously ordered  this product as a gift. My nieces loved it and said the light  is perfect and the product was well made</li>
    <li> Light is great, but mirror is a huge disappointment! I even did some research on it in Amazon and YouTube. There were several mentions of mirror not staying still, and clown like magnification, but videos I saw didn&#x27;t make it look that bad. I figured maybe someone just got a defective frame or something....Nope! When you have it on the non-magnified mirror, you better have a stopper wedged at the bottom, or it will spin on you. Magnification takes a lot of getting use to...Don&#x27;t try and move around, you&#x27;ll get dizzy! Too much money for the cheap quality of the mirror. Definitely, don&#x27;t get what you pay for. Thankfully, I bought it when the price was reduced.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror, it provides natural light for my somewhat dim room; my makeup looks even better, indoors and out, cause my makeup is applied in the right light now. I was very excited to receive this mirror and I&#x27;m not disappointed, I&#x27;m actually very impressed! It makes putting makeup on fun again. It&#x27;s very sturdy, and easy to use and store. No problems! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I received this mirror promptly and well packaged.  The right side however, would not light.  The bulb will not stay in place.  Small detail and fixable, but my biggest complaint is that the magnification mirror is distorted.  Wavy... and elongated.  Had to return this.</li>
    <li> I like the lighting on this mirror.  It is very bright.  Plus the mirror is a good quality and the size of the whole thing works.  Unfortunately, one of the two sidelights has already stopped working. While I did love the whole unit while it worked well, I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed that I have to purchase a new light bulb already.</li>
    <li> I have had no troubles with this mirror.  The light is perfect and the mirror tilts and stays put.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great, my wife said it was the best lighted mirror she ever had.</li>
    <li> Just wish the mirror was fastened a little more securely.</li>
    <li> No complaints from the wife.  Bought for a Christmas present.  Works well. I have seen some complaints or concerns from other reviews but no complaints here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for some time now and I love it. I use it to do my makeup, fix my eyebrows (the magnified side is perfect for that!), etc. No complaints.</li>
    <li> So as I have mentioned in other reviews, I have no bathroom storage and hardly any counter space. So I have to do my makeup in the bedroom using my dresser. The problem is that I don&#x27;t have the best lighting there. This daylight mirror completely solves my problem! This light up mirror has really helped me put on the right amount of makeup and the right colors of makeup thanks to its daylight lighting. It is a pleasure to use despite one tiny issue - the mirror wants to spin on its own. But I just taped it to the mirror frame and it doesn&#x27;t move until I want it to move. &#x3D;)  Really great makeup mirror!</li>
    <li> The light from this mirror is fantastic, the best I&#x27;ve ever seen in fact.  The mirrors however are why I dropped it to two stars.  If you need any kind of magnification the one side that is magnified is totally worthless.  I have a magnification mirror already and I need that because I can&#x27;t put makeup on with my bifocals in place, but this mirror&#x27;s magnification is distorted.  It&#x27;s like a mirror in the fun house at the fair.  It&#x27;s so wavy and blurry it almost makes you sick to your stomach.  The other flip side mirror is normal, but I need magnification to do eye makeup because I wear bifocals so the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; side is of no use to me at all.  I guess if your eyesight is good then you will like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because I purchased this same product at a Jo-ann store for Christmas for my sister two years ago. She uses it all the time while locking her hair. I was unable to purchase it at a Jo-Ann store so I purchased it from Amazon.com. I received my mirror in 3 days (I ordered it on Saturday and it arrived on Tuesday). I am now enjoying my mirror. The only issue I have is that the magnified side is the side the mirror rotates to so I have to place a stopper (much like a door stop but not as large) in the space between the mirror and the mirror frame. No big deal.</li>
    <li> Everything about this light is awesome.  It is very nice looking and it simulates natural daylight perfectly.  The only problem is that the mirror tilts forward and the longer I have had it the more it does not stay in place.  I put a piece of tape on it to keep it from tipping forward at the top.</li>
