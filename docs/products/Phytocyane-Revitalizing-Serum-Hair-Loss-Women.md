### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>again, great product but go to Ulta</li>
      <li>It works great and is affordable.</li>
      <li>Great product,as are almost all of the phyto products.</li>
      <li>I have always loved this product I purchased it online because the price was great</li>
      <li>I think that I need to get about two more boxes and use the product for a good three months to get the best results.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it is a good product and will do what it says but</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it, that I am confident it will help me.</li>
      <li>i think it has stopped some fallout but, not quite sure.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on 8th week so still not one hundred percent sure of its value.</li>
      <li>The smell is lovely as well.</li>
      <li>My hair has been gradually thinning most probably because of age and the onset of menopause.</li>
      <li>I like it and will order more.</li>
      <li>, she is alos in love with the product.</li>
      <li>Just used for the second time, and I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m sure most people won&#x27;t have this issue...</li>
      <li>This hair product was OK.  </li>
      <li>This works better than Rogaine.  </li>
      <li>With this product, my hair is thicker around the crown and has more texture.</li>
      <li>Seems to work better when you first use it, then it does not seem as effective, but that just could be me.</li>
      <li>Several co workers bought it also, this product is incredible.</li>
      <li>More importantly, the vial broke while I was using it</li>
      <li>I think my clients like it to much, its gave them good result after one month use in the spa</li>
      <li>The Biotin must also be helping because my nails are suddenly really strong whereas before, they would bend.</li>
      <li>but, something in your scalp is better than nothing, right?</li>
      <li>I am excited to see what happens when I have been using it for a longer time.</li>
      <li>This is most certainly a product that I will be using to maintain hair growth and health.</li>
      <li>however it&#x27;s true what they say &amp;#34</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but it didn&#x27;t make me go bold either.</li>
      <li>maybe there&#x27;s something far more fabulous out there?</li>
      <li>This will be worth your money.</li>
      <li>yuck, right?  </li>
      <li>He also said it wasn&#x27;t falling out in huge amounts anymore; it was just normal fallout.  </li>
      <li>Tried this, and in a month, my hairdresser confirmed that I was getting new hair.</li>
      <li>i felt really funny</li>
      <li>I used this for the intensive treatment for a month along with the restructuring shampoo and the vitamins, and my hair dress--to whom I visit every 6 weeks--said he couldn&#x27;t believe how much my hair had grown!  </li>
      <li>the first time i used this</li>
      <li>so if you feel funny the first time you use it--my advice is don&#x27;t keep using it.  </li>
      <li>I am a mix of African-American, Caucasian and Native American with frizzy, fine shoulder-length hair.</li>
      <li>that really doesn&#x27;t do anything, or hasn&#x27;t in three months.</li>
      <li>The product I really, really like is TRESemme 24 hour Body with collagen.</li>
      <li>I still can&#x27;t tell if my hair loss is seasonal or if this product really helps.  </li>
      <li>I am almost done with the whole box.</li>
      <li>I guess products work on some people better than other.</li>
      <li>At the very least, it&#x27;s good for my hair.</li>
      <li>I am an African American with a relaxer and semi permanent hair color and it is doing a great job at keeping excessive hair from falling out.</li>
      <li>My hair is thicker and I have new hair growth.</li>
      <li>I think that if you have hair loss it is important to note that if you color your hair or have any other chemical treatment on your hair this product will abate the hair loss to some degree but it will not completely stop the hair loss.</li>
      <li>I had my baby 6 months ago and had major hair loss, to the point it clogs my drainage.  </li>
      <li>I started using this product in late September and have seen a huge difference...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to use daily and style as usual.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using only 2 of those little bottle so far, so I can&#x27;t really say if it works or not.</li>
      <li>The hair on my crown has been thinning since high school, mostly due to genetics.</li>
      <li>I just realized that my hair feel a little bit different, more coarse than usual.</li>

<li> I just realized that my hair feel a little bit different, more coarse than usual.</li>
<li> , my hair is growing againg, i know is too early, but I will continue using it everyday</li>
<li> After a long term of hair loss, this product has helped me grow a lot of hair.  </li>
<li> I use it twice a week, and the hair loss has stayed minimal.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not exactly curly or kinky or wavy, but not straight.</li>
<li> Have been using Rogaine for 3 years due to hypothyroidism.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s cheaper than either of the other options, and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch, either.</li>
<li> and I had to remove sharp glass shards from my hair.  </li>
<li> less hair on my counters, floors, and clothing....</li>
<li> I have also noticed new growth along my hairline where it often drips (it doesn&#x27;t look really weird or anything, though).</li>
<li> , I have noticed my hair growing a lot faster since I started using it after a few weeks .</li>
<li> ; you get what you pay for!&amp;#34; This product is glass and was shipped in a soft package which led to 1/3 of the product being broken; therefore the ampules that were broken had leaked and when I got the product it was soaking wet and sticky....</li>
<li> For the price I was expecting a lot more from it but was very disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what to expect with thinning/losing hair products.</li>
<li> It has made a small difference, but not marvelous.&lt;br</li>
<li> i wound up cutting my finger trying to open one.  </li>
<li> I use the serum at least twice a week and it must be helping in some capacity because after each application, I get instantaneous curls whereas without it, my hair starts to curl as it dries.  </li>
<li> At least the hair loss has been reduced-</li>
<li> Expensive for a glass vial of some unknown liquid (water?)</li>
<li> product itself isn&#x27;t thick or greasy, like I was expecting.</li>
<li> My hair is past my shoulders and at my bra strap but is very thin</li>
<li> I would recommend the product to anyone who is experiencing thin hair.</li>
<li> I have inherted thin hair from my mom and I introduced her to it also</li>
<li> Tried Rogaine, no joy.</li>
<li> Tried Bosley, no joy.</li>
<li> i shouldn&#x27;t have kept using it because i just felt sick in an odd way until i stopped using it.  </li>
<li> The applicator tip is difficult to put on.  </li>
<li> almost afraid to stop using it...</li>
<li> which is a small step forward!!!!!!!!</li>
<li> That&#x27;s from years of having fake nails!!!!!!!!  </li>

    <li> my hair within 2 weeks was fuller and looked healthier. I have inherted thin hair from my mom and I introduced her to it also, she is alos in love with the product. Several co workers bought it also, this product is incredible.</li>
    <li> Works for me- Regain had stopped working -and someone suggested this- At least the hair loss has been reduced- which is a small step forward!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this for the intensive treatment for a month along with the restructuring shampoo and the vitamins, and my hair dress--to whom I visit every 6 weeks--said he couldn&#x27;t believe how much my hair had grown!  He also said it wasn&#x27;t falling out in huge amounts anymore; it was just normal fallout.  I am so relieved.  I intend to continue purchasing this and using the maintenance program next.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product I purchased it online because the price was great however it&#x27;s true what they say &amp;#34; you get what you pay for!&amp;#34; This product is glass and was shipped in a soft package which led to 1/3 of the product being broken; therefore the ampules that were broken had leaked and when I got the product it was soaking wet and sticky....again, great product but go to Ulta they carry it!!</li>
    <li> This leave in makes my hair shine and give my hair life, I have noticed my hair growing a lot faster since I started using it after a few weeks .</li>
    <li> The applicator tip is difficult to put on.  More importantly, the vial broke while I was using it and I had to remove sharp glass shards from my hair.  I stopped using it for this reason.  Don&#x27;t know if it is a good product and will do what it says but a bleeding scalp is a lot to pay to find out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to expect with thinning/losing hair products. I started using this about 2 months ago, 2 vials per week. I am a mix of African-American, Caucasian and Native American with frizzy, fine shoulder-length hair. It&#x27;s not exactly curly or kinky or wavy, but not straight. The hair on my crown has been thinning since high school, mostly due to genetics. With this product, my hair is thicker around the crown and has more texture. I have also noticed new growth along my hairline where it often drips (it doesn&#x27;t look really weird or anything, though). It has made a small difference, but not marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself isn&#x27;t thick or greasy, like I was expecting. It&#x27;s easy enough to use daily and style as usual.</li>
    <li> This hair product was OK.  For the price I was expecting a lot more from it but was very disappointed. The product I really, really like is TRESemme 24 hour Body with collagen. It works great and is affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only 2 of those little bottle so far, so I can&#x27;t really say if it works or not. But I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it, that I am confident it will help me. I just realized that my hair feel a little bit different, more coarse than usual.</li>
    <li> My hair has been gradually thinning most probably because of age and the onset of menopause. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I can&#x27;t wear ulta short hair styles anymore because my scalp is visible on both sides of my head.  Not only did I start using the serum but I also began taking Biotin. I use the serum at least twice a week and it must be helping in some capacity because after each application, I get instantaneous curls whereas without it, my hair starts to curl as it dries.  At the very least, it&#x27;s good for my hair. The Biotin must also be helping because my nails are suddenly really strong whereas before, they would bend. That&#x27;s from years of having fake nails!!!!!!!!  I like it and will order more.</li>
    <li> I had my baby 6 months ago and had major hair loss, to the point it clogs my drainage.  I tried this product and within 2 weeks, I saw hair growth!!!</li>
    <li> Pricey but I think it works. I&#x27;m on 8th week so still not one hundred percent sure of its value.</li>
    <li> most people don&#x27;t react as dramatically to things as i do, so ignore this if you never get weird reactions.  i felt really funny the first time i used this...i shouldn&#x27;t have kept using it because i just felt sick in an odd way until i stopped using it.  so if you feel funny the first time you use it--my advice is don&#x27;t keep using it.  i&#x27;m sure most people won&#x27;t have this issue...but i feel like i should mention it.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product.  I have been using it for about 2 months and it seems to be working</li>
    <li> Tried Rogaine, no joy. Tried Bosley, no joy. Tried this, and in a month, my hairdresser confirmed that I was getting new hair. The growth has continued, despite the fact that the stress in my life has gone from severe to earthquake levels. I use it twice a week, and the hair loss has stayed minimal. It&#x27;s cheaper than either of the other options, and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch, either.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  Have been using Rogaine for 3 years due to hypothyroidism.  This works better than Rogaine.  I am excited to see what happens when I have been using it for a longer time.</li>
    <li> After a long term of hair loss, this product has helped me grow a lot of hair.  This will be worth your money.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but it didn&#x27;t make me go bold either. I guess products work on some people better than other. I won&#x27;t buy it again because I didn&#x27;t see any difference but, something in your scalp is better than nothing, right?</li>
    <li> I have been using Phytocyane Revitalizing Serum now about 6 months. My hair is thicker and I have new hair growth. I would recommend the product to anyone who is experiencing thin hair.</li>
    <li> i think it has stopped some fallout but, not quite sure.  almost afraid to stop using it...maybe there&#x27;s something far more fabulous out there?</li>
    <li> I think my clients like it to much, its gave them good result after one month use in the spa and they are still using it at home after shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product,as are almost all of the phyto products. Seems to work better when you first use it, then it does not seem as effective, but that just could be me.</li>
    <li> This product does work. I have been using 2 vials per week for almost 5 weeks. I am almost done with the whole box. I think that if you have hair loss it is important to note that if you color your hair or have any other chemical treatment on your hair this product will abate the hair loss to some degree but it will not completely stop the hair loss. I am an African American with a relaxer and semi permanent hair color and it is doing a great job at keeping excessive hair from falling out. My hair is past my shoulders and at my bra strap but is very thin and I want the hair to thicken up and continue to grow out. The smell is lovely as well. I am also using the Phytocyane shampoo and the revitalizing conditioner. I use the conditioner as a leave in conditioner. I think that I need to get about two more boxes and use the product for a good three months to get the best results. This is most certainly a product that I will be using to maintain hair growth and health.</li>
    <li> I been using this for a month and i can noticed the difference, my hair is growing againg, i know is too early, but I will continue using it everyday</li>
    <li> One of the bottles broke so I ended up with 11 bottles in one box (supposed to be 12 bottles in one box)</li>
    <li> Expensive for a glass vial of some unknown liquid (water?) that really doesn&#x27;t do anything, or hasn&#x27;t in three months.</li>
    <li> these are glass bottles.  i wound up cutting my finger trying to open one.  it didnt break off where it was supposed to.  havent noticed any difference with my hair either.  will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I was amazed what one application did for my thinning hair! Just used for the second time, and I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t tell if my hair loss is seasonal or if this product really helps.  I just know that in the heat of the summer I was looking at hair drop into my sink as I brushed my teeth!  I started using this product in late September and have seen a huge difference...less hair on my counters, floors, and clothing....yuck, right?  I will report again next summer to see if the hair loss increases again.</li>
