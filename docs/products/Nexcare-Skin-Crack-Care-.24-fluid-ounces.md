      <li>So I just tried this out for the first time and it helps a great deal!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this!</li>
      <li>The Advanced Skin Care Cream that is advertised to use with the skin crack care is very good; using that alone is better than the skin crack care.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Nice to have for winter cuts on the finger tips.</li>
      <li>nice cover without sticky residue.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially useful at bedtime.</li>
      <li>My skin crack was still catching on every fabric thing I touched.</li>
      <li>I think that a good hand creme applied many times a day works just as well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice not being burdened by band-aids or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice product for the paper cut or crack that in places can&#x27;t put a bandaid on.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best skin crack healer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I am honestly amazed...</li>
      <li>very good and very fast</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong smell at all which is good.  </li>
      <li>It seems to relieve the tenderness and is the best product I have found so far.  </li>
      <li>You can easily tear it by hand (no scissors needed!)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is absolutely the best liquid bandage product available.  </li>
      <li>you will love</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll always be sure to have a bottle of this on</li>
      <li>I did much better using Working Hands hand cream</li>
      <li>Wish I had known this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>so fellow OCD sufferers: plan to buy more and often.</li>
      <li>Adding more of the product did nothing.</li>
      <li>I love this skin crack care.</li>
      <li>I love it for simplicity for use.</li>
      <li>I keep re-applying in the hopes that it will work better</li>
      <li>Better than liquid bandage.</li>
      <li>That seems to help the most.</li>
      <li>I got better results from using superglue.</li>
      <li>so you may have to put on more than one coat at a time.  </li>
      <li>maybe 1 day at the most...</li>
      <li>Much better than adhesive bandages.</li>
      <li>So glad I was able to find it online as the stores seem to have quit carrying it.</li>
      <li>to the length you want, you can put it on a wound in one layer or wrap it around a finger one or more times.</li>
      <li>It was nice to have full use of my fingers for a change, and it does help the cracks pain as well.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s not sticky, dries fast and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I was extremely pleased for many years with the original Band-Aid Liquid Bandage which contained the miracle ingredient 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, a human-safe version of superglue which is currently used by doctors/surgeons/vets as the best available product.</li>
      <li>I really have not found a product nearly as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it goes on easy.  </li>
      <li>In the end, I just used Krazy glue and it stayed strong for 3 days.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am fine with it though.</li>
      <li>I get cracks around my thumbs during the winter months and it worked fine for that</li>
      <li>It dries quickly, seals and protects the wound making them heal a lot more</li>
      <li>One of my fingers ( my pointing finger) had a huge crack on the side.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t like the alternative brand i used as much and was thrilled to find Nexcare brand again.  </li>
      <li>Off topic somewhat, the doctors in our family have recently turned me on to an excellent non-liquid bandage which they use, but a year later, pharmacies still do not sell this quite amazing product.</li>
      <li>3.5 stars if that were available.</li>
      <li>, i use this great sealer daily.</li>
      <li>The primary ingredient is 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, aka isooctane.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels better right away.  </li>
      <li>Our dissatisfaction grew to such a state that we used the web to research the best product to use on cracking skin and this item came highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This product works the best AND has little scent!</li>
      <li>It washes off more easily than the 2-octyl cyanoacrylate based products, but if you keep re-applying the product your skin crack will heal pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>this is especialy great in the winter months when my hands get dry and fingers start cracking.</li>
      <li>The applicator (similar to the type of applicator used for nail polish) allows the user to easily coat anything from a paper cut to a scrape  or a deep crack on a finger or heel with the product, and the BEST PART is</li>
      <li>Can not say enough good things about the product.</li>
      <li>The instructions say you may need to add multiple layers to get good coverage, so that&#x27;s what I did..</li>
      <li>(it does wash off, but I found it takes maybe two rounds of a fair amount of dishes for it to start peeling), and my fingers are starting to look healthy and normal again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried getting a dermatologist to write a prescription for medical-grade super glue but they would not do it.</li>
      <li>It wears off too quickly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well. because of my dry skin in winter I  prone to painful splits on the tips of my fingers.</li>
    <li> I love this skin crack care. Especially in the winter when flu season is here. Because if you have a cut you can paint this on it and your protected from germs entering through the cut. It also heals cuts and cracks.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - I&#x27;ve used it for three years; it works just as stated.</li>
    <li> We needed something to help our baby boy seal up some minor skin abrasions.  I was surprised that this product was no-sting based upon use of other similar products.  The film that is made is quite thin, so multiple applications is necessary; morning and evening application will need to be performed.  One crazy thing about this product is that it has a very volatile solvent carrier (octane) which should be kept far away from heat sources due to its flammability.  Of course it evaporates quickly (which is what you want), and isn&#x27;t a hazard after evaporating.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for sealing up small cuts or cracks in your hands and feet.  I use this all of the time and it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price always seems ridiculous for the tiny bottle of it you get.  That said I keep buying the product because it works and I always want a bottle of it in my 1st aid kit.</li>
    <li> Somehow I managed to get a big crack in my skin on my face about an inch below my mouth, from dry skin probably. After a few days it was bleeding and excruciatingly painful -- I said enough was enough and went to the store to look for something for it, and I found this. While I was expecting to seal up the crack to protect it and maybe make it a little less painful, what I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how rapidly it has made the crack heal... I am honestly amazed... it has been only 3 days and what was a deep, 1/2-inch long crack is now little more than a small nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely use again, and definitely recommend, it will blow you away.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, can&#x27;t find anything else that works. I have trouble finding it in the drug stores or pharmacies.</li>
    <li> Nexcare&#x27;s Skin Crack Care is one of the very best products I&#x27;ve ever discovered.  There are ingredients that promote healing while sealing the sore spot so that water and soap don&#x27;t even cause a flinch, and I find that cracks, cuts, even bleeding cuticles are improved immediately.  The applicator (similar to the type of applicator used for nail polish) allows the user to easily coat anything from a paper cut to a scrape  or a deep crack on a finger or heel with the product, and the BEST PART is IT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN BURN the way Second Skin and Liquid Bandaid do.  I have used this product on babies and little children with nothing but smiles from them.&lt;br /&gt;(The only time it ever stung was in a deep or very raw injury when the brush pushed too hard into the sore.)&lt;br /&gt;There are two drawbacks -- 1)  the price is steep but TRULY, the product is WELL WORTH IT.&lt;br /&gt;The other drawback -- it gets very thick when it gets toward the bottom of the little bottle, but that may be because I am so sparing with it that it probably does what my chocolate does when I save it WAY beyond the age date, and that is probably pretty normal considering the Law of Entropy.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: you may want to keep the cap on as much as possible because it seems to evaporate when left uncovered.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you give this wonderful product a try.  I WON&#x27;T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!</li>
    <li> Not perfect but does a good job.</li>
    <li> Always works great!!  A must have if you have cracks around your nail beds.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and in the wintertime, my skin is prone to cracking, especially in creases. While the skin crack care does seal the crack, it&#x27;s so thin, I don&#x27;t think it stays for very long. And I haven&#x27;t noticed that my cracks are healing any faster using this compared to what I usually do (vaseline). The Advanced Skin Care Cream that is advertised to use with the skin crack care is very good; using that alone is better than the skin crack care.</li>
    <li> After receiving my Nexcare, I tried it on three deep skin cracks located on a couple of fingers. The product worked great on two of the cracks by sealing off air contact and stopping the pain. On the third crack, I applied several coats of the prodcut and could not get the pain to stop for several days although the pain intensity was reduced after application of Nexcare. I continued to work with my hands and did not have any additional pain or cracking. All three cracked were healed within a week.</li>
    <li> As a harpist who suffers from skin cracks from practicing and playing so much, this is the only product that works.  I can apply it on my fingertips, wait a couple of minutes for it to dry, and resume playing. This is a must have for anyone who has those nasty skin cracks.</li>
    <li> this product SKIN CRACK CARE...is the best!&lt;br /&gt;the only problem was the seller it took FOREVER TO ARRIVE.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll always use the product NEVER THE SELLER.</li>
    <li> When my fingertips first developed painful vertical cracks several years ago I could have used a product like Nexcare Skin Crack Care.  Researching turned up EFA deficiency as a possible cause at that time with 2000 mg fish oil daily as a possible solution.  And it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was so long ago that I forgot all those details, and within 2 weeks after discontinuing my fish oil use the splits recurred, but this time it took a full month for them to heal using 3 grams of fish oil daily which is 1 more than I had been using for the past 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was very glad to find sellers here because until this product I had no choice but to wear latex finger cots over the Band-Aids lest the cracks break open and start to bleed again. I&#x27;ll always be sure to have a bottle of this on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I&#x27;m somewhat chemically sensitive but I had no adverse reaction that I could tell.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Nexcare Skin Crack Care works as advertised. I had small cut and used Newskin.It did not work. Then I pealed the Newskin plastic film and used Nexcare. I could see immediate results from Nexcare.Nexcare has additives to enhance healing of the cut.</li>
    <li> i had purchased this previously somewhere, used it all, and then couldn&#x27;t find it again.  i didn&#x27;t like the alternative brand i used as much and was thrilled to find Nexcare brand again.  this is especialy great in the winter months when my hands get dry and fingers start cracking. LOVE this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old and I get dry, cracked skin on my fingertips and joints every winter.  It&#x27;s not as bad as some people&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s bothersome.  So I just tried this out for the first time and it helps a great deal!  As soon as I notice a crack, I paint some of this stuff on.  My skin feels better right away.  It smells odd and is sticky for about a minute until it dries; then I don&#x27;t even notice it and carry on as usual.  It wears off after six hours or so, so I reapply as needed.  Now the cracks I get heal up instead of festering for days.  I don&#x27;t know if Nexcare helps with more severe dry skin, but for me it&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy with 24 ounces in total as opposed to tiny bottles that look like nail polish.  You may need to put it on up to four times a day as the finger protectors my husband wears cause sweating and also friction causes it to wear off.  This works well but it is not thick-about the consistency of clear nail polish so you may have to put on more than one coat at a time.  It helps in conjunction with the waterproof finger protectors he wears as well as latex gloves when he washes dishes.  It is not tacky or sticky and will not cling to gloves.  Will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> Helps heal my cracked hands during the winter months.</li>
    <li> O produto é muito bom, o problema são os impostos que Governo brasileiro me cobrou. Comprei dois por $14,00 + $20,00 de frete. Chega aqui me cobraram mais R$ 51,00.</li>
    <li> This is the VERY BEST product for skin cracks!! No stinging!! I will ONLY use this!,,,</li>
    <li> helps with cracks on finger tips</li>
    <li> Great way to heal painful cracks in your fingers!</li>
    <li> Great for paper cuts and small cuts and scratches.  Helps promote the healing and reduces the pain caused by cracked fingertip skin.</li>
    <li> - Instant relief&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t sting&lt;br /&gt;- Little to no smell&lt;br /&gt;- Heals within days&lt;br /&gt;- Convenient, once daily applications&lt;br /&gt;- No residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingers tend to crack every winter. This year, the middle finger on my left hand was cracking really badly; I had patches of raw skin everywhere. Neosporin doesn&#x27;t help and leaves my fingers feeling greasy until it absorbs. Band-aids make it worse. Medicated creams haven&#x27;t helped. I went to Walgreens in search of something that might remedy it, after Googling the problem. A few people suggested Liquid Band-aid, others suggested New Skin, some people actually suggested Super Glue. I hadn&#x27;t heard of Nexcare Skin Crack Care until I saw it in the isle. The price was a little steep, but ultimately, I feel it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seconds after applying it, I felt relief. (No joke.) After using it for two days (one application daily in the morning), my fingers have almost completely healed. Typing doesn&#x27;t hurt, doing the dishes isn&#x27;t painful (it does wash off, but I found it takes maybe two rounds of a fair amount of dishes for it to start peeling), and my fingers are starting to look healthy and normal again. It doesn&#x27;t sting when applied; even on raw skin. There was a very, very mild smell while wet, but after it dried the smell was gone. One of the biggest bonuses of this product is that once it dries, you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s so nice not being burdened by band-aids or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this from now on. Highly recommend this to someone who is desperate for relief, like I was.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long...maybe 1 day at the most...I got better results from using superglue. It felt gooey and attracted too much dirt and lint.</li>
    <li> Great for healing cracked thumbs. Best product I have found on the market. Would never be without it.</li>
    <li> After over 30 years of struggling with painful, ugly cracks in my fingertips, I have finally found a product that works!  I hosestly can&#x27;t believe it!  I purchased it because it was more expensive than other products designed to do the same thing. I thought if I spent more, I would \\&quot;get what I paid for.\\&quot;  I certainly did.  Now I am sending a bottle to all of my family members that struggle with the same problem.  Thanks to the makers of NextCare Skin Crack repair, I will not be going through another winter of pain!  Eilene, Fridley, MN.</li>
    <li> I knew right off considering the fact that it has tree tree oil that it would have some possibility to burn. Aslso the fact that it states on the bottle that it is highly flambale. But considering I have been dealing with these cracks on my fingers for months. I figure I would I try it!    One of my fingers ( my pointing finger) had a huge crack on the side. it will split wide opne but NOt bleed! This is from repeated use of openening water bottles..I know rediculous!  My other finger..Well ..You can tell that is a bad case of psoriasis or somthing simlar. My skin comes off in patches and or the skin breake open. I have tried eveything. skin creams, lotions ,bandases,ointments..So I thought I would give this a try!    Beofre I I did I googled it. First I bought it though. Then I came here. Everyone said it DID NOT BURN. But I was still hesitant. So...I put it on the pointing finger. The one that I get the crack from the water bottles. Ok...Just the fumes from putting it on there made the other finger burn! YES I AM NOT KIDDING !!!! But I am desperate here! So I did the least of the bad one next and then I did the one by my finger nail the one that was bleeding. let me tell you. I was hating life in that moment! It burned so Freakin bad!!!! It was like sticking razor blades inside a wound once it dried and then every time you move it those razor blades jab again.When it dried fully it had pushed all the blood into a bubble to the surface. That was the razor..  Lets just say I WONT be using this again!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t sting and works pretty well. However the only draw back was that the edges would peel and hurt other cracks. This is probably not an issue for most people since I have numerous cracks at all times.</li>
    <li> You should investigate the actual ingredients of this product - not \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot; as implied in the amazon.com listing per 3M product literature.  The primary ingredient is 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, aka isooctane.  Yeah, that octane, as in on the gasoline pump, because that&#x27;s what it is, a key component of gasoline.  Look up 3M Nexcare Skin Crack Care on Google, and then select the 3M product link.  The MSDS sheet is there listing the ingredients.  This stuff may \\&quot;work,\\&quot; but at what cost to long-term health?</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I get cracks in my skin due to eczema and the pain is incredible.  This is the only product that brings immediate relief and the cracks heal and are gone within a day or two.  You may have a slight sting when you first apply it, depending on the size and depth of the crack, but it is nothing compared to other products and it is only momentary.  I bend my fingers to open the crack when applying to ensure that it goes deep into the crack.  Once applied, I can return to normal activities and don&#x27;t even notice that my skin is cracked. It has become harder to find, but thanks to Amazon.com I have a new supply.</li>
    <li> It sealed nicely initially but after washing my hands for the 2nd time in 3 hours, 1/3 of it peeled off.  Continuing throught my day the remainder pealed off due to perspiration or something.  In the end, I just used Krazy glue and it stayed strong for 3 days.  This stuff probably only works on cuts that are not on the hands and are not on joints.  I had a cut on the joint of my pinky finger.  After the initial 10 minutes of burning and drying, it maybe lasted 30 minutes before I bent my finger and it cracked down the middle, allowing more pain and such into my cut.  Seriously, dont wast your time with this and just use krazy glue, they both use acrylate polymer.</li>
    <li> Finally something that works! This works great! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really my husband who loves this.  He has cracked skin because he works outdoors and uses this product a lot.  I had this laying around for some reason and suggested he use it.  Now he&#x27;s hooked.  It definitely protects the cracked skin area the complaining has stopped.  LOL</li>
    <li> I work around wood a lot and my hands dry up and crack. I use lotions but that is not enough. As another reviewer said, I used to use the Band-Aid product that was essentially super-glue and it really worked. But Band-Aid took it off the market. I had no choice but to try this Nexcare Skin Crack Care in the hope that it might help. It does not. It is useless. I apply to clean dry skin and it initially covers the skin crack but then not long after the crack will reopen. I&#x27;ve tried applying and applying this Nexcare Skin Crack Care but that does not help. It doesn&#x27;t seal the skin crack and does not help in healing the skin crack. A complete waste of money. I&#x27;ve tried getting a dermatologist to write a prescription for medical-grade super glue but they would not do it. So I&#x27;m stuck using bandaids and/or bandage wrap.&lt;br /&gt;If you get skin cracks on your fingers/hands, don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this product, it does not work.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on my hands and I get skin cracks all of the time.  This product DOES NOT STING like liquid bandage.  It is flexible when it dries and doesn&#x27;t peel off.  It actually fills in the crack.  My skin is healing much faster with this product than with anything else I have tried and I have tried everything.  Get this you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;If I notice a skin crack beginning I can put this on and it will prevent it from getting worse.  I wish it came in a bigger bottle but then if it did it might dry up before I used it all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few skin crack or liquid bandage type products and so far, I like Nexcare best. Unlike some other products that involve applying on an applicator, this one&#x27;s easy to use. Just paint it on. It dries quickly, seals and protects the wound making them heal a lot more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing worse than having a crack on the fingers that keeps opening up. Nexcare takes care of that. It only takes a couple of applications before the wounds start to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle will last a long time. I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve had my bottle, more than a few years, but it doesn&#x27;t look anywhere near empty. If I ever use this up, I will buy it again. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you have those cuts on your hands in the Winter like I get then this is what you&#x27;ll need.  I get cut to ribbons because my hands are in water a lot and in the Winter that can be very bad.  We have very hard water and my hands sting with pain with the cuts.  I just brush this on, it&#x27;s like nail polish and the stinging is gone.  It stays too!  It drys on your skin protecting it from the water.  I apply it once a week.  You only need it on the cuts.  I use Zim&#x27;s crack creme for the rawness and that works great too.</li>
    <li> The only product my husband swears by for his feet. He is on his feet all day everyday and his heels get cracked. This is the only product that he will use.</li>
    <li> very good and very fast</li>
    <li> I work a lot of overtime and my skin sometimes cracks on my fingers. Tried this, applied it several times and could not tell much difference. Don;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> My fingertips have cracks and I was hoping this product would help but it didn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> No awkward bandages needed for split skin or cracks around finger nails ... nice cover without sticky residue.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff has all the adhesive properties of Jell-O. Totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products containing 2-octyl cyanoacrylate are infinitely superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I didn&#x27;t waste a big pile of money on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other kind of liquid bandage that smells like nail polish, and this is not like that.  There is no smell to this whatsoever.  It stays soft on your skin, not hard like nail polish.  It also does not sting when applied to a cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does wash off after a while, but not a quick as a bandage.  It also helps to heal the area.  I applied this twice a day to my fingers, which were cracking in the cold winter air, and this sealed the cuts right up.  I continued to use it for a few days to keep the area from cracking again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very tiny, but it takes less than a dab, so it&#x27;s going to last forever.  Seriously, a dab is too much.  Wipe the brush off on the bottle lip before applying and you&#x27;ll have plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny because my fingers no longer hurt like the dickens.</li>
    <li> The best care for cracked finger tops available . It doesn&#x27;t have the pungent aroma of its competitor . Too bad it is do pricey.</li>
    <li> I may have applied it wrong, but it made my cracking skin worse by making the slightly cracked skin cohere, and the one point of failure then became a huge crack that took a week to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell drove my wife a little mental.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work for me..... Expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t help your fingers. I would not recommend this brand.  Sorry,, : (</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my finger tip cracks.</li>
    <li> Nexcare Skin Crack Care is the only thing on the market that gives me relief from the very painful cracks on the corner of my thumbs and forefinger. I get them every winter</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL AND I HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE WINTER ESPECIALLY WITH SKIN CRACKS ON MY FINGERS.  I SAY THIS PRODUCT WORKS!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice product for the paper cut or crack that in places can&#x27;t put a bandaid on. It works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for the same purpose, but my favorite is Nexcare Skin Crack Care.  In the winter or when I&#x27;ve had my hands in the water too much, my skin starts cracking.  I get cracks in my knuckles and the wrinkles on my fingers and hands.  Cream only goes so far to help this but covering it with Crack Care helps it heal faster and works great to cover it especially in areas where adhesive bandages don&#x27;t stay put.</li>
    <li> I get skin cracks in my thumbs every winter and this product applied several times a day will heal them up in 2 or usually 3 days, so I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used it several time but not sure if it is doing any good but I wouldn&#x27;t say it wouldn&#x27;t work for you</li>
    <li> really helped heal my dry cracked skin on my feet!</li>
    <li> Works great to protect wounds from the salt water of the ocean.</li>
    <li> I get them on my fingers, especially during our dry winters - VERY painful!  This product works the best AND has little scent!</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased for many years with the original Band-Aid Liquid Bandage which contained the miracle ingredient 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, a human-safe version of superglue which is currently used by doctors/surgeons/vets as the best available product. This Nexcare product doesn&#x27;t work as well in any respect compared to the original, and 3M knows it, but it is no longer sold over the counter to people (evidently too many folks were not careful in using it). Note that acetone (horribly stinky nail-polish remover) or mineral oil or any superglue remover does remove this human-safe version of superglue, but this was not common-enough knowledge and folks did not have a remover readily available when they misused it. So it was removed from the consumer market several years ago, evidently due to liability concerns.    I used the original Band-Aid liquid bandage for many years for my painful winter skin cracks. A miracle product since it instantly cut the pain. When it was discontinued I tried literally every other product on the market and all had serious deficiencies. This Nexcare liquid bandaid is adequate in filling skin cracks except it doesn&#x27;t cut the pain at all (my main gripe) and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.    I just serendipitously stumbled onto the wikipedia entry for Cyanoacrylate, which includes this in its introductory remarks:  \\&quot;2-octyl cyanoacrylate is a medical grade glue encountered under various trade names; e.g., LiquiBand, SurgiSeal, FloraSeal, Dermabond, Orabase, Surgi-Lock and Nexaband. This was developed to be non-toxic and less irritating to skin tissue.\\&quot;    I searched amazon and the only two products in the list of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate products above from wikipedia that are sold (by amazon) are Dermabond (0.5ml for $17) and Surgi-Lock 2oc (2.0ml for $40). There is no other liquid bandage that compares to a product with the main ingredient cyano 2oc -- at least that is what the medical establishment believes (and I know from years of experience, having tried all the liquid bandages on the market). Sorry the real stuff is expensive, but you get what you pay for (plus they can charge doctors nearly any price and get away with it).    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    Off topic somewhat, the doctors in our family have recently turned me on to an excellent non-liquid bandage which they use, but a year later, pharmacies still do not sell this quite amazing product. However Amazon does sell it, \\&quot;3M Micropore paper tape\\&quot; (also called \\&quot;3M Micropore surgical tape\\&quot; because that&#x27;s what surgeons use). 12 small portable rolls of 10 yards(!) each are about $10, which will last you forever. I have been using the 1\\&quot; wide version for the past year (also have the 2\\&quot; wide version, but haven&#x27;t had a wound that wide yet :-) and am very impressed by its properties. You can easily tear it by hand (no scissors needed!) to the length you want, you can put it on a wound in one layer or wrap it around a finger one or more times. It is \\&quot;micropore\\&quot;, ie. it lets the wound breathe, and is waterproof enough to stay on through a couple of days of showers.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    12/26/14 update: \\&quot;3M Vetbond\\&quot; is currently the most cost-effective of the thin medical-grade cyanoacrylate products.  Apply one layer (1 drop), let dry (blow on it for faster drying), then apply one or two more layers (drops) and let dry between each, to get the desired thickness.  One bottle should last for at 50 two-drop skin crack fixups.    By the way, the \\&quot;3M Nexcare skin crack care\\&quot; product is almost useless in comparison to \\&quot;3M Vetbond\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> this product works great for cracks in your fingers, and is waterproof. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bottle too small. I accidentally lost half a bottle fumbling trying to hold it and apply the glue to my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, it is basically just glue as far as I can tell. Doesn&#x27;t really do anything by itself to heal the wound.</li>
    <li> I often get cracks on my fingers from working in the garden or washing dishes.  Wish I had known this product for many years.  It has cut the healing time down from days and weeks to often overnight.</li>
    <li> I have a skin disease called icthyosis, i dont know why walgreens discontinued this product, i use this great sealer daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;the know what I would do without Nexcare skin  Crack care.  My fingers Crack especially in the winter and the Nexcare covers and protects for quick healing.  Wonderful product.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin cracks from opening. Good for a whole day of usual business use. Much better than adhesive bandages.</li>
    <li> I get a cracked thumb every year during hunting season from exposure to the elements.  Although Nexcare Skin Crack Care is not a miracle cure, it does a good job.  It does require multiple applications.  It seems to relieve the tenderness and is the best product I have found so far.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was very excited to give this product a try for the cold winter.  It does not have a strong smell at all which is good.  However, I was disappointed at the lack of effectiveness.  It almost seems too thin and watery to give my small cuts a sufficient barrier.  I keep re-applying in the hopes that it will work better but it&#x27;s \\&quot;so-so\\&quot; at best.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market for skin cracks along the fingernails.  I&#x27;m a nurse,  because of alcohol based hand sanitizers, my hands crack and bleed.  This product soothes and doesn&#x27;t sting unlike other products.  Unfortunately, no retailer in my area carries this.  Amazon you get my business!  Thank-you!!!</li>
    <li> Good for small cracks. Soothes the skin and prevents further breakage.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product I can&#x27;t live without in these cold Alaskan winters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who wash their hands a LOT, causing my fingertips to crack and bleed. Fingertip cuts are almost impossible to bandage satisfactorily - at least if you expect to still have some dexterity, especially while typing. The great thing about this is that you paint it on like nail polish. It creates a thin barrier between your boo-boo and whatever you need to do. It lasts for a while too - depending on how hard you scrub your hands when you wash them. It&#x27;s especially useful at bedtime. Paint it on before you go to sleep and your fingertips finally start healing overnight. Well, almost overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle so fellow OCD sufferers: plan to buy more and often.</li>
    <li> Nice to have for winter cuts on the finger tips.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best skin crack healer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I purchased one for my mail carrier, whose hands were much worse than mine, being out in all kinds of weather.  It works!</li>
    <li> I use Nexcare Skin Crack Care on my feet.  I was becomming almost immobilized because of painful cracks in the heels of my feet.  Nexcare SCC is helping me heal those cracks.  I put on the Nexcare first, then moisturize.  Great stuff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely the best liquid bandage product available.  I have tried them all.  None of the rest work as well.  None of the rest are as durable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one problem is the product becomes too thick before you hit the end of the bottle.  I have emailed the company with regard to a thinning agent.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever! I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything to heal my fingertips with no success but this worked in 3 days. Plus, it&#x27;s not sticky, dries fast and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> My Wife and I have used this product very successfully for just over two years now and in that time we have consumed seven bottles between us. Prior to that time we had used a competitor&#x27;s product and had had problems with it not lasting on the skin. This resulted in three problems. Firstly it allowed the crack to open again with the attendant pain issue, Secondly allowing the crack to reopen resulted in poor/slow healing and thirdly the overall consumption of the competitor&#x27;s product was high. Our dissatisfaction grew to such a state that we used the web to research the best product to use on cracking skin and this item came highly recommended. Accordingly we took a leap of faith and ordered an initial batch of 6 bottles. To date we have been very pleased with both our choice and the products overall performance. The skin adherence is far superior resulting in much less skin re-cracking, far less pain, faster healing due to the wound staying closed and finally much less product consumption.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Actually doe help cracks heal faster, reduces pain and is an improvement over bandages (either liquid or standard)</li>
    <li> I am a tailor and from December to March I get these wide open painful cracks in my fingertips. this stuff works so great, and I&#x27;m glad I can get it through Amazon, because no one seems to carry it in stores.</li>
    <li> This version of the crack care fluid is the consistency of nail polish so it goes on easy.  The packaging is a big improvement which prevents the liquid from evaporating.  Little to no hurt when applying it to cracked skin.  It&#x27;s now a must-have with me wherever I go.</li>
    <li> My thumb has split open in numerous areas due to dryness. It got to be very painful. I tried to find liquid bandaid but they did not have it. This said it was for a skin crack so I tried it despite its expensive cost. One application is so thin it&#x27;s not even there it seems. My crack is just as open as before and the exposed inside skin is not protected at all. Also it lasts about one hour. Adding more of the product did nothing. My skin crack was still catching on every fabric thing I touched. I expected much, much more. I expected a product that worked even a little bit. I wish it did. One of the worst things I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is mildly helpful for those nasty cracks between finger and nail that tend to develop in winter, but you have to keep reapplying, and should probably apply liquid bandage over that.  I&#x27;m a finger-picking guitarist, and my fingers really take a beating.  Using this stuff and liquid bandage provided a cushion eventually, but  it looked messy and ugly.  I did much better using Working Hands hand cream</li>
    <li> NEW SKIN IS MUCH BETTER AND CHEAPER</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me on the ball of the foot.  I have yet to find one that will work there, however.</li>
    <li> I get cracks around my thumbs during the winter months and it worked fine for that</li>
    <li> we could not find this in the store anymore. it&#x27;s a must have in the winter for skin crack. the stuff is a miracle worker. make sure finger is clean and dry, and work it into the crack and let dry. don&#x27;t glob it on. it stings a little at first, but then it feels like a new finger.</li>
    <li> 3M used to market a small tube of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate based skin crack care under the Nexcare brand, which OSH carried.  It worked great.  Then, they changed the formula, and removed the 2-octyl cyanoacrylate. It worked, but it washed off.  Now, 3M dropped the small tube formula completely, but offers this small bottle product.  This product works. It washes off more easily than the 2-octyl cyanoacrylate based products, but if you keep re-applying the product your skin crack will heal pretty quickly.  Also, the product does not sting or burn, like some other skin crack products do.  I would give it 5 stars if more water resistant, but only 3 stars compared to the older product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that wrapping the finger in a band-aid (or maybe the surgical tape referred to in another review) speeds the process, probably by holding the crack together.  Some people report using the Nexcare product to fill the crack and then using the edge of a thin needle to apply a little cyanoacrylate (\\&quot;Superglue\\&quot;) to cover the Nexcare and make it more water-resistant.  That is probably not recommended.  I do recommend using Jack Black Industrial Strength Hand Care to help prevent skin cracks, and in conjunction with this Nexcare product to help heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate products are no longer available at retail, and are now very, very expensive; about $300 for 6 small tubes.  However, Amazon offers some veterinary skin adhesives at a very reasonable price.  Supposedly, the same ingredient is legal for use on people in Europe.</li>
    <li> No one treatment help me with painful skin cracks.  Just this one! I love it for simplicity for use. You need small dose for every crack! Thanks a lot  Nexcare 3M. Buy it! It really help!</li>
    <li> Not just for skin cracks--I use it for any small cut. It&#x27;s especially good for when your cuticle tears. Ouch!</li>
    <li> I use this on my fingertips in the winter, when I tend to get skin splits, and it works well.</li>
    <li> This stuff does an OK job of covering small wounds (think paper cuts, small scratches, and the like) but I would have preferred it if the solution had been thicker. It is quite thin and runny and if let&#x27;s say you have a wound where a tiny piece of skin is still attached, you&#x27;d be well advised to remove this first because the Skin Crack Care does not sufficiently cover it. It will continue to &amp;#34;stick out&amp;#34;, putting you at risk for further injury. Thicker solution would mean better protection in such instances...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am fine with it though. 3.5 stars if that were available.</li>
    <li> Several thin coats (dry in between)! Apply until wound doesn&#x27;t hurt when touched. It should begin to peel after a day or so. Remove and reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Skin must be dry and not actively bleeding before application.&lt;br /&gt;Will only sting on first or second coat because of anesthetic ingredients...bite a bullet!&lt;br /&gt;NOT for large wounds!&lt;br /&gt;Especially effective for wounds and cuts on flexible parts of body.&lt;br /&gt;Great for sores that have scabbed over but still hurt...will soften scab and draw infection to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Also try New Skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  It works like a charm and does not sting.  So glad I was able to find it online as the stores seem to have quit carrying it.</li>
    <li> If you let your fingers get too dehydrated (O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands is the best I have found as a moisturizer), this will temporarily close the cracks. It is the best product I have found. It is much like nail polish.  It has much better sealing and adhesive properties than New Skin.  I really have not found a product nearly as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the bottle dries out after a while.</li>
    <li> Every winter I get cracks on my knuckles and around the tips of my nails, and various other inconvenient locales.  Bandages help but get in the way when I type, cook, wash my hands and otherwise bend my fingers. Crack care helps seal up the crack so it hurts a little less, and I can keep tapping away.  Some deeper or longer cracks need double application (brush on, let dry, apply more, let dry more).  Crack care dissolves/breaks down in contact with moisturizer, so don&#x27;t apply lotion to the crack care area.  As with any glue applied to skin, crack care does not last all day as friction will rub it off.  I am willing to work with these minor issues of crack care, but anyone who expects this stuff to be like super glue, will be disappointed.  Note that one should minimize the bottle&#x27;s contents exposure to air, or the solution will thicken.  So as soon as you brush it on, put the brush back into the bottle.  Conclusion: only way I know to temporarily seal up my various skin cracks without band aids.</li>
    <li> Fixes those annoying fingertip cracks that occur during the winter.</li>
    <li> This product is great to use on cracked skin no burning, just works good.</li>
    <li> I sew for a living, and material is just like paper where skin is concerned..It steals moisture from your skin causing dryness and cracking. Every single winter I get those deep, very painful cracks near the fingernails on my thumbs.... Anyone that gets them knows what I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s amazing how painful they are.. It&#x27;s very hard using pins,needles,typing on my computer or even cutting with scissors..The slightest little bump causes horrible pain. I happen to be one of those people that pretty much ignores pain, but these things just do me in..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything from organic lotions, super expensive hand creams, handmade ointments, wearing gloves to bed with my hands coated in vaseline, 3 in 1 ointments, bandaids wrapped around my thumbs (they never stay)..you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. Nothing prevents them or heal them fast enough.. Each new crack seems to take about a week to finally heal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Nexcare product out of sheer desperation, not looking forward to another winter dealing with these painful skin cracks...I really didn&#x27;t think it would do much good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that time of year again,(cold)and I&#x27;ve already started getting those dang blasted cracks. A very painful one appeared yesterday afternoon, so before going to bed, I got this product out and applied some.. The instructions say you may need to add multiple layers to get good coverage, so that&#x27;s what I did.. As soon as one layer dried, I added another. I probably ended up putting about 6 layers on it.. When I went to bed, it was still very painful and I thought, this isn&#x27;t going to make a bit of difference.. But when I woke up this morning I was AMAZED that it no longer hurts.. I&#x27;ve been sewing all morning with absolutely no pain or problems... my other thumb felt like it was getting one, too, so I applied some of this near my thumb nail, and so far, so good..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey for such a small bottle, but because it works, it is so worth it!!! I would guess this one bottle is going to last all winter, though, so the price really isn&#x27;t that bad.!!!

    <li> I have been looking for this product for years.  It dropped out of the drugstores.  Then i found liquid bandaid in my drugstore and it wasnt quite the same so i googled liquid bandaid and Nexcare came up.  Its the best product out there for healing cracked fingers.</li>
    <li> As a nurse this is a great product. Have used for years</li>
    <li> My husband gets awful cracks from working outdoors and we were excited when we saw this product.  It helped but wasn&#x27;t a miracle cure.  I think that a good hand creme applied many times a day works just as well.  He also applies creme and wraps his fingers overnight.  That seems to help the most.</li>
    <li> Sliced my finger on a razor about 2 days after getting this in the mail. Boy was I happy to have this stuff handy. Did the trick with no burning or pain. What a life saver or in this case finger saver. It does have an odd smell but its not terrible.</li>
    <li> Works fast and removes pain. I use it when I have paper cuts or got a cut cooking.</li>
    <li> My Dad was a Pharmacist when I was growing up, at which time there were other skin applications for cuts and scratches, which usually burned your skin when applied.  When Nexcare  (3M product)started selling skin crack topical liquid, I began buying same from local pharmacies.  For several years, Nexcare was the only stock sold for for that application to hands.  Recently local pharmacies began selling their own brands which did not dry quick enough for me.  One day in early winter, I began checking on Nexcare  on the internet and found that Amazon sold the product.  Needless to say, I ordered Nexcare from Amazon and received same quickly, and began applying same to my hands the day it arrived. For my cuts, cracks and scratches, Nexcare works.  Thank you Amazon for helping me keep my medicine cabinet complete.</li>
    <li> Can not say enough good things about the product.I work leather all the time and get constant painful cracks in my thumbs and fingers.This product solves the problem.It works!</li>
    <li> Junk. Do not expect this to seal your skin like suture glue or skin glue, far more worth it to go get Vet bond for you AND your pet. This barely seals and wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Better than liquid bandage.</li>
    <li> this is the only solution that will work in 1 application, if you have cracks in your feet that hurt.</li>
    <li> My hands are always dry and I find my fingers split a lot. Bandaids are too large and get in the way, so I decided to give this a try. It was nice to have full use of my fingers for a change, and it does help the cracks pain as well. I recommend if you have cracks on your fingers. Well wroth the buy for me.</li>
    <li> Bought it from some other site, for a little bit less than on amazon. Purchased together with \\&quot;Skin Shield\\&quot;. This one smells like hell, costs three times more, for much less quantity and is no good. It doesn&#x27;t hold to your skin, gets washed away with water, the moment you get close to it. So it&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> I have to apply it often to protect the crack on my finger.  It wears off too quickly.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
