      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>These are perfect for the tops of my bottles so that I can easily find what I need.</li>
      <li>Nice labels but pricey.</li>
      <li>Very Nice Labels and Quick Shipping.</li>
      <li>These are nice, although I feel they should have come on the top of the bottles to begin with.</li>
      <li>These keep my oils easy to find!</li>
      <li>Love them because I am able to use no matter where I purchased, although I can tell do Terra oils appear more potent, which I absolutely love!</li>
      <li>great stickers quick and easy to use</li>
      <li>Love knowing it&#x27;s official doTerra.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;to be able to give samples to clients.</li>
      <li>There were 7 of something called Slim and Sassy which I sure don&#x27;t need and five of something called On-Guard.  </li>
      <li>OK purchase, but</li>
      <li>I am able to pull out the doTerra oil I want without having to take each one out to find the one I want.</li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>Love them.  </li>
      <li>They do what they are supposed to do, but there should be more labels for the amount of money.  </li>
      <li>Easy to see oils that are in box.</li>
      <li>Price is great and when you have a collection of essential oils, this is a MUST have to track them all.</li>
      <li>These fit on all my bottles of essentials oils.</li>
      <li>They fit the bottles well and match the colors of the bottles.</li>
      <li>It is so great to have these stickers for my essential oil caps.</li>
      <li>Good, my stickers were a bit off center.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re making an oils order anyways do it there otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be worth paying shipping</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>there could be more blank ones on this sheet</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and packaged well</li>
      <li>The stickers are exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Very helpful!</li>
      <li>These stickers are exactly what I wanted!&lt;br</li>
      <li>wish they were more blank ones</li>
      <li>life so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really stick that good to the bottle caps either - you have to keep pressing them down.  </li>
      <li>, I just wiped the tops of the lids with alcohol first to make sure there was no dust or oil on them and let them dry before applying the stickers.</li>
      <li>Wanted these little labels, but there must be a better way.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really complain about that, though, it&#x27;s not like there isn&#x27;t a clear picture to show what the stickers are</li>
      <li>Expensive for a sheet of stickers but nice to have for the top of your essential oil bottles.</li>
      <li>Other than that they are just fine.</li>
      <li>Received in new condition.</li>
      <li>and it DOES clearly say DoTERRA in the description!</li>
      <li>fit perfectly on my little oil bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
      <li>I read someone&#x27;s comments that they had labels for nearly every oil that is out there.  </li>
      <li>Wish that it had a few more blank stickers.</li>
      <li>Weird they&#x27;re listed and weirder that folks are willing to pay more than 10 times the price for them...</li>
      <li>I only realized after ordering that I could&#x27;ve gotten this same sticker sheet through my normal doTERRA orders.</li>
      <li>Honestly too expensive for one sheet of stickers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are perfect for the tops of my bottles so that I can easily find what I need. Also great for roller bottles.</li>
    <li> Met my needs. Perfect!</li>
    <li> These fit on all my bottles of essentials oils. Even the smaller bottles. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good, my stickers were a bit off center. I only realized after ordering that I could&#x27;ve gotten this same sticker sheet through my normal doTERRA orders. I found it under product literature and/or through the search bar on my order for 50 cents! If you&#x27;re making an oils order anyways do it there otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be worth paying shipping</li>
    <li> Great product. The stickers are exactly what I wanted. They fit the bottles well and match the colors of the bottles.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very helpful!</li>
    <li> Wanted these little labels, but there must be a better way.  Expensive and so was shipping.  They do what they are supposed to do, but there should be more labels for the amount of money.  They don&#x27;t really stick that good to the bottle caps either - you have to keep pressing them down.  OK purchase, but I&#x27;ll be looking for a DIY bottle cap label solution.</li>
    <li> All I recieved was promotional material for doterra. No label stickers. Rediculous</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy doTerra oils so I really should have thought this through, almost half are doTerra blends! If you hover over the image you can see that the second row below the middle starts the blends. I can&#x27;t really complain about that, though, it&#x27;s not like there isn&#x27;t a clear picture to show what the stickers are and it DOES clearly say DoTERRA in the description! I was disappointed though that instead of Tea Tree, there&#x27;s &amp;#34;Melaleuca&amp;#34; (same thing) and nothing for Vanilla. They do seem to stick well, I just wiped the tops of the lids with alcohol first to make sure there was no dust or oil on them and let them dry before applying the stickers.</li>
    <li> Received in new condition. Price is great and when you have a collection of essential oils, this is a MUST have to track them all.</li>
    <li> It is so great to have these stickers for my essential oil caps. I am able to pull out the doTerra oil I want without having to take each one out to find the one I want.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to put out there that you can order these through doTERRA for like 50 cents a sheet. Just saying</li>
    <li> Oops!  I have Young Living Oils and ordered the wrong ones.  Other than that they are just fine.</li>
    <li> As expected but took awhile to deliver.</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps find the oil you are looking for faster, to have the labels on their lids.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why WA&#x27;s are ordering these on amazon??  From DoTerra they are only 50¢.... They&#x27;re in your LRP drop-down list of products.  The shipping cost for the oils negates the shipping cost for these stickers.  Goodness!!  I don&#x27;t know whether DoTerra even allows the resale of the stickers....  Weird they&#x27;re listed and weirder that folks are willing to pay more than 10 times the price for them...&lt;br /&gt; I am so confused.</li>
    <li> Honestly too expensive for one sheet of stickers.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Wish that it had a few more blank stickers.</li>
    <li> Bouhgt these so I can take some of my oils with me to work and know which is which.</li>
    <li> These stickers are exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;They fit perfectly on my little oil bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Makes life so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very Nice Labels and Quick Shipping.</li>
    <li> wish they were more blank ones</li>
    <li> These keep my oils easy to find!</li>
    <li> Expensive for a sheet of stickers but nice to have for the top of your essential oil bottles.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and packaged well</li>
    <li> great stickers quick and easy to use</li>
    <li> Love them.  Easy to see oils that are in box.</li>
    <li> there could be more blank ones on this sheet&lt;br /&gt;to be able to give samples to clients. will purchase again</li>
    <li> These are nice, although I feel they should have come on the top of the bottles to begin with.</li>
    <li> I read someone&#x27;s comments that they had labels for nearly every oil that is out there.  They don&#x27;t.  This grouping doesn&#x27;t come with Carrot, Cumin, Elemi, 4-Theives, Ho Wood, Litsea, Nerolina, Origanum, Pine, or Petitgrain.  There were five blank circles, but I needed 10 of them.  Also, it comes with five Pepperment, and that seemed excessive to me.  There were only three Myrrh, and I imagine that lots of people buy Myrrh.  There were 7 of something called Slim and Sassy which I sure don&#x27;t need and five of something called On-Guard.  I don&#x27;t know what that is.</li>
    <li> Perfect stickers! Love them because I am able to use no matter where I purchased, although I can tell do Terra oils appear more potent, which I absolutely love!</li>
    <li> Now I can read my vials when in the container.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love knowing it&#x27;s official doTerra.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Nice labels but pricey.</li>
    <li> I love these I will definitely order more.</li>
