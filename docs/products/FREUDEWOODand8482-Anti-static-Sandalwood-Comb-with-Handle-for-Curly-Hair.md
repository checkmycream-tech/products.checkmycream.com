      <li>the top two teeth broke off.</li>
      <li>I would think it would be more sturdy.</li>
      <li>Love this comb.</li>
      <li>I love this comb.</li>
      <li>Calm, smooth, happy hair.</li>
      <li>just ordered 2 more.</li>
      <li>She was very pleased for the feature of success in combing fine curly tangles</li>
      <li>Love this comb and the wood is very smooth and dense, my new favorite!</li>
      <li>It makes it easy to comb through my curly hair without pulling and tugging and breaking my hair.  </li>
      <li>, it was really strong.</li>
      <li>Solid wood, and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Hands down best comb purchase ever!</li>
      <li>Bought this neat comb along with Handcrafted Neem wood comb (sold from SoulGenie, made in India) - these two combs are hands down best combs - they are affordable.</li>
      <li>: When I first got it, it had a very very strong smell (and I guess I was expecting that from the name)</li>
      <li>Wonderful functional comb, though feel bit heavy in hand</li>
      <li>This is a great wooden comb.  </li>
      <li>but it is only Feb, lol.</li>
      <li>ordered this comb with another one &amp;#34;Handmade 100% Red Sandalwood Wood Comb Beautiful Aromatic Smell Long Handle&amp;#34; both of them are very good ;)</li>
      <li>I will be ordering several more so that I can have one in bathroom, in car etc and will make great, very useable gifts.</li>
      <li>Feels significant in my hand not flimsy.</li>
      <li>It IS a bit of a cool effect, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, as it hasn&#x27;t comprimised the comb&#x27;s integrity, but I was hoping for the color shown.</li>
      <li>This comb feels so good gliding across my head and easily combs through my wet conditioned hair.</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair and brushing with this thing</li>
      <li>I use this one on wet hair - gives a nice shine and evenly distributes serum or argan oil without harm to hair!</li>
      <li>But having frizzy, curly hair and not having much luck using the best, natural products possible, I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought I was getting!</li>
      <li>suppose it is a fine enough comb if you don&#x27;t already have issues with frizz, but I cannot recommend buying it for the purpose of reducing frizz or static.</li>
      <li>Up until the other day it was a very nice comb, dropped it on the floor and sure enough the tip of the comb bent inwards.</li>
      <li>The first one, I blamed on the apple cider vinegar spray I used as a detangler on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I LOVE WOODEN COMBS.</li>
      <li>As a side note, some people say this has a funny smell to it.</li>
      <li>switched to this wooden comb and its much better.</li>
      <li>The first order I placed came in about 10 days (because the item comes from China) and it had tape marks that destroyed the wood finish.</li>
      <li>After I ordered the first one I then noticed it was shipping from Asia and the delivery date was 2 or 3 weeks out.</li>
      <li>If this comb ever does break (seems pretty sturdy)</li>
      <li>Anyone who wants a nice wide tooth comb.</li>
      <li>just makes my hair get brushed so easily and leaves it all pretty and shiny.</li>
      <li>and I love it too for my long hair.</li>
      <li>A comb that seems it will last a long time and is good to my scalp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a substantial weight, so I anticipate it will last a good long while</li>
      <li>I use this instead of a brush because i have wavy/curly fine hair, but not curly enough to use a pick.  </li>
      <li>This comb is sleek and designed very well.  </li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
      <li>This one works for gently detangling after a shower.  </li>
      <li>And the seller is good,  the item came earlier then I expected.</li>
      <li>very solid, unlikely to easily break  and  combs beautifully.</li>
      <li>As long as you handle with care it should be fine.</li>
      <li>I use it for my baby&#x27;s hair, its great because it is pretty wide for a small head</li>
      <li>I never noticed static in any of my previous brushes</li>
      <li>My hair is super frizzy, especially in the winters.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It glides easily through my hair - I have very long fine hair that was previously knotty to comb</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and the smell is faint now, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been experiencing a lot of trouble with static electricity this winter, but this comb seems to have reduced it quite a bit.</li>
      <li>I fixed it with clear nail polish, so it is no longer a problem, but something I want others to he aware of.</li>
      <li>Nice comb for thick hair</li>
      <li>Definitely combs without creating static in fine thin or aging hair.&lt;br /&gt;May</li>
      <li>This one which was more expensive is my favorite, certainly worth the price as compared to the handcrafted neem wood comb (which I will give away to somebody with less hair than me).</li>
      <li>When I brushed with my plastic comb, my hair literally flew up due to the static and stayed there.</li>
      <li>but it is a natural tree type smell so not complaining!  </li>
      <li>After reading that wooden combs reduce frizzy and seeing positive reviews for this one, I thought I&#x27;d give it</li>
      <li>Such a large claim for a hair comb.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> came ahead of schedule and was well packaged.  I&#x27;ve been experiencing a lot of trouble with static electricity this winter, but this comb seems to have reduced it quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this comb. As a naturally curly hair mixed chic this comb is a life saver or should I say a hair saver. I noticed less hair fall after just one use. It doesn&#x27;t snag and the polished wood distributes oil evenly through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight out the package this comb smells intoxicating. You can tell the craftsmanship and quality that went into making it. My fave purchase so far this year but it is only Feb, lol.</li>
    <li> This is just perfect. Very thick wood and smooth to use. It is not cheap when you&#x27;re holding it and just buy it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a comb that had lost some teeth.  I&#x27;m very happy, works well on my hair, cleans easily, and fits in my travel case.</li>
    <li> PRO: This comb is AMAZING!! I don&#x27;t get it... I&#x27;ve been using plastic/metal combs for all of my life! I&#x27;ve been missing out hahahah :D Seriously, I never though wooden combs would make such a difference. I have super curly hair and brushing with this thing just makes my hair get brushed so easily and leaves it all pretty and shiny. I immedietaly called my sisters and recommended this product :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda Con: When I first got it, it had a very very strong smell (and I guess I was expecting that from the name) I just didn&#x27;t really like the smell, it was really strong. But I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and the smell is faint now, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I use it for my baby&#x27;s hair, its great because it is pretty wide for a small head and it detangles his hair, which he has a ton with adorable curls. Comb is smooth and nice, I havent noticed any static.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Feels significant in my hand not flimsy. Feel like I will have it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Nice comb for thick hair</li>
    <li> just ordered 2 more. does not tear out hair. I dropped one and it cracked. But was my fault. will only use these from now on!</li>
    <li> Bought this off recommendations here. It does have a strong smell - not sure if I like it or not - but it is a natural tree type smell so not complaining!  It glides easily through my hair - I have very long fine hair that was previously knotty to comb but I seem to have no knots when I use this!?  It&#x27;s weighty compared to the bamboo one I was using but the shape of the stem is very comfortable in the hand and overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I had purchased two brands based on how they were promoted at amazon. This one which was more expensive is my favorite, certainly worth the price as compared to the handcrafted neem wood comb (which I will give away to somebody with less hair than me). I had been using big toothed plastic combs which were creating havoc with my thick long naturally curly hair prone to knots. This comb looks good and feels good. The idea of using a wooden comb was suggested by my Kundalini yoga teacher. The comb goes everywhere with me.... I love how it works on my scalp and in my hair.... I feel good about its organic properties. I will be ordering several more so that I can have one in bathroom, in car etc and will make great, very useable gifts.</li>
    <li> Had it in my backpack and it broke some how....the top two teeth broke off. I would think it would be more sturdy. It was great on my scalp, I loved the way it felt. The teeth where a little short for me though, I have long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Up until the other day it was a very nice comb, dropped it on the floor and sure enough the tip of the comb bent inwards. As long as you handle with care it should be fine. Smells great and is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like this comb a lot. It has wider teeth and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair. Out of the box, it does smell like vinegar, but I washed it with soap before usage and the smell attenuated.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, and so worth having, I will probably buy more for gifts and to have a spare in case it gets stolen!</li>
    <li> Bought this for grandaughter for her children.  She was very pleased for the feature of success in combing fine curly tangles</li>
    <li> Wonderful functional comb, though feel bit heavy in hand</li>
    <li> My husband has never been so enchanted by a comb before. He thought I was crazy spending $11 on a comb until he tried it. We live in the country with no garbage pick up when we have a plastic comb break or the weird rubber part rubs off we don&#x27;t have a proper place to dispose of it. If this comb ever does break (seems pretty sturdy) we can put it in a burn pile with no worries.</li>
    <li> I love the comb. It&#x27;s the only comb, that doesn&#x27;t make my hair all fluffy from static electricity. And the seller is good,  the item came earlier then I expected.</li>
    <li> The wood is green, thanks to what I&#x27;m assuming is some sort of fungus in the wood. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, as it hasn&#x27;t comprimised the comb&#x27;s integrity, but I was hoping for the color shown. It IS a bit of a cool effect, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could really do without the giant &amp;#34;oriental&amp;#34; logo etched into it. I think i&#x27;m going to sand it down and paint something on it.</li>
    <li> The first order I placed came in about 10 days (because the item comes from China) and it had tape marks that destroyed the wood finish. I complained to the seller and was promptly sent a second comb, ten days later, of course. Within days of use, both combs have developed a  weird green tint to the wood. The first one, I blamed on the apple cider vinegar spray I used as a detangler on my daughter&#x27;s hair. The second one, I set in a window sill for a sunny afternoon and that side turned green. The green is very unattractive as it looks like a raw piece of wood.  The comb functions as it should, it helps me comb through my daughter&#x27;s afro curly hair and my wavy hair with less snagging. I don&#x27;t know yet if it helps reduce static or gray hair since it is still summer time and I&#x27;ve not had the comb long enough to see if it reduces grays. I&#x27;ll continue to use the comb. As with other reviewers, the Oriental printed on the comb is not a winning design for me, but it was the right length with handle and tooth size for my needs, so I went with it. The cost of the comb is about $15 with shipping, so not cheap for a comb. I wish I still liked the look of the comb...oh well.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice comb.  Solid wood, and beautiful.  Each one is different.  I know this because after i got one, I needed more so i could have one in my travel bag and one in my car.  No static.  I use this instead of a brush because i have wavy/curly fine hair, but not curly enough to use a pick.  It helps me avoid the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect comb for men or women.  Anyone who wants a nice wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> I am nopooer (water-only) and this comb works amazing for breaking up waxy build up and distributing sebum! Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;squishyfacecollection.com</li>
    <li> This comb is sleek and designed very well.  A comb that seems it will last a long time and is good to my scalp.</li>
    <li> Bought this neat comb along with Handcrafted Neem wood comb (sold from SoulGenie, made in India) - these two combs are hands down best combs - they are affordable. I have tried the more expensive ones and they dont come close to what Freudewood sandalwood comb has to offer! I use this one on wet hair - gives a nice shine and evenly distributes serum or argan oil without harm to hair! And did i mention it smells heavenly in addition to being affordable! My hair are so much better and scalp happy that I use this widetooth comb with the neem wood comb!! Hands down best comb purchase ever!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought I was getting!</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase. Love this comb. Definitely combs without creating static in fine thin or aging hair.&lt;br /&gt;May get another just to keep in my luggage for travel. And it smells great too!</li>
    <li> My hair is super frizzy, especially in the winters. When I brushed with my plastic comb, my hair literally flew up due to the static and stayed there. Not a pretty sight.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this wooden comb and its much better. Less tangles too. I would definitely recommend for dry hair. Just wish the price was bit lower.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this comb.  It&#x27;s hard to tell on-line how wide the teeth are.  This one works for gently detangling after a shower.  It&#x27;s a substantial weight, so I anticipate it will last a good long while and the teeth are thick enough that I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll break very easily.  Good quality, smooth wood.</li>
    <li> I had a friend recommend wooden combs to me saying it changed her life. Such a large claim for a hair comb. But having frizzy, curly hair and not having much luck using the best, natural products possible, I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;. I bought this and one other comb with tighter teeth to get the smaller knots. It&#x27;s been a few months now and I must say...I LOVE WOODEN COMBS. I never noticed static in any of my previous brushes so I didn&#x27;t think it was a problem. But one use, literally one, and I immediately felt a change. Calm, smooth, happy hair. These are even better than boar bristle brushes at controlling static. My curls are so happy now! As a side note, some people say this has a funny smell to it. Unless you&#x27;re combing nose hair or a beard, the smell is not noticeable. The comb has to be touching the nose in order to smell anything from it. It&#x27;s not a strong enough smell to leave any residue on your hair, so the smell is a non-issue.</li>
    <li> It decreases the static in my hair and distributes oils evenly from the roots to the tips.  Fewer split ends too.</li>
    <li> I always brushing my hair with wood comb.&lt;br /&gt;Its healthier for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this comb with another one &amp;#34;Handmade 100% Red Sandalwood Wood Comb Beautiful Aromatic Smell Long Handle&amp;#34; both of them are very good ;)</li>
    <li> COMB TEETH WILL SPLIT!  made from different pieces of bamboo and glued together. buy only if you want your hair pulled out and your hard earned money wasted.</li>
    <li> love it for my curly hair and also for no static electricity!</li>
    <li> best wooden  comb i have ever owned. very solid, unlikely to easily break  and  combs beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love this comb!!  I have noticed a difference in the my hair&#x27;s sheen and health!!</li>
    <li> This is a great wooden comb.  It makes it easy to comb through my curly hair without pulling and tugging and breaking my hair.  I have never had a wooden comb before but now I intend to never be without one.  Plus no static with this comb which can be a problem for me in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love this comb. I have long thick wavy hair and have been using a plastic wide tooth comb on days I wash my hair. Otherwise I do not comb or brush my hair so I do not damage the curls.  This comb feels so good gliding across my head and easily combs through my wet conditioned hair. It has a faint smell of sandalwood which I wish was stronger but it is what it is.    My husband also loves it so I just ordered another one for him    After I ordered the first one I then noticed it was shipping from Asia and the delivery date was 2 or 3 weeks out. In reality it only took a few days, maybe a week. I am very very happy with this purchase. If anything changes I will update my review but for now it is 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is an almost perfect comb. It does thejob well and is sturdy. The only problem I has wad that the actual comb portion was put in in two pieces, so there was a tiny gap where the two pieces meet. This was causing a hair to get caught every time I used it. I fixed it with clear nail polish, so it is no longer a problem, but something I want others to he aware of.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have long wavy/curly hair that is very thick. A year later, I am still using it. I would re order as needed.</li>
    <li> I have long, medium-thickness, wavy hair and I&#x27;ve always had trouble with frizz. After reading that wooden combs reduce frizzy and seeing positive reviews for this one, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once or twice and then threw it away. It did nothing to reduce or prevent frizz in my hair. Practically, I found no noticeable difference between this and a regular plastic comb. I usually only comb my hair after showering but the wooden comb still resulted in frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it is a fine enough comb if you don&#x27;t already have issues with frizz, but I cannot recommend buying it for the purpose of reducing frizz or static.</li>
    <li> works great for straight hair also!</li>
    <li> I love this comb-natural -has nice smell. I do recommend to buy it</li>
    <li> Love this comb and the wood is very smooth and dense, my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Smelt bad when it arrived...I used essential oil on mines...but I still like the idea of wood rather then plastic and I get lots of compliments...don&#x27;t know what kind of wood it is though,I wish I did</li>
    <li> This comb feels great to hold and brush hair with. My boyfriend uses it for his short hair (and loves it!) and I love it too for my long hair. It is the righ amount of heavy and sleek - very luxurious!</li>
