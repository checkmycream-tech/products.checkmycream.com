      <li>They have a nice feel in your hand.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery and perfect size!</li>

      <li>I bought these because I make homemade lotion and crèmes  and wanted something to put them in that was a bit more fancy to hand out to friends.  </li>
      <li>I Love these containers!!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Love the jars.</li>
      <li>Wish there were more sizes.</li>
      <li>These are lovely for homemade body butter.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of these for more of my wood butter product.</li>
      <li>Love these cups.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t feel cheap!</li>
      <li>I like it will again order more</li>
      <li>These were very easy to use and light to ship.</li>
      <li>, I figured I would would be able to write it and have it sound &#x27;nicer&#x27;</li>
      <li>Very professional looking to sell my own lotions in!</li>
      <li>Avery Labels stick to the lid securely, the inner liner lid thing fits nicely, and the container itself seems good and sturdy.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll be fine for use around the house</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are cheap plastic jars that are well made and do what is claimed but</li>
      <li>It is such a great product.  </li>
      <li>I filled them with epsom bath salt, and wrote on the lid with a sharpie.  </li>
      <li>They are great quality for home made products or for smaller amounts to take along on a trip.</li>
      <li>So I believe these containers need to be kept at room temperature or in a cool place to avoid mold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve shipped them full of product and nothing leaked out.  </li>
      <li>This larger size is great for body butters without going to large on the container.</li>
      <li>I make and ship coconut oil products and these are excellent as the inner seal actually seals and makes the jar leak proof.</li>
      <li>It just makes my products look more professional.  </li>
      <li>The price is definitely right for a dozen of these containers.</li>
      <li>I love that they come with the inner cover.</li>
      <li>so if you drop them, they most likely will crack/break.</li>
      <li>I made salve in the containers  FAST shipping!</li>
      <li>And I love the inner liner that comes with it.</li>
      <li>They are easy to open and close, and the contents don&#x27;t spill out at all.</li>
      <li>I bought these to fill with homemade body butter, and the top insert is nice, but the containers themselves are SO cheap you have to open them with such a gentle hand, the lids are hard to get off.</li>
      <li>very practical</li>
      <li>I use them for my skin and hair products I make they are sold reasonably</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>I really like these plastic 4 ounce containers.</li>
      <li>I really like these containers.  </li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>They are very sturdy and what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and packaged well.  </li>
      <li>I like them so much that I bought three packs for my Shea butter&#x27;s peppermint scrubs and mud</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>the &#x27;high quality&#x27; statement is so obscure.</li>
      <li>I can agree that the manufacturing of these can be considered high quality but the plastic itself is not.</li>
      <li>You CANNOT open them unless you VERY gently hold the lid because the plastic bends.</li>
      <li>Nice quality and also come with a second cover under the cap with a small pull tab.  </li>
      <li>Seals well &amp; the inner seal makes my products look very professional.</li>
      <li>They close tightly and the removable liner keeps the product fresh and from leaking.</li>
      <li>The size is right for me as I can make small amounts and also give as gifts.</li>

<li> I love that the jars are double sealed making it near impossible for my lotions that I create to leak, the inner seal secures all of the products I make and the lid is solid.  </li>
<li> Tons of product for the money!&lt;br /&gt;It just feels a little heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of thick when blending in.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My only complaint is that one needs a gentle touch to twist them open, rather than my normal Firm Grip.</li>
<li> and I received them earlier then expected.</li>
<li> so... please excuse my frankness as I know it sounds harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I find it takes a number of tries to get the lid to match the grooves to screw on correctly, likely due to the flimsy/flexible sides.  </li>
<li> These containers are super-cute and can be used for anything from creams, to bath salts, to loose powder.  </li>
<li> I like these especially the little cover on inside of jar</li>
<li> Also, don&#x27;t be rough with them and just place the liner on and screw lid on evenly</li>
<li> Difficult to place label on jar due to large lid screw off in the middle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not pleased and will be searching for a nicer jar in the future.</li>
<li> Hard to open the caps.</li>
<li> and I did see black specs of mold on the one that had coconut peppermint scrub in it.</li>
<li> little babies 😍 can&#x27;t wait to put them to use</li>
<li> I used these for a bridal shower that a threw a few months ago.  </li>
<li> I have quite a few in my bathroom, and one was in my bathtub area</li>
<li> Not to thin.</li>
<li> cold products that are just scooped in.</li>

    <li> I like these containers.  I use these for my body butters, creams, salves. They have a nice feel in your hand. You can feel the quality! I love that they come with the inner cover. It just makes my products look more professional.  I&#x27;ve used these for jot products, poured in to set, and cold products that are just scooped in. Works great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I make my own body butter and these jars are perfect for that purpose. They will be nice jars for gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought these to fill with homemade body butter, and the top insert is nice, but the containers themselves are SO cheap you have to open them with such a gentle hand, the lids are hard to get off. You CANNOT open them unless you VERY gently hold the lid because the plastic bends. They&#x27;ll be fine for use around the house but I probably wouldn&#x27;t sell anything in these jars.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:bf7a610251e6a6631c80fd0443724c21]] I bought these for my homemade sunscreen lotion and moisturizers so I can take them with me in a convenient size while out and about and thought these 4 ounce jars would be perfect. My worry was these jars would not be &#x27;sealed&#x27; enough and it would leak out all over the inside of my purse. So I did what I call &#x27;the liquid test&#x27; to check the size and seal of the jars. Watch the video to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, these are plastic jars so if you drop them, they most likely will crack/break. Also, don&#x27;t be rough with them and just place the liner on and screw lid on evenly (in my video is perfect example what can happen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I don&#x27;t know how to say this without it sounding horrible which is why I didn&#x27;t say anything in the video, I figured I would would be able to write it and have it sound &#x27;nicer&#x27; but I am at a loss on how to write it as well so... please excuse my frankness as I know it sounds harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are cheap plastic jars that are well made and do what is claimed but the &#x27;high quality&#x27; statement is so obscure. I can agree that the manufacturing of these can be considered high quality but the plastic itself is not. I do not see what kind of plastic this is listed anywhere so leaching chemicals from the jar to the product is a possibility which means I wouldn&#x27;t store my product in these but use them while on the go. Now, with that being said, for the price I paid and what I got, I am very happy with them. These are for my personal use but if I was in business of selling my products, I would consider a different jar.</li>
    <li> I use these for sugar scrubs. They work quite well.</li>
    <li> Love the jars. Wish there were more sizes.</li>
    <li> These were very easy to use and light to ship. I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These containers are great! Nice quality and also come with a second cover under the cap with a small pull tab.  Shipped fast and packaged well.  Will buy this brand again!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for making my own shea butter mixes. Great for traveling and no leaking at all!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT! I love these containers! I make and ship coconut oil products and these are excellent as the inner seal actually seals and makes the jar leak proof.</li>
    <li> I used these for a bridal shower that a threw a few months ago.  I filled them with epsom bath salt, and wrote on the lid with a sharpie.  These containers are super-cute and can be used for anything from creams, to bath salts, to loose powder.  They are easy to open and close, and the contents don&#x27;t spill out at all.</li>
    <li> These are lovely for homemade body butter.</li>
    <li> These seemed much smaller than 4oz. Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I Love these containers!!!&lt;br /&gt;My little babies 😍 can&#x27;t wait to put them to use</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the skin care products I&#x27;m making- diaper cream and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Started making my own lotion and these are perfect!</li>
    <li> Using these to hold my wood butter. My only complaint is that one needs a gentle touch to twist them open, rather than my normal Firm Grip. Avery Labels stick to the lid securely, the inner liner lid thing fits nicely, and the container itself seems good and sturdy. I will be buying more of these for more of my wood butter product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with quality. I made salve in the containers  FAST shipping! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> very nice containers. It even has a cap that helps give it an extra seal.  Very professional looking to sell my own lotions in!</li>
    <li> I like it will again order more</li>
    <li> Great size, perfect for lip gloss, samples, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I make homemade lotion and crèmes  and wanted something to put them in that was a bit more fancy to hand out to friends.  These were great!  I loved that they had a lid that went on top to cover the cream as an added protection also.  These are a great alternative to the Ball glass jars I was putting them in before and they are much lighter in weight!  I would definitely recommend these for smaller amounts of body butters or hand crèmes you might want to give out to others!</li>
    <li> I really like these plastic 4 ounce containers. I like them so much that I bought three packs for my Shea butter&#x27;s peppermint scrubs and mud masks.&lt;br /&gt;The containers have it inside lid that is detachable to protect whatever product you put inside of them. I did notice that these also do collect mold. I have quite a few in my bathroom, and one was in my bathtub area and I did see black specs of mold on the one that had coconut peppermint scrub in it. So I just took off the inside lid and cleaned around the container and my peppermint scrub was not affected at all. So I believe these containers need to be kept at room temperature or in a cool place to avoid mold. The price is definitely right for a dozen of these containers. In the pic below I have put some face mud in my container and it&#x27;s kept nice and protected.</li>
    <li> I really like these containers.  It is such a great product.  You get three pieces for the price of one.  I love that the jars are double sealed making it near impossible for my lotions that I create to leak, the inner seal secures all of the products I make and the lid is solid.  I would definitely always recommend using these containers.  And the price is excellent.  I will continue to purchase these containers.</li>
    <li> Great quality and price</li>
    <li> Tons of product for the money!&lt;br /&gt;It just feels a little heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of thick when blending in.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s protecting my skin well, though.</li>
    <li> They are very sturdy and what I was hoping for. The delivery was on time</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife, who makes her own organic products. She was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This larger size is great for body butters without going to large on the container. And I love the inner liner that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy these again. I find it takes a number of tries to get the lid to match the grooves to screw on correctly, likely due to the flimsy/flexible sides.  I&#x27;m not pleased and will be searching for a nicer jar in the future.</li>
    <li> I got these for home made lotions. They work wonderfully! The size is right for me as I can make small amounts and also give as gifts. They close tightly and the removable liner keeps the product fresh and from leaking. They are great quality for home made products or for smaller amounts to take along on a trip.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade lotions and salves.</li>
    <li> Worked out well. Doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
