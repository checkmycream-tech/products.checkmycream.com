      <li>Lovely!</li>
      <li>I still love this product despite all that!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>Nice lotion</li>
      <li>I liked this.</li>

      <li>but I like this as a nice creamy moisturizer for the winter months.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be a really good face cream without as many toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a nice combination.</li>
      <li>It is light but very effective.</li>
      <li>Now I order it here, it&#x27;s more cost effective.  </li>
      <li>so it may not be suitable for people with oily skin.</li>
      <li>also think its ingredients are pretty good and that it is a good value.</li>
      <li>good moisturizer - not oily - no blemishes - just a great product, highly recommend this item - cheers to smooth faces!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s a little win; but it makes me feel great!  </li>
      <li>I have always been told I have beautiful skin, so I really want to fight this fight.  </li>
      <li>Very smooth, non greasy formula.</li>
      <li>This creme feels good and has a pleasant scent, but if you have naturally oil-prone skin</li>
      <li>(You would be safe to buy from derma e)  </li>

      <li>4-Ounce Jar is an outstanding item.</li>
      <li>This cream was okay.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>they just have too many chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite daytime moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m inching my way towards 30 and decided to get on the wrinkle care; better to prevent than treat</li>
      <li>I tried Loreal Revitalift, Neutragena Healthy skin, Eucerin Q10, Nivea Visage, etc, with no change.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s especially good under my eyes at preventing puffiness/wrinkles from not getting enough sleep.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Phenoxyethanol-Repeated exposure to the substance over prolonged periods has been linked to contact dermatitis (more info 1 and 2), worsening of eczema (more info), reproductive toxicity (more info) and neurotoxicity (more info 1 and 2).</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I wished there was a formula for it with a more matte look.</li>
      <li>probably more then olay or neutrogena.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice and light for night time use.  </li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin feels.  </li>
      <li>I stock up because I can&#x27;t love without this.</li>
      <li>It does make skin more elastic and youthful.  </li>
      <li>Our ages: 56 and 61&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, she was pleased.</li>
      <li>I thought Derma E made safe products.  </li>
      <li>but I bet it would be ok.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used this on my legs in addition to a caffeine based cream to help with toning. Didn&#x27;t notice much difference. I&#x27;ll stick to my caffeine cream and squats.</li>
    <li> I like this cream.  Makes my face smooth.</li>
    <li> i really like the feel of this cream, i don&#x27;t actually use it on my face, mostly hands, arms and feet. it works really well and leaves your skin soft for the whole day.  seems like it might be a bit heavy for your face.  the ingredient list is good, not great, but at the price it&#x27;s likely as good as you are going to get.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this face cream.  I am 50 years old but still have combination skin (not dry) and this cream doesn&#x27;t feel too moist as some do.  My skin has not had any negative reactions in the past 3 weeks of application.  What a value too!  Cost 1/3 of what I was paying for less than half this size of another organic/natural brand.  I really like this derma e brand.  I also use their skin lotions.  I will begin using the face wash and toner in this line once my old brand is gone.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It&#x27;s really nice and light for night time use.  Mainly, it moisturizes, from what I can tell.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Smoothes out my skin. Absolutely zero breakouts... love this stuff and highly recommend for minimizing all wrinkles</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My husband says it makes me smell like old lady, but I like the smell.  I still have plenty of it, too, after a year (I only put it under my eyes).</li>
    <li> Not a product i will order again, surprisingly</li>
    <li> good product, thank you</li>
    <li> Although it is a better alternative than most facial moisturizers, this one still contains questionable ingredients.</li>
    <li> Yes, this cream really does work--but don&#x27;t expect instant results.  Keep using it for about two weeks to see what&#x27;s happening.  It does make skin more elastic and youthful.  It&#x27;s not a liquid face-lift (let&#x27;s face it, nothing does that!), but it does dramatically improve one&#x27;s appearance if used regularly.  I use it when I get up in the morning, just a light touch will do it.  It has a smooth, creamy, light and hydrating feel without being oily or sticky.  Lovely!</li>
    <li> It really Works! And the price is good.</li>
    <li> Great product and it got here a day earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I love this derma e cream! It was recommended on a message board with a very large population. It has done a wonderful job of hiding fine lines and making my skin feel silky.</li>
    <li> This is currently my everyday facial moisturizer. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so can&#x27;t attest to how it works for that, but it&#x27;s creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face. A little goes a long way so I expect the jar to last a long time.</li>
    <li> this one i guess is the cheaper version of derma e products. it is got too much fragrance, and is very sticky, they have some better products to offer</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years its a great product. It will even out your skin tone. Great for Clearing age spots.</li>
    <li> derma e Refining Vitamin A Crème, 4-Ounce Jar is an outstanding item. I have been using this creme for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this cream.  I like it because it is non greasy and absorbs fast into your skin.  My skin tends to be sensitive and I have had no issues with it.  It is mildly scented and looks like cold cream.  I use it at night to combat the signs of aging.  The results have been subtle.  This product is best at helping preserve your skin from more damage and smooths out  wrinkles.  This is no miracle in a jar but it does what it is suppose to do.  There are many creams out there with the same ingredients that cost way more than this.  I think tis is a good buy and will continue to use it.  I wish I had started using the cream when I was younger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a moisturizer to use at night for a long time.  I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of very expensive ones and have not been happy with any of them.  I&#x27;ve got oily skin prone to break outs and am starting to get some crow&#x27;s feet.  I like to use a \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; cream b/c I&#x27;m hoping to prevent Mother Nature from taking her natural course.  I was finally frustrated with the search and found this in my favorite grocery store. Since it was not expensive, I decided I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  My first impressions were that it felt and smelled GREAT!  My 4 year old even commented on how good it smelled. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half, and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin.  It looks smoother, my pores look smaller, and I&#x27;m not breaking out as much.  After all the expensive stuff I&#x27;ve bought through the years, and this is the stuff that has made the biggest difference!</li>
    <li> Not much change at the moment how long does one have to wait I have used it morning and night since it arrived  Pat Bradford</li>
    <li> Let me say a little about my skin type and concerns, so before you read this you can decide if it is applicable to you.  I am 46 and have normal /combination skin.  I am pale and burn easily, but a brunette.  This year I have felt that my makeup doesen&#x27;t do enough, but when I don&#x27;t wear makeup I look lousy.  I also see some wrinkles in my forhead and around my eyes and lips.  I have always been told I have beautiful skin, so I really want to fight this fight.  I would rather not wear any make up but needs-must.  I have only been using this a for four days in combination with&lt;br /&gt;derma e Hyaluronic Acid Rehydrating Serum and derma e Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Glycolic...and I SEE a difference!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product on my face and neck for a few days and noticed two things.  The skin on my neck got very itchy and felt rough to the touch.  My facial skin did not get itchy, but it became very, very rough feeling.  My skin is generally not sensitive/allergic.  This morning I read an article in Delicious Living which listed ingredients to avoid in personal care products.  One of these ingredients was retinyl palmitate ... the name of this product?  Viamin A Retinyl Palmitate.  I guess my body&#x27;s reaction to this product is not surprising.  I&#x27;m tossing this product out.  A clue should have been the price.  You get what you pay for - cheap, bad for you product.  I thought Derma E made safe products.  Guess not.</li>
    <li> Great product but the price is going up and up.</li>
    <li> I love this crème! It makes my skin feel so soft and my foundation goes on beautifully over it.</li>
    <li> To really smear your face with stuff at night, it needs to be pretty cheap, and this feels like L&#x27;Oreal anit-age cream, not some greasy vasoline.</li>
    <li> I see results in my skin after using it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive unlike other crèmes out there&lt;br /&gt;it has vitamins&lt;br /&gt;I see the fine lines disappearing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this crème!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why anybody would pay so much for a facial creme. Buy an inexpensive facial creme (if possible, one with as little chemical ingredients as possible - purity rules!), and than buy vitamin A and vitamin E capsules. Poke the capsules open with a needle and mix them with your creme...apply to face and enjoy :).You can mix your own facial cocktail this way AND you can determine how much of the vitamin you want to put in. That&#x27;s how I do it, and it lasts so much longer and is much cheaper. Works just the same as those expensive cremes - even better. Derma/e, Retinol cremes....they just have too many chemicals in it. Derma/e might be good, but instead of buying Derma/e, do as I have stated/explained above and see if this does not work for you. Derma/e is on the rather affordable side, but still, my suggestions would be much cheaper than Derma/e and the rest. If what I wrote above doesn&#x27;t work for you, you can always go back to Derma/e or any other Retinol/Vitamin A creme.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and I have yet to find a product that keeps my skin from feeling tight or flaky. This product has been a miracle worker. After one use my skin felt moisturizer and my dry patches started to fade away, now months later my skin looks significantly better, it&#x27;s dry and firmer. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge anti aging effect but it is very moisturizing. It is very thick so it may not be suitable for people with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Another great product by Derma E. This is a good nighttime cream that will moisturize your face.</li>
    <li> I am on my third jar of this and I will use it as long as they continue to produce it.  I have tried many, many other &amp;#34;Top Rated&amp;#34; name brand creams, and nothing has worked anywhere near as well or as quickly or consistently.  I cannot afford to have &amp;#34;work done&amp;#34;, and the ultimate compliment I have received since using this is the fact that a wealthy relative who has had &amp;#34;work done&amp;#34; refuses to believe I have not!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s a little win; but it makes me feel great!  I use other products by Derma E, and have not been disappointed, particularly the microdermabrasion scrub. My younger daughter  has now begun using the acne line, after little success with even her prescription products, which aren&#x27;t cheap!</li>
    <li> I love this for my face.  It sinks in and is not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> best moisture  cream for face and body i have used! and i have tried  a bunch and very reasonable in price all of my daughters are now useing it</li>
    <li> I am always looking for the most natural ingredients for products I use on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many chemicals out there and many are in the products you use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as a skin moisturizer.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face but it&lt;br /&gt;works great for the hands and legs.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cream for a great price.  Though I do use it occasionally on my face, I use it every day on my neck and chest.  I am mid fifty&#x27;s and was starting to get creases on my chest from age and being a &amp;#34;side sleeper&amp;#34;.  This cream has made the wrinkles disappear.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I bought it at a health food store. This Christmas I chose her for my Secret Santa gift. So I ordered one for her and one for me. Great price on Amazon, great product. Our ages: 56 and 61&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, she was pleased. Note: this company changes the color of their labels often, so you must read what you want to get.</li>
    <li> I used this item, wasn&#x27;t impress, I know no product is going to remove wrinkles, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am better off for the price, to buy the cheaper product that I have been purchasing from my local CVS. I do have to say in their behave, they ship fast.</li>
    <li> Did not compare to skin care I normally use LaTherape. It sounded the same in the description but did not have the same effect on my skin. Appears to be less intense thus less effective.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer cream very wonderful</li>
    <li> I have been using Derma-e Cream for a long time ever since I saw it on DR.OZ show  I am a believer in their product it really works</li>
    <li> The wife says she swears by it. Great product. Arrived on time as scheduled. and She atarted using it right away. She loves the results she gets from it.</li>
    <li> This face cream is not greasy, but moisturizes well and minimizes wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with some other products and I&#x27;ve been rubbing it  on my face, neck and arms and it really has smoothed out some lines.  I&#x27;m in my 40s so I wish I had started this in my 30s.  Just ordered another one!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite daytime moisturizer. It blends with my foundation and it has a really nice, subtle smell.</li>
    <li> I liked this. It goes on smoothly. Has somewhat of a rose smell though...which I don&#x27;t like. it is a big jar for the price...economical. I notice a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; difference after using it for 30 days at least. But I don&#x27;t notice much.</li>
    <li> I found this cream at my local Big Y chain. I fell in love with it. It makes my skin well hydrated! And protects against wrinkles! I definitely would recommend it. I have already gotten my third bottle of cream.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a really good face cream without as many toxic chemicals. And at a reasonable price. Still looking for something more pure.</li>
    <li> Have severe allergic reaction to so many thinga and this brand and item does not cause me any problems.  No harmful ingredience</li>
    <li> Very nice, inexpensive night cream.</li>
    <li> Good cream! And seller.</li>
    <li> I have used this this cream for years and wouldn&#x27;t dream of changing to another product.  This product is reasonable in price, effective in hydration, maintains elasticity and slows the development of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Use this daily, loving the results. Thank you so much.  Would buy again, and again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00021KD2C Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Creme - 4 oz. - Cream]].  *****I was trying to save some money by ordering my skin care cream from amazon.  The product is made by derma e and when I started using it. I noticed that it smelled different my skin tingled, almost burning.  Unfortunately I bought two and I waited one day too long to return it.  That, of course, is my fault.  I assume that the supplier is selling old stock or it has been sitting in a hot warehouse somewhere for too long.  The product itself is excellent but watch out ordering through companies like amazon.  (You would be safe to buy from derma e)  I think I&#x27;ll continue to buy skin care products at the store.</li>
    <li> I have mature skin that needs moisturizing, especially in winter months, but is prone to breakout. Have been using this for a couple weeks and no breakouts.  My skin is more subtle and soft. It is nice and creamy and I now use it on other parts of my body.  Was hoping for more of an improvement in skin tone (redness,etc) due to the Retynol.  But if you want a quality face cream on a budget I&#x27;d give this a try. You won&#x27;t waste your money trying it like other products since, as I mentioned about, you can use it as a body moisturizer.  It is a generous jar of cream.</li>
    <li> These products are the BEST. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think I don&#x27;t care for the smell on this one. These are my first choice when trying out skin cremes. I&#x27;ve been in the skin care industry since I was 14, and these are the most natural, effective and inexpensive I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying all the different ones that would apply to your skin to find your favorites!</li>
    <li> It took me a week or so to get used to the mild scent, because I usually prefer an unscented face cream. But now that I&#x27;ve adjusted, I love this product. It is extremely hydrating. It can be applied day or night. It seems to work well... My skin feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think its ingredients are pretty good and that it is a good value. That&#x27;s a nice combination. I will continue using their product!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion but doesn&#x27;t do much for fine lines or wrinkles</li>
    <li> Now I order it here, it&#x27;s more cost effective.  I love this Creme!  I&#x27;m 59 years old and between this, my Argan Oil and Coco Butter my skin still shines.  People say I don&#x27;t look anywhere near my age and this as part of my skin routine has helped.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to get long-winded about a skin creme, all that needs to be said is it works fabulously for me, I have normal to dry skin, I&#x27;m not really sensitive to things, and I do try to use as natural a product as I can find, and eat fresh, organic foods.  Skin also needs to be hydrated, so I drink a gallon of water a day if not more for my OVER ALL health.  Water helps many things, but it really does keep our faces and bodies looking and feeling younger. IMHO ;-)</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for,I tried this to remove minor age spots for 3 weeks,no results whatsoever,tried another brand with rave results!</li>
    <li> Love this line. i use the cleansers, scrubs, eye cream and sunscreen too. PURE. free of scent, feels great on the skin. I&#x27;m 60 and have been using it for about 3 years, skin is moist and even toned.</li>
    <li> I do see a difference in one of my dark spots on my face.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it, a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; face cream.  But I still use it and will probably by another.</li>
    <li> The consistency and smell is good.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used this before, so it is too soon to know how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This cream was okay.  I did not too much care for the feel of it.  I did not see any noticeable results as far as wrinkles go.</li>
    <li> I have used many different vitamin A creams, I really like  how this smells, and how it makes my skin feel nourished.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to, nightly cream. It&#x27;s light, yet incredibly emollient and though I have sensitive and somewhat acne prone skin, at times, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause break outs. I wake, every morning, to soft, smooth, silky, well hydrated skin. LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
    <li> Derma E has the best products.  I have been using this crème for years and stick with it because I can see how good my senior skin looks.  I have smooth and unwrinkled skin.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer if you&#x27;re looking for facial moisturizer.  We buy this regularly.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive oily/dry combo skin and this product has worked great for me over the years. They keep changing the packaging but the product seems to stay the same.</li>
    <li> havent try it but it has different packaging from the picture.. hope its authentic ingredient and not fake product. It is misleading the customers based on the picture here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m inching my way towards 30 and decided to get on the wrinkle care; better to prevent than treat, right? I was intending for this to be a day cream but it is WAY too thick. It absorbs beautiful at first but within a few hours of apply this my highly acne prone skin turns into an oil slick! (It does with 90% of products) You only need to apply a tiny pea sized amount to the ENTIRE face. I still love this product despite all that! I have since started using it at night and it works WONDERS. My pillow cases absorb all the excess oil that my face might put off and this cream leaves my face feeling hydrated and silky in the morning with NO break outs! I use persecution strength acne medication (Epiduo) that some days leaves my skin dry, scaly, and flaky beyond belief. This is the ONLY thing that will get rid of the dryness in a single night and at the same time not encourage acne to pop up. (I used this product prior to being on Epidou as well) During the day I have been known to apply this VERY LIGHTLY to any troublesome flaky spots but it always requires that I dab off extra oil at a certain point. (So make up will come off if you apply over this).</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It makes my dry peely skin feel great and helps keep the flakes to a minimum.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  Works great.  Thick so you would have to use it sparingly if you have oily skin.  Mine is dry so I don&#x27;t have a problem.  Great value.</li>
    <li> A lot of product for the price. This will last a long time. Very smooth, non greasy formula. Moisturizes wonderfully.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest face moisture.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It has a nice light smell and is not greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful. It blends well with other make-up. You only need to use a little bit so the value is there as well.</li>
    <li> I received this with the seal bursted and the cream leaked. Didn&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
    <li> This is a great face cream if you like a balance between greasy and not. It&#x27;s well made; no petroleum. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many face creams, but always come back to this one.  I have very sensitive skin, and this cream is very gentle and hydrating.</li>
    <li> Use it daily after the serum to moisturize.  Skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my skin feels.  Its not greasy like other products.  My skin feels hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if others has the same habit as me but with how this products makes my skin feels and easily absorb to my skin...It has me using it daily.... it became a healthy habit to just grab and apply everyday.  I cant say it help with any wrinkles I have (that if I even have it..hahahha)  But definitely great for just keeping a healthy hydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
    <li> I do like this cream.  I basically use it at night with my vitamin E oil and and it seems to be helping so much more than several other creams that I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  It is slightly greasy so I keep it for the days I&#x27;m at home and for nights.  I wished there was a formula for it with a more matte look.</li>
    <li> I received the Derma e Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Glycolic Facial Scrub with Vitamins C and E as a gift (see review), and decided to the order the Derma e Anti-Wrinkle A Retinyl Palmitate cr&amp;egrave;me to use with the facial scrub through the Add-On Item Program. A recent advertisement I read that the cr&amp;egrave;me contains Vitamin A which encourages cell renewal, Vitamins D and E, plus Allantoin which is included for an extra-rich moisturizing treatment. The Seller states it helps diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, leaving skin soft, smooth, and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on advertisements it enhances surface cellular renewal to diminish the appearance of age lines, wrinkles with a rich refining cr&amp;egrave;me. When I first opened the jar, I was amazed at how light the cr&amp;egrave;me appeared, once it was applied on my face it absorbed easily without the greasy feeling and appearance. It is labeled that it contains Vitamin A (Retinyl Palmitate) at a potency of 10,000 I.U. per 100 grams, commonly referred to as the &amp;#34;skin vitamin&amp;#34; and best known for its surface cell renewal properties. Its antioxidant Vitamin E, skin-calming Allantoin and Panthenol, as well as nourishing oils gives your skin the beneficial nutrients deep within the skin’s surface to address the look of skin aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the cream for a few days, I was disappointed; I did not see any changes to the appearance of my skin. I kept using the product, and after the first week, people started asking me what was I using different on my face. I mentioned I was trying out the Derma e Anti-Wrinkle Facial Scrub and Cr&amp;egrave;me. I started to become amazed at how I could see the anti-aging effect of this product on my face, where I could see some of my age lines diminished, while other lines have become smaller, quite unnoticeable. It has an amazing affect which allows your face to become firmer, which is definitely a great plus, and I do look years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use other facial products, I would be able to state in a month, if this product is responsible for the great differences I have seen in my skin and face. I am not encouraging that both products have to be used together to see the results I have experienced. I personally like to use products in sets, even though I have other facial products that I use on a weekly basis. I believe using the set does enhance your facial regime, and gives you the opportunity to identify if the product is working to enhance your beauty needs. One morning I used another favorite brand facial scrub, applied it evenly to my face, left it on 15 minutes, and then rinsed my face. Thereafter I applied the Derma e Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Glycolic Scrub for 15 minutes, then rinsed off my face and was surprised to see how my face felt much cleaner, the appearance of age improved after using this product. I use the Derma e Anti-Wrinkle cr&amp;egrave;me in the morning and night. The Derma e and nourishing oils in this creme delivers beneficial nutrients deep within the skin&#x27;s surface to address the look of skin aging. This product is 100% vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, lanolin-free, gluten free, GMO-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller has described this product accurately. I would definitely recommend to others, including Amazon Customers. I love the light whipped cr&amp;egrave;me feeling it has as it is applied to your face, it does not have a scent, and as someone with sensitive skin, I did not have a reaction to the cr&amp;egrave;me. Packaging was secure, and neatly packed, as delivery was timely. According to advertisements, it was previously known as Refining Vitamin A Cr&amp;egrave;me and Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Wrinkle Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me.her facial products, I would be able to state in a month, if this product is responsible for the great differences I have seen in my skin and face.

    <li> I love Dermae products, but this cream has a strong perfume scent.  If you have a sensitive nose, I&#x27;d steer clear of this cream and try Derame Vitamin E 12,000 IU which has next to no scent.  The scent of this cream is not a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> great product. It&#x27;s not great as just a moisturizer if you have dry skin, but it is great at smoothing out wrinkles. I think it&#x27;s made me look a lot younger than before I started using it, going by the comments I get from people and from comparing old photos with what I look like when I use it regularly. I tend to use this and the derma E vitamin E cream together because vitamin E cream is more moisturizing, and I have dry skin. I have to say I&#x27;m glad that these products are relatively cheap and actually work because there is no way I&#x27;m gonna gamble 40 or more dollars on an anti-wrinkle cream that may or may not work.</li>
    <li> Now in my 40 and having a lot of stress recently,  I was noticing lines around my eyes, mouth, and neck. I tried a few products before and didn&#x27;t see much difference.  I was also looking for something cruelty free. This product works.  I&#x27;m using the cleanser, toner, and cream. I also use a vitamin C serum and Crereve eye cream. The combination is working great.  I have noticed a big difference since adding the Derma E products to my regime.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this is one of the few lotions that don&#x27;t leave my skin greesy and take away the &amp;#34;i just ate a powdered donut and didn&#x27;t wipe my face off&amp;#34; look that my dry skin leaves. Love this brand.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!  Makes your skin supple and returns the glow!</li>
    <li> This is a good day creme.  You have to put it on liberally otherwise it can be drying.  I have noticed a difference in fine lines not being as visible.</li>
    <li> i do my research before buying creams I apply to my skin and if I can I like to educate and inform other people too. So, here is the info I found. I won&#x27;t buy it now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol-Repeated exposure to the substance over prolonged periods has been linked to contact dermatitis (more info 1 and 2), worsening of eczema (more info), reproductive toxicity (more info) and neurotoxicity (more info 1 and 2). [...]</li>
    <li> UPDATE 4/26/14: My original review is below, but I am updating based on the new formula. I no longer like this product, it does not moisturize the way it used to and leaves my skin feeling dry/chapped. I believe they have now changed the formula twice (in just over a year). I don&#x27;t know why they keep changing it, but I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review from 3/14/13: I did not have high expectations when I purchased this. I just wanted a cream that moisturizes and wasn&#x27;t too expensive. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and started noticing my skin was beginning to get a little droopy, losing elasticity, about a year ago. In addition, I have a few fine lines that I was not happy with! I&#x27;d been using anti-wrinkle creams with and without retinyl for a while, but nothing made any improvement. I tried Loreal Revitalift, Neutragena Healthy skin, Eucerin Q10, Nivea Visage, etc, with no change. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2 months now and I definitely notice a subtle change in my skin. My cheeks are not nearly as saggy as they were and the bags under my eyes have slightly diminished as well. My fine lines have not changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, after I shower and before I go to bed. I don&#x27;t use it in the morning as I prefer to use a lotion with SPF during the day. Like I said, this cream won&#x27;t worked miracles (I doubt any lotion will). But for the price, and compared to all the other much more expensive products I have used, this one is the best. My skin looks youthful, even toned, and my breakouts are not affected by the cream (which was an issue with Nivea). I don&#x27;t give 5 stars often, but I could not find anything negative about this cream. If I had to choose something, I would say that the smell is a little off putting, almost floral, but not terrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the look out for products that don&#x27;t contain parabens and sulfates that won&#x27;t break the bank.  This fits the bill beautifully.  It is quite lightweight, which is perfect for my skin, but someone with very dry skin might find it isn&#x27;t creamy enough for them.  I have been using it for quite awhile now (on my third jar) and my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out or had any adverse reactions.  Will definitely keep using :-)</li>
    <li> This creme feels good and has a pleasant scent, but if you have naturally oil-prone skin and you put the creme on in the morning, use it VERY sparingly as it will increase sebum production within hours and leave an oily residue.  In that case, it&#x27;s best to use the creme sparingly and do so before bed.  Do not reapply in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay youthful!</li>
    <li> I use it with the microdermabrasion and my face feels and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I really loved this cream. It is light but very effective. I am ordering for a second time.I would reommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion..probably more then olay or neutrogena. I like how it smells and how fast it absorbs into your skin. This does not feel greasy at all and even worn under makeup it doesn&#x27;t look oily or shiny. Well worth every penny and this is definitely my new favorite face creme.</li>
    <li> This product is not a greasy and helps your skin feel great</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this years ago.  This product smooths skin and makes you look fresh and young.  It&#x27;s less expensive than other products and does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Vit A cream for a couple of years as not my face moisturizer but a hand cream and it is amazing!  My hands get very dry in the winter and I had had enough of the red, peely, itchy skin so I went on the hunt. I use Retin A on my face so I know this isn&#x27;t exactly the same form of Vitamin A, but I thought whatever its cheap and rated well. It was love at first smell!  It has a great light floral scent, a glossy whipped texture, and moisturizes my hands like no other. I use it before bed every night and I wake up to the smoothest most soft hands in the morning, and I swear it plumps them up so they are nice and firm. It doesnt absorb super fast, it maybe takes about 10 mins but that doesnt bother me since I use at bedtime.  I now consider it my anti-aging hand moisturizer. I recently starting using it as my under eye cream and it helps there too!  I&#x27;m super oily and acne prone so I haven&#x27;t tried it all over my face yet, but I bet it would be ok.  When I see it at a low price here on amazon I stock up because I can&#x27;t love without this. One of my very few Holy Grail products :)</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 20s, so I don&#x27;t have actual wrinkles yet - but I like this as a nice creamy moisturizer for the winter months.  It smells great, and wears well under my makeup, and doesn&#x27;t cause my acne-prone skin to breakout.  I think it&#x27;s especially good under my eyes at preventing puffiness/wrinkles from not getting enough sleep.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and have to use face lotion every day.  This is by far my favorite.  It is gentle and not perfumed which I love, but I think it does help prevent and minimize fine lines.  After using this lotion I started trying other Derma e prodcuts and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> good moisturizer - not oily - no blemishes - just a great product, highly recommend this item - cheers to smooth faces!</li>
    <li> I recommend this brand to anyone, especially this product. The skin care line is all natural and doesn&#x27;t overwork the skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of those regular buys for me.  If I&#x27;m getting low, I order quickly so I&#x27;m never without.  I like the ingredients of this brand better than many of the drugstore mainstream alternatives.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all unless I have an irritated nose from a cold.  I do avoid the under eye area and use another product for that.</li>
    <li> Great product! Been using for 4 weeks, skin noticably different!</li>
