      <li>There are far more reds in this batch that I would have liked, but the reds do differ in shades so you&#x27;re not receiving duplicates of one red.</li>
      <li>They are complimentary to my complexion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is really a 4.5 as one otr 3 of the colors are a little off. Great for a make-up artists kit ...but do love all the options. Great price. I like that the pencils are relatively long They each have a cover They are super soft Fairly well pigmented **Not extremely long lasting though</li>
    <li> Threw them in the garbage.  Really really wanted to like them but very unimpressed.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. The tips keep breaking off easily and they color doesn&#x27;t go on very well. I don&#x27;t use most of the shades, just 1 or two as most of them are dark colors.</li>
    <li> Love all the Browns and color 108 😍😍 nice muave color perfect for dark woman. They also glide on, there are a few Browns tho so that&#x27;s the only bad part.  Would def purchase again</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;The mid shade colors are all VERY similar, but you can shade them with the brown or black if that&#x27;s a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the structure of the pencil itself. The twist is very loose, and if you&#x27;re not careful the pencil pushes back in while you&#x27;re using the product.</li>
    <li> Love the color pay off from these pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3 colors to recreate kylie jenner&#x27;s lip look, and these pencils have helped me to achieve that  goal. My lips look natural and subtle, yet which ever color I choose, I always get amazing color pay off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find you&#x27;re having a hard time applying the product, you&#x27;ll need a lip moisturizer. I sometimes use just regular chapstick, but lip balms or primers would work even better.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty.  Unfortunately, they are not creamy and therefore hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Great colors.</li>
    <li> Colors are really nice, and they go on very well.  Only complaint is that the colors are different from what it says on the bottom of each tube however they are still good quality.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> NICE GREAT COLORS AND QUICK DELIVERY</li>
    <li> I like the color choices, but they are a bit dry during application.</li>
    <li> Great colors! I bought these because they were such a great price and a nice variety of colors. Me and my girls have fun playing around, trying out new looks/combinations. This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> These are perfect. I got them for a matte lipstick set, and the colors match up almost perfectly. These are some of the best lip liners I have used. I recommend them!</li>
    <li> Amazing colors, coverage, consistency and texture, and durability. Love these little guys! They transfer plenty of pigment with a soft touch, go on and stay matte, feel great on the lips and can even be used in place of lipstick altogether. The colors blend together smoothly, so if you like to contour your lips a bit, these work great!</li>
    <li> Very smooth colors are perfect i love all the dark colors as well, very creamy, there are a few colors that are very similar though</li>
    <li> The colors on the lip pencil doesn&#x27;t match what&#x27;s inside. Too much pressure and they break even</li>
    <li> great quality and a good sleection of colors. I gave some to friends and my mom as I don&#x27;t need so many</li>
    <li> Love them they go on smooth and the colors are amazing</li>
    <li> shipping was fast love how it came in so many colors</li>
    <li> I would buy this whole set again just for the Puce colored pencil! I&#x27;ve never found a liner that matches my own lip color so well. What a great find!</li>
    <li> I really like these all the colors are great. I do wear lime crime velvitines liquid to matte lipstick so the black and brown are perfect for those shades.  They go on well and stay well I run them on my hand before applying for first time to get it started.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend,  these are great! thinking of getting some more. I use them deft as lip liners. They do give you a black one which i have tried to use as a eye liner and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> When I first bought these lip liner, I immediately feel in love. I am particular about two colors I just ran out of. # 7 and #9. Is there a way I can purchase just these two colors. Like 3 of each?!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great price for the amount of lip lines. They are way better quality than the cheap ones you can get at Walgreens (Jordan brand)</li>
    <li> not a big lip liner person but these get the job done. no bleeding, lots of colors and I use the black one on my eyes for winged liner. great for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t care much about lip makeup, usually just gloss and heavy eye makeup but these make my collection complete *EDIT* i swatched a few of these on my hand last night and its been well over 16 hours and the lines are still on my hand! crazy long wearing lip liner</li>
    <li> they go on smoothly and the pigment is great!</li>
    <li> Great colors, great deal.</li>
    <li> Love the color selection and formula.  Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> While there are a variety of colors, the darker ones all appear to be close to the same shade.  They do work well.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.</li>
    <li> Lovely colors. Application was smooth and stayed on all night.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> These have a nice formula, very creamy and easy to apply, with a matte finish. Some of the colors look good on their own as lipstick, although that can be a bit drying. I love that they are retractable so you don&#x27;t have to sharpen them. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don&#x27;t like a couple of the colors, and I wish the set included at least one purple instead of 4 different shades of brown.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun colors for the lips. Some (about 3 or so) are black and different shades of brown. I wouldn&#x27;t use those on my lips, but they are very good as eyeliners. For the price one gets a lot of different lip (and eye) pencils.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say it gets the job done and the colors does work. The thing is, they are too sharp and hurts when You put it on And then breaks easily (one My pink broke).</li>
    <li> Love J.Cat products and loved these liners as well.  Great price for what you get and if you like these?  Try J.Cat&#x27;s lip paint - a dupe for OCC&#x27;s Lip Tar which costs five times as much.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE!!!! GREAT COLORS AND EASY ON THE WALLET!</li>
    <li> these lip liners are great!! The start off very pointy like most roller lip liner I just slight brush it across my hand and until the point is gone and slid it across my lips so it doesn&#x27;t hurt they have all colors including black. They are very smooth can&#x27;t wait to use them all!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Love these. They will last until you take it off. Color goes on beautifully and smoothly.</li>
    <li> Not great or true to color... Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> These are awesome! My girlfriends loves them</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying J.Cat. I can say that my shipment came on time, tightly wrapped, and I have all colors. The colors are amazing. Haven&#x27;t tried them all but will pretty soon. Long last and glides on smoothly. Will purchase again and expand to other J. CAT products.</li>
    <li> Excellent pencils, loved the colors and they stayed on nicely too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Firm but creamy, a good buy especially if you don&#x27;t like having to sharpen traditional pencils.  For fair complexioned people it is more of a 9 lip pencil and 3 eyeliners kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for someone to ask me to review this product.  I am so pleased with this product!  I don&#x27;t even remember what I paid for them, but you get 12 of the pencil liners, so even though there are three that I never use, (black &amp; brown) there are still nine shades left to choose from, at far less expense than buying them at the store.  I used to buy them one at a time at the drugstore, at the cost of $5.95 and up each!  I will definitely re-order these, but I won&#x27;t run out for years!</li>
    <li> Just about every color lip liner you&#x27;ll need for a cheap price.. Plus some eyeliners. They&#x27;re really nice and the color lasts.</li>
    <li> Surprising quality!! Lasted all day!</li>
    <li> Love theses products!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love all of these liners! Some of the darker colors go on differently than you&#x27;d expect based off the bottom color, they are typically brighter. The browns and blacks can be used for eyeliners and brow liners, but can also be used to create more edgy looks for lips such as a vampiric red with a blended black outline.</li>
    <li> Easily comparable to higher end lip liners. I love the versatility within this pack of lipliners; there&#x27;s a color to fit virtually all your lip liner needs. These are great quality lip liners with excellent staying power. These can easily hold their own out there in the cosmetic world amongst all the higher end brands. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy these again and would definitely recommend to anyone who asks. I love the fact that these do not need to be sharpened, these glide on very nice and smoothly and are very true to color. Keeps my lipstick beautifully in place all day with minimal touch up needs.</li>
    <li> What colors are they in?!i just purchased I&#x27;m excited</li>
    <li> Love the darker colors!</li>
    <li> I had heard about J Cat Costmetics through Ipsy, so I already knew that I&#x27;d be getting a quality product. I was so impressed with these lip liners and the colors were perfect for what I already own; will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I have a blast with mixing colors. They are complimentary to my complexion. I should have ordered more. I have used them so much.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors. I have lots to play with making my lips beautiful.</li>
    <li> Some where very gooooooddd!!! Some were dried and horrible!!! Wish they were all in good shape kinda disappointed when they didn&#x27;t all work...</li>
    <li> The colors are off. The product is pretty good. Just wish the colors matched the top. I still have to go out and buy other shades when I assumed this product would be the array of colors I needed to have a complete set.</li>
    <li> Did not like these at all. Do not glide on well and barley shows up. So dissapointed</li>
    <li> These can be worn alone or paired with lipstick or lipgloss layered on top or just a balm also looks good. When I first used these lip liners, I found its not too dry if worn alone and glided quite smoothly. I was able to have a whole evening and dinner and still the color was intact!&lt;br /&gt;-  It is creamy and spreads on effortlessly. It is also smudge resistant and will stay on for hours.&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting. You can eat, drink, lick your lips all day long and it will hardly budge!&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to wash off, in my opinion this is a pro. It just goes to show how well it stays on through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;- Very pigmented, the colors show up well.&lt;br /&gt;- You have all colors from nude, natural to rich berry and brown, there would possibly be no need for any other color&lt;br /&gt;- The best part is these are roll up and no need of sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;- Good price for the the set</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed because what I thought were a bunch of browns were actually reds/burgundies which was a welcoming surprise. I love them!</li>
    <li> Good colors and a good value!</li>
    <li> These are sub par lip liners. The price is right, but they are difficult to apply and not very creamy. They also are a bit  drying. Not a bad range of colors, although many of them are quite dark. You can also use them as difficult to apply eye liners. . .If you are looking for an inexpensive lip liner I would buy the NYX lip liners, retractable or pencil. They are still budget friendly and apply much better.</li>
    <li> The color doesnt pop for me and just didn&#x27;t like how much re going over i had to do just to get it on.</li>
    <li> Great colors and goes on smooth either as a lip liner or eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I like most if the colors but some are a bit dry.</li>
    <li> The colors advertised online for the pencils do not match the actual colors. For example, a dark brown turns out to actually be a red on your lips. There are far more reds in this batch that I would have liked, but the reds do differ in shades so you&#x27;re not receiving duplicates of one red. The colors glide on pretty easily and are very rich in color. It&#x27;s a great set to add on to an existing makeup collection, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this expecting to receive the exact colors you see online.</li>
    <li> Nice lip liners&lt;br /&gt;Small though&lt;br /&gt;Work for eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;Matte finish</li>
    <li> Perfect! All I needed to go with my lip gloss. I&#x27;ve already worn 4 different shades &amp; they all look good so far!</li>
    <li> Nice color variations.Good enough for lining lips before lipstick,matches many different colors.</li>
    <li> The only reason this is not a 5 star is because whenever you roll up the pencils i feel like it only has a little bit, but considering you get 12 pencils for about $20 its not that bad of a deal.</li>
