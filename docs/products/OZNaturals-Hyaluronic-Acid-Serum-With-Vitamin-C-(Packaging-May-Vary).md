<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the Oz products am currently using the Retinol Super youth and had tried the C Serum thought I would get cheap and adventrouse and made my own C Serum and bought the hyaluronic acid to add to it big mistake I like there C serum way better I will continue to use the hyaluronic acid I add it to my moistureizer  but I am going back to the Oz C serum for sure</li>
    <li> it works well, thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for two weeks and I am pleased with the results. The difference between 4 stars and 5 stars for me is the price. It is a GREAT value. I&#x27;ve tried expensive prestige brands as well as some drugstore brands. This serum is reasonably priced and as good as any other hyaluronic/vitamin C that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read it seems the product is most effective/agreeable for young(ish) women (30s) who are familiar with mass market anti-aging skincare products. I am 37 years old and have always been good to my skin. I have sensitive skin (eczema) that cannot tolerate heavy duty AHAs and BHAs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the claims of the product to be true. A little goes a long way,  but I know that I use more than is necessary. My skin was already oily to begin with.  Using this product seemed to make me oilier, but thatbis fine with me. As I age, my skin will be glad for all the excess oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the aloe vera calms my sensitive skin and the product does seem to attract moisture. The combination of hyaluronic acid and vitamin C in the product are kind of like buy one, get one free. I use a retinol cream on top of it and it all works well for me. You can also layer another serum over it before you moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with the outcome considering that I stumbled upon the product and bought it on a whim (because it was affordable). I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Combine this with the retinol cream and works better.</li>
    <li> I read about the results of using this product. I&#x27;m excited to try it. The price is not too bad. I hope it leave up to it promise. Can tell you too much about it. I just using 2days. Maybe get  back to you in 14days later.</li>
    <li> The best results in just a few days,I will definitely order this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have only used half the bottle so may be too soon to see results goes on easy, dries quick, no reaction. But I can&#x27;t say I see a huge improvement as of yet been about a month.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product and one of the best serums I&#x27;ve used. This product is a good or better than the pricier department store options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my skin just isn&#x27;t responding or not but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference and I followed the instructions. I&#x27;m not saying its a bad product, just not good for me.</li>
    <li> I am sold on the quality and effectiveness of the Oz products. My smile lines have lessened, enlarged pores have constricted and my skin feels &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; overall. Very nice product....I was lucky to be able to purchase it at a reduced price.</li>
    <li> Love it Oz naturals are great</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product. I have used a  lot of different products on my face from retail stores to straight from the dermatologist. I have to say that I Love hyaluronic acid for my skin. My skin looks so much better and when I stop using it I can see a difference. I love Oz naturals it does what it supposed to do. Works for me</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t see much difference but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it!</li>
    <li> This was a repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Use this to start &amp; some almond oil and my face feels great</li>
    <li> A lil goes a long way. I love how my face feels. But it pretty much looks the same. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast  great product. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent  product for my sensitive skin. I have had difficulties finding good products that are free from allergens I  have  and appreciate the simplicity and effectiveness of this natural product.</li>
    <li> I m just not happy when I got my bottle with out seal. Have plastic at the top of the lid only. You can open without break the seal because the seal don&#x27;t go all the way to the bottle only the lid</li>
    <li> This “OZ Naturals” serum is advertised as a potent Anti Aging Serum, and I found that this is true.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to believe the manufacturer&#x27;s statement that it is a “Facelift in a Bottle,” but after trying it for a month, I have to agree that the results really are that spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see them right away. From the first application, my skin gained a special radiance one associates with vitality and health, while becoming smoother, as small wrinkles simply disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like a miracle, especially considering that it accomplishes this using natural, vegan ingredients. Plus, it has not been tested on animals, which is essential for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear, cool gel, goes on cleanly and feels very good on the skin. It causes no sense of irritation, no trace of an allergic reaction, nor any other unpleasant sign. Just a tiny amount is sufficient to generously coat the face. The small bottle is well made, durable, in a no-muss no-fuss style, and the product is a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this find, I have switched away from the other anti-aging skin product I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad to have discovered this company, and its remarkable line of products, combining high quality, and high ethics, in the sense that these excellent beauty items have not involved the suffering of animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go OZ Naturals! I highly recommend this product, and feel that the company&#x27;s other products are likely exceptional too.</li>
    <li> Second time I have purchased this product. Love it. It is very light.</li>
    <li> Serums were not as good as other ones I used</li>
    <li> Feels so good going on.  Like it.</li>
    <li> will buy again love this stuff.....it is amazing dramatic results....I put on my clean fresh face and tried the serum and I felt it working right away, lifting and firming and shrinks pores...my make up went on beautifully and feels good to wear no make up and feel confident.&lt;br /&gt;gooooood stuff! oh i am 45 and don&#x27;t look it!!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product and had to try it as I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie. It was like using water on my face and I saw no results.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. This plump the skin and tightens.  I like the results I see.</li>
    <li> Really amaze , as soon as I apply it  I feel my face tighter , can leave without it</li>
    <li> It is is the best skin serum EVER</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product again.....it looks and feels mostly like aloe vera gel.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in early 50&#x27;s &amp; take good care of my skin. I like this product. It compares to very expensive brand I have used with excellent results. Skin feels hydrated &amp; tiny lines around eyes are barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> Serums are so important but finding the right serum is even more important and can really change the way your skin looks and feels. I used this product for a few days and decided it lives up to the desciption so I couldn&#x27;t wait the 30 days to see the optimum results. I had fine lines on my forehead and I can&#x27;t say that it already made them disappear but it did help them to be less noticable and now when I put my makeup on it looks much smoother. I got this product to review and I think this product is a must for everyone! The price is unbeatable I used other very pricey serums but after a year of using them a seeing no true benefits outside of the smelling good, I&#x27;m never looking back. The ingredients in this are amazing and paraben free which is essential to having beautiful skin and keeping the aging away!</li>
    <li> its very jelly like and probably one of my favorite out of the 3 OZ natural serums i have! would def buy it again</li>
    <li> I love it, and I need more. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is very similar to the anti aging serum from Oz that I&#x27;ve been trialling. I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for two weeks now in the same way as i did the anti aging serum. Its been very good, and my skin feels soft and pleasant. I have very dry, sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. It comes in an eye dropper dispenser so no germ laden fingers contaminating a pot, and no waste spilling a thickish liquid from a bottle...its very light, almost like single cream consistnecy, and it quickly absorbed into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have any fragrance, which I like, so there&#x27;s no worries about clashing perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels very soft, and there&#x27;s no signs of redness which often happens to me. I like the way it quickly sunk in to my skin, I hate feeling like I have a layer of something in my face - it feels like I can&#x27;t breathe so this was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep my diet and skin treatments fairly natural if possible, and this company specialises in that. This particular product is 92% natural and 72% organic, slightly less on the natural side than the anti aging serum but still excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied with product for review, and have been using it daily and would be happy to continue with it.</li>
    <li> Hyuloronic Acid serum helps prevent free radicals from harming your skin and helps to shed off those dead skin cells and reveal new fresh skin. Healthy skin is younder looking skin, and this serum does just that produces healthy looking skin. If you have fine lines and wrinkles then this serum will help hydrate those lines and wrinkles away. Get visibly healthier skin in a few uses.</li>
    <li> Not a facelift in a bottle! !&lt;br /&gt;Are you kidding me! !! To good to be true? !! Hey, you can foul some of the people some of the time .... You didn&#x27;t full me  ! What was the refound policy again  ??!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product</li>
    <li> LOVE this serum!  It is like a combination between a gel and a liquid, making it easy to apply and it feels great on the skin. I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum along with the Hyaluronic Acid serum and my skin feels the best it&#x27;s ever felt!!  It has helped my skin stay clear and after it dries it almost makes your skin feel a little tight, like you really can tell it&#x27;s helping your skin. It is amazing and it&#x27;s so affordable, I wish I had discovered sooner. It makes your skin feel wonderful.  I will definitely be buying this again.  Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________&lt;br /&gt;Made &amp; Sold by: OZ Naturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order date</li>
    <li> Save your money, doesn&#x27;t do anything except make you THINK you&#x27;re taking care of your skin. Too pricy for what you get.</li>
    <li> I use this serum after vitamin C serum, yes, I do two layers of serum under the moisturizer. Overall I liked the improvement on my face, the skin became softer after several months, although not sure which serum works better. This serum is very thick, maybe 5% hyaluronic acid is considered as high concentration. I would prefer a thinner serum. And one more layer of moisturizer is a must after this, otherwise I can feel the dryness several minutes later.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, I&#x27;ve noticed that I have been having less hormonal acne, and when I do it heals faster. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the serum, but well, I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt. It doesn&#x27;t dry out or break out my face so that&#x27;s always good.</li>
    <li> I Love love love this serum. I have finished two bottles of the vitamin c serum by OZ Naturals and decided to give this amazing Hyaluronic Acid Serum a try and so far, I am loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;I applied about one or two drops on my clean dry face and massage it into my skin in circular motion and sometimes with a little extra one the bridge of my nose (i have some lines due to facial expressions).&lt;br /&gt;This serum absorbs so fast and leaves my skin smooth and moistened up. You could really feel the effect instantly. After just a few use, I could see the lines fading a little bit and my skin is overall less dry.&lt;br /&gt;I also like it that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or &amp;#34;layered up&amp;#34; as some serums do, it doesn&#x27;t give a weird reaction with my moisturizer, sunblock or make up which I usually apply on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Amazing results ! It has left my face with a pretty smooth glow. I am fair skinned and have age spots and they are now almost invisable I have used this for maybe two weeks and can tell a difference . This product is great!</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals has the best Products , I love using them, I had gotten this hyaluronic serum, and the vitamin C serum, and I also got Super Youth Eye Gel, and I can really see a difference, And the Best part is I Got them absolutely free!!! You have to try them to believe them!!!</li>
    <li> Cannot argue with results. This helps to give a nice smooth sheen to your skin. I will order more soon.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this.  It dries fully which is nice and I do think it at least temporarily improves the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Very soothing and hydrating for my very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the results of the product will order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 38 year old woman with sensitive and dry skin. I&#x27;m starting to get some wrinkles on the forehead, around the mouth and eyes, with a lot of redness. This product is odorless and the color is totally clear to me two very important features. I used it for the first time in the morning and inmmediatelly noticed how quickly it was absorbed into my skin, which was very good because I wore makeup almost inmmediately after application. The second time I used it was the same day at night. When  I truly saw a difference was overnight, by morning my skin was softer than ever!!!!! My forehead lines were smoother and with a lot less redness. This was amazing because I get motivated when I see fast results and this product certainly did that. If you have dry, sensitive skin I really recommend you buy this product. It&#x27;s like going to the spa and getting a facial everyday, just affordable. The shipping was very fast also.</li>
    <li> I am a RAVING fan!  I have purchased this several times - super effective and a great product.  It really hydrates my skin and reduces the wrinkles around my eyes - makes my skin glow!  LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I ordered it on a whim since I have purchased every other skin care product on the planet, and the ratings were so high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the desert, have 65 year old skin, have been using retin A and Kinerase for moisturizer, but this immediately had an affect on my wrinkles, way beyond what even the Kinerase (which I love) can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the rest of the line is as good, but if not, this will do. I used it ONCE and could see the difference. Can see why the ratings are so high. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> The serum is fast absorbing and nob-sticky. It feels really moisturizing on my skin and has a slight herbal scent which is light and barely noticeable. You only need one full dropper application for your entire face. I was able to apply my moisturizer on top after the serum without any interference. A serum is a good idea before a moisturizer because it acts as a carrier to deliver the ingredients of your moisturizer into your skin more efficiently. I love that it contains beneficial skin ingredients, Vitamin C and is from a cruelty free, vegan natural product brand.</li>
    <li> don t waste your money</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this...</li>
    <li> ♡ this product!  Must have for all women!</li>
    <li> Did nothing from me and is not even nor can be even considered ACID SERUM....there is no acid in this....its like goopy water!!!</li>
    <li> the bottle did not seem very full and on the box some of the information about the product&#x27;s contents seemed to have been been scratched out.  there seem to be alot of other ingredients and yet only 5% hyaluronic acid despite it being called Hyaluronic serum.  however the texture seems pleasant enough to dab on wrinkles under a moisturiser.  still looking out for any effect.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum after seeing what a great price it is and the serum is totally natural and organic! Great selling point!  I have dehydrated combination skin and only after 4 days using the serum I was able to see and feel a difference.  My skin feels so soft and smooth.  I use my serum every morning and every other night with a night cream.  I love the results I see and feel.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone looking for a great vibrant change to your skin!</li>
    <li> Product is lightweight and dries quickly. No sticky residue.  Time will tell if it works as well as others have found.  Would purchase from this retailer again. Very fast service!</li>
    <li> My skin looked brighter and clearer after 4 days of using this.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> loved it but recently found a better product without the vit c.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m not sure I look any younger but my skin looks healthier :)&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to buy enough to fill up the trunk of my car. I used to use the 45 dollar AHA complex from Merle Norman and this is twice as much product for 1/3 of the price and does an even better job. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Very effective. produced a noticeable difference in about a week. Very happy with this stuff and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> perhaps haven&#x27;t used it long enough for good results.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician and I recently purchased this serum.I have been using it for a few weeks now on myself for my lines on my forehead,my frown lines between my eyes and around my lips.So far,i love it! It has smoothed them out and they made them less dramatic.I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it, I could see a difference in my skin within one week. I use it with OZ Naturals vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I have an oily/combination skin and use Paula&#x27;s choice RESIST line of products. My skin is in top condition, and free of any and all blemishes. I saw the amazing reviews for this product by many and decided to add it to my skin care routine. I started using both Vitamin C serum http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DPE9EQO/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 and Hyaluronic acid http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7DYBX0/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 and my skin started breaking out severely. I used both serums together, one after another as suggested by several reviews here, one in the morning and one in the night etc., but skin would break out severely within a night. If I stopped the serum, my skin would return to normalcy. I really wanted to like the serums but one of them is causing severe breakouts to my skin. I am not sure which serum is causing the problem, but those with acne-prone skin, better be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers said this product does not clog pores and is safe on oily skin but in any case, I simply cannot use these serums.</li>
    <li> This is crazy, but I believe this has changed my skin drastically.  I use it morning and night and it gives my skin a tightness and a radiance that I never had before and has eliminated my small acne breakouts. I&#x27;m almost 40 and this is important because I&#x27;ve tried many expensive products from my dermatologist and from the spas.  I follow it with Argan Oil and my skin has never looked better.  I am a repeat purchaser and will continue to purchase it as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of respect fur dr Oz and his products. I am a great believer of using natural products as much as possible, but that&#x27;s not always convenient. That said, this product is a combination of both natural and convenience. It feels light on skin, and works on restoring tired skin right away. I highly recommend this priduct and am looking forward to trying other Dr. Oz products.</li>
    <li> This serum really appears to help plump up my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and I have found I can use the OZ Naturals without any problems at all. Love this serum, fantastic value and results!</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  I have ordered another bottle</li>
    <li> this seems to be working.  People don&#x27;t believe that I am as up in age as I am.  Will more than likely re-order when this runs out.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good for price, will buy more as needed.  It just takes a drop or two absorbs well &amp; lasts overnight.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Per the reccomendations I started out using this at night every other day for 7 days, then applied it at night daily for 7 days and now on my 3rd week of using it I am applying once at night and once in the morning. I do feel this does a great job at hydrating my skin but I am still not seeing a difference in the lines and wrinkles. My skin wasn&#x27;t dry or sticky afterwards. And I used this with and without make-up and it works great both ways. Be careful when applying the 1st time I accidentally applied too much and had to wipe some off, a little bit does go a long way. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results as I keep using this. You have to keep in mine everyones skin is different and results are different for everyone. I give this 4 out of 5 stars because it has the potential to work like it says over time, 2 weeks or even 30 days can be hard to get the  full results of a product.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products for review purposes. However ALL opinions are honest and my own. I do not recommend products I would not use myself.</li>
    <li> this  was not for me  but if your skin is not really dry like mine it probably  would be good  --sorry  i try a lot of things  most of my life my skin was great  i am lot older and need moisture  too ---  If you don&#x27;t try you  u want know is my  thing  ----</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and bright.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel. Nice and tight!</li>
    <li> Received this today and used tonight over the Retinol moisturizer (see review) that I bought with this. The OZ  BEST Retinol Moisturizer is fantastic, on it&#x27;s own, But this over the top, on my under eyes and lids, laugh lines, well, it was the cherry on top of the cake. Amazing products!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this and used the whole bottle.  It&#x27;s not a miracle elixir but my skin looked and felt nice and plump. Seems like it helped moisturizer absorb.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after reading the reviews and absolutely zero effects on me....i threw away $ 20.00</li>
    <li> Have been using for a while, really can&#x27;t tell the difference. Hopefully I will</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I love how great my skin feels. I have combination skin and it can be hard finding products that actually work and do what I need it to do. I can honestly say this one works and I can tell a difference after just one week.</li>
    <li> Like it very much. Make a great difference on my skin and yes it diminishes wrinkles appearances. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> the product meet my expectations. This hyaluronic acid serum from OZ Naturals is amazing. It provides my skin with a plump, tightening effect that looks and feels hydrated and more vibrant. Application is easy. Do see improvement of skin smoothness. Love this serum, put it on first thing before any other product.</li>
    <li> The best for all the various needs for the skin on our faces, along with vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Really really love this stuff! I make my own coconut oil and 100% pure Therapeutic oil sugar scrub for my face. And, after washing it off I apply this ( vitamin C serum) to my face. Twice a day. And my face feels so clean, fresh, and tight, clear. I have used several different kinds and brands. I think I like this one the best. It seems thicker, you use less, and I feel it working more then the others. Now my mother has started using it and much to my surprise really likes it to. It came on time, was packaged well, with a nice dropper. I will be ordering more it has become one of my favorite facial products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the look of my skin.</li>
    <li> no noticeable results, not smoothing, did not enhance any moisturizer I used.</li>
    <li> I was not that impressed, I really didn&#x27;t see any improvement or plumping of the skin to improve the look of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Effective, little goes long way. Allows the moisturizer to be better absorbed. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product was too drying for my skin.</li>
    <li> works well. not to dryimg</li>
    <li> It met my expectations. in fact, it made a huge change in a couple of weeks only. There is a feeling of smoothness around my eyes. I mix one drop of Oz oil with my regular moisturizer daily, and sometimes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the kind of product that can help your skin.  An aesthetician told me about vitamin C, and I bought this to go on my skin before moisturizing. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet, but my skin feels great after applying it.</li>
    <li> I can see the difference in my skin, good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I use it religiously and it works very well on my face.</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin c serum. This totally broke me out.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smoother and looks clearer.</li>
    <li> Works Great !! Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I love OZ product, i use my OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum everyday underneath my make up, that really product my skin and helps my skin to keep it hydrate all day long. I would recommend this product to all skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOT THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN AN EXCHANGE OF HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> wrinkles do no look as deep. improved texture</li>
    <li> This serum makes my skin dry even with added moisturizer.  I used this product for almost two months and I saw no improvement in my skin. I am now using Derma-e Pycnogenol  Moisturizing Gel with their Pycnogenol Moisturizing Cr&amp;egrave;me.  They both also contain C, E, &amp; A, and I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin in just a couple of days of use.</li>
    <li> Skin is hydrated but not greasy.  What a concept!  Will purchase this again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The packaging was well done, the bottle is nice as well. I noticed a difference in my face under my foundation right away. It was definitely more dew-ey and fresh looking. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first product purchased.  I love it.  It is very clean and makes my skin feel hydrated.  Can&#x27;t wait to experience more of the product line.</li>
    <li> im soooooo sad that i didnt get results like all these other people. part of the reason i bought this product and the vitamin c one is because of the great reviews and affordable price. now, maybe its because i have sensitive skin, maybe its because i used them both at the same time and it was too overpowering i dont know, but my skin got worse not better. i will say i noticed a difference in pore size, but other than that my skin developed patchy dry areas around my mouth, and bumps on my forehead. not like pimples but a rashy looking bump and my face turned red and so dry. i normally have oily skin so for me to be dried out is unheard of. and its not like this product is rocket science, i washed my face, applied before moisurizer. ive stopped using this altogether and im trying to get the moisture back into my skin with maracuja oil instead and moisturizer. i feel like they were a waste of 40 bucks.</li>
    <li> My skin was fairly nice before using this serum (in my 20s, no breakouts, a few lingering acne scars from year ago), but I have seen a overall positive change in the texture and tone of my skin.  I was mainly concerned about the fine lines that have started to creep in, and those seem to nearly disappear after a day or two of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this is a very good product for the price!  I&#x27;ve used serums that I&#x27;ve seen faster, more significant, changes with, but they were also at least $40 more than this product... so I can&#x27;t complain.  I can&#x27;t really imagine this would work for deeper / older wrinkles, but it is great for nipping them in the bud and just improving smoothness and slight scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love that it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try jus got for free on snagshout 😃 thank you</li>
    <li> I use this with a vitamin C lotion from another manufacturer. Within about two-three weeks I noticed that I no longer needed to use the Retin-A and I was getting many compliments about my skin! I use it in the morning and at night. While I don&#x27;t think it would be the best stand-alone product, I think in conjunction with the Vit-C lotion, it has made more of a difference than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m ordering my next bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I have bee using it every other night, checking if I have a reaction.  I love how tight and smooth my skin fills when it dries. I&#x27;ve been using it for some months now, I use it under my makeup and have been enjoying it,  I love the remarks that I don&#x27;t look as old as I am :)</li>
    <li> This product is very nice leave your skind soft and cleam best of all your skind look jonger</li>
    <li> I really like using oz naturals product. I will continue purchasing this product. Best i&#x27;ve found so far. Really see a difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember what I used before I found this serum but I know that I am never going back. Even my anesthetist  noticed the difference!</li>
    <li> Often when you purchase hyaluronic serums they tend to sit on the skin and start to peel off when you apply makeup. This product seems to absorb very well into the skin and cause few problems when applying a foundation.</li>
    <li> This product is made with 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  It also includes Vitamin C.  This product is made to help dull skin.  It is also meant to help balance the moisture levels in your skin.  It also can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  This is a great product if you want to help reverse the signs of aging.  The product is really easy to use too.  That is important to me.  I simply apply this to clean skin, and then allow it to try.  I then use my favorite moisturizer on top of this.  I can&#x27;t wait to see more results over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;free sample provided for a blog review</li>
    <li> I was asked to try this product and write a review.  I can see some difference since starting it about three weeks ago.  My skin is more firm and my red spots seem to have lightened up a bit.  I think after using it for a while longer I will see more changes.  I cannot give it a 5-star because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but was asked to put my review up now, so I can only work with a 4 star for this.</li>
    <li> OMG, love this stuff. Great product and will defnitely buy it again. Really felt it was moisturizing and would use it with my new roller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the entire OZ line of anti-aging products. The Hyaluronic acid serum was easy to use, smelled great, and made short work of the beginning wrinkles on my face. The crows feet were always lightish, but now they&#x27;re invisible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know that my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive. It&#x27;s rare for anything to have a negative result on my skin - take this into account when using any anti-aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive a lot of products (as I did this) for review, and there aren&#x27;t many I can recommend without hesitation. This is one of them. Absolutely love it! I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It truly gives my skin a wonderful glow! Before using this product, my skin always looked so dull and tired, but lately I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right about how great my skin looks! This serum also contains many natural ingredients that are great for your skin! I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product free for my review. All opinions are completely my own.</li>
    <li> Only been using this for a few days but already see the effects of this, I can only image that it will get even better in time.&lt;br /&gt;my face is smoother, the dryness is gone too. and the fine lines seem less also....poor size do appear smaller too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very VERY sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m always concerned that my face will react poorly to new products but I&#x27;ve had no problem with this and the other two Oz products i purchased (their ocean mineral facial cleanser and sea infused herbal moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rec&#x27;d an email from the company a few days after i started using their product that told me to start using this product every other day and work up to daily then two times a day to allow my face time to adjust to the product...but as i started using the second i rec&#x27;d it i used per directions on the bottle and have had no ill effects...my face/skin seems to be taking very nicely to the product.....I will update this post in a few weeks and provide insight on the longer term effects of the product...but am happy with even just a few days results so I can see things will only get better with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information from the company on how to use this product correctly....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions &amp; Ingredients For Your OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum From Amazon&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals - Amazon Marketplace (1m8knjnngc33gwx@marketplace.amazon.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1m8knjnngc33gwx@marketplace.amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, it&#x27;s Angela Irish from OZ Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to provide you with the directions for use and ingredients of our hyaluronic acid serum that you recently purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most out of your serum, please carefully read the below information and feel free to keep this email as a reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> I have used this product for a couple of months. I really like it. I will only buy and put natural products on my skin.  This one is a winner.</li>
    <li> 😀love it . Does exactly what I need. Is a great lift for skin</li>
    <li> My skin is combination skin and very sensitive . I just started use this product for last three days. I must say I can tell big changes already . My skin is smooth and feel tight and dry anymore around mouth area. I love this product and affordable price .</li>
    <li> wow...the compliments I get after 6 weeks of use</li>
    <li> This does wonders for your skin!</li>
    <li> I use this at night, once a week. This is very strong and does a wonderful job on my skin. There is very good evidence it works as people are never willing to believe my age. The Dr OZ.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I used this with caution and it seemed ok and I though My skin looked better&lt;br /&gt;I used it every other day and sometime not for  three days&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time two days in a row&lt;br /&gt; now I have a ugly red rash on the side of my face like a sunburn about the size of a half dollar&lt;br /&gt;please take care with this</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much so far. At least It calms my sensitive skin. Will update...</li>
    <li> After one week saw my skin smoother!!! Live this brand!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I like the Dr. OZ vitamin C 20% serum. But I find the c serum to be too watery , the Hyaluronic Acid + C is thicker. Easier to apply.</li>
    <li> The return policy should have provided me insight into the quality of the product line but I was too impressed with so many glowing reviews.(Now I wonder how many are real).  I also read a business news item about  the products flying off shelves and how well the company is doing.  Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  It&#x27;s a sham.  Did nothing for my skin.  Beware of companies that don&#x27;t back up their product with a generous return policy:  there is a reason</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews.  I have sensitive skin.  This product line works for me!  Purchased the eye gel and this serum.  Comforted by the fact that there are no harmful chemicals, greasy film.  Just the perfect amount of hydration, ease of application,  Use twice daily, under make-up and at night.  Lovely, fresh fragrance.  Promises fulfilled.  Please don&#x27;t change anything!  Have many compliments.  Thank you Dr. Oz!!&lt;br /&gt; The Mrs.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is a beauty blogger and got this to try, she likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> I am in love with OZ Natural products.  I use both the Hyaluronic and Vitaminc C Serum. I use the Hyaluronic Serum at night, and after a week of using the product, I am waking up with softer smoother skin. I have minimal lines on forehead and laugh lines, but they look plumped and fuller with moisture. The consistency is much thicker, than the Vitamin C Serum, but a little goes a long way. It is a great product that I will be using on the regular. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading the back and forth between one of the customer and i guess one of oz naturals representative. The one about cancer. I got scared and just did not want to take any chances, especially that I use vitamin e oil on my face every night, will not buy again. I tried to return, but I waited too long the return time frame was expired. So definitely will not by again</li>
    <li> My face is looking like it did back 20 years ago</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim. I have noticed a difference in my skin probably three weeks in with twice a day use. Some acne scars have faded, I feel there is a fullness that has come back. I will continue to use this.  O and I am 36, no smoker, I wash my face twice a day minimal and I love water. I feel this all helps.</li>
    <li> Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;Age: 57&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a small clear(ish) bottle with dropper style application. Serum is &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than some of the gel-like consistency serums. Apply over face and throat once or twice a day. Massage in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful company - and an effective, environmentally sound, product line. I&#x27;ve used other Oz Natural products and continue to be impressed with their serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smooth/massage this serum over my face once or twice a day -- it&#x27;s not as thick as some serums, and does absorb very quickly, so I suggest massaging into sections of your face using just a small amount at a time. You do not need much of this serum, and for best results, work quickly over sections and massage in thoroughly. Use your regular moisturizer over the serum -- you can use it alone, and sometimes I do, but as my skin becomes more dry as I age, I find I need the extra moisturizers, especially as quickly as this serum absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon application of this hyaluronic serum, my face looks &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; - something a woman my age can appreciate. With continued use my complexion appears fresher - that&#x27;s the only word I can think to describe the results. Works well with other products, such as my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my face is rather sensitive and I have some rosacea, I have to be careful what products I use. With this serum I&#x27;ve had no break-outs or irritation. I do wait at least five minutes after cleansing my face before applying or it may feel &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; just a little - but not unpleasantly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying more Oz Naturals products -- cruelty free vegan -- and though I&#x27;m not a vegan, I always appreciate products that are.</li>
    <li> Gives my 64 year old face baby skin.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised. Nice lightweight ferl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I do see a slight difference.  I use it together with the Retinol Serum from OZ Naturals and then after both have dried, use a moisturizing cream.  My deeper lines have softened so will continue to use.  I suspect it will take some time for the total affect to kick in.  Because it&#x27;s winter and I live in the Northeast, my skin will be dry - I am waiting to see how my skin looks when we are in Spring/Summer when the humidity kicks in - I suspect that my skin will look even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above paragraph was written awhile ago - I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning since I purchased it and I can see a diminishing of the deeper wrinkles - they have definately softened.  For me, this took awhile but worth the wait!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has really broken my skin out!</li>
    <li> I love it. I reorder as needed. I highly recommend that everyone try this.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY...I&#x27;VE HAD MORE QUALITY PRODUCTS......</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m 73 years old and had run out of my first bottle..After a couple of days I knew I just to reorder immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased with this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> Until a representative with OZ Naturals contacted me requesting I review their anti-aging face products, I was a faithful consumer of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Divine and Immortelle facial products.  In fact, I was completely addicted to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Divine Oil, which has similar ingredients as OZ Naturals&#x27; hyaluronic acid serum.  I love the way the Divine Oil makes my skin feel soft, supple, and youthful.  What I don&#x27;t love?  L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s $120 priced tag for its small bottle of Divine Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum also leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, supple but at a fraction of the price. I applied the Hyaluronic acid serum to my face after washing it before bedtime. The next morning, my face looks less wrinkled and has that slightly flushed glow reminiscent of sometime in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I prefer the scent of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Divine Oil over the scent of OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it&#x27;s not worth paying the exorbitant price difference.  I also like L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s pretty bottle more than the OZ Natural&#x27;s plain bottle because it looks nice on my make up stand, however, again it&#x27;s not worth the price.  OZ Naturals is a bargain Antiaging product that actually works!</li>
    <li> During the 3.5 weeks I tried out this product I must say that I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin. The only difference is that my face feels a little bit lighter. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in the softness, blemishes or any other flaws I have on my face.  I can&#x27;t say that this product doesn&#x27;t work but for me it didn&#x27;t do anything that I couldn&#x27;t have gotten from a facial moisturizer. In all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product too highly but it may work for others because everyone has different skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Soothing and has my skin looking smooth.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, especially if you use it with the skin roller with needles so it penetrates deep into your skin.  I&#x27;m in my 60s and this has made my skin come alive again.</li>
    <li> Have tried it for a week, so far no problem</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I can&#x27;t figure it out if it&#x27;s helping are not will buy it again and see if there is finally is a difference</li>
    <li> Seems to be what ot says, results must take some time.</li>
    <li> Not my fave Hyaluronic serum but its ok.......I wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products! I use it first thing in the morning, after I have&lt;br /&gt;cleansed by face.  I always put on a sun screen for daytime use. I also use it at night&lt;br /&gt; before I put on my night cream. I have seen a BIG difference in the texture of my skin and pores.</li>
    <li> Love the serum. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your face.</li>
    <li> I always took care of my skin since I was 17. Now that I&#x27;m 53, taking care of my skin paid off but I noticed on the &amp;#34;higher magnification&amp;#34; side of my mirror fine lines under the eye area so decided to give it a try. Reading all of the wonderful reviews of this product I was hopeful I would see a difference, unfortunately this was not the case for me. It&#x27;s basically crap in a bottle! As the saying goes, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; (and this product was relatively cheap) so I&#x27;ll stick with drinking plenty of water and exercising! Having good genes is also a benefit and my mom had beautiful skin well into her 80&#x27;s so I shouldn&#x27;t fret over the wrinkles I &amp;#34;may get&amp;#34; some day!</li>
    <li> used for one week. smooth and silky under my moisture day and night. play close attention around the eyes and the eleven.  see a little Inprovement</li>
    <li> Love..love..love the feel of this product on my skin.  I have very sensitive skin so I am always reluctant to try new things but I wanted a change so I decided to try this and I have not regretted the decision.  There is no stinking - which I get from many other products.  I will be purchasing more of this once I this bottle is finished.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I got a chance to test and review a Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C by Oz Naturals, and instantly fell in love. I applied this product twice a day, once every night after cleansing and toning, and every morning underneath my moisturizer and makeup. Although it goes on pretty thick, it absorbs completely into the skin leaving to traces of product, just soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results were immediate. My face wasn’t as dry anymore and looked more alive. When I applied it underneath my makeup, it gave me a beautiful dewey effect without looking greasy. If you have combination skin like I do, I would just avoid the nose area under makeup. My co-workers noticed a difference too, one asked, what product I was using that my making my skin look fresh and dewey and not oily. Usually its the result of a highlighter (Did I mention before I work in one of the biggest and well known Beauty Supply Stores located in Los Angeles?) We offer some of the top skin care lines you can find in the states, but I have yet to find a product that works as great as this serum, with immediate results!</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid serum I got this on a promotion as I saw that it had a slightly different formula then I had seen before compared to many  Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid serums I have tried. What I noted was different was it also has Vitamen E and Green Tea extract which we know helps to minimize and reduce puffiness which I really need help with in the under eye area. I also liked that the Hyaluronic acid is botanically derived and it is an all VEGAN formula. It also meets my need to be all NATURAL &amp; ORGANIC  AND  CRUELTY FREE and it does not contain any alcohol, parabens or sulfates.  It goes on very silky and smooth and feels like it really penetrates and sinks into your skin with no sticky or greasy after feel.  It comes nicely boxed with a well thought out upscale looking label and package so it will also make a nice gift. So many serums I buy while they are lovely formulations and do work effectively just don&#x27;t gift very well because they come in a stock blank brown box with no label and the bottle with dropper has a very &amp;#34;elementary&amp;#34; label so it is refreshing when I Recieve all natural products with a lovely appearance in package design. Well done.</li>
    <li> I really found a change in my skin ist a very good proudect for skin care</li>
    <li> I am definitely noticing less wrinkles. Nothing dramatic, but anything is thrilling at this point. It&#x27;s also only been one and one half weeks of using the serum. Will write back when bottle is empty with my results. I&#x27;ve been taking &#x27;before&#x27;s&#x27; as I&#x27;m hoping there will be a huge difference in the &#x27;after&#x27; . . . I&#x27;ll show you at the end. Still have my fingers crossed but my face muscles I can&#x27;t help the big smiles. I&#x27;d love to get rid of the wrinkles but I know that they are just a sign of character too (well, and getting older too) so I&#x27;m happy either way so far. Will return when bottle is empty to give results and pics.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and the results I have recieved.</li>
    <li> Just plain does not work like it claims. I was really hoping it would, but its a hoax like all other magic wrinkle serums. Save your time, effort, and money and just get the real stuff from a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after undergoing 6 months of aggressive chemotherapy.  The chemo regimen left my face looking pre maturely old.  Being 41, having beaten cancer and wanting my outward appearance to reflect how triumphant and alive I felt on the inside, I gave this product a try.  This stuff is truly amazing.  It has filled in lines and brightened up my face.  People have even told me that my face is more radiant than it was before cancer.  Use it twice a day accompanied with vitamin c serum.  This stuff works.  I am grateful for it.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals the best Hyaluronic Acid Serum - I got this  on a sale to try out and I am really working on improving the appearance of my skin. Itmhad a quite dull look and while i dont have big breakouts i have lots of little bumps like clogged pores. My mom said give up on all the drug store stuff it&#x27;s not working anyway and try all natural products that clean and exfoliate. So I started with the Vitamin C cleanser and the Vitamin C serum and the dead sea mask and really noticed a lot of improvement but it felt like my skin was kind of over exfoliating so I backed off the vitamin C serum to only once a day and now I am trying this Hyaluronic serum with Vitamin E to calm my skin and it is soothing and getting rid of  the redness.  I noticed that unlike the other serums I have tried so far which are pretty thin in consistency and with the dropper instead of a pump I felt like I was wasting a lot because it was hard to get just a few drops at a time. This one is thick and almost gel like so I can get the right amount out without wasting it and it does go on really nice and feels smooth too. It came in a nice box too.</li>
    <li> We got very fast service on delivery of this product.  It is very good for areas around the eyes.  This is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I liked this better than some of the other high rated low price serums I&#x27;ve got off amazon.com. I bought this stuff because I couldn&#x27;t afford my normal $85 DDF serum. This does nothing for pore minimizing but I think it did a decent job of keeping my skin clear. Like I said I&#x27;ve tried 2 other serums in this range and I was most impressed by this one. It does have an odd consistency and smell but I would buy it again if I run out of my expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> dont see much improvement ---patiently waiting</li>
    <li> Love it, I use it day &amp; night. My skin looks radiant and feels smoother.</li>
    <li> SO MUCH VALUE FOR THE PRICE!! For reference, I am 18 with oily/combination, acne prone skin. I am interested in anti-aging and just keeping my skin plump and healthy. This product does it for me! (: After a week of use my pimples have gone down, my acne scars are starting to fade and my skin feels and looks so healthy! My favorite part of this product is that it&#x27;s vegan and simple, not to mention cruelty free!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 bottles and then switched to another brand. Wasn&#x27;t impressed nor did I find it beneficial.</li>
    <li> I use this at night to keep my skin soft and moist.</li>
    <li> I love all the OZ Naturals products I&#x27;ve ever tried, and this one is no exception! I was sent this product in order to review it with my honest opinion... and I have noticed that fine lines and frowns are a lot less noticeable! Which is great because I feel like at times I&#x27;m starting to look too old for my age. This product is helping to combat that.</li>
    <li> My skin looks 100x better. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd bottle of the hyaluronic acid and was really hoping to see some improvement in the overall appearance of my skin but I honestly do not see any difference.  I used it faithfully every night and applied moisturizer immediately afterwards .  I was really hoping to notice even a slight improvement but i will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Like this product with the Acure Firming Serum.  I feel like this product along with the Acure product helps kick my skincare up a notch</li>
    <li> Dude this is amazing. I love this stuff. Just got it and use twice a day. I see brightness in my eyes. I am 40. I love the sun. I am paying. I need help and this will do it. Not sure if its the end all be all but for now, I appreciate the product and feel that the extra $6-8 dollars is worth it over drug store types. I just hope the OZ is not Dr. Oz. I do not want to keep pumping money into a lying machine who is constantly retracting his crap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks. My skin is not in good condition, so to give the product a fair chance....it will take some time. So far I am pretty satisfied with it over the other products I&#x27;ve used. I have terrible lid-lag to the point my insurance company was willing to pay for surgery to improve my field of vision. I could not have the surgery due to dry-eyes. An eye lift with very dry eyes is dangerous. It can inhibit your eyes from ever closing again. In two the weeks that I have used OZ Naturals, I have noticed that my eyes appear more opened and less tired looking.! Now that alone is  worth the product.</li>
    <li> this product works fantastic will order again</li>
    <li> Helps with fine lines</li>
    <li> Very nice. Would love a sample</li>
    <li> Trying this as a supplement to the skin moisturizer I am using for the face and after reading about the drying, flaking skin, I am a little nervous about that. So far that hasn&#x27;t happened.  This absorbs into the skin quickly but felt a little sticky to me.  I have sensitive skin but this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet.  So far it seems to be doing what it is supposed to do.  Like all of these types of skin care products, I do think this is a bit expensive for a small bottle.  I will update my review once I have some long term use with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any</li>
    <li> still waiting for the awesomeness to happen, not as amazing as reviewed and advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using OZ Naturals for a couple of weeks now and I have not seen any real changes in my skin.  I do like the way it goes on and it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> A very much needed vitamin for me and my family. we use it everyday! best cure!!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money.  I do not know why there are five star reviews of this product.  It did nothing for my skin after a month of using the product.</li>
    <li> Using only a few days and loving it! My face is craggy especialy on the left from the car window. I can already see an easing there. I do not expect transformation. I am pleased with the results. Easy to use.  Not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Been using in conjunction with the vitamin c serum every night for a month now and noticed no difference in hyper pigmentation! All lies! Strategic marketing ploy to target women who have to live with unsightly dark spots but the claims are all untrue! I&#x27;ve noticed zero difference even after following their complete beauty regimen day and night!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this over a month now. It definitely softened my skin when I applied it but after using this everyday for a month I dont see drastic improvements or anything yet. It softens my skin but the next morning my skin feels dry again until I reapply. So I don&#x27;t think I see any long lasting results. This is good for short acting results. I will update if I see any results after using the full bottle.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product  I put it on after I wash my face in after I us my moisturizer. My feels tighter love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on HA prior to buying this serum. I wanted that plumped look everybody described. I&#x27;ve also read from some people it does not work for them. Well, it did not work for me either...AT ALL. It did not plump at all and I think it made my skin drier. I tried applying it alone, on top of moisturizer, and under moisturizer, all tips I&#x27;ve read online. Nothing worked for me. I am now trying to return it. I will update how the return process goes.</li>
    <li> I love the Oz naturals I saw results within a week.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of use coupled with a moisturizer, have found a couple of  dry/flaky patches. Does not make my skin feel or look any&lt;br /&gt;better. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.  I see no difference in it an another product claiming to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Great product.Goes on nice no smell and dries smooth not crumbly.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, no unusual smell, absorbs quickly and I know I&#x27;m doing something that will benefit my skin. I would highly recommend it. OZ Naturals are on my &#x27;favorites&#x27; list!</li>
    <li> I adore this company! I am not one to follow skincare regimes. I usually buy a couple cheap things a year, use half a bottle, see no results, and toss it in a drawer. And repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore! I started using the toner, Hyaluronic acid+ vitamin C serum, Vitamin C facewash, and Super Youth moisturizer twice a day a few weeks ago and have seen a great improvement in the texture, softness, redness and dryness of my skin. Most importantly, I saw a dramatic improvement in my nasolabial/marionette lines. I am 32 but have thin skin and spent many years working in the sun, and was considering fillers for the ever deepening lines from my nose to the outer edges of my mouth because of how they were aging me and making me look tired and unhappy.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to lessen them but they continued to get deeper and more pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of these products has saved me from the needle! The creases are much more shallow, smoother, and less noticeable after only a few weeks. And I am a skeptic, folks, but I LOVE this product line. It has saved my skin. Though they are powerful, they are not harsh. I have sensitive skin prone to redness around my nose and eyes, but this has evened it all out. It is gentle on skin but tough on signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to seal the deal, they are USA made, Vegan (no animal testing!), all natural, and the prices can&#x27;t be beat. You CAN afford an entire line of this stuff. I probably go through two entire bottles in a year of each product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Nice texture and my skin feels good after using it.  I would recommend this product.  The service was quite efficient.</li>
    <li> Great product Will continue to use</li>
    <li> Deep wrinkles started to smooth out within a few days.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin super soft and supple! Love the effect it has on my skin.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and in secure packing. I began using nightly and noticed some drying to my skin so I began an every other night routine with it until my skin adapted. Now that the drying has stopped, I love this! It is best to use after washing face and before using moisturizer. Please note that the serum is not meant to be moisturizing on it&#x27;s own but was designed to help absorb moisturizer. Leaves my skin very soft. Will order again once this is gone!</li>
    <li> too drying. seems like a bunch of hooey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several ha serums over the years including some of the most expensive brands on the market and i have to say, this hyaluronic acid serum from OZ Naturals is my new favorite. It provides my skin with a plump, tightening effect that looks and feels hydrated and more vibrant. Not only is this serum half the price of my previous serum, it&#x27;s far more effective. My skin is loving the hydration and I&#x27;m even seeing the fine lines and wrinkles filling in. I can safely recommend this serum to anyone shopping for a high quality hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
    <li> SO FAR, SO GOOD.  I CAN FEEL THE &amp;#34;TONING &amp;#34; SENSATION AS IT DRIES,  AND I HAVE REORDERED TO GIVE IT A REAL TRIAL.  HERE&#x27;S HOPING.</li>
    <li> I love Oz Naturals.  I cannot say enough about their products.  They do exactly what they are designed to do.  I have used them for a couple of weeks now and I see a major difference in my aging skin.  Thanks Oz Naturals for a great product!</li>
    <li> I using my second bottle, I am happy I got some positive complement for my skin.</li>
    <li> FROM WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN A SHORT TIME, THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PRODUCT...ALSO, ITEM DELIVERED IN TIMELY MANNER...I DO THINK I NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO EVALUATE THE VALUE OF THIS PRODUCT...</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s make my skin feel soft and silky. my skin don&#x27;t feel dry. love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old, and have been using this product for about 4 months.  My wrinkles immediately lessened, and to my amazement are still becoming less obvious.  I look 10 years younger!  It&#x27;s a great product - I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just got it. I used it right away.  I put two drops on my hands. I put it on my face.  I followed the directions on their web site.  Wet your shin first. I cannot believe the results.  I am 59 and this is great.  Do not believe the negative reviews.  I am not asked to give this favorable feed back.  Use it.</li>
    <li> Did nothing  more than a reg moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Shane on the manufacturers fir using  retouched photos but then everybody uses false advertising or young girls to sell their products.</li>
    <li> I am seeing improvement in my complexion after 3 weeks.. Hoping for more😄</li>
    <li> Have seen absolutely no difference with my skin with this product. Have used it morning and night for a month. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> garbage, like all the other snake oil that this &amp;#34;dr. oz&amp;#34; quack endorses.</li>
    <li> I received the product last week, so far I like the serum.  I also appreciated the email that was sent with instructions on how to use it. The ingredients are excellent too. I&#x27;ll keep using it daily &amp; hope to get good results.</li>
    <li> Loving it so far, still waiting for the glow&lt;br /&gt; it does make my face feel soft and supple.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the way it feels on my skin and hope I will see some positive results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this works but it makes your skin very dry then whatever you follow it with get sucked in like a sponge. Moisturizers I use to use no longer leave my skin feeling moist. I had to either apply a lot more or change to a more oil based cream to not feel dry. I&#x27;ve only used a few weeks but feel my skin is not as dry as it use to be by this product absorbing everything better. You cannot use this without following with a  heavy moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it religiously every morning and night with a derma roller for the last two weeks to see if it would improve my forehead expression lines and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s changed a single thing...</li>
    <li> CRUELTY FREE, CLINICAL STRENGTH. NATURAL &amp; ORGANIC , what more could you ask for? Everything I have been looking for in a Hyaluronic Acid Serum..and did I tell you its  MADE IN THE USA?? Too right it is!!</li>
    <li> So far I love this product. I&#x27;m 26 and live in colorado for 4 years and have had incredibly dry and sensitive skin since living here (I&#x27;m originally from TX). Normally I use primarily oils but this year even oils can&#x27;t help my skin. My skin would some what feel hydrated and then I&#x27;d be flaking on my forehead. When I first used this it made my skin even drier due to the directions saying to apply it to dry skin. I was determined to make it work so I researched what I could do differently and found that my face should be wet when applying it. Man did it make a difference! My skin us baby soft. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different looking about my skin but I notice the hydration!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, my face is smoother</li>
    <li> Decent product, better than most. Left skin feel great. Would use again</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff for the price.  I actually see a firmer face after I use this in the morning on my naked 60 yr. old skin.  Always follow up with a moisturizer though...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for it. It just seems to make my face more dry. I have decided to just continue using my moisturizer by itself.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, makes my face feel wonderful</li>
    <li> GOOD STUFF. DIMINISHES THE LOOK OF FINE LINES AND WRINKLES AND MAKES FACE FEEL SOFT. I USUALLY USE RETINOL BUT IM BEGINNING TO THINK THESE INGREDIENTS ARE JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER.</li>
    <li> I wrote a blog review for this item thanks to the sample OZ Naturals provided me for an honest opinion, and from my experience it was absolutely amazing. I love how fast drying it is, and it is perfect for layering other skin products. I had no bad allergic reaction to it, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to apply on the neck and around the eyes as well. Check out my full review here: https://gabofgift.wordpress.com/2015/07/16/oz-naturals-hyaluronic-acid-serum-review/</li>
    <li> I LOVE this company and products! I have been using their line for about 3 weeks and the results are incredible! My skin tome looks amazing and my wrinkles seem to be disappearing along with the dark circles! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> No difference. Waste of time. 3 weeks of daily use</li>
    <li> Over half gone can&#x27;t see any results!</li>
    <li> I am super excited I got to try this OZ naturals serum for free,  I apsolutly love it my skin feels so hydrated and wrinkle free. I&#x27;m in love 😍thanks for letting me try</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering your anti aging serum in the brown bottle. I think I like that better...skin has a cleaner feel after use.&lt;br /&gt;Do you still have that? Or have you only this moisturizing serum??</li>
    <li> Love this product! I would recommend using this with derma roller.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  I&#x27;m 55 and it has made a huge improvement!  I&#x27;m very fair, and have had dry skin all my life.  I have always used a moisturizer on my face, but using your serum first right after I wash my face makes my skin look and feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;So absolutely yes, you are doing a great job!!  I love it, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve ordered l think around 6 bottles!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, I will continue to order your product and recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This smells and feels amazing I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Would not order this again! No results for me, very sad about this product.</li>
    <li> Instant results! I was very happy with my results</li>
    <li> I do feel as this product does help absorb my moisturizer. I started using this in the winter when my skin was really dry. It has the texture of hand sanitizer and dries quicky like it. The smell is okay. I use it daily before my moisturizer and I feel it does help it sink into my skin better. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any other amazing benefits to it. Most people said it broke them out and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different in my skin. I do have acne prone/oily skin but it didn&#x27;t cause any extra breakouts. It does help keep my skin from getting too flaky when it&#x27;s cold out.</li>
    <li> The natural products. I like it.</li>
    <li> After reading the rave reviews I felt like I was missing out of I didn&#x27;t order. I am 45 years old and my skin is in decent shape. Have minor wrinkles around eyes. I used this product, as instructed. BUT I only used on 1/2 of my face so that I could truly see the difference. I have since lost the before and after pics. This is what I learned ..it smells nice. That&#x27;s about it.  It&#x27;s not the miracle serum that people think it is. It did absolutely nothing but possibly lightened a couple of freckles. I&#x27;ve also done my research.  Vitamin C has a shelf life of maybe 3 days. After this it loses ALL of its ability to heal. If you want to do great things for your skin? Order yourself the Vitamin C powder on Amazon and mix with a nice carrier oil (I like almond or jojoba oil) and mix small batched for yourself every few days. This was basically a 40 dollar bottle of carrier oil.</li>
    <li> So far, this product seems to be OK.</li>
    <li> Really awesome product. I am 45 and I feel like this has taken off about 5 years in 5 days. I am excited to finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had enough time to see results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 30 and don&#x27;t have visible wrinkles yet but even looking at a photo I took 4 years ago compared it to one I took last month, I actually looked younger.  I have used this for a few months now and I like it so far. I have combination skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or dryness. So far, I have used it every day at night before using their Retinol A moisturizer and have not seen any reactions on my skin. I use the Vitamin C Serum during the day and use this at night.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I am 56 and have been now noticing many more laugh lines. I was thrilled even after the first use my fine lines evened right out over night and were so soft even in the morning. I have been using it now for a month day and night and I found a little goes along way. I now put it all over my face and neck what an amazing feeling. So soft and supple. I am buying another bottle and also going to now try the 2.5% Retinol + Astaxanthin + Vitamin E.</li>
    <li> According to customer support, the serum is supposed to be cloudy.  This is unlike other HA products I have been using namely, Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> Shall be ordering my third bottle soon, love it</li>
    <li> Really amazing product. It definitely does seem to help the skin retain moisture better- I live in Colorado so that is always an issue! I also notice a brightening effect. It&#x27;s a little thick for the dropper, a pump would probably be better packaging. Outside of that, great product. I love it!</li>
    <li> Just started to use, but seems to be working ok</li>
    <li> Nothing to post here either.</li>
    <li> I broke out using this product, don&#x27;t know why but I did.</li>
    <li> Feel good to the skin....but no great improvements</li>
    <li> After using this product for 10 days, I noticed the circles around my eyes are gone.  I&#x27;m never going to stop using this with my moisturizer, I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Major improvement in skin appearance&lt;br /&gt;Less small wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth appearance&lt;br /&gt;Takes about 2 weeks to notice&lt;br /&gt;I have reordered 3 times and shared it with my sister by sending it to her.</li>
    <li> It doesnot work for my acne prone skin. I have more cysts. I also bought vit C oz natural and retinal cream, they are also broke me out after a few used. I stop using them now.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper. Like the way it came. Product is fine. No fault. No side effect. Yet, I didn&#x27;t see improvements. But I do not blame the product. May be I didn&#x27;t know how to apply correctly or that my skin is not suitable. I&#x27;m 40 and fair skin with spreading dim dark spots on my face. Have been using it for a month or longer but unfortunately I do not see any improvement. I&#x27;m giving it positive 3 stars reviews still hoping it will work for me eventually with longer use. I will wait using it for a couple of months more. If it didn&#x27;t work, I would certainly come back and update my reviews accordingly.</li>
    <li> The advertised price of $6.00 per ounce makes each 4oz bottle $24.00 each.....gets even pricier when I mistakenly posted  4 ( thinking 4 ounces) and that comes up as 4-4 ounce bottles. The one star is for me not seeing my mistake in time. The product however is excellent and on arrival I gave 3 to friends who like the product and will probably purchase more. However I will be working up my own as I enjoy tinkering with the various possibilities in skin care and the deeply-technical side of therapeutic restoration.</li>
    <li> Really a great product.  Feels silky when dry.</li>
    <li> I found it to be nonirritating and appears to hold moisture to the skin after I apply my moisturizer. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> i have used this serum for over a month now. I bought it based on good reviews and some of the reviewers even called it as miracle in a bottle.in my experience i haven&#x27;t seen any miracle or change on my skin, if anything it dried up my skin. I have fine lines under my eyes and i was hopping this serum would do miracle as described by some reviewers however unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. Those reviewers who said miracle in a bottle or they saw result within a week is a misleading and I think they are paid to leave those kind of reviews. For me it was nothing but a waist of money and I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Well I have been using this product a couple of weeks now and I have to admit, that it works! Without a picture it is hard to tell but I will post an update to this review after I finish the bottle so all call see my results. For those of you thinking about, make sure you have some face wash, toner, and facial lotion to use with this product to receive the maximum benefit. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Does wonders !!! Very hydrating</li>
    <li> I love OZ naturals, i like this product, I don&#x27;t know that it is THE BEST thought.  I may stick with OZ naturals for other products but try out a different HA serum next time.  I think of this serum as a good start (this is my first HA serum), but I might try others next.</li>
    <li> THE BEST AVAILABLE!!!!!I</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the Oz skincare products.  I used as directed for two weeks and I have not seen any noticeable change in dark circles or puffiness under my eyes.  Also my crows feet don&#x27;t look any different.  I read all the reviews and had so much.hope for this product. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it is awful. I don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  Mini facelift!!</li>
    <li> My skin felt smooth after using this. I bought another bottle!</li>
    <li> Ladies, while we know There is no fountain of youth.... You&#x27;d think by reading the reviews on this product there was one. I&#x27;m here to tell you that while I was excited to receive this product and try it the first evening, I was horrified as to what I woke up to. I had more wrinkles under my eyes than I have ever seen. DO NOT PUT THIS STUFF NEAR YOUR EYES! I think I&#x27;ll be gifting it to an enemy!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> I love love love this! I use it under makeup and with my night time moisturizer. It makes my skin look great!!!! I want to try their other products.</li>
    <li> The best hydrating serum on the market. Lots of moisture for dry skin. Good serum for people living in very hot, dry climates.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS AND AMAZON HAS QUITE A SELECTION.  I CHOSE THIS ONE B/C IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIVES....JUST STRAIGHT HYALURONIC ACID.</li>
    <li> Great article. Come as expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum two years ago to take to Peru as a gift for my sister. She is very skeptical with face products but when she used it to give a try next morning she was telling that her skin seems different more softer and less dry. After that, I am using it as well. As I said before, I love all these products great quality..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks OZ</li>
    <li> I received my Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Oz Naturals, thanks to Brandbacker. I honestly cannot say that my skin has ever felt this smooth or fresh before! Not only did it reduce the excessive oiliness around my nose and forehead, but it helped clear some of my blemishes/flare ups! I am so happy with this product and I will purchase this in the future!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Great product. Best anti-wrinkle serum I have ever used. Very simple to use. I will order more.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie, an advertising companies dream customer.  don&#x27;t even want to think about how much money I have wasted over the years.  This product works as well if not better then the more expensive brand.  Within a week my skin was looking better, had a glow to it that I haven&#x27;t had in many years.  And it wasn&#x27;t just me noticing it others around me did.  I have now purchased this product for friends.  Definitely a keeper</li>
    <li> It works for a short time.  I put it on in the morning and by the evening had to reapply.  Not sure if it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This hyaluronic acid serum is a translucent milky gel with a distinct vegetal odor dominated by the sharpness of witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very soothing when applied to the skin, especially on irritated, flakey, or slightly sunburned areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula contains over a dozen beneficial botanical ingredients such as aloe, hyaluronic acid and glycerin that provide an intense moisturizing effect and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles with regular use over time. The plant-derived hyaluronic acid may even help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear glass bottle has a dropper cap, which is very convenient. A little bit goes a long way. Apply after bathing or washing the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided serum for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (98% natural and 72% organic): Organic aloe, botanical hyaluronic acid, witch hazel, kosher vegetable glycerin, MSM, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, organic jojoba oil, wildcrafted green tea, geranium essential oil, vitamin C, vitamin E, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethyl hexyl glycerin.</li>
    <li> Not any better than same product but cheaper costs.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Soaks into your skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Been using it for about a month and there is no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having good success with another 100% Hyaluronic Acid available on Amazon. Perhaps I failed on my end as a consumer to diligently sift through the product description. However, at a glance, this product appears to be marketed as a pure Hyaluronic Acid-- which it is not. Getting that out of the way, I&#x27;m still less than thrilled by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It sits heavy on the skin. Whereas the pure Hyaluronic Acid absorbs into the skin feeling light, this product sits on top the skin and never fully absorbs. By the end of the day my face felt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) In addition to the unspecific ratio of HA, this product also contains several oils like Jojoba and Geranium Oil, as well as Witch Hazel, MSM, and Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I think the product is OK-- a little on the oily side especially when compares to the other pure HA sources available for less on Amazon. What I was really put off by, was the misleading (in my opinion) and inadequate description of this product not clearly stating it to be a blend rather than Pure HA. I would not buy this again. It&#x27;s not HA and it&#x27;s on the low end of moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Absorb fast. Make my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Sorry Dr Oz. I really love you and typically trust your advice but this doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me that&#x27;s noticeable. Maybe it&#x27;s good for my skin but I want to see the results. At this point I feel pretty defeated after trying so many different products.</li>
    <li> All Ingredients were not disclosed.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST Hyaluronic Serum I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve purchased designed brands at a shocking price that don&#x27;t compare to this product.  It&#x27;s organic.  It&#x27;s vegan (I think). It also has vitamin C and E. It&#x27;s made in the USA.  It is literally amazing and I am shocked at how affordable it is.  OZ Naturals consistently delivers quality products that are socially conscious and this serum is no exception. After the first use and after every use my skin feels hydrated and soft.  I can definitely see an improvement in the texture and the fine lines are less noticeable. I am literally IN LOVE.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best wrinkle serum on the market and organic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now.  I&#x27;ll totally honest - my intent was to start a good beauty routing *before* wrinkles really set in.  I was not expecting the few fine lines I do have to start disappearing!  A few other people have commented that their skin glows after using the serum...and they&#x27;re right!  In addition to the beauty benefits, I really appreciate that this product is made in the United States and NOT tested on animals.</li>
    <li> these are great products for the face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this few times already for the past year. At first, I loved it. Now, I feel the product quality has changed... Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as potent as it was before. Lately I&#x27;ve mixed it with some jojoba oil as part of my skin care. I may start buying other brand to see if they quality is better. Use on: Early 30&#x27;s, Asian, normal skin.</li>
    <li> If you want your skin to look its very best and its youngest this is the best product out there. I have tried the most expensive name brands out there and nothing compares to this. I have already ordered 4 bottles:-)</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and no change in pore size, wrinkles did not soften at all and have had a little more acne break outs  Plus I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has ever experienced this but it made all of my facial hair darker and more of it.  Took me twice as long to pluck my eyebrows and I had hair on my upper lip, not a good look.  The only thing I really like about this product is the way it makes my skin feel very soft all day without moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum works well with the face cream I use. I let the serum dry and than apply cream.</li>
    <li> Use lightly.  Can burn if overdone.</li>
    <li> has softened deep lines - will keep on using it</li>
    <li> Ok I was going to wait until I used this awhile before I gave a review because people give reviews after a few days and says how great something is without giving it a chance to work or not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this since beginning of December. I am 47 so started getting wrinkles under my eyes ugghhh. So got this due to the reviews but was skeptic. I put it under my eyes in the morning when I took a shower and waited for it to try maybe 5 mins and then put my own lotion on it. I started seeing results in 2 weeks not one day like someone say. But it&#x27;s been almost 2 months and I have no wrinkles under my eyes. Not sure how it gets rid of them? I am guessing it plumps your skin up somehow but it&#x27;s got me hooked and I&#x27;ll continue to use it. Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> I read the extensive reviews for this product after looking to decrease the amount that I was spending on my facial regime.  I was not sure about purchasing a serum because I thought that it would not be moisturizing.  I was wrong.  I love this product.  It is very moisturizing and I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin.  I traded in a $100 moisturizer for this to wear under my Daily face cream with SPF.  So, I use an eye cream, this product, and a daily moisturizer with SPF daily.  I saved $75 and am really happy with the outcome so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this HA religiously for about 3 weeks.  I can see a difference in the texture of my skin.  Full disclosure, I also use other serums and creams so I cannot attribute this to just the HA but I do plan on reordering because who knows, right?  The bottle is tiny but you only 3 drops so does last.  HA is touted as being one of the best skin care applications available.  I am staying with it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order the Oz brand because of all the negative&lt;br /&gt;reviews, especially regarding the company&#x27;s customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Also, that it was likely watered down. But, being a stubborn&lt;br /&gt;woman who doesn&#x27;t listen to others complaining, I went ahead&lt;br /&gt;and ordered it.  I strongly say nonsense on those complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order arrived in a couple days, and it has&lt;br /&gt;been amazing.  The first few days, admittedly, my skin was dry and flaking,&lt;br /&gt;which I assumed was because it was removing dead skin.  Apparently&lt;br /&gt;I was right, since my skin adjusted quickly, and is soft, bright and&lt;br /&gt;youthful.  I endorse the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD JOB!  You have an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year now and everyone says I look a decade younger than I am (I am 61).  What I like about it is that it combines the facial acid for exfoliation with vitamin C which the best dermatologists will tell you to put on your skin.  Other brands are ten times the price.  Definitely lots of value in this little bottle.  I use it in the morning under my moisturiser and then use Retin A at night.  The two combined are the best skin aging fighters out there.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is great highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Makes the skin soft. The small wrinkles will not disappear, lets be honest... but it does make your face smooth, nice and again: super soft.</li>
    <li> I use the product on top of my makeup (I live in a  very dry area).  Blends very well, does not clump or roll up.  Not oily.  Gives me that moist result I need.</li>
    <li> Been using it two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet.</li>
    <li> Too thick,dropper is useless.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid can be used in a number of ways including serums, moisturizers and oral supplements. OZ naturals has a great hyaluronic serum, also containing vitamin C and E to help give you a dewy glow while also combating the signs of aging. Another perk is their products are free of parabens, sulfates, mineral oil and lanolin. I only had to use this product once and noticed immediately how my skin felt more hydrated and supple. My skin is oily and prone to breakouts and I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts with this product. In fact, it helped my acne serum to work ten-fold and help diminish my breakouts. I used it under my moisturizer as well. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to help combat the signs of aging and increase the effectiveness of other products.</li>
    <li> good product. good seller.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 5 days along with the OZ Naturals Best Retinol Moisturizer and the OZ Naturals Best Naturals Eye Gel...I am already seeing results with decreasing visibility of crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and brow lines.  At age 45, this is the first product that I can say really does what it claims.  I have used department store brands, designer cosmetic store top sellers, and top line drug store products, and none can compare to the results of these 3 products.  As a reader of Product Reviews, I never post a review...until now...this is worth the money because it delivers what it claims to do for your skin.</li>
    <li> I slightly see a difference but can feel the tightness. not bad.</li>
    <li> It works! It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for my wrinkles, but it works hard at trying, and definitely makes my skin look better.</li>
    <li> All excellent products</li>
    <li> I think it was just water because I saw absolutely no immprovement with my skin.</li>
    <li> happy with this product</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for a hydrating serum and was encouraged by other user reviews for this product. I&#x27;m getting married this year, so anything that promises to make me look rested/glowing/generally stunning gets a test drive.... well, within reason ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin soaks this up, and I typically wait a few minutes before putting on my moisturizer. I can see a difference after using it for about 2 months. It&#x27;s definitely not an insane before/after scenario, but I feel it does what it promises, is affordable, and I enjoy having it as part of my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Item arived in perfect condition, and was great to use. Thx</li>
    <li> Started using its great</li>
    <li> I love how easily this serum goes on and how it makes my face feel. Love that it&#x27;s organic and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> The best anti wrinkle product I&#x27;ve ever used. I started to see results after a week of use. I am told daily I do not look my age.</li>
    <li> Great Service..Great Product!!  I will never be without it...my skin loves it!!</li>
    <li> This vitamin serum feels very good on your skin, however I have not seen any improvement in firming or fine lines and wrinkles.  I have been using it for almost a month along with the 20% vitamin C serum in the evenings faithfully.  I am going to continue to use for 6-8 weeks, if still no improvement then I will try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria&lt;br /&gt;Albq, NM</li>
    <li> This clogged my pores and caused breakouts so I couldn&#x27;t use it on my face. I used it for my neck and chest, but wasn&#x27;t really impressed. Hyaluronic Acid is supossed to be great for your skin so I&#x27;m going to try another brand.</li>
    <li> I Love OZ Naturalss products.  all natural and leaves my skin fresh and healthy.</li>
    <li> I felt my skin tighten slightly, but I did not see a dramatic difference after I use it in terms of wrinkles. I have been using for a month. The best thing is that it is all natural, No Alcohol, No Paraben..</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Helps soak your moisturizer into your skin.  I use in the morning and in the evening.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money, haven&#x27;t seen anything different on my skin, I want a refund.</li>
    <li> Miracle worker? NO..but for a wrinkling 60 year old woman it brings some plump and some smoother texture to my face. I wish the bottles were bigger!</li>
    <li> Again this arrived fast and the routine of using, has bumped up my face washing routine.  I am taking better care of my skin because I have a good product to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item 2x a day and haven&#x27;t notice any change. I&#x27;m also using  other stuff that was recommended but stll no change</li>
    <li> Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin - Potent Anti Aging Serum - Best Anti Wrinkle Serum with Vitamin C - Facelift In A Bottle HA Serum - 100% Pure No Cream - Top Reviews - Best Skin Care - Help Your Skin Look Younger And More Vibrant</li>
    <li> My face looks younger, smooth and soft. I used a lot but now I know the difference. So try it.</li>
    <li> like glue on the face</li>
    <li> But it does feel good on my face! I use it every morning and night, let it seep in, then put lotion and eye cream on top of it. That entire regime has definitely improved the balance of moisture on my face and reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but it&#x27;s hard to say which particular product is actually doing the work.....!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in hopes of keeping the aging process away but have found a wonderful other use -- acne control. I have oily skin and am prone to adult breakouts. This product has boosted my acne medication and has been unclogging my pores and helping to treat my blackheads and pimples. It&#x27;s also been great, so far, on my forehead expression lines. I also like that it dries fast and absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> Works well like Reivtalift by Loreal BUT a better price!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product after reading the reviews for my Mom. The product arrived on time however with a major flaw. The product label contains no information at all! No ingredients, no directions for use nothing! Its just a plain sticker with the product name. I thought it would be pure Hyaluronic serum with vitamin c, but its not. Its got loads of other ingredients which is not mentioned on the label. The ingredients and directions for use came later in an email which was quite strange. Now ill have to give Mom a print out of it so that she&#x27;ll know whats in it and how to use it! Anyway Mom says the product is okay, too much fragrance which she hates. Its definitely not pure Hyaluronic Acid. Think we&#x27;ll switch back to Watts or find some other pure hyaluronic acid!</li>

    <li> first bottle almost gone. you can feel it lifting the first time used. i&#x27;m signing up for the monthly delivery if it&#x27;s an option. really. i&#x27;m 48 &amp; i&#x27;m not gonna tell you how long i was a smoker. premature aging my doctor said of me a year ago &amp; now she can&#x27;t believe the positive change. also if you use this at night followed by a quality night cream it really helps. i feel like there is new collagen elasticity something like that. i&#x27;m glad i don&#x27;t have a recent &#x27;before&#x27; photo but i&#x27;m not opposed to a new one. the question i have is does just keep getting better? i had really deeply furrowed forehead lines that i&#x27;ve been trying to cajole into softening with years of numerous quality serums creams lotions (including those w hyaluronic acid) &amp; was never impressed... is crazy.</li>
    <li> good price and very good result</li>
    <li> Great serum, and has a lot in the bottle. A little drop in your hand will cover your entire face. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Does what I expected.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! Saw results right away</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! I have very dry skin and I use Retinol, which further dries it out. I need all of the moisture I can get! I am a huge fan of Hyaluronic Acid serums for getting some of that additional hydration to my skin and holding it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several OZ naturals skin care products and they are a top flight brand. High quality, effective, attainable and affordable. I highly recommend this serum to anyone who is serious about skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product was sent to me for review. All opinions are honest and my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly like a home facial&lt;br /&gt;You feel the benefits right away&lt;br /&gt;Natural and effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.facebook.com/TheOneLifetoLiveNaturalist.health</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and my face seems to be clearer and the tone has evened out a little bit.  I like that it helps my moisturizer get deeper into my skin.</li>
    <li> It made my face super soft but, I dont really like the smell!!</li>
    <li> This serum keeps the skin hydrated better than moisturizers. I will never use another product no matter the cost or hype.</li>
    <li> you know you have a winner when you apply a product and you can see the difference right away in the mirror.</li>
    <li> A great serum at a really great price.  Vitamin C - Ascorbic Acid is a my BLT!  It brightens, tightens and lightens.  A Hyaluronic acid is made by the body natural and aids in plumping skin.  I highly recommend it.  Would love to see it in a larger size!!</li>
    <li> Must have. Fast shipment</li>
    <li> This product I don&#x27;t believe is made by Dr. Oz. A lot of products carry the name. The ingredients are recommended by Dr Oz. There are so many products out there saying &amp;#34;recommeended by Dr. Oz&amp;#34;  I was told this was not a Dr. Oz product. Is this true?</li>
    <li> This product is great. I immediately saw a different in the texture and appearance of my face over night. It hasn&#x27;t helped with any of my acne so far, but I am loving the results I already have!</li>
    <li> Fortunately through correspondence with another manufacturer of Hyaluronic Acid seru,m. I found out it is useless to use the product unless you first either dampen your face with&lt;br /&gt;water or dilute the product with a drop or two of water -- THEN and ONLY then it can be absorbed --  This detail is completely overlooked in the Oz naturals offering!!!!!  I&lt;br /&gt;will never purchase another Oz product as a result.  Hype will not make one a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eugenia</li>
    <li> does nothing for me that I can tell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with Oz Naturals Best Vitamin C Serum and they work together fabulously!  After using them for 2 solid months, I&#x27;m thrilled!  My skin is much finer textured, with dramatically smaller pores, and it seems thicker, somehow.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, with pretty darn good skin for my age, but it was getting thinner so that you could see more capilaries and tiny veins.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I don&#x27;t see them nearly as much, and my skin is so much fresher and young-looking that I&#x27;m actually comfortable going out without wearing any foundation or blush!  I didn&#x27;t really have any wrinkles but was noticing some sagging, but my skin seems firmer now, as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to point out that my skin seemed to break out more when I first started using these 2 products.  (My skin has always done that, still oily, despite my age.)  I contacted the company and they told me to be sure to exfoliate more, and that took care of everything!  I think this stuff kind of planes down your skin so that stuff that is under the surface emerges, but exfoliating removes the &amp;#34;gunk.&amp;#34;  Then you&#x27;re left with smooth, clear, finely-textured and fresh, young-looking skin!</li>
    <li> Second time buying this. I can see a difference in minimizing wrinkles. I use under a makeup primer and apply after washing face before bed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product use it everyday even in place of my moisturizer</li>
    <li> I like this before the evening moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I feel that this product has been very beneficial to my skin.  I also bought the VC serum from OZ Naturals and use them in conjunction with my Mary Kay skin care products.  I have gotten multiple unsolicited compliments from people since I have started using the serums and that makes me happy!</li>
    <li> I have to wonder where all of these reviews are coming from?  I&#x27;ve been using this along with their Vitamin C serum for a few months.  The moment they are both out of the bottle, they basically turn into the consistency of water in your palm.  Very difficult to apply and I&#x27;ve seen zero positive results.  I recently purchased Paula&#x27;s Choice Vitamin C serum and within days saw a positive difference.  I will not be repurchasing this product.  I find it useless!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use after using The Oz Naturals Best Vitamin C serum.  Great for fine lines, crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkle prevention. Excellent and affordable skin care serums.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it daily and can see a big difference with not having dry skin and tightens.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> Like the way it makes my fact feel.</li>
    <li> I bought thinking, oh yeah sure ....but now after 3 weeks of steady use, I am a  believer. Lines around month, nose  and eyes have slowly been mininizing. Recently at a family gathering the compliments where flowing.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It has a soft pleasant odor, goes on smoothly and most importantly my skin looks smooth and feels so soft.  I apply it at night and put a light moisturizer on top and in the morning before my makeup primer.  Do I look 25?  No, but I&#x27;ve been told I look at least ten years younger than I actually am.  I&#x27;ve used half the bottle, so we&#x27;ll see what further changes occur after I&#x27;ve used the serum for a bit longer.  My only con would be that though the dropper is useful to deliver the serum to my face, it often does not completely empty (i.e., there is some serum I can see in the dropper that has not made its way to my face), but overall the product meets my expectations.  So much so, that I&#x27;ll be ordering another bottle when I&#x27;m through with this one.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple other products from Oz Naturals and loved them but I must admit, I was a little hesitant to put something on my face with the words &amp;#34;hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of my fear, admittedly is ignorance about what it actually is. I just know I don&#x27;t associate the word acid with skincare! Before trying this, I did a little reading on all the product information first to learn more about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATURAL &amp; ORGANIC hyaluronic acid serum is considered to be the highest quality HA serum on the market.&lt;br /&gt;CLINICAL STRENGTH anti aging, anti wrinkle serum (no cream) is proven to plump skin &amp; fill in those fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;THIS HYALURONIC ACID SERUM is guaranteed to give you that dewy, moisture boost needed to achieve that youthful glow &amp; is proven to reduce skin&#x27;s fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;CRUELTY FREE, vegan hyaluronic acid serum does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types - This hyaluronic acid serum for your face is an extremely effective anti aging, anti wrinkle treatment.&lt;br /&gt;MADE IN THE USA in a state of the art FDA registered facility - OZ Naturals formulates the most effective anti aging products on the market - OZ Naturals products work &amp; they work extremely well - This HA serum will provide your skin a more youthful appearance upon 1st use - We guarantee you&#x27;ll get results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well now that doesn&#x27;t sound bad does it? I still proceeded with caution and used these recommended guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it every other day for a week, then worked up to every day and now twice a day. I didn&#x27;t see a huge drastic change but I have noticed a difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. When my face gets too thin, all my wrinkles show so I like that this plumps the skin naturally which decreases the look of the little lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a dropper included and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I used one dropper per use and then followed up with my regular moisturizer as recommended. My skin does feel moisturized and not at all greasy. At first I was using on it&#x27;s own before I realized you were supposed to use with a moisturizer and I think that was actually drying my skin a bit because it just felt tighter. When all else fails, read the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Hyaluoronic Acid is easy on my skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines. I&#x27;m hoping for even better results after using for a full thirty days!ly. I used one dropper per use and then followed up with my regular moisturizer as recommended.

    <li> This is my second bottle of this product.  The thing I love about it is my skin feels softer and smoother after adding it to my O.Z. routine.  I have a small scar on my chin from a surgery and I am seeing it beginning to fill in.  I use this with the O.Z. Sea Infused face lotion in the morning and they work very well together.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my mother&#x27;s skin, especially in the cold winter. She has always found her skin very dry in the winter, and this serum helps to combat dryness! Her moisturizer absorbs a lot nicer too!!</li>
    <li> Did not do what it claims, did not notice any more moisturizer skin.</li>
    <li> This really works well</li>
    <li> Plumps skin and helps with hydration. I use it with moisturizer . Not greasy absorbs quickly, use day and night. It helps does not cure wrinkles, I don&#x27;t think any cream or serum does it. Skin looks fresher.</li>
    <li> Second time purchased, can&#x27;t go without.</li>
    <li> I am in love with Oz Naturals product line. Everything I have received is amazing! I love serums, and this, by far, is my favorite. I like to apply it as soon as I get out of the shower. It goes on smoothly and leaves my face very soft. Not oily at all. I love the fact that it has a shelf life of 2 years!! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> Pleased with results...but for a serum it was kinda watery...ordered two bottles....one came 1/2 empty...grrrr</li>
    <li> so far  so good..only used it a few days...</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and my skin was better using my other stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum and is a must have of all the serums out there to use!  This is my second bottle and it has truly made a difference in my skin.  I am in the 60+ crowd so I am especially pleased that aside from being an exceptional moisture boost, the lines that were forming are all but gone and my skin is very smooth.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!  Love this that it is natural.  Feels great going on your face.</li>
    <li> I used twice a day, everyday, and did see some improvement on texture and softness of skin. The major change was the area under the eyes: no puffiness in the morning at all!! It has very good consistency (not too liquid that will drop all over before reaching your fingertip), absorbs fast and has no scent. I&#x27;m sorry I decided to try another brand, will definitely go back to this one.</li>
    <li> Just as they said it would be... On time, The price was reasonable. Not sure if I will order again because I am not sure the product itself is helpful. However, if you want to try. I would order it from them.</li>
    <li> I just received my order a few days ago and I am already in love with how it makes my skin feel/appear. Currently being at work, I can&#x27;t wait to get home to clean my face and apply the serum. The serum is also light enough to wear under makeup and does not leave a layer like peel after it dries. All in all, I will be stocking up on this serum and will be informing my friends and family about this amazing product!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that much improvement.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! The serum goes on smooth and there is no sticky feeling.  This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again ! I have already noticed a big difference! A+&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I need more time with this one also.  It also itches and is very drying.  I&#x27;ve stopped using it and will try again later.</li>
    <li> This serum gave immediate results.  The first time I used it, my skin plumped and smoothed itself out as if injected with &#x27;youth&#x27; itself!  How many products can show very visible results the first time used??  Honestly, I think it is something inherent about the ingredient hyaluronic because I used another serum several months ago (can&#x27;t remember the name of it) which did the same thing.  Either way, whatever the reason, it delivered.</li>
    <li> This is a popular  product evidently as when I ordered it the product was on back order. Because of weather conditions the company was unable to get the product to me on the date I expected an ran over by 2 weeks. They couldn&#x27;t help it one of those things we can&#x27;t control the weather. Because I was patient they refunded my purchase price and shipping. Most companies might not do that? I have used the product for two days and notice it has made the fine lines above my top lip plumper and less noticeable. I am 60 so I don&#x27;t expect miracles no one should but this seems to help matters. Put your primer on then this and light mineral make up and I see a difference and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I have paid much higher for other products that didn&#x27;t do a thing. I like dealing with companies with good customer service and this company went up and beyond for me. I will give them more of my business for sure.</li>
    <li> I had to wait a little bit for this product due to its high demand but wow was it worth it !! I have only been using product for a few days but the results were pretty much instant.  Having work at Macys cosmetic counters I was able to try the latest and greatest from several lines, but this product literally blows them out of the water! I am so happy I found this product and can guarantee that I will continue using it.  Many thanks to Oz Naturals to putting out such a wonderful product and for unbelievable customer service  ... God bless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana M Devlin</li>
    <li> So I was reading about the acid that is in this.  I went with this brand because, frankly, it was on Amazon.  I use it at night along with my Obagi lotion and even though I have only been doing it for a handful of days, I can already see results.  I haven&#x27;t tried doing it in the morning too yet as I think I may need to build up some acceptance to it.</li>
    <li> This is nice on the skin.  Choose this because of the high rating.  It is a little drying to the skin but a moisturizer takes care&lt;br /&gt;or that.  Will definitely reorder again.</li>
    <li> Hmmm.... it works.... KINDA. I waited to write my review, the full month as the instructions suggest it takes a full month to see maximum results and they suggest you slowly start using, like once every other day and work towards using daily. Also you are instructed to use a moisturize after you apply the serum, so it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint if it&#x27;s the actual serum. I do suggest you read the follow up email from the company that gives you tips and suggestions. I know all skin types are different and product work differently for people but this didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked in the sense it definitely brighten and evened out my skin tone. However I purchased in the hopes of reducing fine lines and preventing wrinkles which this did not do :( My fines lines are still as fine as before, there is no change at all so I doubt it would help me with wrinkles like the company suggest. As for anti aging I would have to say no... yes it does brighten and even the skin tone but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize, if it doesn&#x27;t moisturize I don&#x27;t understand how it helps preventing wrinkles. My pores not a problem but no change with my pores. I&#x27;m lucky acne was never really an issue for me but once in a while my chin has minor break out with new products and this was one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little does go a long way so the bottle might seem small but you will get a TON of use. I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s serum as the email instructions stress to use a moisturizer directly after as the serum is meant to pull the moisturizer in. Make sure you use the moisturizer after or the serum leaves an almost tacky feel. I would say this product at best is a toner as it does brighten the skin up. I still use the product ask me if I would purchase again I would say no, I&#x27;ll keep researching for another product.</li>
    <li> From the description I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a blend rather than pure hyaluronic acid/vitamin c. So I was disappointed. Not bad per se but I have no idea how much actual hyaluronic is in the blend and it just isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this when used with OZ naturals Facial Mosturizer.  Help my skin look younger</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals has done it again! I have feel absolutely in love with this hyaluronic acid serum. Many brands have very low quality hyaluronic acid  included in their products so you are spending a ton of money and not seeing any results. I immediately started seeing results in my skin after trying this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a derma stamp pen that I use biweekly and decided to try out this new serum. My old serum did ok, but the results never lasted like they should especially after using a derma stamp pen to really get the serum to penetrate. After using this wonderful serum my skin stayed plumped, smooth and hydrated for 3x&#x27;s as long. My skin is also glowing and I am starting to see fine lines around my eyes fade out. I am very impressed and actually threw my old bottle away. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy so I can apply makeup after this serum dries with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> I used two bottles and didn&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A BOTTLE OF GOLD FOR SKIN!! makes mature skin look like age 20!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I actually see any changes/improvements</li>
    <li> REALLY  WORKS !! Nothing  more to say.  LOVE AMAZON ordered a 2 ND bottle.💙💚💛💜💗💟</li>
    <li> I felt an improvement in the hydration of my skin immediately after the first use of this product. After two weeks of twice daily use, I notice a substantial improvement in evenness, and smoothness, with fewer and less noticeable fine lines. The elasticity of my face seems to be improving as the collagen regenerates. I have paired this product with a skin roller which I use three times a week after cleansing. I also use an additional moisturizer during the day, and a night cream before bed on top of the HA. I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
    <li> Oz naturals my facial friend!!!!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Been using it for a month and my skin looks better than ever and I&#x27;m nearing 60. Truly impressed. My daughter keeps commenting on how tight my skin looks. Where can I get a 55 gallon drum of it? My cynicism towards all skincare products is over. Finally.</li>
    <li> So far I am pleased with this product. I have used it for 1 1/2 months and do feel that I see an improved texture of my skin. I really need to use the whole bottle before giving a final recommendation but so far I am pleased!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. In just a week I notice the reduction of wrinkles in my forehead. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After using the product for about a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the tone/moisture level on my face. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The product acid hyaluronic is very nice, this serum hidrating my skin and I give 5 stars for my purchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems ok. Feels good on the skin.  Will give it credit as the last bottle of Hyaluronic Acid I purchased was a scam product and was super diluted. This feels like the real deal.  Just a little difficult to get out of the squirter sometimes.  Will I buy again&lt;br /&gt;?  Maybe.</li>
    <li> A good product I will buy again, although it did not seem to last that long. Still a great price.</li>
    <li> I really like this on my face as it feels good and goes on smoothly.  I wear moisturizer over it and am most happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few months since November and now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels often dry even with moisturiser on. I can tell it&#x27;s dry when my makeup doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as before and would often cake up. So I decided to try this serum from OZ Naturals as it was within my budget. And I&#x27;m so glad I did. I wouldn&#x27;t say it did wonders to my skin but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as tight as before. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago, I use it before my face oils and have noticed it does help, however I don&#x27;t plan on buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make enough difference to justify the purchase</li>
    <li> There are a lot of products claiming to help your skin and some are over three hundred dollars. This feels nice and I feel better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for the past 6 weeks, I apply it after cleansing and toning, and after i have applied the oz naturals vitamin c serum first. Within the time i have been using it my skin not only feels better, but looks better, my skin has radiance, and my fine lines have been dramatically reduced, many people have said &amp;#34;how well&amp;#34; i look. I have tried many lotions and potions over the years, some expensive, some not so, but this is the only product i have used that you can see an improvement almost immediately, i have no hesitation in reccomending this product, i only wish i found this years ago !!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I used it the same day I received it. I have an oily t zone and dry, sensitive, and flaky skin around my mouth. This serum dries very quickly and does not leave any residue or sticky feeling. I apply my moisturizing creme right away and it leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 days but I noticed right away that my laugh lines and wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyebrows are not as noticeable. I&#x27;ve used other serums and they do not come close to this one!!!!!</li>
    <li> Its good, used for about 3 weeks and saw very little improvement.</li>
    <li> One of those products your like well... I think I like it. I don&#x27;t know. Honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it is breaking me out or not. It makes your skin tight it cannot be worn alone must have moisture immediately on top of serum. Do not Purchase if you have dry skin it will just make you even drier and you&#x27;ll have to try and cake on moisturizer. But it can be worn under makeup if your face can balance its formula.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping.  Have been using various products for a long time and don&#x27;t know which ones are working.</li>
    <li> Just the best ever. Made my skin more youthful with one application, even my friends commented on my youthful glow.</li>
    <li> My wife found this product amazing for her skin type. I hope you have this product in stock at all times</li>
    <li> AUGUST 2016 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased 4+ bottles of this serum since originally trying over a year ago. I&#x27;m updating my review to 5 stars because I&#x27;ve found that consistency is key. My skin looks fantastic now! I no longer have dry patches and my skin is super smooth and supple. I receive compliments nearly every day. Really like that OZ Naturals also backs up their products and promptly responds to questions. Customer service alone is worth a 5 star rating!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;This is a great serum for a mild moisture boost. I have combination skin that&#x27;s felt a little drier than normal lately. My usual moisturizer and serum were superb in general but needed something extra for severe dry patches. I still have dry patches using this. Doubling up on my moisturizer helps.</li>
    <li> I like this serum. It&#x27;s lightweight, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve noticed the fine laugh lines around my eyes have softened and my skin looks and feels softer and smoother. I love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s alcohol and paraben free. I&#x27;m excited to see future results. I have received this product for a reduced price for my fair and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Bought it for myself and ended up giving it to my mom. Bought another one for myself because this will renew and refresh your skin! It is recommended because it&#x27;ll be effective for all skin types and ages!</li>
    <li> This product does not perform miracles, but I do see an improvement in my complexion after using it for about a month. I would also rate the seller very high as the order was delivered quickly and the communication from the seller was excellent! I will be reordering this product again.  You need very little product each time you use it, so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to friend. Met expectations.  My skin is youthful for my age 65 and wish I had started several years ago.  I will continue to use. Application is easy. Do see improvement of skin smoothness</li>
    <li> My skin gets very smooth after using this product. It sinks in the skin so natural.&lt;br /&gt;First bottle has gone and just purchasing next one. I want to continue to see how it would work on my brow line.</li>
    <li> This serum plumps up my skin nicely and I use it after I tone, but before I moisturize.  All that I need is about two or three drops and it goes on smoothly.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> WOW ....Really is brightening &amp; tightening my skin !!  Such AN AWESOME LOW PRICE TOO !!!! I&#x27;ve even told my family &amp; friends about the Wonderful effects it has done for my skin !!!  People Can NOT Believe that I am 66 yrs. Young !!!  &#x3D;  )</li>
    <li> When 2,000 people rate a product, it must mean thousands of&lt;br /&gt;folks have purchased it.  I have been using OZ Naturals Hyaluronic&lt;br /&gt;Acid for a long time, probably before most discovered it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m over the 65 year mark, and I want to shout it loudly and clearly,&lt;br /&gt; my skin looks amazing.  It is rare that a product does what it claims&lt;br /&gt; to do, but beyond a doubt, OZ naturals Hyaluronic Acid does that and&lt;br /&gt;more.  It claims it is the best hyaluronic acid available...I agree.  I just&lt;br /&gt; purchased a new bottle...both my daughters use it as well.  All I hope&lt;br /&gt;is this company keeps on producing great products.</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  It dries quickly and not sticky at all.  I wear this under my normal moisturizer and my skin looks better now than it did ten years ago.</li>
    <li> So far like the product a lot.  Using it with other hyaluronic moisturizers/serum products from my business.</li>
    <li> I did not see any results with this. My skin did not feel nice, or look nicer after using this</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this as I really like the Oz Vit. C serum. This serum, however, made my eyelids red, bumpy, and flakey (and while I put it around my eyes, I don&#x27;t put it directly on my lids). It took several weeks to clear up completely after I stopped using it. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I saw better results with my Lemongrass Spa products. Hoped to have better results as reported in the reviews. I suppose not all skin types are the same.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. Leaves my skin glowing and ready to absorb moisturizer. No noticeable scent, no irritation. I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> Works great for me hope others like it as much as myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now but not really noticed anything different.Spend a little more for the better one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hyaluronic acid since 2005 and have tried a dozen or more&lt;br /&gt;brands.  I&#x27;m here to say this stuff from OZ is by far the best and most&lt;br /&gt;effective I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s more than I was paying for hyaluronic before&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.  At least this one does what it says&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using this product a short time there is a visual difference in my skin,&lt;br /&gt;notably around those laugh lines that extend out for the face and across my cheekbones. The lines seem&lt;br /&gt;to be less noticeable, perhaps my skin is more puffed up from retaining moisture provided by my face cream.&lt;br /&gt;I use the product twice a day, and apply a good skin cream directly afterwards. There is a tingling sensation,&lt;br /&gt;and a slight burning which only lasts a few minutes, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable. I might have an allergy&lt;br /&gt;to this product, or  maybe I am using it too frequently, or maybe the Micro Needle Roller I use prior to&lt;br /&gt;Oz has recently caused a faint rash to appear. Although I can barely see it I can feel it. I am going&lt;br /&gt;to continue using the product without the Micro Needle Roller to see if the rash goes away in a few days.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! This is my second bottle And i will continue to buy!😃</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.  Have only been using it for 3 weeks, and there is a huge difference in my skin.  Well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This serum really helps. I live in a dry climate and the winter air is hard on my skin. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference since using this. It really draws your moisturizer deep in to your skin so it can work better. Follow the directions and you&#x27;ll love the results. I saw comments about it making your skin drier, but that&#x27;s because moisturizer wasn&#x27;t put on right after this serum.</li>
    <li> Okay, even some men[me] does like to take care of their skin. Okay, I someone like a woman when it comes to wanting to hold of the aging process as much as possible. Well I, like most woman, has spend a lot of money of products that are WORTHLESS. For once in my life I can say my skin after the first night, seem so much better. It&#x27;s only been a few days, and I can tell u what exactly it has done other than I&#x27;m looking good lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I tired this some time ago. Since this is my first serum, other than a on big name brand that didn&#x27;t work, I want to purchase more serums this one, and others with different ingredients. THIS GOT MY ATTENTION.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because it was recommended o use with the vitamin c, so far so good, I use avery night after apply the vitamin c</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best but it seems to be working nicely on my face.  Fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> First day of use,  but I really like the weightlessness of serums and this one makes my skin feel like silk.  I use bare minerals make up products and I spent less time applying and I actually had to double check that it was blended even and smoother.  and was even more pleased when I took off my Make up that night and I used significantly less than usual.  So I&#x27;ll be keeping this product.  Jury still out on the lotion.  But if u like serums as opposed to creams (even ur considering a change or addition) look no further.  I was very happy with the L&#x27;Oreal and olay products I had,  and although I look 10 years younger than I am, I have done research on hyaluronic acid and take it for my back and this serum seemed to, on the first day mind you, gave me the results sold exclusivily on infomercials three times the cost. I can say if 2maro I get the same results,  I will be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I was so anxious to receive this product.  I started 3/17/14 and today is 4/2/14 - the same lines are there on forehead, cheeks, mouth lines and the ever slight hairpin lines around my eyes - and the bags are in the same place.  Total waste of money.  I am so sick of reading 5 STAR reviews on inferior products.  This stuff stinks!!!  I purchased a 10X magnified mirror so I am SEEING these ungodly wrinkles and believe me they ARE there and all the daily &amp; nightly applications, after cleansing face and waiting 10 minutes before applying my moisterizer, yup 10 minutes not five minutes.  This is my 17th day of this meticulous operation. It does work girls and I don&#x27;t understand what is wrong with these people and the five (5) star reviews.  What are they all blind?  Get a magnifying mirror, girls.  Point being if expensive Serums are selling for over $100.00 and some of them don&#x27;t work - what in God&#x27;s heaven should we expect from a Cheap Serum.</li>
    <li> I love it...you really have to be careful to use just a touch over my usual quality cream. Especially as the season warms, i have learned that a teeny lil bit goes a very long way. :) I use it on my entire face area, forehead, under eyes, cheeks, jaw, and neck. :) Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Great combo of hyaloronic acid and vit c. Great for when you travel only one small bottle</li>
    <li> Very good for my skin. I use it daily and I see a better tone to my skin and lines diminishing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week now.  I like the precision applicator.  It&#x27;s moisturizing, but haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference on the fine lines yet.  It leaves a light tingling sensation right after application, but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with irritation and my skin is usually very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Use this twice per day. Seems to work good. Good price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results. However, their customer service and follow up was spot on, Even if it was a bot, they followed up.</li>
    <li> I took the advice from the seller, not to start out using this everyday.  I am really pleased with my skin, I am in my 70&#x27;s and got without makeup at times now because my skin is very healthy looking, shining.  I look great, which makes me feel great.</li>
    <li> I have seen little or no improvement to skin.  I will say that my skin is not as dry. Red spots are appearing on face.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use this product because of the the world &amp;#34;Acid&amp;#34; but after further research and reading the reviews I figured I would give it a try and i was pleasantly surprised! I am a skincare lover and this has been added to my nightly regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/OZ-Naturals-Hyaluronic-Satisfaction-GUARANTEED/dp/B00C7DYBX0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428716684&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;oz+naturals</li>
    <li> Amazing product with amazing results! LOved It and will be puchasing more in the near future!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best serum I&#x27;ve used. It smooths my wrinkles, makes my skin baby soft and young again. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love their products!</li>
    <li> This face serum is great. I could tell a difference the next day,and everday thereafter was an improvement.I dont want too be without this. Keep in stock. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I have been using it for two weeks and I see no improvement. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s been two weeks and we both are starting to see minor improvements. Lines appear to be getting lighter. Let&#x27;s see how things look after a month!</li>
    <li> I am 63 years young and I&#x27;ve probably tried quite a few facial toning products as of this date. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is okay, but I did not &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; wrinkles vanishing in one week&#x27;s time. These wrinkles take years to develop and nothing is going to make them go away in one week&#x27;s time. I will probably finish the bottle, but won&#x27;t be buying anymore. Thank you for your interest.</li>
    <li> I am still on the fence with this product. After using it for about 3 days I started to break out really bad. I am still trying to figure out if it was my hormones or this serum.</li>
    <li> Great product. Heard great things.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference yet, but it is a good price for trying new stuff, hope it helps my skin somehow eventually.</li>
    <li> using it daily,some results noted</li>
    <li> HI Amazon,  I realy like the product, I will buy it more in a few days, many thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I use hyaluronic acide serum twice everyday . It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth . This product is great  for my skin !</li>
    <li> Great product. I will offer it again.</li>
    <li> The serum slides on very smoothly and thinly, it seems to be water based.  I leave it on for a few minutes right out of the shower or after cleansing my face at night .  It takes a couple of minutes to dry, but then when it does, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as uncomfortably tight as other serums have.  Then, I slide some moisturizer on over the serum, after it has dried .  I am really looking forward to seeing the results in the coming weeks, so far, my face looks fresh and nice, I am liking this serum a lot, thanks.</li>
    <li> As usual with Dr Oz recommended products I found it to be overpriced, over-hyped, and had mediocre results.</li>
    <li> This all natural facial serum is non greasy, quick drying and long lasting. It has the perfect ingredients for most skin types. I found it to add a special soft feel/texture to the facial skin. I always allow it to be absorbed before an application of moisturizer. This step is followed by an spf product daytime and regular moisturizer before bed. In the past I have used seperate serums for morning and night looking for inclussive results. This serum I use am and pm. I agreed that I would honestly give my opinion of this product when I accepted it without charge. I exceeded the trial period a bit, but wanted to give a fair trial. So, while I&#x27;ve been applying for a bit over a month I&#x27;ve been impressed with the results since week one. Recently I had surgery and missed the twice daily application for 5 days. On the 6th day I could feel a slight difference, not see. The smooth texture was just a bit less velvety. Was the change from serum or moisturizer withdrawl? Just thought I&#x27;d mention because after only 30 days use the change from 5 days of not using was slight. The manufacturer has fairly represented the product and I used as directed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference.  Maybe not for me.</li>
    <li> everything was great with purchase</li>
    <li> Trust me when I say this.... your face should be a little damp while applying this. The point of hyaluronic serum is that it can carry way more than its own weight of water, so if your freshly cleansed face has traces of water still on it apply the serum immediately. Do not completely dry your face and you won&#x27;t regret it. It definitely enhanced a already great product. Always apply a non comedogenic moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Loved it &amp; am about to order some more.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum in less than week I have felt difference in my skin will definetely use it for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and see no difference in my skin. I will continue through the bottle. But as for a re-order? We&#x27;ll see when we get to the bottom.</li>
    <li> This proved to be the best facial serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  For a change every word I read about it is true.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I can order more.  Sincerely, Ci</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after using the Vitamin C serum Vitamin C cleasner and the Rice Enzyme Dermafoliant. I had been using a VERY expensive Hyalo plasma cream for probably 6 months. What I discovered was the Oz Naturals soaked into my face as opposed to just sitting on top. With these products my skin has never looked better and I am 68! My husband told me I looked pretty one morning and on visiting my daughter she told my how great my skin looked. I have already purchased another hyaluronic acid for fear they will be out when I need it. You owe it to yourself to try these products.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, put it on first thing before any other product,a friend and I each got one. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel, but the claims regarding vitamin C disturbs me. Quality vitamin C products are packaged in brown bottles to protect it from light. This has a clear bottle. It has the great slippery feel of HA.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of change in the wrinkles but will continue to use it.  read all the reviews and decided to try it</li>
    <li> I honestly have not noticed ANY change at all in my skin, however, I will finish out the bottle, maybe it takes a little longer than told</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I really see no difference in my fine lines around my eyes or any other area of my face.  I had expected some sort of tingling in my face after applying it, like some of the other anti-aging creams have, but I felt nothing.  I probably will finish up the bottle because it does make my skin feel soft, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks now and have not experienced any changes in skin tone/texture as other reviewers have claimed.  In addition, the product has &amp;#34;thickened&amp;#34; making it difficult to apply.  I&#x27;m not giving up though.  I will continue to use product twice a day and provide an update.  For now, I&#x27;m only giving a one star rating because I purchased this product based on the number of positive reviews.</li>
    <li> OZ naturals has excellent customer service and a great company.  The CEO Mr. Romero a great guy who is on top of things.  If  or you have any problem with the product whatsoever , they listen and respond promptly.  I can not describe enough how good my experience was with this company.  I would rate the seller my best experience here on Amazon so far and I buy here ALL the time. So thank you for your great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;The product is also awesome.  I know Hyalronic acid and Vit C works great for your skin so it is a great product for the fraction of the price.  I would recommend the product and the seller to anyone who is looking to buy an anti aging serum.  I am not very old and I have started using anti aging serum as a preemptive measure and I would recommend this product for anyone, young and old.</li>
    <li> my skin is ready and so soft still working on those eye wrinkles on forehead wrinkles and smile lines</li>
    <li> I bought this because the reviews were all pretty good on it.  But you know what?  It actually made my face drier than it has been in a long time and now I am doing massive corrective treatments to put moisture back into my skin.</li>
    <li> im very impressed.. im giving this review after a month of use, &amp; i must say, that frown lines have decreased extremly. i wil be trying OZ natural products from now on.</li>
    <li> It is not that great ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 and started noticing small lines around my eyes  months ago. After countless amount of products and money later I decided to really research for a good product. After reading reviews and reasearching many different products I decidrd on giving OZ naturals a try.  Oh wow! Was I impressed. I have been using OZ Naturals serum for 3 months and noticed a change on my lines within a week. Three months later those lines are almost nonexistent.  For les than $20 it&#x27;s a must try. A couple of my close friends have already bought it too!</li>
    <li> The product is nice.  It goes on nice and smooth - it actually has a cooling effect on the skin.  I follow application of the serum with my moisturizer.  My skin has been in good shape, so I can&#x27;t say that the serum has made much of a difference.  I think it mainly gives me peace of mind, knowing that I&#x27;m giving my skin a treat every day!</li>
    <li> I keep offering this product and see a wonderful difference in my skin . There are others on the market that cost much more so be aware and buy Oz!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for the past one week and I love it. I love the fact that it&#x27;s %100 natural because I love anything natural. I will be buying more of this product for sure.</li>
    <li> This seller is AWESOME! Fast delivery and got a follow up email for product info and directions how to use. Can&#x27;t say how much I appreciate the fast delivery as I travel allot and wanted the product with me as I ran out of my other products and wanted to try something new and less expensive. I have only had the product about a week and a half so I can&#x27;t yet say of its effects. However I have not had any bad reactions and I have sensitive skin. I would recommend this seller to anyone who appreciates great customer service and a good product.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to write a review to see how this works. This a great serum. It does the job, really easy to apply. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> The serum arrived not quit .three quarters full. It arrived with a level below the top of the green lettering on the package. I will need to buy a new bottle soon it does not go very far when it is only three quarters full. I feel it helps my skin remain less taunt. If I am only getting three quarters of a bottle it is not worth the money. I would recommend finding another distributor.&lt;br /&gt;Donna</li>
    <li> I was expecting a more serum-feeling product.  You need to massage this product into your face immediately as it dries VERY quickly.  Other than the drying effect, I like this.  I was sold when it said &amp;#34;Potent Anti-Aging Serum.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve not seen any visible difference on my skin, but I have only been using it one-week.  Others rate this highly so I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
    <li> Nourishment for your face and feels so soft. After, I wash my face each night, I pat dry a bit and my serum goes on the damp skin.  Allowing it 3-5 mins. to soak in, I then apply moisturizer.  I have been using for 3 days now and my under eye puffiness and dark circles have diminished. Not to mention, the healthy glow it leaves me with. Very pleased indeed! Great job Oz essentials...</li>
    <li> To begin I have terrible skin I always have,I have red acne scars,blotchiness, breakouts due to hair removal. It has,always been hard for me for my facial skin to look flawless. I have tried many beauty products that have caused me break outs or dried up my skin making it look worse. I wasn’t born with naturally flawless beautiful skin. It is always hard to find products that actually work without causing me more breakouts or soothing my chaotic facial skin. I love love to try new beauty products and I tend to like serums, I feel serums go much deeper into the skin especially when they have natural ingredients that also help my skin look smoother plumped and healthier looking. I was happy to be able to try Oz Naturals 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum.The serum feels weightless on the skin and sinks in immediately. It doesn’t burn or feel sticky on your skin. It’s very soothing and didn’t break my skin out or irritate it. It has a thick consistency which I love only downside is you have to apply it quite fast it does absorb really quickly on to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product’s main function is to “provide intense anti-aging effects, to plump and give skin a more luminous, youthful appearance. It smoothes fine lines and fills wrinkles.” I have found this claim to be true; my skin is super soft after using this serum, and it does indeed feel smooth. As for filling in fine wrinkles I feel that with consistency I will see results. My skin does plump up and my makeup looks flawless which I love and it doesn&#x27;t peel on me when applying moisturizer. I honestly feel this is a top quality serum and I will definitely  purchase once I run out.I did receive this serum for free for testing purposes so that may give my unbiased thoughts and experience.</li>
    <li> Feels like aloe going on. Had to wait a long time to get it due to previous weather conditions in the east. Don&#x27;t know yet if it was worth all the wait--time will tell.</li>
    <li> Loved it and I use it in combination with another serum &amp;#34; BEST Anti Aging Serum - Advanced High Potency Natural Wrinkle control&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;also available on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Will surely buy more once this is over.</li>
    <li> I felt and saw a difference after using this product the first time. My skin felt so soft. I believe that it does help my moisturizer penetrate the skin better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Making a part of my daily routine forever.....has helped with under eye puffiness and bags. This has been a win win for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two days so far but my skin is really soft. I hope it plumps up my skin!</li>
    <li> Not delivering miracle results, but I like it anyway.</li>
    <li> I can tell my skin is more moisturized with this product. The small area of flaky skin on my nose went away shortly after I started using it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.  I am 67 years old and my skin is much softer and my face no longer has dry patches.  It also does a great job on softening my heels and elbows too.</li>
    <li> It is amazing product, pleasant to use, no allergic reaction, just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an anti-age product like that, just a wonderful surprise.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  But I am noticing that it isn&#x27;t as thick as it used to be........and the bottle I received recently was already past the expired date!!  What is going on?</li>
    <li> When I first started using this, I liked the way it felt on my face.  I am now at the bottom of the container and there has been no change in my skin.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Having tried many formulas to battle lines around my mouth and eyes and forehead I find this simple, inexpensive formula works better than any of the more popular publicized serums.  Within a few weeks there has been definite improvement in all those areas.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of the serum and I love it. Helps with my skin brightness and texture. Will order again,</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help my skin look a bit younger. Not really sure it has made a difference. I will use up the bottle but won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
    <li> specialy around the eyes..u use it every nigth and morning under my daily cream..it makes my skin looks brighter, smooth and my under eyes puff is gonne 10 minutes after i put it on!amazing, i will get my next bottle soon.and you just need a drop, it is enough for the whole face!!love it!</li>
    <li> I am using this product  plus the eye gel and the retinol moisturizer from Dr Oz. One month so far and no visible differences yet. I will use this for 3 months and see if I see any difference. So far, I rate this product as okay...</li>
    <li> I have used several products like this and this one is very inferior. Not a well made formula at all.</li>
    <li> I received the Oz naturals Hyaluronic acid and vitamin C serum and was expecting a terrific product. The first time I used it, it just stayed on my skin and when I touched it and ran my fingers over my skin I could feel it roll around on my skin and it came off in little clumps! oh so gross! I would not recommend this product at all. I am sending it back!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see and feel results so quickly! The first day I used it, I felt a slight tingling feeling. Within two weeks my skin feels and looks firmer. I also have rosacea so I have to be extra careful with the products I use. I love that there are only a few(and good) ingredients in the Oz Naturals products. No more having to research 20 or more ingredients on skin care products! (And some of those were a little scary) I&#x27;m in my mid-fifties and am totally impressed with this serum! Looking forward to trying more of their products.</li>
    <li> Having many allergies concerns, I try to use as many natural products as possible.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> WOW.... what amazing product you ll see the different right away. I used it with l&#x27;oreal anti wrinckle cream. you face will look like a mirror. clean, soft, no wrickles</li>
    <li> Easy to use and feels great. I was surprised this is a gel consistency.  OZ Naturals is awesome about explaining how to use this product.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel great</li>
    <li> The inclusion of carrageenan in their laundry list of ingredients is a deal breaker. Research has shown that exposure to carrageenan causes inflammation and contributes to tumor growth. Since the skin is the largest organ of the body, this should be a serious concern. Use this product every day and your body is absorbing carrageenan on a daily basis. If you already have inflammation in your body this will do nothing less than contribute to it. This company raves about their organic ingredients and yet they add carrageenan as a thickener because it&#x27;s cheap. They denigrate their competition and yet none of the other hyaluronic serums sold on Amazon contain carrageenan. Check it out for yourself and then Google the dangers of carrageenan. Do the research and don&#x27;t get hosed by the hyper sales pitch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the sixth month of using this and I am on the second bottle.  I am 69 years ald so the wrinkles were set in places I hated.........around my mouth, furrows in the brows etc.  I am seeing a change but it is very subtle and gradual.  I believe I look about 8 years younger already and I have had many compliments on my skin this summer.  I use it in conjunction with the honey moisturizer suggested. (Era Organics Moisturizer).  I use these at night after I have cleansed my face with cold cream and a steamy cloth.  Be patient, however, it doesn&#x27;t happen over night. Many of my friends have noticed a difference and started using these products.</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for three weeks but I am seeing an improvement in my skin. Will be very happy if it keeps improving.</li>
    <li> This is a good serum. I do feel it tightening my skin. I haven&#x27;t seen any change to my deep wrinkles. My fine lines have improved quite a bit. I like the feel of the serum and it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. In fact I can say the same for  toner and moisturizer. I will certainly buy the products again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I am 43 and I got carded for wine yesterday</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It has made my 47 year old face smooth and even. I also have dark circles. My dark circles are less noticable.</li>
    <li> I have tried every wrinkle cream on the market, expensive, inexpensive etc., I found this Anti Aging Serum on sale on line and ordered a bottle...after 2 weeks people were telling me how good my skin looked! Not only that the wrinkles I had on my forehead are totally invisible and the wrinkles around my eyes are gone...I just ordered more...I would love to share this secret with my friends, however, I want it to  be my secret!!</li>
    <li> Love It! I use it with my Derma Pen.  Great results, Very Happy, Quick Ship!</li>
    <li> Nothing happened, expected a little something</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom to help with her skin.. which has changed with age.. unfortunately she was very unhappy that it didn&#x27;t do what it promised. She wholeheartedly followed the directions .. I felt sad that what I bought failed</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this serum I can feel it&#x27;s working right away. My long search for a good serum/hyaluronic acid has come to an end! I can wear it before my moisturizer and make up or I mix it with my moisturizer or with my moroccan argan oil moisturizer. There is really no wrong way on how you use it. It&#x27;s a little pricey for a small bottle but you wont regret you did!!</li>
    <li> I learned about this product on Dr Oz, and love that it is made with the highest concentration of pharmaceutical Hyaluronic Acid, &amp; is the same that is used in the world&#x27;s most expensive serums. I also like that It is made in the USA !&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i love this serum.  i researched and found that using a hyaluronic acid serum w. a vitamin c cream is a good combination so i searched and found this serum and thought i&#x27;d give it a try and i absolutely loved it.  i found a good vitamin c cream at a local store.  i wear these together at night.</li>
    <li> Use this twice daily. Perhaps it&#x27;s too soon.  No visual positive effects yet.  I will keep trying and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> I initially gave this review a bad rating, because it took a while to get this item.  I want to go back to say this.  Eventhough it took a while to get this, the store stayed in touch with me to assure me that it was on it&#x27;s way.  I received the product and I love the way it feels on my skin.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to share any improvements yet, but I know it is in the works.  Thank you for your honesty OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I received it when I was sick with the flu, but my skin looked amazing within a couple days. I couldn&#x27;t believe the glow and how smooth my skin was after using it a couple days, plus being sick. I have struggled with acne and now I feel like I might have more wrinkles from harsh acne creams, but now I love my skin. I&#x27;m 32 but my skin looks like when I was a teenage without the acne. I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup anymore and I look so healthy. I bought some for my mom because she struggles with adult acne and blotchy skin too. All my dry blotchy skin is smooth and soft now. I love this serum! I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It really helps your face.</li>
    <li> This product really works, when used as directed.  Previously when using moisturizer only, my skin would still be dry, and I would need to reapply moisturizer 2-3 times per day.  I now apply 4 drops of this product on my face before applying my facial moisturizer and I am good for the entire day &amp; night.  This product really helps your skin absorb and hold the moisture... even in the coldest and driest winters. I have not changed moisturizers, but have simply added this to my daily and nightly skin regimen.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. I have three lines across my forehead and this serum really has lessened their depth. I don&#x27;t always get to put it on every day, and still I can see a big difference in a short amount of time. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I thought the price was too good to be true but you get what you pay for SOMETIMES. I wish they had a refund policy for this serum. It caused my skin to breakout. I am very sorry I purchased it. It did not make me skin soft and I saw nothing positive happening to my skin &#x3D;( I would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This caused my skin to break out within 2 uses.  I don&#x27;t consider my skin sensitive, but this definitely irritated it.  Gave to a friend who loves it.  FYI.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly; can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really noticed much improvement in my skin, though.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what all the fuss was about with this product. I&#x27;ve decided either go with a face lift or age with grace. Personally I like the age with grace. Good luck to other users.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product over the last month.  I have had several comments from people I knwo on how young my skin is looking since I started using this product.  I plan on ordering more.  I have been using this product in conjuction with OZ naturals Vitamin C serum.  I will say I can tell that teh wrinkles around my mouth and by my eyes are less noticeable.  I strongly suggest you buy some.  I will tell you that it is not an overnight thing.  It takes a bout a month to see the difference.  Use it both day and night.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand because it costs less than the others.  Note that the info doesn&#x27;t state the percentage of Hyaluronic Acid in this gel, which I failed to notice. That&#x27;s because it seems to be watered down. HA is listed third on the ingredients, meaning HA is not the main ingredient. Aloe vera is. It&#x27;s a nice little ditty of a gel that is soothing to the skin and I guess has some health and/or moisturizing benefits, but I&#x27;m returning to the brand I had before this that clearly states on the bottle 65% HA and clearly has a tightening effect on the skin (the purpose of HA).  I bought this brand because it&#x27;s less expensive than others, but there&#x27;s a reason for that.  Aloe vera, the main ingredient, is pretty cheap. Shame on OZ Naturals for misleading the public by saying it&#x27;s 100% pure HA and that it&#x27;s \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; has no meaning in skin products. 100% pure HA doesn&#x27;t mean it has 100% HA...it just means the form of HA it uses is \\&quot;pure,\\&quot; which I&#x27;m not sure what they mean by that. Organic, maybe? I&#x27;ve used it a week and see no difference in my skin, as opposed to my prior brand, where I could tell a difference in skin firmness almost immediately. I&#x27;ll give this more time and use it up, since I&#x27;ve paid for it. I should add that if you are not that old but just want a little lift, this may work fine for you. But I&#x27;m getting older and need the strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/4/2015: I ran across this product again when searching for something else. I notice that they changed their main description at the top. While it used to say the product was 100% Hyaluronic Acid (which was misleading since it gave the impression the liquid gel contains only HA), it has now removed that description at the top and added further down the page that the gel is \\&quot;with 100% HA,\\&quot; which is more accurate. They&#x27;ve also added to the main description at the top of the page that it contains other substances, like Vitamins C&amp;E, which makes it clear that the liquid is not 100% HA.</li>
    <li> Anti tampering seal did not break when I removed the cap. I noticed the cap easily came off and wrnt back on without ripping the seal, which means the contents could have been altered. Here are some photos.&lt;br /&gt;http://1drv.ms/1CG3Zop</li>
    <li> My wife really likes it</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle and I see a difference in my skin. It is smoother and less wrinkles and fine lines around the eyes. L</li>
    <li> Frustrated :((&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 items&lt;br /&gt;Using them all diligently.&lt;br /&gt;No change in anything so far :(&lt;br /&gt;How many months (?) do we need to use these products? To notice a difference?&lt;br /&gt;Also, in researching I read Hyaluronic molecules are just too large to penetrate skin??&lt;br /&gt;I honestly thought when I saw this it was OZ as in Dr.OZ&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone name a company OZ unless they wanted that effect (of people possibly thinking it is Dr.OZ?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t care if these had worked.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to wonder about integrity of anything if you&#x27;ll use a name to possibly mislead.&lt;br /&gt;Just my 2 cents</li>
    <li> Applied this stuff twice a day for 2 weeks and never saw anything!!!!</li>
    <li> Stay away burned my skin. Tock a week to clear up . Gave me a nasty rash. I&#x27;m sure all the good reviews are from the seller . I&#x27;m considering reporting to FDA</li>
    <li> it help my aperance  my face  looks very good</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel soft, but it didn&#x27;t smooth any fine lines.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference using this versus over the counter O&#x27;lay moisturizer.  I would save your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Been using daily for several weeks and it&#x27;s definately brightening several dark areas I have on my face. It&#x27;s not moisturizing at all when used alone so I always use a separate moisturizer as instructed.  Will buy again when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping-great product</li>
    <li> Just finished the bottle. I bought this for one reason only: to enhance the effects of the acne creams i was using. And it worked!! It really did! Aaaand i&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is so much more moiturized. It&#x27;s not 5* because it didnt blow my expectations out if the water. I think that there&#x27;s something better out there... I just need to find it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I even us it on the back of my hands and they, too look and feel younger.  It was worth the try.  I am ordering it now regularly.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I look younger and my face is radiant and glows!!!</li>
    <li> After using this for a week, my skin is definitely more smooth and the little &amp;#34;training wrinkles&amp;#34; that were forming on my forehead are pretty much gone. My one complaint is that it does have a pretty strong scent. The smell dissipates quickly but, if you&#x27;re like me and bothered by anything scented, you might be a little bugged by it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t affect me. My skin looks better now. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Has already made a noticable difference in wrinkles and in uneveness on my face. Product isnt sticky or thick. Works well!</li>
    <li> used it for few weeks  but looks like the product is diluted and didn&#x27;t work at all.Shouldn&#x27;t have ordered 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> Not sure What I expected but no miracles</li>
    <li> This serum leaves my skin very soft and I like the feel.  No noticeable difference on the wrinkles</li>
    <li> I discovered hyaluronic acid and initially used creams containing it. My wife told me she had pure hyaluronic acid in Hong Kong and how she liked it. I ordered another brand of pure liquid and somehow that brand failed to live up to expectations. So when I started looking again I wanted a quality product. This says it&#x27;s better than cheap brands. True. This is thick and luxurious. One drop massaged under the eye works wonders. Vitamin C seemed an excellent addition. My real surprise was how fast you see improvement. My wife gets some very high quality products from Hong Kong which I think may be of Swiss origin which work better than anything I&#x27;ve seen on my eyes. This product is on par if not better, which is to say nothing short of amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month and results are scant - maybe a tiny bit less wrinkles. I am not going to purchase it again if I don&#x27;t see some significant progress by the time I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! I have been using this for about a month and found out after a few nights I was using easy mote product than I needed to. Not quite a dime size will be more than enough for your face and neck. I can see a difference already.</li>
    <li> Let me make it clear that I have not bought this product and therefore have no idea or care whether this stuff works. I don&#x27;t care if people have wrinkles or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many of the comments about this product because I had no clue Amazon was tainted by scams. By scam, I mean that all of these raving reviews are a bit sketchy if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the most relevant thing I wanted to point out. This product reeked of being a scam upon reading through the reviews. Not the negative reviews, which already made me question the product, but the responses to the negative reviews by some Craig guy who says he is the cofounder. His responses were so ridiculous, I was enjoying reading them. Highly entertaining stuff! Here are a few that I found particularly immature and hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Like many Amazon customers I check out the reviews written by the customers who have tried a product to see what they say. As I read the reviews written on this product I found it disturbing to see so many that were written by “unverified purchases”. I noticed few from yesterday and quite a few from the March 4th. I want to read feedback from someone who has tried the product, not an unverified source. I feel like I’m being tricked..&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Craig, whose name on Amazon is CR, says this in response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hey james, all of our reviews come from real users of our products and 99% of them I see are from verified purchases. Our products are also sold at spas and retail stores. We also give out our products in gift bags and other promotional events. These customers of course will not show as verified purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do we take great offense to your completely false and inaccurate assumption, but I&#x27;m sure all the customers who&#x27;ve taken the time to post their reviews take offense too. It&#x27;s not fair for you to simply assume our reviews are fake simple because some of the customers didn&#x27;t buy our product on Amazon. You&#x27;re essentially calling our customers liars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly request you revise your completely false accusation....By the way, your &amp;#34;Review&amp;#34; which really isn&#x27;t a review...is also NOT an Amazon Verified Purchase. Your comment does absolutely nothing to help the Amazon community. In fact we have reason to believe that you&#x27;re simply an angry competitor attempting to compete with OZ Naturals...Well, Good luck...you&#x27;ll need a lot more than posting negative accusations. OZ Naturals clearly provides the highest quality, best selling anti aging serums on Amazon and your comment here will do nothing to slow the growth of this company AND your review will soon be buried by real reviews left by real customers who benefit from our products. Essentially, it was a waste of your time.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, he says this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What do you mean how&#x27;s the serum working for me? I&#x27;m actually the co-founder of the company so I get paid A LOT and because the brand is so successful I&#x27;m actually able to spend my time answering questions and comments if I choose to do so. I have that luxury :)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was laughing audibly at this point. Last but not least though, is a delightfully stupid reply to a bad review from a reviewer called &amp;#34;leila&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;it&#x27;s so funny how some people wait until their face all wrinkled then they start using serums and creams...and they expect the product to work for them wight away..ha ha ha...if you really care about your beauty..you should of started using anti wrinkle creams and serums when your 27 years old not when your 46....I have been using antiwrinkles creams when I was 25 now i&#x27;m 37 and every one thinks i&#x27;m just 27. by the way this serum works great and i&#x27;m just getting ready to buy another bottle&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lovely comment is given a response by our professional acting &amp;#34;cofounder,&amp;#34; Craig:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Agreed &amp; Thank you Leila!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arethe most immature comments I have ever heard coming from a business person! Know that if you buy this product, you will be putting money into this guys already filled pockets considering that he is &amp;#34;paid A LOT.&amp;#34; Hahahaha!! Hope this comment was mildly entertaining!</li>
    <li> Easy enough to use and the results show right awayl Can&#x27;t ask for more. However, are these permanent results? Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am using the product and it seems to work as stated. I have only used it for a couple of weeks and I hope to see additional results.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SERUM FOR ONLY 4 DAYS AND IT REALLY IS HELPING MY SKIN! IT FEELS FULLER AND THE SKIN NO LONGER FEELS SO THIN ...I HAVE SENSITIVE AND COMBINATION SKIN WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD GET IRRITATED WITH THIS,BUT NO! I CAN EVEN USE IT AROUND MY EYES WITH NO DISCOMFORT ...THAT IS SHOCKING BECAUSE AT LEAST 75% OF EYE CREAMS I HAVE TRIED HAS GIVEN ME A BAD REACTION....BURNING ,STINGING,WATERY EYES.FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT IS GENTLE AND WORKS FOR MY SKIN!!!!!ITS BEEN WEEKS NOW.....I AM HOOKED HYALURONIC ACID IS THE WAY TO GO FOR GREAT YOUTHFUL SKIN. TWO DAYS LATER AS I WOKE UP,STILL GROGGY MY FACE FELT DIFFERENT. I TOUCHED MY FACE STILL IN THE DARK ,AND THOUGHT IT FEELS FULLER .....LIKE IT HAS A BIT MORE CHUSION AND YOUNGER!...WELL I HAD TO GET UP AND SEE IF THERE WAS DIFFERENCE... THE LINES AROUND MY EYES SEEMED LIGHTER AND MY SKIN TEXTURE ALSO IMPROVED....I WAS TOLD I LOOK ABOUT 35 YRS OLD AND I AM ALMOST 50....IS THIS POSSIBLE ? YES.....EXFOLIATE YOUR SKIN AT LEAST 3 TO 4 TIMES A WEEK. DRINK AT LEAST 8 GLASSES OF WATER,EXCERCISE 3 TO 4 TIMES A WEEK. ALWAYS USE SUNSCREEN EVEN IN WINTER AND TAKE A MULTIVITAMIN AND FISH OIL WILL ALSO IMPROVE YOUR SKIN APPREANCE.</li>
    <li> Really great serum! I have both that one as well as the vitamin C one from the same company. I love how natural that product is. After using it the skin absorbs the cream so well.</li>
    <li> Another great product for OZ Naturals... My skin feels amazing. So soft and clear. Will buy again and again..&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for an HONEST review.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday sometimes twice a day and my skin is responding very well.  My skin is soft and plump! !</li>
    <li> This is such a great product both me and my mom used it and both of us loved it! It helps my mom&#x27;s wrinkles fade away little by little!</li>
    <li> This OZ Natural has been the best thing I have ever put on my face..the serum makes my skin feel so smooth and soft, it has helped eliminate wrinkle around my eyes,and that is eliminating a lot since I am 63 next month and made me feel fabulous..thank you for letting me find your great product ... of course it was my sister that suggested this product..I thank her also..</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best thing I have used - and I have tried almost everything out there. I was very self-conscious about a deep set wrinkle just below my lips and after using this product for just a couple of weeks, it is barely noticeable. I would definitely purchase this again - BY THE CASE!!!!!</li>
    <li> This really makes a difference. I use it after a exfoliation and it makes your skin plump and vibrant. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is stuff is garbage. I mean G.a.r.b.a.g.e. As far as I am concern is not real authentic stuff. It&#x27;s watery and doesn&#x27;t do anything for your face. NONE! Please save your money and look something that&#x27;s been around for awhile with good reputation. I literally threw this stuff after a while cause I was worried what it actually contained. Who knows what they putting in these jars anymore!! Be careful what you purchase online these days.</li>
    <li> I am using the serum, until  now every thing is well, but is to soon to evaluate the results. Later i will comment how worked for me. I recommend for the dry skin and I hope give me an hidratant effect.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum. I bought this with the Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and I actually saw results rather quickly. I replaced my lotions with serum and my skin transformed. It was very easily absorbed and my skin had a dewy, natural, soft look to it. It works really well under make-up and I know most people do not like to put any products right under the eyes, it really did under my eyes.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out but so far every time I&#x27;ve used this product I have more wrinkles than before I used it and so I apply Garnier Nutrisse wrinkle remover.....I&#x27;m not understanding it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> whole bottle used didn&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have never been a fan of gooey and greasy face lotions. This product is light weight, but provides high moister to skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very much helped my dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed did not notice changes,  I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product ....My dermatologist asked what I was using on my face and I told her the ingredients in this product ...She said they were the very best to use on the face</li>
    <li> IS A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT IF YOU BUY IT AND EXCEPT TO SEE DRASTIC CHANGES IN 1-2 WEEKS, ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  I THINK CONSISTENCY AND PATIENCE ARE KEY ELEMENTS FOR SUCCESS.</li>
    <li> Reduced some wrinkles</li>
    <li> This really balances out my skin!</li>
    <li> The Sony Clock was awful. I was verry happy to find Hyaluronic acid as I have been using it for 2 years and it helps with wrinkles.  Ann M. Giorgi</li>
    <li> Works well. Can feel increased tautness in my skin , especially around my eyes and throat areas. I can see a definite improvement in skin wrinkles and my wife agrees. I will try for another 4 weeks to see if it improves even further</li>
    <li> Had hope for this product. Just not impressed. Would not buy again. Maybe i am looking for too much but this does not feel like it is doing anything when I put it on. Call me crazy but i like a little tingling or just something. Have seen no change after a month of using.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, very effective.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very fast shipping....</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it!!</li>
    <li> This is another product from OZ Naturals that I tried and absolutely love.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this line.  It is budget friendly and products are pure and natural.  Usually the products are 90-100% natural and over 80% organic.  I like products that don&#x27;t contain any unecessary additives.  The Hyalauronic serum is wonderful!  It&#x27;s a thicker consistency but spreads nicely on your skin and once dry doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or stick feeling.  The skin is supple and plump and just continues to improve with use over time.  I apply this product in the AM and PM and then wait a few minutes and apply moisturizer over the top.  My skin looks great and I&#x27;ve not experienced any redness, irritation or break outs using the product or any other product from OZ Naturals.  This is a wonderful line that I&#x27;d highly recommend for all skin types.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted - perfect - purchased many</li>
    <li> I started using this product in conjunction with a derma-roller. It was nice and light, coated evenly, absorbed quickly, just as a serum should. Now I can&#x27;t tell yet whether or not it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my wrinkles, but it feels great after the derma-rolling sessions, and it does seem to help with the absorption of my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the thickness of the serum increases with use, partly because each time you open the bottle it becomes slightly more dehydrated, and the thicker it is, the harder it is to get out when you are nearing the end of the bottle. Wish there was a better way to dispense than the dropper system.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Absorbs easily. would buy again.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this! I have extremely extremely dry skin. I was a little apprehensive at first, but after a week I have noticed a HUGE difference. I put it on my face before my nighttime skincare routine and it helps my moisturizer sink in faster and soak in better. I don&#x27;t know the science behind it, but I will absolutely re-purchace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent it to review via Brand Backer, but all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> not sure it&#x27;s any better than any of the rest...price point is good, so what the heck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OZ Hyaluronic acid serum for a year now, it&#x27;s like an instant face life, works well on tired eyes.  I&#x27;m 57 yrs. old and like the results.&lt;br /&gt;I order 2 bottles at a time!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t start my day without it....I use it with Vit C Serum for an added boost.  I&#x27;m over 60 and have great skin.  Thanks OZ Naturals!!</li>
    <li> I do use this every night after toner before moisturizer. In the beginning I could tell a difference. My skin felt smoother..I&#x27;ve got acne scars and still get the occasional breakout, but it seemed to smooth it out more. After a few weeks, I noticed the serum doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse but doesn&#x27;t really make it better, either. Good for the price, but I&#x27;m sure another kind of hyaluronic acid serum would do the same.</li>
    <li> In few words.  I notice the difference in a week and I now swear by this product.  It&#x27;s not overly price which I love and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR 6 MONTHS.. I USE IT WITH OTHER SKIN CREAMS .... SO  I CANT GIVE AN ACCURATE REPORT</li>
    <li> using facial serum daily for the last 6 months or longer it smells and feels nice but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant difference in my skin since I started using this product.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just love this little miricle in a bottle what a difference it has made skin feels refreshed puffy eyes have gone will def be buying more</li>
    <li> This serum works wonders!! It makes my skin look like I get weekly facials!! I really love this stuff. I am scared to tell everyone because I am afraid this product won&#x27;t be available if everyone knows about it.  This makes your skin smooth and I have seen less wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes.  It even makes the little bunny wrinkles you get from sleeping smooth out.  I love this stuff and from here on out will never go without it.  I even got my sister hooked.  Great product!!! Great price!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product I use it every day. I am 59 and had developed deep lines at the corners of my mouth. Using the hyaluronic acid serum every day for a month now those lines are almost gone, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I plan on buying more of this serum.</li>
    <li> I have spent tons of money on anti-aging products.  Most recently, meaningful beauty and murad.  I - like most people - want results fast.  That is exactly what I got with this product.  I was amazed at how fast it works!  I have super sensitive skin and I  had no problems at all with this serum.  I noticed a big difference in my face but where I saw the most improvement was my neck.  Now that was an absolute shock.  I thought that the turkey neck thing was permanent.  Anyway, I will not purchase another product except this one as this is the best on the market for anti-aging.  I use it once or twice a day and other people are starting to notice the difference.  And, instead of 15 different products to use, now I have ONE.  THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My 18 year old daughter is using it now too because she notices a big difference in her acne.</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle but I can already see a difference in my skin.  My marionette lines are almost gone!  I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a couple of days but have seen a major difference in my skin already. My husband, greeting me at the front door yesterday morning actually said, &amp;#34;you look younger&amp;#34;! That is all I had to hear. SOLD!!  Also I was with my sister yesterday and she said that my skin looked fantastic and asked what I was using. I told her that is was OZ Naturals and sent her the link to purchase. I&#x27;ve always had really good skin for my age but this serum works better than so many of the department store brands out there including some of the biggest names in highlighted in New Beautify Magazine and sold in Sephora and Ulta. Please dont stop making this serum!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain amazon has the best products this thing is miracle it works great on any skin type 100% worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent, exactly as described! Very well packed!</li>
    <li> I have been loving this hyaluronic acid serum. It goes on so smoothly and sinks in really quickly. I always apply a moisturizer on top of it because I have dry skin so I feel this helps boost anything I put on top of it. It really makes my skin glow and I feel with continued use my skin is going to be in the best condition it has ever been in. I also like to add a tiny bit of this to my foundation to give my skin a healthy,dewy glow. This product has not irritated my skin or caused any breakouts. It feels very gentle so I think it would be suitable for any skin type. The dropper seems to really help to not dispense too much product so you aren&#x27;t wasting it. I love that this products is all natural and cruelty free. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m expecting too much; after all, there is NO miracle cure for wrinkles.  But quite honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin since using this product.  I do, however, like the feel of it when I rub it onto my skin.  I get a slight tingly sensation, so I anticipate there will be a magic transformation!!  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll order it again.  I&#x27;m experimenting with using it along with various moisturizers.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll land on a good combination.</li>
    <li> Since using this product for the past two months, I have had people remark on my face. I highly recommend this product.  It helps with dark spots, small wrinkles, and brightens your skin all at the same time.</li>
    <li> I had no issues with the product when using and it seemed to work well for hydration. Not sure about the vitamin c however because it is a clear bottle and vitamin c is destroyed by light.</li>
    <li> Love how this serum makes my skin feel. I almost feel like I don&#x27;t need to wear a moisturizer on top because it works so well.  It&#x27;s thicker than a liquid but not TOO thick. Love the feel of this serum!</li>
    <li> I am still trying it to see if there is any help. I&#x27;ll finish it and then judge it&#x27;s help or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for only 7 days and I can already see my skin becoming smoother and fine lines and the wrinkles around my eyes smoothing away nicely. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite facial serum it feels sooth on the skin don&#x27;t burn don&#x27;t irritate the skin&lt;br /&gt;But you can definitely see results and feel how it transform your skin definitely great love this would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very hydrating</li>
    <li> I used to spend loads of money on estee lauder over night recovery serum, because when i woke up in the morning, my skin was nice and plump. i have acne prone, t zone oily skin, and it helped with that as well.  well i research and found out the main active ingredient was hyaluronic acid since its hypertonic solution therefore plumps the skin and draws moisture in, therefore i found this and started saving money, and use it in combination with other high end and drug store products. I will be getting my second bottle soon</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals are great quality product which really are amazing for your skin and I was mostly impressed by the costumer service they provide which is really rare  :)</li>
    <li> I am writing this review before I&#x27;ve even had a chance to use the product.  It&#x27;s based on my awesome experience with the company&#x27;s CEO, after my order was delayed.  I ordered the product a couple of weeks ago.  I am on the move right now, saying farewells to friends and family, due to an upcoming move overseas.  I had the order shipped to a friends house, anticipating that I would be there during the shipment time.  I received an email (as did other customers), from Craig Romero CEO of the company, several days later, which was an apology for delayed shipping of the product.  I knew that I would be gone by the time the shipment came, so I wrote an email to Craig.  I actually expected a generic response back - but got a personal email back right away, from Craig.  He personally posted a bottle to my next stop over!  And did it at no charge :) It came today and I can&#x27;t wait to start using it!  GREAT SERVICE CRAIG!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 7 weeks and the results are Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it daily, I&#x27;m not that consistent.&lt;br /&gt;The results: firmness overall, clear and even tone, and YES less ugly wrinkles ( in my neck, since I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around the eyes). And all this for under $20.&lt;br /&gt;Will I recommend the product: yes, to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The outcome: 50 yr old skin went to 40 yr old Face and 35 yr old Neck&lt;br /&gt;The user: 50 yr old Female looking 50 before the serum, now....:)</li>
    <li> I cant review the product itself as I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  I was upset for not receiving the product which was beyond the control of OZ&lt;br /&gt;Naturals.  They have set everything right and I highly recommend  using this company.  I will  order products from them again in the near future. Thank you Natural Oz</li>
    <li> So far it is well worth it. Time will tell. I am sure after a month or so I will notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Use this w/ micro rollover to reduce fine lines. Works great and good price! Skin is so soft and fine lines have reduced on my forehead</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product.  It feels good going on and is a rich consistency, but I don&#x27;t see much improvement.  I have only had the product for about 2 weeks so hopefully I will see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I just got this product today and I already applied it to my face. I am using it before I put my moisturizer.  It has left my skin softer and tighter. I hope I see my skin looking better in a month or two. But as far as right now I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Must take a long time to work.  No real results so far.</li>
    <li> can really rate how product work because i could not use it as it arrived with the  seal broken.  i returned for refund.  thanks.</li>
    <li> This is like straight aloe vera you find in the sun block section at the drug store. It just sits on my skin. When I wash my face at night I feel like it just gets moist again and slimy and washes off... not at all what I was expecting for hyaluronic acid or vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> I had ordered a similar serum from a different vendor on Amazon but did not feel it was making much of a difference so decided to try a different brand. I  read very favorable reviews about this product and  I agree wholeheartedly with the other purchasers. The product feels good on the face and seems to really be making a difference in my level moisturization. I use this daily and in conjunction with my micro needling roller as I heard this helps product to be absorbed into the skin. Of course I do not use the roller on a daily basis, only 1-2x per wk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to add that there was a small shipping issue with this product and when I sent an inquiry to the vendor regarding the order I am pleased to say they responded back almost immediately. They apologized profusely for the problem and immediately refunded my money even though the product has already been shipped and was just arriving late. I will definitely purchase again from the seller.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and I love the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I notice if I put makeup over it, it balls up on the face.  Maybe because it wasn&#x27;t completely absorbed or&lt;br /&gt;maybe that&#x27;s the way it is.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t use it with makeup.</li>
    <li> I have just received this product and did know some flaking immediately. The customer service was great. I will continue using and update my review it does make my skin feel and look great</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet,but I will still use it.  Sometimes it takes  a little longer to work.  I will let you know later after I finish this bottle.  If it works I will surely order more.</li>
    <li> I am 45 and don&#x27;t have a lot of deep wrinkles but have some annoying around eye, eyelid and smile lines.  I gave this a shot for $20 and was amazed.  After one week I can&#x27;t even find the lines I was trying to fix.  The lines practically disappear! My makeup looks better and pictures of me already show an improvement! I am using a good moisturizer about 10 minutes after applying like the directions suggests.  I am shocked and pleased at this little find.  I plan to NEVER be out of this miracle stuff.</li>
    <li> Have used twice a day for almost a month hand have seen no improvement. Very disappointed in product. Will not re-order!</li>
    <li> Two people have asked me what I&#x27;m doing with my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my fine lines have disappeared and the deeper ones are much better too.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly and I&#x27;m ready for my moisturizer. Big pay-off for very little trouble.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this and am very happy with it.  After only using it a short time people started telling me how good I looked.  I was hearing words like vibrant, healthy, amazing, radiant.  I&#x27;m 55 years old and have never been one to use much on my face. This is really worth using.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to redness/dryness on my cheeks. This did not irritate my skin whatsoever and ultimately had a cooling, soothing effect. The hydration has really helped with the dryness and to calm the redness in the cheek area.  I have also noticed an improvement in the fine smile lines beginning around the nose to mouth area. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use it together with the Oz Naturals Anti Aging Moisturizer. I noticed a change in my face, neck and decolte after 3 days! and after a week, my skin looked  younger, smooth shiny and glowing. It realy reduced the Signs Of Aging.</li>
    <li> Terrible!  I don&#x27;t know how this is suppose to feel but the area I applied the serum to felt tight, dry and tacky even though I follwed it with the sea kelp lotion.  Don&#x27;t like this at all!!!  Need to return.</li>
    <li> I liked very much, thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for a few weeks now. WOW ! I will continue to use these and recomend them to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> expected more from using 3 bottles of this. I do not see any changes. ;But will try a few more times</li>
    <li> used it one night after washed and dried skin.  Let it dry before using moisturizer and when I woke up, and after my skin&#x27;s long dry spell, it was as if I&#x27;d been sleeping for 20 years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty certain that some of the rave reviews for this product were planted by the people who sell it.  I have been using it for 2 months and there is absolutely no change in my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My nemesis is dry skin,  This little bottle surprised me. I thought on first application it was too sticky and gummy.  But after it dried and I put my moisture cream on it worked so well with the combination.</li>
    <li> This serum makes my skin so smooth and gives it a nice &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; if you will. I will definitely be buying this product again and strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it did a thing for my skin. It actually made my skin feel dried out. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. I saw a difference  in 10-12 days in my skin. Take a chance and try it.</li>
    <li> I use this serum followed with a basic facial moisturizing lotion as a part of my daily facial cleansing and moisturizing routine when I wake up, this stuff hydrates my skin better than any stand alone lotion I have used and it lasts until I rinse my face before bed. I have been using this Hyaluronic acid serum for about 3 months now and I have not experienced any adverse effects like clogging of pores, acne, etc. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin and has a hard time finding lotions that last all day. It&#x27;s an excellent product with an affordable price so I can continue to justify replenishing my supply.</li>
    <li> I  STARTED  USING  FEW  DAYS  AGO  BUT  I  ALREADY  FEEL  MY  SKIN  SMOOTHER  THAN  BEFORE  AND  I  BELIEVE  IT  WILL  WORK.  YOU  CAN  REALLY  FEEL  YOUR  SKIN  NICE  AND  FRESH</li>
    <li> I really do like this product. I can see results already.</li>
    <li> This serum has been awesome for me has seen a change since I have been using it.  Love it thanks oznaturals</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my grandmother. She loves it and swears it has done wonders for her. Used in conjunction with the vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I wanted to try it because my skin has been very dry under the eyes and the eye lids. I noticed a difference in my skin after only one application of this product. Now that its been almost two weeks, my skin is bright and glowing, I&#x27;ve even noticed less break outs. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin. AND it&#x27;s cruelty free! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals is one of the best...works well with my sensitive skin.  Will continue buy OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money, i didnt see any changes or fixes with any fine lines and arrived extemely late</li>
    <li> Ladies and men - forget about spending your money on all those other over rated and over the moon products.  This works.  I have been using it for over a month and I began seeing the difference within a few days.  I am a beautiful 63 years young and darling I can tell you when something works and is worth your time and money - look no further because Dr. Oz hit the nail on the head with this one!!!</li>
    <li> I am a brown skin Lady , I purchased this product some time ago i want to say I can&#x27;t leave home with out it ,this stuff is the bomb&lt;br /&gt;it really make my face glow I use it then I use my moisturerizer once I leave my home my face is glowing beautifully and the glow last all day  it&#x27;s great i will be buying another bottle (PLEASE NEVER STOP SELLING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hyaluronic Acid serum for almost a week now and I must say that my skin feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be perfectly honest my skin is fairly young, I am 27, and I have taken care of my skin. I thought that my skin was already quite soft until this came along and now it’s even more so, which I didn’t think was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of freckles and I have been trying to use a cream which helps to fade freckles and also contains an SPF, something within that cream was upsetting my skin and making it prone to itchy and dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product as a base it feels like the other cream is being absorbed better into my skin rather than just sitting on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great because it’s allowing me to use a cream that I would otherwise stay well away from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m really happy with this product and will definitely be a returning customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very viscous and easy to apply, it gives a great deal of hydration however it’s not greasy. It really is the perfect consistency and is a terrific beauty buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powered by BrandBacker</li>
    <li> Did not like it doesn&#x27;t help in anyway. I can buy something from a drugstore that&lt;br /&gt;Works better. Did not like the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using about three weeks.  I like the way my skin feels.  Having said that, I&#x27;ve not noticed much difference in how it looks, but I will continue to use it, giving it a fair chance.</li>
    <li> i use it at night on my skin..love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using the vitamin c  serum from this same company. This serum is slightly thicker and has a slight buy very nice fragrance. It goes on smooth then just seems to disappear into my skin. I love the results as i have not been kind to my skin considering the various methods of tanning i have subjected it to over many years. I cant say this serum has done wondrous things.....yet, as i have only just received it, but if it works as well as the vitamin c serum that i use at night i (i use this in the morning) i will make an addendum to this post. For now, i can say that after using the serum and following with a moisturizer in the morning, by bedtime my face does not feel dried out even if i have been outside, as it has before. So far, i really like it and recommend it. (I am 61 but few believe it)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. The dropper doesn&#x27;t work that well, and it&#x27;s very thick. I added some filtered water to make it easier to spread.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t do any thinks. feel like rose sugar water. don&#x27;t do any thinks. feel like rose sugar wdon&#x27;t do any thinks. feel like rose sugar vater.  ater.</li>
    <li> I have been using pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum &amp; from the reviews &amp; esthetician said use Vit C also. Thought this would get both with one e.bottle.  I feel it is thick &amp; too heavy. Better results with pure HC acid. Better value 2 oz bottle, vs 1 oz of this one.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m Asian, but this product made me break out.. I was using another product &amp; I was doing so good, until I saw the ad from Dr. Oz, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Unfortunately, did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great item!  Quickly absorbs into your skin and you can apply any kind of moisturizer over the serum.  Feels great.  No weird smells.  It really helps with dryness, especially when you put a good lotion over it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of product before and expected better results and a product that wouldn&#x27;t be harsh on my skin. I have sensitive skin and when I used this product with my sensitive skin moisturizer my face turned bright red where both products were applied. It does &#x27;tighten&#x27; the area where the serum is applied but it is not the best that I have used. I would not recommend it to anyone who has any type of sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> Skin looks and feels great after use. Followed with your favorite face or body lotion, this product helps deliver your lotions strength to its highest ability. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that would help with my skin as I grow older. I found this serum to be the best out of many that I have tired. I noticed a difference after the first application. I will definitely order it again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I think I notice the tiny lines around my eyes are fading away. It makes my skin softer and more supple!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product but never recieved it. So I purchased it from a store.  I jst love it!  Works great</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 1 month now. The texture of my skin has noticeably improved, pores look smaller. No change noted in wrinkles, however, it took me 64 years to get these wrinkles, so as I said no real change in wrinkles. Would definitely buy this product again since I do see significant improvement in my skin in general. Have not given up hope for improvement in the wrinkles with continued use,but even without that perk, I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the results from products from OZ Naturals.  I have noticed improvement in the elasticity of my checks.</li>
    <li> Love love love !!! Met every expectation I had. I am young 20&#x27;s and wanted to start treating my skin good, this couldn&#x27;t be better! Will order again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is good. It immediately tightened my face. Only had it 2 weeks. Will update a little later. I am already buying a back up for later. Thank you...</li>
    <li> I can&lt;br /&gt;t say that its as good as some other products I have used that were cheaper...will not purchase again...and I am not looking for a miracle...just a good serum for after shower face do...</li>
    <li> It felt good on my skin but I didn&#x27;t notice any change. It was fun to use. It might work for you.</li>
    <li> Had few problems wth my order , the sellel e mailed me said it was the weather I can relate to that refunded my&lt;br /&gt;Shipplng  it has not put me of I like the product and will order it again and will recomend it .thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now. Since my skin seems to be in good condition, it&#x27;s hard to tell if this is doing anything additional. I do like the way it feels and I use it around my eyes with my Clarisonic Opal massager. I would most likely purchase it a second time, since the company did not charge me due to delay in shipping.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals Serum works well in our dry climate. Combined with moisturizer at night it is making a visible difference in my skin. I will definitely keep using it .</li>
    <li> Bought after watching a dr. show. Seems to be working. I see a difference in fine lines, hope it continues</li>
    <li> OMG this serum works miracles especially when applied after a Derma Roller session. It leaves your skin soft, plump and very glowing for days.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Good quality to be used as a base. It gives a feeling of firmness to the skin. It gets absorbed in seconds and allows you to apply your moisturizer as a second layer.</li>
    <li> I could not tell that it did much.  It worked like any hand cream would work on your face.  Pass on this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! Brightens my face a lot and it gives me a healthy looking glow.</li>
    <li> works great on ageing lines.. husband thought I was trying to change for a younger spouse. No it works great</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  It&#x27;s thick enough to stay on the skin and is very moisturizing.  Purchased an extra as a gift for my sister.</li>
    <li> I ike this product, I feel like around my eyes look healthier and are softer however, I dont see any difference in my fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff , it made my skin feel and look great , I&#x27;ve noticed that those lines on the side of my face are much less noticeable</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I used. Still not sure if it works as good as it advertised! Skin seems smoother and wrinkle not as obvious but that&#x27;s it. Just slight improvement. I guess it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Improvements can be noticed after the first week. I do not need anything else on my skin. It absorbs perfectly and my skin looks hydrated and smooth. I use it in my chest. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> tried for well over a month and did not have any noticeable change or improvement to skin quality, wrinkles, etc.</li>
    <li> I repurchase this any time I run out. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the first thing I use in my skin care regime both morning and night, and I love the way it works with everything else. Leaves skin firm, yet soft. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> What a waste....and this is a Dr. Oz product?.  It is sad to think that this is marketed for anything other than a hydrating liquid.  Stay out of the sun and use a sensible product like sun screen.</li>
    <li> I took a photo of my face before I started using the Serum and I love the results.  My skin is much brighter.  I have tried other serums but they didn&#x27;t change anything so, I&#x27;ll stick with Oz Naturals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and I am seeing great results.  Good price and great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over three weeks &amp; haven&#x27; t seen results yet, maybe, I should wait longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it years ago.  I noticed an immediate overnight change in the texture of my skin, it was smoother, my pores were smaller.  I am very fair, never tan and have sensitive skin.  I even use it on my neck, ears, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and the back of my aging hands. Of course that means I use it up faster but its affordable!  I am now well into my 2nd month of using it. There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking.  It does not sting or burn.  I used the entire bottle and was so pleased, I have now bought an additional 3 bottles because it sells out fast. Ladies, give this a try before you buy something more expensive. I am 64! The deep lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin and I swear the deep wrinkles on my forehead have softened.  Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried. Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it. I estimated 1 bottle lasted me a month.  OZ Naturals is first rate, their customer service is flawless, they respond promptly, keep you informed and strive to keep you coming back.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product, makes my skin feel smooth and healthy.  It&#x27;s not the ONLY product I use, but it&#x27;s a great tool for complete skin care, especially on aging skin.  I&#x27;ve have gone through 3 bottles, now on my 4th.  I also think it&#x27;s reasonably priced, especially considering how long they last even with regular usage.</li>
    <li> I did monitor the progress by taking selfies everyday and this product did seem to reduce lines, I was happy with it, now is just to see if it lasts or if it is a temporary fill in</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!!  This serum has done a good job of plumping up my skin and softening my few lines &amp; wrinkles. It absorbs well and moisturizers easily go over.  My skin is sensitive but no problems with this product. I&#x27;m finishing my 2nd bottle and keep a spare so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Gently firms facial skin,  Don&#x27;t expect to look 30 again, but it does soften even deeper wrinkles.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try any anti-aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;I was very reluctant to use any products until I found this. Its works great on my skin and I apply it just once in the night.&lt;br /&gt;Its not having loads of unwanted chemicals and has many organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions as stated to get the result as promised by the product. This is my 1st bottle and have just used for couple of weeks but it looks promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this product by the manufacturer to review, and the opinions in the review are my own</li>
    <li> Made skin so DRY that no cream could help. Waste of my money!  Still trying to recover from the applications.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after learning that Doctors do hyaluronic acid and vitaminC injections as alternative to Botox.&lt;br /&gt;So i started to look for this combination in a cream and i found this serum.....great staff!!  i had fine lines around my mouth and  I noticed that change after one week of using it....i always use it now before my moisturizing .</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician. This is my all time favorite product. I use it on each and every one of my clients and it works well with every skin type! I use this twice daily as well. I love it so much that it has become my go to gift for everyone in my life and each and every person I&#x27;ve given it to is eternally grateful!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other manufacturers before and had high hopes for this product.  Unfortunately, from the title of my review, I saw no changes.  I tried morning only for a week and then graduated to morning and night.  Nada.  Seriously... no change at all.&lt;br /&gt;I realize others have had  MAGNIFICENT, STELLAR, OUT OF THIS WORLD results.  I am delighted for them.  :)  Don&#x27;t know unless you try something ... sometimes..</li>
    <li> great product.  just wish it was in an airtight amber bottle as many of the ingredients are unstable when exposed to light and air.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to wait weeks to post a review, the OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Serum gets a thumbs up from me and I will continue to use. I have very dry sensitive skin, and being over 50 and diabetic, I have found that my skin is becoming increasingly sensitive. So what I&#x27;m looking for in products are either, unscented or lightly scented that dissipates quickly. In serums I prefer the ones with thicker consistency, those that apply smoothly, and especially those that don&#x27;t sting, or burns, or gives me rashes - the OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Serum is a check on these categories and the added bonus is the affordability and the fact that it is a natural product. Oz Naturals seem to work very well with my other skincare products (department store brands) and for this reason, I have no problems continuing using this product.  I will definitely highly recommend this product to friends and family and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other products in the line especially the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me..I read the reviews on Amazon. I decided to try. I am sure I will be able to write a good review. So far I like this product. I think the lines are disappearing....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and have not really noticed any results.  I will continue to use it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Very good for your skin.  Soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the change it has made in my face  Have order it again and just love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while.  It  makes my son dry and peel. So you have to use a lot of moisturizer. Not a good thing to use before an event the next day.  Leaves the skin feeling dry. Im continue to use it to see more results..</li>
    <li> So this proove to me that all the pictures advertised with this product and any other serum or cream, are photoshoped.&lt;br /&gt;it might be a good one and i&#x27;m still using it but my problem is the amazing results i&#x27;ve been promised.&lt;br /&gt;WHERE IS IT.????</li>
    <li> You can see the difference immediately.  Like it!</li>
    <li> I used as directed and I&#x27;m sad to say that this product dried out my skin.  Would like to return.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product. I use it with a retin A product and it leaves even my deep winkles much softer and less deep. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really have not seen any changes to my skin the way the reviews have calmed but I&#x27;ll give it couple of weeks more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - I use it tandem with my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Product for review Brand backer OZ Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum Review – cost $16.45 – It’s ok.  I have to use a moisturizer or serum on top of it to make it seem not so drying.  I didn’t break out from it’s use.  I will not be repurchasing.  It did help and make my skin soft so I could recommend it.  You can find a video review on U Tube under the user name ravercat4.</li>
    <li> My sister and I have been using this for four months and the difference in our skin is amazing.  This product has no chemicals in it and is as pure as it gets.  There definitely are cheaper Hyalauronic acids out there, but you get what you pay for.  This is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I think I see a small improvement in lines and wrinkles....perhaps I am expecting too much for a senior such as myself.  Have not finished the first bottle yet, at the end of that time I&#x27;ll decide if it&#x27;s worth the effort and money.</li>
    <li> I am happy I bought this my skin feels amazing. My fore head has finer and smaller wrinkles to .</li>
    <li> I use only a very small amount of this product in the morning under my moisture and the results are immediate. Can&#x27;t believe it, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this one is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that does exactly what it says. Wish that I had taken &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pictures!</li>
    <li> Bought this with the cream and use them together. Probably the best results I&#x27;ve ever gotten from face creams.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product by the company to review! I have used it for over two months and I really like it. If your looking for a product that will give you a boost of moisture, than this is for you!! My favorite ingredient in this serum is Hyaluronic Acid and do not get put off by the word acid. It is an ingredient that s high in moisture content and is why this serum is very hydrating. But what I like the most is that it dose no leave me skin greasy at all. The serum absorbs really nicely into the skin and feels very smooth and silky. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It has a great affect temporarily when applied. It plumps skin when it&#x27;s on, but if it&#x27;s not on I notice no change in wrinkles after a month.</li>
    <li> I am giving it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it that long  but what I&#x27;ve seen so far I like!</li>
    <li> For my skin, this is actually seems to be working. I tried the Watts brand first, and that one was like water and did nothing. Oz is definitely more like a serum, yet absorbs quickly. I have very dry sensitive skin, 45yo, fair skin. This past winter was brutal on my face and my face was literally peeling. It may be a coincidence due to the improved weather, but I really think this Oz is helping. (continued to peel on Watts). A little goes a long way--I use twice a day on face,under eye, and neck and then Neutrogena Natural moisturizer. It should be noted that I tried CeraVue and Cetaphil creams without relief either. ( something in the CeraVue made my face red/burn)</li>
    <li> This tiny bottle is packed full of what I refer to as a magic potion.  It feels great on the skin, absorbs nicely, and the effects overnight are noticeable.  For the price, it is a great value.  I will be reordering.  I just wish the bottle was slightly larger.</li>
    <li> My skin did not take well to this product, I will wait and try this product again, it is clean and fresh smelling.</li>
    <li> Really like the product, gives a nice tone to my face</li>
    <li> Please with the product.</li>
    <li> just amazing ,in few seconds ,you&#x27;ll see the difference. my friends and relatives din&#x27;t believe me, they were amazed to see my skin glowing and smooth, dispite I&#x27;m in mid age ,my face looks so much younger and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;you also have to use the toner and the moisturizer</li>
    <li> Meh, didn&#x27;t see a difference or felt extra moisturized. Lasted barely a month. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 2 weeks now.  It is excellent and almost immediately, I could tell the difference.  I have sensitive skin and it is very soothing and gentle.</li>
    <li> I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after one day of use. It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. I apply it and a moisturizer. I won&#x27;t go with out it in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome! See results in a couple of days. I gave it four stars because you have to use it everyday. When you stopping using the product you will see visible wrinkles again.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Feels very silky on the skin. Very good ingredients too. will continue to use it</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see the results that I thought I would</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 10 days into using this...did not start using it right away.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased.  I am almost 71, dry skin, some wrinkles on cheeks, due mainly to youthful scarring from acne that, in my late 60s, wrinkles settled into the little pocket scars.  I do believe that some of my finer lines are diminished and that this product is beginning to lessen the wrinkles on my cheeks.  My &#x27;jowls&#x27; either side of my mouth and chin have slightly (just slightly) improved...I&#x27;m hoping for more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product sort of stings at first, but not very much...no discomfort at all.  A little goes a long way....just a light slick rubbed in is all that is needed, NOT a whole dropper full of product.  Avoid eyes, and right away, I apply moisturizer cream.  I am using only at night...so perhaps I now need to increase to morning and night and I&#x27;ll see faster improvement.  One improvement I definitely notice is that little, hard white bumps...a bit like a pimple but really a white head deposit that I sometimes get either side of my nose down to almost my lips...these tiny pin-head size white bumps are going away.  It has to be this product. In the past, I&#x27;ve had a dermatologist remove an annoying spot or two, or after months, sometimes the deposit will rub off. They  form where in my youth I was very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL continue to use this product, no matter what other products for moisturizing that I choose to use.</li>
    <li> First let me stipulate that I am an Oz Naturals skin-care consumer and not only have tried almost every product in the line, I use most of their products every day and some of them both in the morning and in the evening as part of my nightly skin-care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two products that initiated my appreciation of the Oz Naturals line is their Vitamin C 20% Amino Blend Hyaluronic Acid Serum, with the yellow square on the bottle and the second product is the Hyaluronic Acid Vitamin C, with a green square on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reached my sixties, and for the past, few months have started a rigorous and aggressive nightly procedure of derma rolling.  When I have finished with this procedure, my face is red, raw and my skin is extremely sensitive.  First, I apply the Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum and it does NOT sting.  This was the only Vitamin C serum that had not irritated my face after this procedure, most likely because the others used alcohol content, whereas Oz Naturals uses Witch Hazel, which is not irritating on my skin.  After I have let the serum absorb for a moment or two and I feel the effect of a slight tightening, I then apply the Hyaluronic Acid.  The Hyaluronic Acid is a little thicker than the serum and it actually feels somewhat soothing to my raw skin.  Again, no sting at all.  I wait a moment or two for the Hyaluronic Acid to be completely absorbed and I can actually notice that the dry, raw skin is a little less red, and just a little plumped out.  Then I proceed to my nightly moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in the morning that I get the pleasant surprise.  Overnight, my face has completely healed and the skin looks a little plumper and healthier.  I was not getting the same positive results before I started using Oz Naturals.  The morning results are definitely visible and I am positively thrilled that there is no irritation considering the abusive and aggressive nature that I am enduring with the derma rolling five nights a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both of these Oz Natural products, as a regular maintenance, for those who have sensitive skin issues, and for those of us who are going through any skin care treatments.  These products are gentle to the skin, and give positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ends my review of Oz Natural products - Hyaluronic Acid, however, for those who are just starting to learn about skin care maintenance, I have provided a brief synopsis of the benefits, functions, and the results of Hyaluronic Acid in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid for Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is an important natural component of skin produced by fibroblast skin cells, which decreases as we age.  Skin starts losing hyaluronic acid as early as age 18, but wrinkles and other skin damage from hyaluronic acid loss generally do not show up until we are in our late 30s or early 40s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid, also known as HA, is a natural compound found in skin that has many important functions; including holding in moisture, providing cushioning, aiding in tissue repair, holding together the skin structural components collagen and elastin, and helping create a protective barrier against microorganisms.  The topical HA product is considered effective at moisturizing surface skin cells, which prevents water loss and protects the skin from dirt and other pollutants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing - Since hyaluronic acid holds moisture well--holding up to 1,000 times its weight in water--it functions not only to deliver water to the skin, but also to hold it there.  As a large molecule, it does not permeate deep into the skin, but instead stays near the surface where it moisturizes the skin&#x27;s outer surface layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles - The loss of natural hyaluronic acid is one of the causes of wrinkles, so the idea of putting HA back into the skin to repair wrinkles makes sense.  Since topical HA cannot penetrate to deeper layers, the moisturizing effects will only last a fewdays.  Repeated use will maintain moisture levels in the skin, preventing skin dehydration.  Hyaluronic acid is useful for reducing or removing wrinkles.  By reducing wrinkles, hyaluronic acid does help to produce healthier skin, restoring skin tone, for a smooth and supple young and healthier look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope that this review and/or the general information has been informative, because skin care can be a little confusing in the functions of each product, so hopefully this has been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE;  6/06/14  HELPFUL TIP&lt;br /&gt;I live in the desert, the climate is so dry with almost no humidity.  Keeping moisturized is a challenge here and we know that dry skin is very prone to wrinkles.  Anyway, I recently purchased a humidifier for my bedroom, which is where I spend 8-10 hours from evening to morning.  It has made a substantial difference in my skin, in the range of about 15% - 20%, a little different each day.  So, if you reside in a relatively dry and low humidity area, try using a humidifier, the benefits of skin care products are improved.days.

    <li> I am not so sure about reducing wrinkles, but my skin seems much nicer after using with the Revitol.&lt;br /&gt;Together it makes a bit of an improvement.</li>
    <li> Love it - will order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought hyaluronic acid before but I truly think this is the best.I noticed a slight change in my fine lines immediately and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week.I&#x27;ll continue using this product from Oz because I see results and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Well i used it for about only 2 months only, so i can&#x27;t say exactly what it did to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but It did feel good, refreshing. I am thinking of getting another one ( or this time with vitamin C or something) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as an essence after toner, and it feels like it&#x27;s tightening because it&#x27;s a bit sticky..? i guess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i should use it for a longer time. anyways it&#x27;s not bad overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and really, really like it.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC!  After about 5 days you will notice the amazing change.  Your skin will look young and small (even big) wrinkles will start to fade.  A miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try but will let you once I do. Again, if it does what it says it will, thats good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on the face and is working fine&lt;br /&gt;I think that this is a good base for moisturizer I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one bottle of this stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making my skin plump &amp; filling in those fine lines and wrinkles as it claims.  At 57 so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles.  I guess you could say it does help keep your skin hydrated.  I&#x27;ve yet to see that youthful glow and reduction of fine lines and wrinkles as it claims. Overall for the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I had this product for a few weeks now and it really works! My skin feels more hydrated, plump and I noticed my fines lines are less visible. I mix this with my moisturizer. Amazing product! I am hooked forever ^_^</li>
    <li> Having only tried this for a couple of weeks; I could not fully rate this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have super-sensitive skin; so, the fact I had no adverse reaction tends to make me like this product.</li>
    <li> Okay but not what I had hoped.  I had hoped for this product to help plump up my skin where I have some moderate wrinkles.  I wanted it to go to a fine line rather than a cavern.  This did not help much except to possibly keep my skin more hydrated.  I guess only costmetic fillers will work.</li>
    <li> I adore this serum! It has a soft consistency that reminds me of aloe vera gel. I used it before moisturizing so that my moisturizer would sink in deeper. I loved how smoothly it applied without being runny like some serums. And though I used it twice a day it lasted quite a while, maybe around 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed a change in my skin too. It evened out my skin tone and cleared up some dark area on my neck. It also helped fade some acne scarring I had on my cheeks. I tried everything to fade this area, and this serum did it! Plus it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, which is very important to me.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and it really works.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff. Sometimes I mix with my lotion, if I&#x27;m in a rush; otherwise, I apply it and then lotion when it dries. It&#x27;s the only product that has gotten rid of some stubborn millia (and I didn&#x27;t even buy it for that!) My skin is looking great and I&#x27;m now reordering for all the women in my family.</li>
    <li> Light, easily absorbed formula. Non greasy or oily. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel nice and smooth but didn&#x27;t fade any lines at all. Just ok I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> She started using this product two weeks ago and now it shows the difference in favor of a new skin. We take photos and note the difference</li>
    <li> From the first time I put it on and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home take off my make up.  Just a little does the job and my skin was so soft almost like powder on your skin.  Once completely dry then you put on your moisturizer.  Within a couple of days I can see the difference in my skin.  I purchased for my mom to try also.</li>
    <li> The results are amazing!  I can see  the difference in my neck &amp; d&amp;eacute;colletage ( much less creasing  and more firmness )&lt;br /&gt;My face also shows signs of firmness  &amp; the backs of my hands have improved tremendously! I am  64 yrs old and my hands looked much older. I no longer wear make-up only tinted sun-block. (Garnier BB cream) that I apply after this serum for daytime. I have an oily complexion and do not apply anything to my face at bedtime except around my eye area and this serum comes before my eye cream.  I am so happy with this product that I am reordering and adding 5 more bottles for my daughters and best friends.</li>
    <li> I have smile lines that really show when I am dehydrated. This has helped reduce the appearance of them greatly.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it tightens the skin, but it really hydrates and brightens my skin to give it a smoother appearance. I also like using the Serum around my eyes. A lot of products make my eyes puffy(even light weight gels) but this just seems to hydrate without puffing the skin up to get rid of lines like some products do. I follow it with a moisturizer right after, and if I&#x27;m consistent, I notice results. I want to add one of the rollers to help in penetrate beneath the surface.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the results of this serum. Who wants to spend money with Estee Lauder or other expensive brands when this one is AMAZING, When I use it at nite next morning my skin is glowing. This serum is very thick consistency so what I do is I spray my face with organic rose water and later the serum so I don&#x27;t have to over use it after I apply the Bel essence intensive anti-aging treatment  nutrition for the skin and thas my fountain of youth!!</li>
    <li> At first I used too much.  Then  I remembered a review that said, &amp;#34; less is more, &amp;#34; and used very little I was pleasantly surprised.  I wash my face, leave it very damp, touch a bit of OZ to three wrinkle prone areas and smooth it all over my face.  It smooths easily as my face is still very damp.  I allow it to nearly dry, leaving a slight dampness to my face then add my moisturizer.  It has smoothed out the wrinkles over my top lip.  I had read to be careful not to apply to my lips and have avoided that mistake.  I am very happy and impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The bags under my eyes decreased quickly. They have not come back. I still use it about 2 times a week. It works!!!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying watching my skin on my face clear which it has started to.  I use a special cream on top of the hyaluronic acid. It feels so pleasant on my face. Little by little it is clearing the blotchy look on my facial skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good skin care product and fairly priced.</li>
    <li> I just read the good reviews on this product and after I ordered, the bad reviews.  I will never trust good reviews again.  I find it outrageous for a company to let these false reviews keep coming through.  Amazon may be making money now, but sooner or later customers will catch on like I did.</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very thick liquid which makes your skin more elastic and removes fine lines and wrinkles after a longer use. I love it!</li>
    <li> Following the directions provided, I applied the product to my face (and neck) prior to going to bed. The next morning I noticed a distinct softness to my skin after rinsing away the product, which is a good indicator of changes to come.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way, seriously. At first I thought it dried out my skin but I was mistaken. It tolerates moisturizers well and does no cause blemishes.</li>
    <li> I love the product and use it twice a day.  My skin looks better than ever.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after the second use!  I was a smoker for years, and I have many fine to medium lines around my mouth.  This product is by far the best one for me.  In fact, it&#x27;s truly the only one of dozens that has made a difference.  I follow the directions and add an additional moisturizer afterwards, so I can still use up my supply of those I&#x27;ve kept around and now they work for me. I also have extremely sensitive skin, and I have absolutely no irritation with OZ Naturals. It&#x27;s a breakthrough for me!</li>
    <li> Its not just the hyaluronic acid and vit C. The product contains other ingredients and my skin cannot tolerate it. Broke out in itchy bumps.</li>
    <li> My skin looked brighter after the first use.  It had a real clarity to it.  I know I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I couple this with triple action C serum! What a difference!  Fine lines are disappearing.  Skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever tried. Well buy over and over, great price. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of these hyaluronic Acid Serums, but this one is the best.  I can see a significant difference, but with the others I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything.  I even put it under my eyes and it gets rid of the wrinkles there for me.</li>
    <li> I saw a change in my skin, specially the lines that form when I smile, I think this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this, alternate with another product that doesn&#x27;t have the vitamin C...my &amp;#34;parentheses &amp;#34; line I had on one side has disappeared. .really minimized my crows feet as well.  Will continue using!</li>
    <li> Feels nice after do derma roller on face</li>
    <li> Really like the feel and look of this serum.</li>
    <li> Dont like this product would not recommend</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working but time will tell :-)</li>
    <li> The serum is very easy to use. All you need is wash your face and pat dry it. You can apply your regular facial cleanser. You can use the serum to moisturizer by using few drops or many drops as you wanted. You can add the cosmetics when it is dry. I leave the moisturizer by itself. I LOVED that my face does not itches or any reaction after applying the serum to my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I will add this serum to my regular routine now. If you are looking for moisturizer then Oz Natural is your choice.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, it made my skin very soft and smooth after the first application. I use it once or twice a day after cleansing and then put my moisturizer on top. It really does hydrate my skin very well and my makeup goes on perfectly afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the minus side, even after two months of daily use, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my fine lines or wrinkles. I&#x27;m 38 with some fine lines around my eyes and lips, and this hasn&#x27;t really made any visible difference in those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product has a LOT of other ingredients besides the HA. Sometimes when I put it on my skin, it tingles or burns (probably the witch hazel, with is astringent). I&#x27;ve also noticed that I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot since using this product, as my skin is sensitive and probably reacting to one of the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; ingredients. I&#x27;m not sure why they need to add all the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not terrible for the price, but honestly, I will keep shopping around.</li>
    <li> Seem to be a temporary fix</li>
    <li> I love the way it goes on your face . This product is  fantastic .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line! Please check out my full review here on YouTube! Click on this link: [...]</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, just purchased my second bottle. I can see a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and the more pronounced lines on my forehead and smile lines!! This is the first product that I have ever liked enough to reorder!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! As described. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum. Anything that has hylauronic acid in it&#x27;s contents must be apritzpplied to moist skin. After cleansing &amp; using toner, I spritz my face &amp; neck with Evian water. It comes in a spray container so it&#x27;s very simply to use.</li>
    <li> A staple in my cosmetic cupboard. You only need a little. I used too much in beginning and you have to wait till it does before applying face cream. I noticeably see wrinkles diminish around eyes. I use it around my mouth but don&#x27;t see the difference as much probably because the skin is thicker and wrinkles deeper.  I am on my second bottle &amp; would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this under moisturizer and it makes it so much more effective.</li>
    <li> I think its working great. I can see the difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t believe anything is perfect&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Skin looks brighter, fine lines have gone away. I think I look better and that&#x27;s what is important.</li>
    <li> I am embarrassed to admit I tried this product after reading all the glowing reviews. After a month of use I see no improvement at all in my skin. The last portion of the serum might never come out of the bottle as the dropper doesn&#x27;t reach it, but hey it hasn&#x27;t worked so far so I&#x27;m guessing a few more days won&#x27;t make a difference. I&#x27;m happy for those who did see results, I&#x27;m just not one of them.</li>
    <li> Waiting on some changes</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Light, dries fast and tightens wrinkles</li>
    <li> Nothing miraculous....makes my skin dry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product. It has kept my face looking young and fresh. I have had the bottle for 4 months and have still not finished it. It&#x27;s definitely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Best product I ever used. been using it for 7 months and it never disappoints.  Put it on after the&lt;br /&gt;vitamin C serum drys and it smooths out all the wrinkles.  Apply moisturizer and off I go, try it you will be amazed.  1/3 the price of the others and it works great.</li>
    <li> I can tell you, I have been getting Botox for the last 2 years, its pricey, but it works. I read many reviews as to the quality of this product and thought I would give it a try. I can tell you, it worked for me, immediately!  Follow the directions, use it daily, and you wont be disappointed! The results exceeded my expectations!  Im 42, my skin looks years younger, my wrinkles are barely there. Also, I have sensitive skin, this product has caused no irritation at all! I am one happy camper;)</li>
    <li> Wow really reasonable price for something that works as well as serums that cost hundreds. I buy one that is $240. seems very similar. I stopped using my expensive one for a week, and see no difference using this. No breakouts either, and I have had that happen. Pretty natural ingredients all good for your skin. Absorbs nicely. I love it. May stop using the expensive stuff once I run out of it. Might start my daughter on this since its reasonable. Good job Dr Oz</li>
    <li> I started using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 30 days ago. First let me say I am a female woman 54 years of age with very dry skin. Immediately I could feel the difference in my skin (much softer) but did not notice any change in my fine lines or wrinkles. After 2-3 weeks I started seeing a slight difference in the lines around my lips and this last week I have really started to tell that it seems to be working much better.  Since my skin has always been sensitive I have only used it once a day but will now start to use it twice a day since I have not had any issues and have started to see that it appears to be working for me.</li>
    <li> So satisfied with this product !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent when used in conjunction with Xfacio anti aging serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it, but I don&#x27;t see as much of change as I expected.  Maybe, after 2 more months, I see a difference.</li>
    <li> I just turned 50 so that youthful look of my face is fading. Beneath my eyes I noticed they start to look a bit baggy so I started applying OZ NATURALS and it worked like a charm within a week I could significant change. I will continue using it because it makes me almost look like a teenager again. The remarks from my friends and family only shows how glowing my face is now. I am so pleased, I will always use OZ NATURALS.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and it caused acne!  I do not usually have a problem with acne.  It has so much oil in it that I can only use it on certain places now.  I have used hyaluronic acid serum before in other products and did not have a problem with acne.  The oils need to be removed!!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product and after several weeks one of my coworkers asked me if I&#x27;d had any work done on my face!  No,&lt;br /&gt;I attributed it to the new serum I was using. They wanted some so I bought a bottle for each of them.  This serum really works, there&#x27;s nothing I don&#x27;t like about it. Of course you have to use a moisturizer after you apply and a little goes a long way. It feels great and my skin feels so much better, healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 &amp; had horrible acne in my teenage years which resulted in fine, ugly lines on my face from the damage of all the acne treatments I&#x27;ve used &amp; this stuff has saved my skin!! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month &amp; started seeing results after a week of use. I did notice the first 2 or 3 days my skin felt a little dry but it was probably just getting rid of old skin because my skin is now BABY SOFT &amp; my fine lines are almost all gone! My skin is looking amazing &amp; even my husband noticed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I saw results within days of using this serum. My face looked and felt firmer and refreshed. Also help with my acne breakouts consistent with hormonal fluctuations. I am hooked and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The product is very good.  Use it morning and night for best results.  Great value for money.  People comment lately on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian female in my late 50&#x27;s; I&#x27;ve been using this a month now and have seen a decrease in pore size, as well as a slight increase in skin tone. It has, also, helped even out my skin tone and diminish color depth of sun spots. I&#x27;ve seen a slight improvement in some deeper creases under my mouth/around the chin. It has helped smooth out my decolletage, too. I&#x27;m happy w/ the product and wondering &amp;#34;what took me so long to try this kind of stuff?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like it, but I haven&#x27;t notice any difference so far. I will finish the bottle and I will came back and post more info.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I&#x27;m 60 years old and I notice that this serum is more effective than the ones I have used before.  My skin feels more tighter, smooth, and age spots are fading!  I also use it on my hands at night.  I recommended this products to my friends, and they all switched to OZ Natural Products!</li>
    <li> These Oz Essentials products are amazing. I have been using the hyaluronic acid serum for about a month. Have seen remarkable results in my skin tone, texture and level of moisture almost immediately. My skin seems to glow.  As a result of using this product I have just ordered and received the vitamin C serum and eye youth gel.. I was a bit confused about the difference between the two serums and how snd when to use each. I wrote the company and they immediately and thoroughly responded to all my questions. Love the products!</li>
    <li> i HAVE NOTICED THAT MY LINES ARE NOT AS PROFOUND. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY FACE CREAM.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a few months now. I am a male and i have notice a difference in the texture as well as appearance in my skin. I recommend using this over using a derma roller (please do your homework on it beforehand). Or you can use it on its own before bed!</li>
    <li> No results very unsatisfactory.  Used a moisturizer as directed. Zero changes in my complextion. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just about to purchase my second bottle about 5 weeks after the first one arrived. It seems to me that this is a good product and has helped my skin look smoother and more luminous. I have what I think is a good skin care regimen which includes lots of daily sunblock. I&#x27;m tempted to try the other more expensive one Oz makes but the rapidity with which I went thru this one makes it kinda prohibitive. We&#x27;ll see.....it is light and a gel- good for my oily break out prone skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for almost a year, and have seen such an improvement in my skin, it is almost unbelieveable!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t go in for facial serums that make extreme claims of rejuvenating beauty -- but my sister used it and urged me to order it.  I did and have been using it ever since - it really, truly is FANTASTIC!  This serum makes your skin feel smooth as a teenager&#x27;s skin.  And since I&#x27;ve been using it (about 2 months now) my skin is really looking good.  I even use it on the crepey skin on my arms and the fronts of my legs (if you&#x27;re over 60 you know what I&#x27;m talking about!).  This serum makes everything look better.  I wish I could bathe in it.  I know Dr. Oz is getting the heat right now - but buddy, you got it right with this serum!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It has been a great one for going into summer. It makes my combination skin feel hydrated without becoming too oily, and my skin feels plumped up and refreshed. I use it in the morning before my moisturizer with spf and in the evening under a night cream. Although, I have just been using this on its own on hot nights. I find that it&#x27;s just enough hydration most of the time. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out and has been a great serum! Definitely recommend this for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this item after a few weeks saw results I will continue to use this so I can see more results!!</li>
    <li> This is a product that actually works to help your skin look and feel younger. I am especially impressed with the customer service. I have received 2 emails from Oz naturals explaining how to appropriately use the product and a follow-up asking if I was satisfied with the product. I will definitely buy more of this serum.</li>
    <li> I put it on the back of my hands and fab it on my chest, neck and face followed by my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Three 1-/2 weeks, morning and night and my face is feeling tighter and soft.&lt;br /&gt;More of this to come!</li>
    <li> This serum is excellent. I&#x27;ve been using it with my matching eyecream and my face is finally feeling younger again. It leaves my skin SUPER moisturized and feeling refreshed morning and night. It&#x27;s very lightly scented, which I find is great for my sensitive skin. I also only need a few pumps of it for full face and neck coverage which is a big plus in my book! Oz naturals definitely is one of my FAVORITES for skin care and this product is probably my second favorite next to the eyecream.</li>
    <li> I have used many of the serums on my skin, &amp; purchased them based of the reviews.  For me, this serum doesn&#x27;t do a thing!  It&#x27;s watery, it seems to last a long time, but the reviews say it&#x27;s a facelift in a bottle.  My skin isn&#x27;t too bad, &amp; I haven noticed it helping even a little.  I&#x27;m in my second month of using it - day &amp; night!</li>
    <li> Left skin soft and glowing</li>
    <li> I use 2 of the serums and are very pleased. Great price and I feel my skin looks and feels more youthful.</li>
    <li> Exactly as &#x27;promised&#x27; ... excellent.</li>
    <li> My wife is 75 years old and has been using this product for about one year. I saw immediate positive changes in her skin and so did she. I cannot compare this specific product to its competition - - but why should I? This product performed as it claimed! I keep checking the skin characteristics of other women in my wife&#x27;s age bracket, and I am pleased to report that her skin has been &amp;#34;reborn&amp;#34; so to say.  Follow the directions. We continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I use it together with OZ Vitamin C Serum.  Not greasy and my skin looks and feels good.</li>
    <li> Worked and left my skin super moisturized. I noticed a reduction in my skin&#x27;s fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my mouth (smile lines). It left my skin feeling soft and felt moisturized and plump,</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all.  After two months I cannot see any difference.  Maybe Dr. oz should just do his talk show and not get into the business of manufacturing.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this serum,!</li>
    <li> An outstanding product and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with its results.  The serum&#x27;s packaging is easy to handle, dispenses the perfect amount using the dropper and I can immediately feel its tightening action.  Leaves my skin soft and supple.  The 5 Stars are given to the result(s) over the three months of use.  Wrinkles have visibly decreased in all areas of my face, which is exactly why I bought it originally.  Then purchased three more bottles.  I recommend OZ Naturals 100%!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a week straight after receiving it, and the results were amazing... I truly like this product and would continue to use it in my skin care routine</li>
    <li> This is s fantastic product your skin will observed and will make your face radiate!</li>
    <li> Love this! I also love how fast it absorbs. Some serums can leave a tacky feel, but not this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product now for 4 months and it is hydrating but did nothing about the dark spots or discoloration on my face. It&#x27;s an ok product but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and will be adding it to my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> second time ordering, love the stuff</li>
    <li> one of the best serums for skin</li>
    <li> i tried this product with the other two product the eyw and the Vitamin C product but unfortinatily not useful and its waste of money and time</li>
    <li> and I got this one based on high recommendations from my friend with the dewiest skin.  Now my skin is improving daily.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone with dry aging skin. Skin is more supple, smoother,and the moisturizer I use is absorbed much better. When I put it on, it just glides smoothly onto skin.</li>
    <li> I have not used another product to compare it to.  So far, feels great on your face.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s wonderful for my skin. I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this serum after reading the glowing reviews from a lot of people.  I used it religiously for a month and nothing happened to my skin. Either my skin is totally unique and different from other people&#x27;s, or a lot of those fawning reviews are too generous and lenient about the benefits of this serum.</li>
    <li> As I get older, I find lots of products that are deemed the best in anti-aging and combating wrinkles and all that. In my case, I find lots that say that and the thing is I have no idea if they are working or not. Some seem to do nothing at all. This one, I am not sure. Is it just keeping the wrinkles at bay? Would I be covered in wrinkles without it? Is it hydrating? Am I using it correctly? I try to wait for it to dry then to apply my creams, but sometimes I cannot wait. So maybe that is the problem here. I say try it and let it dry before putting on creams. I use near, but not too near, my eyes and on the face in a very thin layer. I think I am confused because sometimes I think I get it right and it keeps the wrinkles at bay until later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;I got this one because I had a fancy cosmetic counter one that I was gifted which had the same ingredients and maybe it did something, but I believe it costs much, much more. I also chew the Beauty Bursts with the HLA so maybe the two are working together to keep the wrinkles at bay. Anyways, I have used it morning and night for about a month and there is still a ton of it left. It is a thin gel consistency. I think the aloe gel is the base so same consistency of that. I only use about half a dropper of it on my whole face. It covers it with just that. I plan to continue until I find the right combination. It&#x27;s not too expensive to keep around and on the hot days it has a cooling effect when putting it on.</li>
    <li> I think this product is working I need to continue using it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It gives my skin a rosey glow ,leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I will continue to use it. I recommend this serum to everyone wanting more beautiful skin !</li>
    <li> Ok haven&#x27;t seen any great results! Feels good on my skin..</li>
    <li> this makes my skin feel so soft. I really like it!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, excellent product!</li>
    <li> I got tired of the effects of age and years of neglect on my skin.  Did some research, tried this product, and the results are wonderful.  People actually comment on how good I look, or how healthy I appear.  This product does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> Hype about nothing. Apparently dr oz does not endorse this. Save your $</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I have not used long enough to say yet but so far I think it&#x27;s good. It feels like a good product so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, twice daily, and it has done nothing.  If anything, I find I have more clogged pores than before.  Have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Did not see a difference!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b0fe3e3d2919767af89dab11e529fb1]]I LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;I am a skeptic to new products, not because I don&#x27;t like \\&quot;new things\\&quot; but because I am one whom suffers from terrible allergies (not just the sneezing kind of allergies, the kind that you try something out, and later you have what looks like a sunburn from a allergic reaction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that this product was moving into my beauty regiment  when immediately after applying Hyaluronic Acid Serum my skin felt so smooth and even, the product does exactly what is stated on the box. Diminishing fine lines and wrinkles along with providing a nice dewy moisture layer that isn&#x27;t pore clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect to replace your smoothing cream or serum under your makeup, plus it has more benefits than any smoothing cream I have ever tried! I have experimented with many serums over my 7+ years as a cosmetologist, this product provides has so many perks compared to others. Knowing that the product is 92% natural I am assured that the product is: Good for your Skin and will not cause any chemical allergy spots or chemical burning sensations like others compared. I love that when you pick this bottle up and read the label that the ingredients are actually natural. The first 2 ingredients which do wonders for your skin are Aloe and Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both tried this product at the same time, well I put it on him :) The next morning he was raving about how he loved the product, and how his skin felt so smooth (I believe we will have to share this bottle), but having a quality skin care product that you can share with loved ones is worth every penny. I am excited to see what long term results will prevail, I will continue using this product in my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum... is definitely worth every penny, stop wasting money on that foundation primer and do something good for your skin by nourishing it.</li>
    <li> Havn&#x27;t gotten it yet ordered it on the 8th and today is the 21st got an email today saying its going to be late yea I guess it is</li>
    <li> i like it, leaves my skin feeling so soft and nice i would by it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this originally on February 1st.  Within a week the tracking indicated it was shipped and I would receive by 2/18.  After that date came and went with no shipment I contacted seller.  I must say that they were prompt in their response.  However, I was told that when I placed the order initially it was on back order.  I don&#x27;t recall seeing that message as I never order anything when it is on back order but I could have overlooked it.  I do find it curious though that tracking message reflected it was shipped.  Apparently the back order and weather resulted in the delay.  I was refunded my shipping costs and offered discount on my next purchase.  This was a nice gester.  I was told I would receive my package &amp;#34;next week&amp;#34;.  I finally arrived on March 1st.  It was shipped from Boca Raton to me in Delray which is 5 miles apart.  Makes me wonder about the &amp;#34;weather issue&amp;#34; but I did finally receive it.  I am giving this 3 stars due to the delay&#x27;s.  Seller did try however to make amends when they could.  I wish however that they would have sent an update out regarding the delays and not wait on the purchaser to chase down the order.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff! I can see the visual difference after the first week. I will not be with out this again. Even deep laugh lines are going away, amazing stuff in this little vial. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I think this is a good skin serum at a reasonable price.  I liked the way my skin looks brighter and clearer.  Ordinary face creams just don&#x27;t give me this look.  I plan on purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> First of,  great customer service, very helpful and prompt responses.&lt;br /&gt;I been using Oz Vit C serum &amp; is really happy with the results now,&lt;br /&gt;I tried the HA serum, I was going to wait a while to do my review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been one week &amp; I&#x27;m amazed of the results, after being up, couple of nights&lt;br /&gt;Not having enough sleep, I put it under my eyes, face, forehead &amp; even lips.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable!  I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product! It&#x27;s anti-aging in a bottle!</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle of hyaluronic acid serum and I absolutely love it.  I just turned 60 and after using this product for two weeks, our little office services guy said to me one day, You must have a new guy; your face is absolutely glowing.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a month... but I really like this product so far.  I use this serum in the night and the OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum in the morning.  I&#x27;m 24 years old, so I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of deep wrinkles, but I do think my skin feels smoother and generally brighter and healthier looking.  I only gave this product 4 stars as I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s this product making the difference (or really, how much of a difference is being made).  Although, I believe in it!  Definitely worth a try for the price.</li>
    <li> I had ruddy ness on my checks like red blotches that are almost gone after a week. it also as a nice smell.</li>
    <li> It is thick, easy going on.  Been using it after a face peel.  I&#x27;m waiting to see if it improves my skin.  Been using this for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I really llike this, but I will have to learn to use it more sparingly as I am on the 2nd bottle already.  Will try to spread it out next time, but it does feel really good on my face and I wil continue to use it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok .. shipping was fast but not like the other Hyaluronic acid Serum i usually order .. going back to that one ..</li>
    <li> Too early to tell. But it goes on nicely and feels great on the skin. Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a week ago and started using it morning and night. After about a week I could see that my skin appeared &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; , brighter and smoother AND especially more hydrated. I have VERY dry skin, especially during winter and this helps alot. When I use it at night my skin feels hydrated and when I wake up its still nice and soft and a little glossy. A little goes a long way with this product, so it should last several weeks of not longer. You can use it underneath your favorite moisturizer and doesnt feel &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; or anything. My foundation actually seems to go on better as well and more even since I started using this product. The only reason I didnt rate it a 5 is that I wanted to use it a little longer and see if the change continues!</li>
    <li> I am 56 years old and spent many summers at the river and beach in the sun. I was looking for a product to help with my dry skin and found this on Amazon and thought ok I&#x27;ll try it, after using the product for a few days, I noticed the line around my eyes softening and I thought wow this is great. I have used 1/2 a bottle and already ordered another. My skin is so soft and I look younger. I even put some on my lips and it plumps them up too . I cant say enough good things.</li>
    <li> Really bad reaction.  Itching red bumps on chest, legs and arms.  Loved the way it was making my wrinkles go away in the first couple  of weeks but unfortunately my system could not handle something in the ingredient .  Pretty sure it is a rare case and wished I could keep using because the results were fabulous ...</li>
    <li> It is one of the best  products I have ever used. This is the third time  I have purchased it. Definitely  see improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice, thick, clear serum that feels great and absorbs into the skin quickly - the only reason i give it four stars instead of five is because it&#x27;s so thick (in a good way) that the dropper cannot pull all of it from the bottle - perhaps it should be packaged in a more horizontally-oriented container so that one could use a fingertip to easily access all of it</li>
    <li> This serum tightens my skin making it feel softer, firmer and youthful.  I definitely recommend it for any one with aging skin.</li>
    <li> i like this product the best. Smells good. Gives results.</li>
    <li> I have used many other hyaluronic serums.  I thought pretty much they were all the same.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the Oz Naturals a step above the others.  For approximately the same amount of money itis a superior product.  It seems to tighten my skin a little more than the others I have used.  I will order this again</li>
    <li> Works like magic.  I will definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> I really like the way it makes my face feel after I put this on morning and night.  I also feel that the serum is helping with the redness.  I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited to review this till I&#x27;d had a chance to really try it for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really see an improvement in texture and moisture with this. It doesn&#x27;t burn or cause any issues with sensitivity and absorbs very quickly. Not sticky like some other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using and update this a couple of months down the road but, for now, I&#x27;m really liking this!</li>
    <li> Used it for 4 days and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference</li>
    <li> I really did not see a change on my face.But it does make your skin real tight.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for wrinkles  maybe if you are 20 years old.</li>
    <li> And a little goes a long way which is always good news!  The pimples appear to be juicy – I haven’t popped these babies yet as I’m waiting to see what develops.  Maybe they will just disappear and plain, plumb skin will take their place.  Who knows?  Will continue reporting as further developments warrant.</li>
    <li> Yet another empty promise. Don&#x27;t bother trying this one. I used the whole bottle hoping it would start working. NOTHING</li>
    <li> I use this serum after washing my face with my Clarisonic and use olay moisturizers for my face and Glo Therapeutic eye cream. All together I the lines under my eyes go away or are very minimized. Because of my weight loss when I smile I get wrinkles under my eyes and it makes me look old. I am only 25 but this serum helps keep my eyes hydrated and looking as they should for my age.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt anything but haven&#x27;t seen any difference.</li>
    <li> did not work for me personally, would not re-order product.</li>
    <li> This definately does not work. Cant tell any difference what so ever</li>
    <li> This product greatly reduced the aging wrinkles on my face. I highly recommend this product. :)</li>
    <li> Working well thus far</li>
    <li> Am a little disappointed in the results. I was formally a beauty consultant and followed&lt;br /&gt;Instructions to the letter. And the results so far have been disappointing, the serum is very thick and most&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get out of the dropper bottle. Not a Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I used it for some itchy spots in my skin and it helped too.</li>
    <li> I use Hyaluronic Acid everyday and it is truly Facelift in a bottle.  If you&#x27;re young start using this product  in a bottle to stay looking young and if you are over 50 or over 60 start using this product for younger youthful looking skin</li>
    <li> this is a wonder product. within a week the thin lines around the corner of my eyes have diminished. my face is smoother and have soft touch to it. I will try out the entire bottle to see what other changes i will see.</li>
    <li> It just gets better and better. I[m on almost my third week of this anti-wrinkle serum and it&#x27;s amazing. This product is the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;So worth it.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own this.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m looking for a miracle.  I need to add another anti aging product to my routine for this to work</li>
    <li> excellent. Price I must admit I am not consistent in use, so I am not the best to rate this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I think I look younger and my skin looks more youthful.  I use every day under moisturizer.</li>
    <li> certainly not great but, i guess i will use the rest of the bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and I&#x27;ve recently realized it&#x27;s time to start using skin care products on a regular basis, to help prevent some future signs of aging. I should probably have started a decade ago, but better late than never. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product from OZ Naturals mainly because of what is NOT in it. I like that there&#x27;s no alcohol or parabens, and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I strongly believe in choosing natural products when possible and avoiding chemicals in or on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this serum on my face, neck and upper chest.  I used it in conjunction with the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Anti Aging Serum.  I like the moisturizing it provides.  I noticed that putting it on before I used my mineral powder foundation made the foundation stick better to my skin and last longer.  I do not need a heavy moisturizer at this point because my skin is still somewhat oily, so this was just right for me.  I did notice a slight improvement in dark spots, and I felt my skin tighten slightly when used with the anti-aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5, because I noticed subtle improvement instead of the drastic improvement in the Amazon description. But I am satisfied with this product. Sometimes, when you choose natural products/ingredients, it takes a while to see bigger results. I also hope that with continued use of this product, I will avoid some of the signs of aging on my face.</li>
    <li> Dont bother. I used the whole bottle and all I can say is I hope it worked. It didnt feel any different.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times now because it seems to work very well at helping my skin to stay moisturized in the harsh hot climate of the inland valley of Southern California.  It feels good on my skin, never greasy and with a good moisturizer used afterwards does wonders for the dull aging look that can happen in a hot dry climate. I even ordered their eye product hoping it will help with dark circles and fine lines around the eye. I like their Oz Naturals..they deliver on their promises.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My goal was to reduce the appearance of age spots on my hands &amp; it&#x27;s working-just a little slower than expected. Overall very pleased &amp; will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve used several Hyaluronic Acid serum products, this is the best! It&#x27;s hydrated and smoothed out wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. Will definitely plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I did not get the results I expected.</li>
    <li> Makes my asian skin too dry, and it gave me redness.</li>
    <li> The best.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and I love it!!!! I started to see subtle differences within the first week. My skin now is smooth, clear &amp;  vibrant.  I  look younger always a plus. Since my routine for cleaning my face involves natural &amp;  organic ingredients makes this a bonus being a natural product.  I used to get botox treatments, no more.  I receive so many compliments on my skin and how young I look. I highly highly recommend this product.  It delivers what it promises.  This worked for me but with any product it works for some not for all but, for the price &amp;  quality it is worth a try.  I am truly one satisfied customer. I just ordered the vitamin c serum to work in conjunction with this and I  can&#x27;t wait!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little messy to apply with the dropper.  I use a cotton ball instead as it doesn&#x27;t take much.  A little goes a long way.  Speaking just for myself, I noticed I tend to break out if I use it more often than just a couple of times a week.  I doubt if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> NOT THE BEST.  Nice label but this stuff does not compare to the Obagi C Vitamin C Serum.  The OZ naturals serum is gelatinous and sits on the surface of your skin.  It also is thicker so doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Obagi brand.  I also could not tell that it was making any difference.  It feels cheap and is perhaps advertised well, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Not  that spectacular . I was told by professionals that I have great skin. However like anyone else  crows feet and slightly sagging  eyelids  plague me. I found no LASTING  difference so far with using this product.</li>
    <li> The best hyalronic serum folks! Love this product! my skin is definitely is brighter and more hydrated in the morning. I was a little concerned about the Vitamin C add, because sometimes the concentration can break out my skin, but not this one. This has a light pleasant scent, and works well as a prep before I put on my squalene oil, and of course after I cleanse my face. Price point for this item very reasonable, and shipment very fast too!</li>
    <li> seems to work well especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Okay...didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth...good basis to start the day.</li>
    <li> After two months of using this product, I can honestly say that I never want to be without it again!  I love the way it works in conjunction with my moisturizer to really make my skin soft.  If I forget to use it, I really notice it!  This is great for skin and the customer service Oz Naturals provides is terrific.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I am 44 and have been using for 2 months, I have not noticed any change since using this daily on my face, as of now I would not buy again. The product goes a long way and I still have half the bottle but I do not notice after difference on face or neck 2 months, I will follow up after another 2 months and bottle is complete.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> yes thank you I like using it and it makes my face fills so soft.</li>
    <li> This makes my face look more hydrated and keep it looking soft longer. I love it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any huge results from this product.  It seems pricey for the amount you get.  I have only used it a few weeks and it is nearly gone.  It does make a nice base for foundation make-up.  Smooths out the skin temporarily.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It does everything the company says it does.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference right away. It&#x27;s not a cure, but it really helps tighten, when applied daily, my wrinkled neck and lift my drooping eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Clean product. No messy or greasy fingers after applying.  I use it under my night cream as a base and I can see the difference. The price is right with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I saw results almost immediately. It feels just like aloe vera, no sensation of burning, absorbs quickly and I noticed that my &amp;#34;parentheses&amp;#34; on either side of my mouth had diminished. It won&#x27;t erase your lines completely, but they are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have been using the OZ Naturals for a couple of months now and really like it. I also like the idea that the ingredients are all natural and organic. My skin feels tighter and smoother and the fine wrinkle lines have become finer as use continues.</li>
    <li> This is the second brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum I&#x27;ve tried, and it is one I will stick with.  The other name brand I had ordered from Amazon, and which is found in stores, was more watery and dried very quickly when it was applied. Therefore, you needed more.  It also contained alcohol. This brand is thick and glides on smoothly, so I use less.  Two drops is enough to apply to both my neck and face.  I, actually, see a difference in the smoothness in my face and neck, even though I have been using more expensive brands of moisturizers and skin repair products for years.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I use it at night before bed and I can really feel it when it penetrates my skin.  Smells good too.  You really see the effects after 2-3 nights.  My skin looks &amp; feels much more energized.  I would definitely recommend this product, especially to anyone whose face skin feels dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using a variety of well known products for over 20 years. My skin looked good for my age ( 59 ), but I wanted to see more results without having to use Botox.  Oz Naturals HA was the surprising ticket.  It not only plumps up the skin, but it truly is helping to drive the products I place on top of the HA deeper into the skin and I am seeing results that I did not expect. I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I put the Oz Vit C serum on AM and PM let dry and then apply the Oz HA and will then place on top of the HA my Peptide serum... other serums are applied thereafter, but the triple application (  Vit C, HA and Peptide) is used religiously each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you very much...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about looking at a Professional level of Peptide Serum and a really POTENT neck cream ( like Dr Perricone&#x27;s but minus the bad reviews which is why I haven&#x27;t tried his neck cream).  Can you imagine the results teaming the HA with a potent neck cream?</li>
    <li> Since the 1st time I have tried OZ Naturals, I can&#x27;t imagine my beauty routine without it! I have used Vitamin C last time and is trying this Hyaluronic Acid now. Mentally and physically, I feel great and happy~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA is the best for face product~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing in my mind now is after this, should I stay with Hyaluronic Acid or another Serum from OZ Naturals? ^_^</li>
    <li> I have experimented with hyaluronic acid serum purchased at my local health food store for $45.00.  It was not impressive enough to spend another $45.00.  When I found OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C for such a low price I was skeptical, but then thought what did I have to lose. Well, what a pleasant surprise.  I am very, very pleased with it.  And since I&#x27;m about to turn 75 in a few months, I need all the help I can get.  OZ Naturals will be a regular order and I&#x27;m telling all my friends.  In fact, we&#x27;ll be in Las Vegas next month and I intend to visit OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> I saw an immediate improvement in fine lines from nose to mouth lines. Those are gone. And on my chest the skin appears smoother. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful. I use it along with Phytoceramides. Obsorbs well into skin. Really works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Ok, it&#x27;s not as good as plastic surgery, but since I don&#x27;t ever plan on having plastic surgery, this is the next best alternative. I have prematurely aged on the skin around my mouth - can&#x27;t stand the wrinkles! This serum really helps diminish the lines - and who can&#x27;t appreciate that?</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a month without any results.  I thought you were to start seeing changes within weeks</li>
    <li> Still too soon to tell, but I like it so far and I will continue to use it as I feel an 8 week assessment is going to tell me more than just 4weeks.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any difference in my skin since using this product.  The dispenser does not allow use of product when it gets  down to the end of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Dr Oz says you only need 3 things to improve your complextion, a good cleanser, Vit C and good moisturizer, this product fits the GOOD Vit C and I will never be without it!!!</li>
    <li> I used this before I apply my prescription retinoid and I feel it does not hydrate as much as I thought it would since the retinoid dries the skin, but i noticed the 2nd ing on this is witch hazel which can be adding to my dryness. I did notice an improvement on my break outs, I rarely get them anymore, but again I don&#x27;t if it&#x27;s the retinoid or this products or the combination of both</li>
    <li> A lot of waste when the bottle was almost empty. A jelly like substance so it hard to get the last out of the glass bottle, it all sticks to the sides of the bottle. Didn&#x27;t see noticeable results either. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE SHIZNIT!  NO JOKING...  I am getting a bit older and I am seeing age spots appear and dark circles under my eyes and well, I am NOT HAPPY with this... so I was looking for something natural to help...and WA-LA!  THIS IS IT!  I have been using it less than a month and already notice a difference.. I WILL USE THIS FOREVA!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was bought for my girlfriend who is afraid to use her credit card online.&lt;br /&gt;Her package arrived frozen and is nothing but gel now.&lt;br /&gt;She says it is supposed to be a thin flowing liquid and this won&#x27;t come out from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned not to buy shipped items during the winter that are liquid.&lt;br /&gt;About twenty dollars wasted.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper elsewhere if you shop a little.</li>
    <li> Yes, I would highly recommend this product.  It is important to use it consistently and very little goes a long way.  I bought, and started using this product, because I noticed a difference in my 77 year old mothers skin. She found it first!</li>
    <li> I received OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Serum for a review. I usually don’t tend to use serums a lot, so this was an interesting sampling opportunity for me to try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I liked the product a lot. I applied it for a few days now after cleaning my face thoroughly, and applying a toner. I waited for the serum to dry, and then applied my moisturizing cream. I have to say that I loved the results! My skin feels substantially firmer, has good smooth feel to it after applying this serum for even just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t really have a lot of wrinkles, except on my forehead, but I feel that my forehead is much smoother now than it was last week. I know the results are not permanent, and I have to use the products to have this kind of skin, but it is nice to feel that you can reverse ageing at least somewhat with products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally find that my skin is quite sensitive, and it breaks out a lot from trying products that contain alcohol, so I am happy that this OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Serum does not contain any alcohol, parabens or sulfates, and so it is gentle on even sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand OZ Naturals is a very popular brand, and its products are top sellers. This brand works as a vehicle for moisturizing cream to be delivered better into the skin pores, and it works much better than other more expensive counterparts. I feel fortunate to be able to review this product, and to be able to start using it on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of great things about this product. I like the texture of the serum, and it is very easy to apply. I also like the method of application using a pipette. This helps to avoid spills and lets you get just the right amount of serum that you need without wasting the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for a review for free – it is a sponsored post. I am expressing my own honest opinion reviewing this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second item from Oz Naturauls™ that I have had the opportunity to review. I have tried several hyaluroic acid serums and most have been very appealing and pleasant to use. I love, absolutely love, products that give me that edge against the ravages of aging. No one wants to look older, though it is inevitable, because we all age. However, taking care of our skin with products to slow the process is really beneficial in actually slowing down the appearance of aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid contains 5% of this effective ingredient. There is the added benefit of Vitamin C to further benefit one&#x27;s skin. Very appealing, indeed, is the fact that Oz Naturals are just that - natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals serum is thick, opaque liquid in a dropper bottle. I use one dropper full of the serum and apply it to my entire face (be careful of the eye area, though) and neck. After allowing it to dry, I apply my moisturizer. I am using the Oz Naturals™ morning and evening. Using this good serum seems to add a glow to my skin and it seems to me that my skin&#x27;s texture looks better. Oz Naturals is a good product that I feel good about recommending to my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; OZ NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE CRUELTY FREE &amp; FIGHT ANIMAL CRUELTY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are solely mine and I was not compensated for my review.</li>
    <li> I use this with the vitamin c. Serum and, i definitely see some results.I just started using it a week ago so, I won&#x27;t say to much until I use it for a while.Then I will come back and post my results....but so far so good</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product. I used all of it but I never saw any of the results it claims. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend or re-purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product.  It caused irritation and I did not care for the witch hazel odor.  It did not give my skin a glow or smooth like some products do.  Because of my job I have used MANY skin care products from discount store to high end cosmeceuticals  and this was on the lower end of anything I have bought.</li>
    <li> very good price and does soften the skin. did not noice a reduction in lines and wrinkles. if soft skin is the goal it works for that.</li>
    <li> Lovely, light, and easy to use. All natural and oh so kind to your skin. I will order again!</li>
    <li> What I LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s made from natural, good-for-you ingredients that I can actually read, including Organic Aloe, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel,  Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, Vitamin C,  and Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt; - It rebalanced the moisture level of my skin making it much more even and eliminating patchiness&lt;br /&gt; - It mixes well with my favorite Young Living Essential Oils and allows me to apply them all over my face for treatment purposes (I like using lavender and frankincense to help with blemishes)&lt;br /&gt; - I can feel a noticeable difference in the smoothness of my skin when I wash my face in the morning, so I KNOW it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DISLIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - I honestly had to think long and hard about any &amp;#34;dislikes&amp;#34;, and the only thing I might change would be the packaging.  I would love to see this offered in a pump instead of a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that- I like everything else about it!  This product is an amazing value and actually made a difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it now on a daily and nightly basis. It definitely brings extreme moisture to my skin. This works especially well for my under eye area. It dries fairly quickly, has no smell at all which is GREAT only a few drops are needed so the small bottle will last a long time. Great buy and I will for sure be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have volunteered to review this product</li>
    <li> The is the first product I have purchased that finally makes my skin look good.  I have some dry spots (menopause) and sun damage.  This product goes on like silk and helps my skin absorb my face cream so I don&#x27;t look oily.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you really need to give it a chance.  I have been using for about 3 weeks and I notice a huge improvement in my skin.  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure yet, only used 3 was.</li>
    <li> Can NOT live without this! Great product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any change using this product.</li>
    <li> It seems okey. Used one bottle and did not see results. May be one bottle is not enough to show them.</li>
    <li> First let me tell you that this is my first hyaluronic acid serum!! When i heard about the name- &amp;#34;Acid&amp;#34; i was shocked that why i should apply acid on my face,lmfao!! I know that was my dump thought until i learn about this serum later! Their packaging is obviously fantastic, super cute glass bottle with a pump dropper. As you can see, the serum is kind of very thick and supple. If you are familiar with &amp;#34;Glycerin&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll probably understand what it looks like. The formula is thick like glycerin and not so transparent. I immediately tasted it on my hand to see if i like it or not. I was actually shocked and so surprised!! It just absorbed on my hand so well and my hands feels super &amp;#34;SOFT&amp;#34;!!! [I just feel like my skin cell feels happy to use it, what??!!]  It makes my skin so smooth, soft , supple and breathable!! As you can read above, it has all kind of natural ingredients that boost your skin cell and diminish the damages!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I am comparing this to glycerin but it is actually smell like it.The scent is very relaxing and nice.  AND it is not sticky at all!! Just because it&#x27;s similar to glycerin, I would prefer to use it at night.Because in the day light, it can damage the formula and affects on the skin which we do not prefer, right? It&#x27;s a great serum to use it at night, i believe! [Although they didn&#x27;t mention that!!]&lt;br /&gt;I would say it&#x27;s not costly cause the serum is amazing and worth spending some few bucks for this!! I would highly recommend this to anyone-- GO BUY NOW AND THANKS ME LATER! ☺</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for about a week now, and I can say that I do see some slight results in the appearance of lines. Maybe after using a bit longer it will become more noticeable at least that is what I am hoping we will see.</li>
    <li> my skin absolutely loves this product!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Fine lines absolutely less noticeable already!!!!</li>
    <li> I applied this serum on my face after washing and before bed every day for a couple of weeks. I found that I had a sense of wellness from putting healthy vitamins and other natural ingredients on my face. My skin appears clearer and radiant after the daily applications. I like the effect it has had on my reddish baggy eyes. The serum has slightly changed the worst of the reddish bags around my eyes. I liked that it did not sting my eyes when I applied it. It works on pimples. This serum works in combination with OZ Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum and other skin care products.</li>
    <li> My skin feels and looks great. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I had read about Hyaluronic Acid, and had wanted to try it, but wasn&#x27;t sure where to fit it in my routine.  The advice I was given was to apply the OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum, wait a few minutes, apply the OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Serum, and then moisturizer.  I tried this, adding sunscreen at the end, and it didn&#x27;t quite work.  I found that I need to be careful that my sun screen didn&#x27;t pill, and also that I was getting some dry and peeling patches.  However--I was trying this product while I was recovering from an accident where I bruised and cut my face, and perhaps that had an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separately, I tried this Serum with the Vitamin C Serum and a heavy moisturizer or just this Serum and a heavy moisturizer at night, and I liked that better.  This Serum helps your skin absorb the moisturizer, and when I woke up, my skin felt soft and not at all dry.  I suggest you may get the best results trying a few different things that work for you.  I really like the Vitamin C Serum in the day, so I&#x27;ll continue to try different moisturizers (maybe a moisturizing mask?) with this at night.  I was happy with my initial results, but I think there is the potential for the product to do even more if I find the right routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I was provided a sample of this product by the manufacturer to review, and the opinions in the review are my own.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t so to much about the product. I have not been using it very often. I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything!im 32 and barely have a lil wrinkle under my eye and this did nothing.it is not strong I used it twice a day no problems.another waste of money.</li>
    <li> my skin looks smoother.</li>
    <li> Wow ! Amazing product my skin looks and feels amazing after 2 weeks I can see a improvement I am a beauty therapist and will be telling my clients about this product</li>
    <li> This is a nice inexpensive product for under your facial cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only in my mid-20&#x27;s but I was becoming self conscious about deep &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; around my mouth. I used this religiously after showering for 2 months, followed by a collagen moisturizer after it dried. Never really noticed a difference but I continue to use it since its paid for. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Used it regularly for about 3 weeks as per label  directions. Saw no noticeable changes.,however let me add I am a 57 yr. old male so maybe my skin is too far gone to help or may be it just doesn&#x27;t work on  men.</li>
    <li> is great, i found a larger bottle for less (4 oz)</li>
    <li> I use with the Vitamin C serum, so this review will be about the same as mine for that product.  It&#x27;s like Cellux-C, but for less money and it does not cause the blackheads I experienced with Cellux-C.  I really like it and will keep using it.  My skin looks and feels great, and you do see results very quickly.  Me likey!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product, but if the results are as amazing as the customer service, I will be more than pleased!</li>
    <li> the product i got did not look clear like it does on the picture. it has a lot of bubbles in it. the texture is more like a light gel so a moisturizer needs to go on top of it. it doesn&#x27;t have that silky feel at all. i will order a different brand next  time.</li>
    <li> I definitely see results.  The wrinkles are less deep and the skin is definitely softer.  After 2 weeks even my husband asked if I was using something different on my face.  He doesn&#x27;t notice much and he did notice this.  I love the product, just wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive, the shipping and handling cost almost as much as the product.  Found twice the amount of similar product for half the price elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This product was way to thick for me. It might have been older package.&lt;br /&gt; I returned the packageand bought another one by Cosmedine which is much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3wks now and I have zero complaints! I have acne prone, oily skin and it has honestly helped make my skin brighter and much less oily! Love it &amp;#60;3 definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have been using it for about three weeks and my skin in improving daily.  Fine lines are deminished, skin is soft and no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> This works great with Revitol anti-aging.  Awesome duo.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
    <li> Surprise!  Surprise!  Totally shocked that a natural product with no harsh chemicals!  You can read reviews but the proof is in the purchase!  I have laugh lines around my mouth.  Although I am a happy person by nature, my skin is paying the price of happiness.  Not for long though, I have OZ Naturals to fill in the deep lines.  I am definitely looking forward to using this product for years to come.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning. Item caused a terrible chemical burn.  I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t normally have any kind of sensitive reactions. My face broke out in little whiteheads and I had a rash that reminded me of when I use to get poison ivy every place I applied this.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. This product does not work at all. I have not noticed any difference after having used it for over a month.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I have ordered 3 bottles because I swear by it. if your looking to have less wrinkles and a tighter face then this stuff is for you. I use it twice a day. love it..</li>
    <li> The ingredients are awesome. Worked very well on reducing wrinkles on a person I knew. Gave to her as a gift.  Sample was provided and my opinion is my own</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I will purchase it again and again and again!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, I will not say love because it is not my favorite. I prefer the serums with hyaluronic acid, vitamin c etc... But this one was a great beginners serum, I used it as more of a moisturizer because I don&#x27;t like to put lotions on my face since they clog my pores and since moving from New York to Florida the water is much harder and I can&#x27;t just wash and go! Everything has to be moisturized and this is a great deal of help when I want to moisturize but not feel weighed down or find traces of it when I sweat!!! It&#x27;s a really great product!</li>
    <li> I waited to place a review because it was too soon to see any results.  I used it day and night and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any results with my wrinkles around my  eyes.  I so wanted to believe that this serum was the answer to my wrinkles.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable, this serum is outstanding. The product is thick not runny like other serums. It is just about the perfect viscosity - not so thin that it runs all over and not so thick you have to apply it like a skin cream. Baby bear would be very happy with this, it is just right. The liquid is slightly cloudy so you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has taken to not wearing makeup, it makes her face feel wonderful and gives her exactly the shine and look she wants. An eyedropper full is the perfect amount for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it myself and it makes my skin feel wonderful. The primary active ingredient is hyaluronic acid. There is some real science to this reducing wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid has been around for a long time and it genuinely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is odorless - that is so wonderful. So many of these things smell like something, the worst is old lady perfume. OZ Naturals has left off fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle size is perfect for traveling - TSA friendly and allows you to just pack one thing, not twelve different creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are trying three different products from OZ Naturals. I love their packaging. Each product is in a completely different style of bottle, so you can&#x27;t mix the products up. The labels are so pretty and the colors soothing. That doesn&#x27;t come out in the product pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the fountain of youth - well not exactly? It sure does make you feel better. And it leaves skin a lot softer and prettier. It brings out the natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> I love all things &amp;#34;OZ Naturals.&amp;#34; I also use their vitamin C serum. I switch back and forth between the 2. I can&#x27;t  say enough good about them. I put it on after I wash and dry my face. I wait about 15 minutes before I put on moisturizer,  to give it time to soak in and dry. It really keeps your face, neck and eyelids firm!</li>
    <li> Good product; no miracle in the bottle but it provides nice hydration after regular use. I can even skip my facial cream( use eb5 at this time) on occasion.</li>
    <li> It lived up to its expectations.  I plan to reorder this.  I was very uncertain about this at first.  But it di d what it said it would.</li>
    <li> I noticed my fine lines diminishing and really enjoy the product and recommend it to others looking to good anti wrinkle product.</li>
    <li> It seemed to tone and tightened my skin</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast.  Made my pores smaller. I am 64 yr. old, it did not firm my chin area but on my checks and around eyes&lt;br /&gt;seemed to firm those areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a week, but I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with the results.  Now, I have very sensitive skin, but I also have very clear skin so I wanted to try this for something different other than my face, since it&#x27;s advertised as a moisturizing serum.  I already have the Oz Vitamin C serum and the Oz eye gel, so I wanted to be able to test this on it&#x27;s own to see how it would work.  I have scar tissue on my ankles and the sides of my feet that bother be because they pull when I walk and can sometimes make it painful to walk long distances.  I started using this Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Moisturizing Serum on my scars, and then following it up with a good moisturizer. In the past, just using a moisturizer has done NOTHING for my scars.  After a week of using the combination of this serum and a moisturizer, my scar tissue has softened to the point where I can walk without pain.  The scar tissue isn&#x27;t gone, but it&#x27;s been softened enough that the ridges aren&#x27;t as prominent and it&#x27;s not pulling on the rest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is supposed to be used on your face, but there is already proof in the other reviews that it does work.  I wanted to know that it would actually work to moisturize something that seemed impossible.  I use this serum in the morning and in the evening, and follow it up with a good moisturizer after it dries.  The scar tissue is now soft and flexible enough to stretch, which is pretty much a miracle and a true test of this serum&#x27;s quality.</li>
    <li> Really works well! I use this at night time daily, &amp; it has dramatically improved my deep lines, erasing the small fine ones. Thanks for a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Of all of the hundreds of lotions and creams I&#x27;ve bought, this just might be the most effective. You still need to use a moisturizer over the top, this just makes it absorb more. In the short time I&#x27;ve been using, I have noticed a huge difference in my sun spots and a slight difference in my wrinkles. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was too strong for my skin,</li>
    <li> I like this serum but my question is: doesn&#x27;t the vitamin c looses it power when exposed to light? And this bottle is crystal clear....</li>
    <li> To say that wrinkles disappear overnight or in a week or even a month is unrealistic.  But this product does produce softer skin that seems much less wind and sun damaged.  OTC products are basically cheap money-makers for their providers and this one,  along with staying out of damaging influences,  can really help. The truth is probably that our genetic makeup and life choices are stronger factors about skin health than a purchased product but this one seems to counter some damage.</li>
    <li> It is great on my skin.  I use it every other day.  It makes my skin look refreshed.</li>
    <li> I did like the product....I guess I just can&#x27;t tell if I liked it enough to buy/ try it again?</li>
    <li> DOES NOTHING IT STTAES</li>
    <li> Really is an amazing product!! Very thick!! The results are amazing. One of the better products I have spent my money on.</li>
    <li> great product that gives results! My only recommendation is to order enough in advance since this product is in high demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> I am glad I did not spend a lot of money on this product.  There was no noticeable difference.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in a few days.  Skin looked much smoother.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does. That is the best review I could give it. It hydrates your skin while leaving it feeling soft and smooth. I did start off using it every other day because I have sensitive skin and then I moved up to everyday, some people use it twice a day but since I use other products in the morning I only use it at night. I have only been using it a couple of week but can already see the difference. It&#x27;s a must buy for all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while probably almost 3-5 months since I last purchased this, and I got it so I could do an at home peel and still have moisturized skin post peel. Yes, it worked incredibly as it soaked in and my skin was not even dry after applying two heavy coats of alcohol, which before would&#x27;ve cause my face to produce a ton of oil yet bet dry at the same time. However, before I open or use any new product I try, I meticulously examine its whole parts (because I&#x27;m weird like that) but one negative thing I noticed was that the one fl oz that was labeled didn&#x27;t look like one fl oz. It seems like it wasn&#x27;t filled up all the way because I compared to my tca peel bottle which holds one fl oz, and is exactly the same size bottle and clear as well so I could see where the lines were. I&#x27;m not sure maybe I&#x27;m wrong but now it is a little discouraging to repurchase the product as the last time I purchased it it was about $2 less, and for only 1 oz it just seems a bit pricey, but I know that sometimes in this day and age one must pay for quality.. I should also mention this did not cause me to break out, if that helps anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend to a friend? Absolutely&lt;br /&gt;Would I repurchase? Probably, the product DOES last long, in the beginning I think I also used WAY too much product, and now I not use one small drop for my forehead, nose, each cheek, and chin. That&#x27;s all you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Unfortunately I have to rescind some stars based on my recent experience with this product. The review you see above I loved everything about the product I even recommended it to quite a few people. Then I ordered their Vitamin C serum in the brown bottle. Well long story short my body does not like manufactured Vitamin C whether it be thru pill form (I get migraines), liquid (stomach upset) or topical (break out horribly) I can only get my Vit C naturally thru food. It&#x27;s still sitting in my cabinet I cannot use, waste of money, but not the company&#x27;s fault. Sometimes products just don&#x27;t agree with some people, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now this past July I had ran out of my hyaluronic serum and came here to repurchase another bottle. Then got the shock of lifetime when I looked at the bottle and noticed THEY CHANGED THEIR PERFECT FORMULA AND ADDED VITAMIN C. -_-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely upset because I felt like they already had a SEPARATE Vitamin V serum, why mess up a perfectly good product? Again it sat in my cabinet for months. Fast forward to October and I finally decided to give it one try to see if it wouldn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It. Does. Matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the next couple days my skin broke out and I knew it was the stupid Vit C added because I made sure to keep my regime the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals you have lost a loyal customer for good unless you go back to the old formula. I had a Holy Grail product and it got ripped from my Cabinet of Divine products. What a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for those of you who are sensitive to topical Vitamin C, head back to the search results page and look at other products. I&#x27;ll be right with you... -_-ducts just don&#x27;t agree with some people, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now this past July I had ran out of my hyaluronic serum and came here to repurchase another bottle.

    <li> Great produc takes a minute to get it but worth it when if finally arrives</li>
    <li> i have used it after my TCA peels. Dramatically decreases the recovery time and the look of the new skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It truly restores moisture to aged skin. I bought one bottle a few months ago. Since I was getting low on this product, I bought two more bottles and use it once a day, sometimes twice a day, but spread it thin on my skin. I have received more compliments about my skin and I know it is this product that give it a youthful, clean, and smooth look. I am 63 years old, but my friends say I look as if I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  Excellent product! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to rate this product, I have only used a1/3 of the bottle so far.  It seems like this product is in high demand, my order took a lot longer to get to me than what I expected but to be honest I have no complains on the contrary,  I want to thank the CEO of this company for keeping in touch with me through the whole order process and for going beyond ad above to keep me a happy customer.  I hope I get the same results everyone is talking about and if I do I will definitely  buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  However, I know that vitamin C should be in a dark colored bottle and although this hyaluronic acid includes C, it&#x27;s in a clear bottle.  The newer version with E and C I believe comes in the dark bottle.  Any reason for this, or am I the only one who noticed?  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;I have to give it 4 stars because of this omission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.  I was wrong about the Vitamin C needing a dark bottle and want to be fair and honest because I do like the hyaluronic acid very much.  Next time I&#x27;m going to try the C and E one, which apparently is more potent.  Thanks for correcting me.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of topic alas and this one is the best. I put it on at night and wake up to tighter toned skin. I just don&#x27;t apply it under my eyes because this is pretty potent stuff. It will be forever part of my beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> didnt do anything for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used Hyaluronic Acid serum before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  After using twice daily for almost a month I can say this product does seem to work.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin tone and texture, and the fine lines around my eyes don&#x27;t look as bad.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked the way it intensified my moisturizer.  It helped diminish lines.  Especially during the winter months.  I will buy more and the price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Just love this product.Feels like my skin is smoother and my pores are shrinking.My cream goes on and draws it in .I&#x27;m ready to buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid and vitiman c is the best mixture on the market for agin skin. does not burn and will make wrinkles smaller over time. I love it.  Excellent seller... fast delivery and good packing.</li>
    <li> Came in mail fast, and I am very pleased with it. would recommend to anyone. Feels nice on my face, I mix it with other moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about 5 or 6 days, and I have noticed a difference.  My complexion is brighter, smoother, and the lines are less visible.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like organic products and this one has 90% of the bells and whistles I want in an HA ( hyaluronic acid serum) serum.  This serum is a vegan hyaluronic acid serum  and it does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types I like that too- it&#x27;s not always what&#x27;s in the bottle but also what&#x27;s NOT in the bottle. Key points here for any product you put on your face or body.&lt;br /&gt; I like this because during this seesaw weather in LA, my skin has been very finicky and particular. It doesn&#x27;t like that kind of weather swing.  (Here in LA we just went from  high 50 degree temperature to 80+ in a couple of days!) Courtesy of using the product every day, my skin calmed down and got smoother and softer.  Part of why wrinkles develop is that skin is not pampered with moisture and the right  ingredients. This lovely serum has not only HA but also Vit C &amp; E too to help the skin bounce back.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product is that it provides 3 key ingredients and saves time and money. All 3 work synergistically together. Oz Naturals has great products. Worth finding the best ones for your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it now with a great price on the 1 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used the Hyaluronic Acid Serum regularly for nearly two months.  I can see no difference whatsoever in lines, wrinkles, or softness of my skin.  It didn&#x27;t give me a rash, or burn my skin but I think it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Use with my face cream</li>
    <li> This serum is fabulous!! Goes on smooth and dries quickly. I use it along with the vitamin C serum from oz naturals as well. Has made a tremendous difference in my skin tone. You have to try it!! It&#x27;s the best as is all of the other oz naturals products.</li>
    <li> This was for my wife of 51 years, hope she will use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always ready to try something new once, but this is a great serum. The age lines which have been around a while are only slightly minimized, but the little ones really improved. I would buy it again. I got a deal on two so I have one for my gym bag too.</li>
    <li> This product showed visible results right away.  After applying the serum as directed and then using ordinary wrinkle creams, I find it enhances them in a way that makes them far more effective.  My skin looks and feels so much smoother and flawless!  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! I will use this forever! I get daily compliments on my skin...and I&#x27;m 67 years old.</li>
    <li> My wife has made this part of her beauty regimen. She says it&#x27;s quicker and easier to apply than creams and makes her skin feel more full without the chemical feel some creams give.  She is even trying to get me to try it!</li>
    <li> Excelente serum make my skin so soft ! I noticed a lot of diference since im using this serum!! My skin look my youthful and my fine lines disappear!! Love this serum</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of OZ Naturals. My face really likes it. I can see improvement in my skin with each day. I was having some issues with looking different due to aging. I feel smoother with less fine lines. I have a glow again too!  I recommend this t anyone that wants to use a good serum that does not cost an arm and a leg!</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my wrinkles smoothen and my skin looks 5 or ten years younger. i also add collagen serum then my day facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i like the feel of this product</li>
    <li> Works amazing with my products by Origins. I exfoliate my face then use a cleanser. I apply the serum then a moisturizer and instantly notice a difference. Some complain that it dried out their faces but I&#x27;m sure they didn&#x27;t use it with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really, really works. all natural. I received an email from the company after I purchased it with more clarity on how it works. Love it</li>
    <li> Received the product timely &amp; in excellent condition.  Always wanting immediate results, but is too early to tell if product is as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased three OZ naturals products: this one, the retinol moisturizer, and Vitamin C serum and started using all at the same time. I don&#x27;t know which one works more than the other, but in concert (which is recommended), they work fantastic! It seems to smooth and even out the texture, tone, and consistent pigment of my skin. I don&#x27;t have any actual wrinkles, although I do have minor fine lines and expression lines.  It made the former less noticeable, although the latter--hmm, dunno if anything can be done about them (I am thin and have little subcutaneous fat, and in addition the years--and decreasing collagen--are catching up to me). :-(  Again, I cannot definitively say if THIS serum is doing all that or if it is more of a concerted effort, but whatever it is, it WORKS!</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle and saw no results.</li>
    <li> I received this free to review on my blog.  The serum was like a thin gel consistency and after absorbing, left my skin smooth and not sticky.  It has a mild but pleasant scent and didn&#x27;t sting or burn when going on.  I&#x27;m only 33 so I don&#x27;t have major aging issues but want to stay on top of things.  I appreciate the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, no joke! I was skeptical, but I&#x27;ve been noticing fine lines at the corners of my eyes more and more often, so I decided to give it a try. I noticed my skin feeling tighter within just a few days. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I will never want to be without it. It has ingredients in it besides hyaluronic acid--it also contains vitamin C, which is a great antioxidant. The combination of the hyaluronic acid and the vitamin C acts as a carrier for your regular moisturizer--it is an extra step to add into your routine. I wash my face with Biore Ice Cleanser, then use a homemade toner made from witch hazel and essential oils (peppermint, tea tree, lemongrass, and eucalyptus). All those menthol ingredients stimulate circulation in the face. Once my toner is dry, I apply a drop of this serum, about the size of a Sixlet, all over my face, concentrating on the corners of my eyes to the temple where I have been seeing lines and underneath my eyes, as well as my forehead. Once that absorbs, I follow that with my daytime or nighttime moisturizer, whatever time of day it is (I do this twice a day). I feel like I have finally found the perfect facial care routine for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, I can tell my skin is a bit more hydrated but I definitely can not see the improvement on the skin pigmentation that others have raved about.</li>
    <li> Wow, instant results. I did not expect to see anything right away, but as soon as I applied this serum under and to the side of my eyes the skin visibly plumped and the fine lines started to disappear. How gratifying and the price is reasonable. I use the Weleda skin food (also found on Amazon) at night on my face for moisture and on my nails and cuticles. (My nails are long and healthy now). Now I will add this serum to my routine. I am in my 60s and make sure I use sunscreen every day on my face to reduce environmental damage to my skin. I am impressed with the OZ Naturals serum and look forward to seeing the results over the long term.</li>
    <li> Not sure it is doing what I want it to do but it is okay.  I did feel my face tingle when I first used it but haven&#x27;t seen any real results to say this serum really works.</li>
    <li> Love it! Has been using it for more than a year now along with Vitamin C Serum. Use it few times a week at night. Noticed the results - the skin is clear, pores are minimized, less discoloration and majority of sun damage spots are gone. Skin is deferentially looks fresh and young (i am in mid 40th)</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in my skin.  The wrinkles, I guess, aren&#x27;t getting worse.... But I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty powerful serum because it will start showing you some results almost immediately with continued use. It also has Vitamin C in this serum so if you are using a Vitamin C Serum, I wouldn&#x27;t use it while using this Hyaluronic Acid Serum because it might be too much for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is not like the others I have tried in that it&#x27;s not clear and it&#x27;s thicker than most serums as you can see by the above picture. It went on smoothly and absorbed rather quickly, which is a good thing, because I have dry skin and because I don&#x27;t like for serums to sit on top of my skin and make it look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much as this serum will go a long way, so be careful about how much you apply. I would hate for you to waste this precious serum. And please be aware, that this is really awesome for fine lines and wrinkles, but with deep wrinkles, while it may soften them and make them less noticeable, it will not get rid of them permanently. I haven&#x27;t found a serum or cream that has ever done that and don&#x27;t expect to. That kind of deep wrinkle will have to have professional help and I won&#x27;t lie and tell you that there is a magic cream or serum out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you use this serum the right way and take care of your skin, like using sunscreen protection and moisturizers, you can make a difference in your skin, especially if you start young. Trying to change 50 and 60 year old skin will be harder but you can improve it. Just be realistic in what topical serums and creams can do and you won&#x27;t be disappointed because there really are some great serums and creams out there, like this one, that can give your skin a much better look.</li>
    <li> I believed I was getting 100% Hyaluronic Acid.  Not only that only but, there are more than 15 items listed in this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product not really expecting much...what a wonderful surprise...wonderful product..noticed a difference right away..will order again..and will tell others about it...very nice to find a product that really gives the results that it promises...also nice that it isn&#x27;t terribly expensive..making it available to everyone.</li>
    <li> So nice stuff to have) the best product for oily and problem skin</li>
    <li> I bought this to try on the Dr. Oz idea from show. I like how it works and  the skin does seem to be well hydrated and looks good. I will buy more!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your $$$</li>
    <li> Love it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I AM TRYING THIS PRODUCT AND SO FAR SO GOOD.  WHEN YOU TRY NEW PRODUCTS YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT SOME TIME TO WORK.  I DISCOVERED THE PLUS IN USING HYALURONIC ACID, AND HAVE USED IT ALONE FOR A WHILE.  THIS PRODUCT HAS VITAMINE E IN IT ALSO, WHICH IS SOMETHING YOUR SKIN NEEDS.  IT IS KIND TO THE SKIN AND DOESN&#x27;T IRRITATE IT.  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT TO GIVE IT A CHANCE.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. It feels good but didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin. I like that they give excellent instructions on how to use it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to make a determination of whether I love this product or not.  I can see some difference in my skin texture and it has a slight glow to it that it normally doesn&#x27;t have.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Poor results.  Would never buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for a week and I see and feel the difference in my skin texture, the skin is smoother and my furrows between my eyes are a little softer, not as pronounced...I am 65 and never wanted any surgery , there is no miracle cure  when you waited a long time to stop the advance of age ,but this works at minimizing skin issues...should have done it sooner.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin,  not yet finished with the bottle. Don&#x27;t see any dramatic chamge so far,  but feel the ingredients are good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I am combining it with another topical Vit C product and my skin texture is improving especially my blackheads.  I will buy more. Oh, make sure you shake it up well before use as it will get a little thick on the bottom.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum is known for increasing the moisture in your skin.  I saw no difference whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t know what they mean about a facelift in a bottle.  Again I saw no difference.  Save your money.  I wonder if there is a product that is not a serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for more than a month but see no difference, but like to continue buy it in the hope it will work in time but I am not happy that I have to pay shipping cost unless I would purchase the more expensive one.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Makes u look years younger!!!! I will definitely recommend to anyone that wants younger vibrant looking skin in just days!!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I use this regularly. It really helps my skin.</li>
    <li> After using this for two weeks,  I haven’t really seen much of a difference. Hyaluronic acid is found in many moisturizers, as it is supposed to be an intense hydrator for the skin, but the anti-aging properties are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though–this serum feels pleasant on the skin, and if you follow it up with a moisturizer, like it says on the instructions, it really does moisturize the skin. That however, could be either the moisturizer or the serum working. It’s supposed to enhance the effects of the moisturizer, but it’s hard to really observe the differences on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have extra $20 and would like to try out a serum, it doesn’t hurt to try this one. It certainly doesn’t irritate the skin or anything, and I have sensitive skin. Anyways, lots of other reviewers have claimed that it’s worked wonders for them, but it just didn’t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this review updated as I use this for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Note that I was given a review sample.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I plan on buying this over and over again! My skin has always been so dry and I have to use so much lotion until now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum as an overall skin treatment on my face the last couple of weeks, and it&#x27;s been working well. The wrinkling on my forehead has started to ease, as well as the beginnings of some small aging around my neck line. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll ever go away completely, but this works well to clear up some of the obvious damage. It&#x27;s easy to apply (a few drops on the fingertips and rub it in), and it adds a level of moisture to the skin that wasn&#x27;t there before. And with no irritation, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> I wanted a really good Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C for my face routine, and this covered both!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product! I use it daily!</li>
    <li> bo difference, waste of money!</li>
    <li> Nice product that actually does reduce wrinkles</li>
    <li> Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for all ages or folks w/certain health conditions like diabetes. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t reviewed this yet! I love this serum. It softens lines around my lips and takes away dark areas. Overall my skin benefits from regular use. I am almost to the end of the bottle and will order another.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommended with the use of Oz Naturals Facial Moisturizer for dry skin and fine lines.</li>
    <li> eh, doesn&#x27;t do anything that I can tell</li>
    <li> I am highly suspicious of all the 5 star reviews of this product (and just all the reviews in general. 1400 reviews? Really?  Doesn&#x27;t that seem fishy?). I just finished up the entire bottle (took a few months), and I&#x27;ve noticed zero change in my skin. Nothing. The product smells nice (natural, not perfume-y) and absorbs quickly, but that&#x27;s it. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize and does nothing to fight aging. I have very dry skin, and this didn&#x27;t do anything to help it be more moisturized. Certainly didn&#x27;t do anything to wrinkles or age spots. I won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  To my surprise I&#x27;ve noticed a slight reduction in my crows feet. Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this product is not worth to buy it I get vitamin C from a dermatology 1 week and you feel way more different I pay $140 but I know is real dr oz is just a name I won&#x27;t buy nothing from hem any more I recommend you to see a real dr  is worth you money good look with that Jelly if you buy it.</li>
    <li> IF YOU&#x27;RE READING THIS, FORGET ABOUT BUYING THE PRODUCT, OZ PRODUCTS DO NOT WORK!!!</li>
    <li> I always get nice results from this product , i love the quality of it.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT 2 BOTTLES, EVERY NIGHT I APPLY AND SOMETIMES IN THE MORNING.  SKIN IS SUPER SOFT, YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to tell, it&#x27;s not like I can see an amazing change within a few days, but that might be partly due to me having good skin to begin with and very little lines.&lt;br /&gt;The serum does feel good on my skin and I think I do see some improvement in my smile lines which really bother me the most right now.</li>
    <li> Really liked this for my face and it was very reasonable to purchase but when I went to reorder, the price had climbed quite a bit. Though this product was my favorite, I am now using a less expensive product.</li>
    <li> A little thicker than what I like in hyalauronic acid, but the product itself being organic and vegan rates it an extra star.  Wish it were a little thinner though, it would spread better, IMO.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product does not bother me.... amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It actually seems to make my face more tolerable of other products. Could it be true?</li>
    <li> This was a great price for a wonderful product. Nothing is a fountain of youth, but it is fun to try.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin has added moisture to my skin.  It is now part of my daily routine.  I have not had any negative side effects only positive results.</li>
    <li> uhm i dont know. its only been a week. i use this as base for my other skin moisturizer. came across this product while lookinh for marine collagen. its part of my skin care routine. can i do it without this? too early to tell. but everything else is perfect. love its texture and absorbtion performance.</li>
    <li> just a basic light moisturizer, you might do just as well w/ aloe vera.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this serum.  I have been using it for just over a month now and did not want to write a review&lt;br /&gt;straight away until I could review the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to see an improvement in the reduction of fine lines under my eyes and neck. My skin does feel and look more hydrated, and I also like the fact that it is quickly absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it once a day at night and I still have just under half a bottle left. After years of expensive creams and eye creams I am happy to have found something that really works that is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my other skin care products run out I will be ordering from Oz Naturals as this product is great including their Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> I recommend this vendor and this product as promised your skin will look great! I used it at night so I can take full advantage of it&#x27;s benefits.</li>
    <li> I read the good reviews, knew the product INGREDIENTS work so ordered it. I DID MY RESEARCH ABOUT INGREDIENTS BUT NOT BRANDS, UNFORTUNATELY. I&#x27;m a retired physician so CAN read labels and thought this one sounded good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $ is higher than the ad as it is by the ounce the price listed--which was my 1st clue I should have passed. I have used this plus the OZ naturals Vit C serum for three months and see NOTHING. NO-THING at all.&lt;br /&gt;WASTED MONEY&lt;br /&gt;Sorry all you great reviewers. You must be hired by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*One company person told me to get a refund from AMAZON--past the 30 day time limit that&#x27;s a no&#x3D;go. Since you USE it 30 days--the company makes a lot of money on nothing. Amazon should pull these off its websites.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a great website to research Vit C etc skin creams.&lt;br /&gt;http://feleciaroselabs.com/is-my-expensive-vitamin-c-serum-killing-my-skin/</li>
    <li> The few times I used it, it was ok.  However, I haven&#x27;t used it on a daily basis to determine an accurate results.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. I am on my first bottle and will be ordering a couple more, just for back up. I love how this makes my skin feel. My skin already looks smoother and more tight. I look forward to putting this on after the shower. I put in on before my moisturizer and my shin just soaks it up. I am also impressed with the customer service, very professional and just nice people (:. Just order it, you will not regret it. Xx</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I am very pleased with the results. Mt daughter who has sensitive skin tried it overnight and was pleases with the results. I got her one I also use this after my derma roller.</li>
    <li> Like the smoothing effect it had on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It went on light and was not as drying as other C serums.</li>
    <li> Did like the product, it made the bag of the eyes go away after a couple of hour wild using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommended to highly.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I&#x27;m on my third bottle. Goes on smooth and seems to suck in your moisturizer. No fragrance and weary slippery. You only need a little and the price is good.</li>
    <li> The product really hydrates and leaves my skin feeling like velvet.  I&#x27;ve used another brand of hyaluronic acid in the past and the consistency of this one is a bit thicker - perhaps hydrating event more than the other.  It&#x27;s absorbed quickly into the skin, which then allows my moisturizer to hydrate more effectively.  A little bit goes a long way and I sometimes dab a little under my eyes to keep that area from looking crepey.  It&#x27;s also a good base before applying sunscreen for those times when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup.</li>
    <li> An outstanding product, it does what it is supposed to do. I also intend to order their other items as I feel confident this is a company I want to include in my regular re order  products.</li>
    <li> I have used OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum for several weeks now without any adverse reactions to my sensitive skin. I apply it after my shower and before bedtime. It is a little bit thicker in consistency than the OZ Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum and it goes on smoothly as well. I follow this serum with my Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer after I give it about a minute or so to dry. As with the vitamin C serum, I started noticing results rather quickly, within just a few days. It keeps my skin feeling smoother, moisturized and rejuvenated with a healthy glow. When I wake up in the morning, my skin still feels rejuvenated and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure:  I was sent this OZ Naturals products for free in order to perform this review. However, no other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.*</li>
    <li> lives up to it&#x27;s name</li>
    <li> This product has amazed me!!! I have sooooooo many of these products. This has become my go to lately for some reason. I like the way it feels on my skin. I can feel it working and it&#x27;s a serum so you don&#x27;t need much!!! A definite product to buy again!!</li>
    <li> I must say I saw great result in a week in a half with this serum my family noticed almost immediately how much brighter and let me repeat &amp;#34;much brighter not cleaner but brighter my face looked&amp;#34;. If this made such amazing results in 1 week imagine an entire month or even a year use of this that is just how powerful this stuff is and granted does run out pretty fast  at least for me that is why I gave it four stars, I also I do recommend using a moisturizer with this it got a little irritating after it&#x27;s hardening processes. Highly recommend this, and one last thing everyone skin is different it might longer than a week to see results like mine.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have used this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; for a couple of weeks. It&#x27;s difficult to say how well it works. Neither of us have skin conditions - so no way of knowing if it would hinder or help any conditions, but it is not advertised for that purpose anyway.  It does have a temporary tightening effect, but many things can give that effect including rubbing a freshly cut lemon or plain yogurt on your skin. Whether it repairs any cumulative  age related damage to the skin is impossible to know unless one has the resources and interest to pay for comprehensive tests. I do not. I received the product as a no cost sample and will not be purchasing it in the future mainly because I do not know if it works. I do know that Retin-A works, so I use that. I do know that a quality Alph Hydroxy face cream works, so I use that also. I like the idea of a Hyaluronic Acid Serum (if it actually works), but an idea is not a good enough reason for me to buy it. My opinion is that for many skin care products, one is merely buying a dream.</li>
    <li> Sure goes on easy.  Have not used it long enough to know the results.</li>
    <li> works wonders for the skin</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Lila Sharp</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,this is my 2nd time buying it. I actually bought 2 bottles this time cuz I love it so much!!</li>
    <li> Quite effective on my combination skin. I use it with A derma roller and it leaves my skin very smooth - icredibly smooth, even better than some expensive creams. It doesn&#x27;t ake much so it lasts a long time. Be sure to take the time to rub it in! I&#x27;ll be ordering again when this one gets low.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really use this</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this serum ! Fast delivery.  Will be ordering again......</li>
    <li> This product is equal to prescription level results you would get at an estheticians office. I layer it under either my moisturizer or my retinol product nightly (I alternate). It&#x27;s fantastic! I would recommend it highly to anyone. Do not hesitate to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results . It makes my face look great. It smooths the looks of lines . So happy I tried the Hyaluronic Acid Serum .</li>
    <li> This is a really high-grade serum at a great price. I&#x27;m a skin care snob and have used a lot of expensive serums, and OZ Hyaluronic  ranks with the very best. I have very dry skin, and I really like using it at night, then following up with a moisturizer. My skin no longer feels dry and tight in the morning. Hallelujah!</li>
    <li> I have used hyaluronic acid before but in a stonger strength.  I got a gift card so I decided to try this,  its good but prefer the stronger one.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! Its inexpensive and does the job..I received it in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I put it on twice a day and let it dry then put the revitol cream on.  really like how my skin looks so far.  My friends bought some after me so we are comparing our skins as we are about the same age and have need for younger beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay - I just can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> It does reduce the wrinkles when used as directed. From afar, It looks like  there are no wrinkles on my face!</li>
    <li> The serum worked fast and really well. Unfortunately it ran out after about 10 days of use. I had to reorder and got another brand that was supposed to be stronger, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I am going back to the original product, and will just have to order in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> This product is a 10/10 I love it</li>
    <li> Very beneficial. Noticeable hydration Overall skin looks better. My favorite way to use is after i shower, use dropperful and spread all over face ,let dry then apply my moisturizer. My skin looks good and makeup goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals, products are so real, natural, even that I just started using it, but i can say it works! and price too.</li>
    <li> use it every day……..not really sure if it does anything or not</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months still see lines</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a week or 2 and they are wonderful.  I definitely see a difference.  I can&#x27;t always say that with products, but, with this one, I can.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered this product.  Very good for the skin and lasts since you only need a couple of drops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a little over a week but WOW! So glad I purchased it. The persistant bags I&#x27;ve had under my eyes are much diminished. Maybe I should start bathing in this stuff.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for an affordable Hyaluronic acid from a reputable company at an affordable price....found it in Oz natural Hyaluronic acid. my skin looks plump, supple and hydrated ! happy !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK.  Nothing spectacular.  I&#x27;ll get something else when I run out of this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s  sticky, I prefer something lighter</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals provided the most succinct information on the product and the most favorable pricing.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results I see in my skin tone.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Any other products i have purchased with hyaluronic acid gave a dewy appearance to my skin.  This product, however, kept it dry.  I would have no reason to recommend it to others. BEST is in  their opinion only, Should have known better when the product&#x27;s name is &amp;#34;OZ&#x27; with no connection to Dr. Oz, just a play on words in both cases.</li>
    <li> So here we have a product by Oz Naturals. (A Dr. Oz wannabe?) After reading reviews I was looking forward to trying this particular skin care application. Unfortunately, upon opening the package and reading the ingredients I found that it contains both POTASSIUM SORBATE and SODIUM BENZOTE. Two preservatives that I avoid in food and would never apply to my skin. So much for natural. False advertising? Contacted Amazon and returned immediately.</li>
    <li> If i like it although i have used very little i have not seen results and then i will tell you i do not like your dropper aplicator is not as liquid as much product is wasted</li>
    <li> So far so good! This product is exactly what I was looking for, and also exactly what it said it is. I think over a little more time, I will see even more results.</li>
    <li> Excellent, waitin for results in a few weeks. Fast delivery. Feels great on skin day and night. Need to read the brnefits again</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum! I just purchased a bottle for my daughter! I have noticed a nice change in my face it seems to be so soft and the fine lines and wrinkles are so much nicer!</li>
    <li> I have had this serum for 3 months now. While I do really like the serum, I think for best results it does need to be used daily. I do not use it daily, I tend to have oily acne prone skin, thus I use other creams to treat those issues first and use the serum when my skin is totally clear. I do notice a general improvement in overall skin tone and texture with the serum.&lt;br /&gt;The company which sells this product also reached out via email when I placed my order to make sure I was a satisfied customer. An appreciated touch that went above and beyond the attention most retailers provide customers.</li>
    <li> Great item, speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> this is the basic component  with coconut oil of all the expensive, perfumed cremes and cures being promoted as age erasing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month maybe a little less. I like it a lot. It makes my skin feel very soft &amp; I believe it is working so I will give it more time !</li>
    <li> after a couple of mmonths NO! results</li>
    <li> OMG this serum is taking years of damage off my face.  The difference was immediate.  Feels great too!  This product really does hydrate your skin.  Great price.  You&#x27;ll want to order &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Though the use of Hyaluronic acid serum is well establishes as a quality and reliable topical skin toner and refresher, few can attest to it virtues better than those with dry, sun damaged skin. Where cream and moisturizers feel refreshing when applied, this 5% hyaluronic acid serum with vitamins C and E (both established as necessary for skin health) actually penetrates the epidermis and balances the skin&#x27;s natural water loss. As a result the skin remains hydrated and that in turn diminishes fine wrinkles and line associated with dry, damaged (even if just by age!) facial skin. If it doesn&#x27;t make you look decades younger then your expectations are too high. Use as directed (VERY important) and the results are noticeable within a few days and after a month your skin will indeed look more refreshed! OZ Naturals guarantees it so give it a try - if it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do the company will back you up! Grady Harp, August 14</li>
    <li> I said this before the product is absolutely fantastic. It delivered what it said initially. I love the product. I will recommend this product to ladies to try and they can witness the spectacular results they are waiting for.</li>
    <li> I was not completely sure I was expecting anything immediately noticeable.  Not only do I feel a real change in the texture of my skin, I can actually see my skin changing.  I will use this forever if it keeps improving my face and making wrinkles go away!</li>
    <li> REDUCED THE WRINKLES AROUND MY EYES TO NOTHING IN 5 DAYS. BUT YOU GOTTA KEEP IT UP.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet. we will see in few weeks if this stuff works.</li>
    <li> It works, fine lines are disappearing. Skin feels and looks great. I use this with Home Health Moisturizing Cream, Hyaluronic Acid, with Restorative Hydration.</li>
    <li> Good--works really well.</li>
    <li> This is a soothing product.  Refreshing to the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and the customer service with valued information was the best I have experienced on amazon. A+ seller top rated product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 23 and I haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle on my face so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s anti-aging... Hyaluronic acid is used as skin moisturizer instead of anti-aging in my original country Taiwan, and this product did a great job on moisturizing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for that it will dry out around the rim and that looks a bit messy.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my face feel!  I can see a difference already in Three weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does what it says and I love it. Plus I saved $90+ so I bought it again.</li>
    <li> my skin is smooth and helps fill in my fine lines</li>
    <li> Wish I had known more about this before I ordered. #1 It&#x27;s made with a powder that you can buy in a bag at &amp;#34;Bulk Supplements&amp;#34; - throw a 1/2 tsp. into distilled water and add a dab of vegetable glycerine. WALA - you have the very same stuff for pennies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have found this product.  My aging skin needs as much moisture and help it can get.  I know the benefits of adding HA to your skin care regime and this is the perfect serum.  I use it under my Body Shop Vitamin C daily moisturizer - and then use it at night under the OZ Sea Moisturizer... Fabulous for overnight skin treatment.  I even have my husband using the serum now as he has very, very sensitive skin.  I could see the difference on him almost immediately.  Perfection in a bottle - and affordable too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been amazed at how effective this product is in plumping up the fine lines of my face.  I am 65 and have always taken good care of my skin, but of late I had noticed the fine lines around my eyes and mouth deepening.  After only three weeks of using this product twice a day as recommended (and yes, a little goes a long way) the lines have virtually disappeared.  I never want to be without OZ Naturals--THE BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Seeing is believing.</li>
    <li> Nice product; but I don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
    <li> This product has made my skin baby soft. I use it at night and when I wake up in the morning, my skin looks glowy and soft.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any results with this</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals really works. It took away all my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin is firmer, softer, and I have less blemishes.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-40s and have been looking for a non-greasy, effective, easy-to-use, highly nourishing serum for daily facial use. I believe that this serum is exactly what I was looking for. I have only been using it for two weeks today--and in the interest of full disclosure, this was the free sample bottle I received a free sample from Oz when I contacted them to inquire about this and their other serums. I am very happy with how this product has worked so far! It is absolutely non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished. In fact, I am surprised at how my skin looks and feels with just a few drops of this serum (and a couple of drops of the Vitamin C one from Oz that I mix with it), in spite of being exposed daily to the brutally cold winds and temperatures we have had in NYC these past couple of weeks. I feel no need to use any heavy cream (they cause breakouts for me and I don&#x27;t like the greasy, shiny look they give my face), and can get by with just a few drops of serum in the morning and at night to keep my skin un-damaged by the weather. I am surprised at how well this works and am hoping that this is not just &amp;#34;beginner&#x27;s luck&amp;#34; for me! I now want to try the Vit C. Toner and Moisturizer from Oz so that I can have my facial care regimen taken care of entirely by their line. Once I do that, I will post a follow-up review in case my experience is markedly different from the positive one I have had these past two weeks using just their two serums and their eye gel. So far, so very good. No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> This really leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and firmed. I use on those fine lines around my eyes and forehead and creases on my neck. I am starting to see some improvement after a week!</li>
    <li> Wow!  An under $20 vitamin c and H acid that actually works?!?!  I think I might lose my Sephora Rouge VIP status, as I won&#x27;t be buying their $90 products anymore.  I have been using this product and the all Vitamin C serum for about a month now and have noticed a difference under my eyes.  Skin feels tighter and less puffy (it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m sleeping any better or giving up wine), so I&#x27;m inclined to believe the product is helping a lot.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve skin quality and concerned about gracefully aging.  While I am not sure if it is the absolute best product on the market, I will say that it is the absolute BEST product on the market at this price point.  A+++++++ on bang for your buck.  Thank you Oz Naturals, you&#x27;ve won a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Love all oz natural products</li>
    <li> Finally figured out how to use this effectively for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I usually cleanse my face before going to sleep.  Instead of putting on moisturizers, I put this on, especially my forehead where I have the most lines.  The vertical lines from frowning has virtually disappeared since I started doing this.  My forehead of oily by nature so I no longer put any lotions on, just this serum.  It not only dries  smooth but also make all the tiny wrinkles (that were starting) go away.&lt;br /&gt;So, now, this is all I use on my forehead!</li>
    <li> *I was sent this product for review by the brand.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the serum has been great so far! I’ve really enjoyed using serums in the past with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, and this one is my favorite that I’ve tried. I love that the serum is very light on the skin, and dries in seconds. In addition, the moisturizing quality really works. I rarely use a separate moisturizer now, because this serum does the trick. While I haven’t seen any huge changes in my skin since beginning use, I’ve noticed that overall my skin feels happy! There are no breakouts, and I haven’t experienced any sort of irritation. Plus, I appreciate that OZ Naturals focuses on natural and organic ingredients so that I can feel confident about what I’m putting on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photos and more at adventures-in-polishland.com</li>
    <li> I have liked this very much. I am only 27 but have noticed small lines, so thought I would start now with the anti aging for my skin. I love that it is natural and it doesnt make me breakout.</li>
    <li> I continue to buy this product. I think it works but, honestly, who knows! But when this one runs out I&#x27;ll be buying another :)</li>
    <li> I have use this oz serum first time been using since six weeks My skin looks wrinkle free Since I have been using oz . I can&#x27;t  believe that this product is soooo good my face looks young..will definate order again..</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. My face has such a glow to it since I&#x27;ve been using it. Many people have noticed and made comments about it. I won&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and I do believe I have noticed a difference. I&#x27;m 54 and starting to get those pesky little lines around my eyes and mouth but they do look like they are getting less and less noticeable. Yeah! As some others have said, when I read the reviews before buying myself, you do feel your skin tightening or maybe even like it&#x27;s getting dry, but I think this is just the way the product works. After about 5 or 10 minutes I apply my moisturizer then I&#x27;ll look in the mirror a bit later and I see it working. My upper lip looks plumper. Love it. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> i would never buy this product from OZ naturals they are really rude people. They never help you with ur problem. didn&#x27;t even inform me that i wasn&#x27;t home so they got my shipment back to them.</li>
    <li> Update: I used one entire bottle, purchased a second which is almost empty, and have a third bottle on standby.  This is really good stuff.  Hyaluronic acid is supposed to help skin stay hydrated.  Hydrated skin &#x3D; plump skin.  That means less noticeable wrinkles and lines.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 6-ish months and I really love what it&#x27;s done for my skin.  No, I didn&#x27;t have any major issues, but those nagging little problems that come with age were bothering me.  Much less so now.  I highly recommend this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I will have to update this after using the product longer, but after just 10 days, I can see a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any really major skin issues, but at 39, I&#x27;m starting to see fine lines around my eyes, and my skin doesn&#x27;t look as bright and even-toned as it once did.  Some darker spots, and some gentle sagging.  I do have two deeper creases in my forehead, between my eyes, from years of squinting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, those two lines seemed far less obvious.  The skin just plumped right up and filled in.  Each day since, they are less noticeable.  I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle cure for lines and wrinkles, and from what I understand, the effects are temporary.  Meaning I will have to continually use the product the see the results, but I&#x27;m ok with that.  I&#x27;m also noticing a bit of brightening, and my skin looks and feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply twice a day to a clean face, followed by an eye cream and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see more firmness, fewer wrinkles, and better skin texture and tone after using this longer.  I&#x27;ll update after 30 days and see if this happens.</li>
    <li> Th product is outstanding and the price is good compared to similar products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does what it says it will do. Very impressive.</li>
    <li> I read up on this item, and decided to try it.  I have used it for 2 wks at&lt;br /&gt;this writing:  very pleased with the immediate results and the good&lt;br /&gt;surface that remains after using my moisturizer after the serum has&lt;br /&gt;dried.  Good results.  Glad I got this stuff.  UPDATE: 12-01-2015, I have used this for a while, now.  I think I am on my 6th Bottle.  I already tested this on my face by NOT using it.  For me, my results:  I have better skin with this product.  It works for me.  I am experiencing better complexion texture, surface, and tone.  I am staying with this product for a while yet.  I give it an A+.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in fine lines and wrinkles, and it has only been a couple weeks of use. I plan to continue with this product. Oz sends great follow-up directions--Follow instructions, and you will see results!</li>
    <li> Omg....this stuff is the best. Really notice a difference in eye area, neck and chest. I have actually started using it on the backs of my hands too. Can you say fountain of youth. I use this with a good moisturizing cream after. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling very smooth and since i&#x27;ve been using this in combination with a few of the other OZ products, my pores are visibly smaller and I have a more even skin tone. Thankyou for this affordable line of organic products !</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. My skin has improved so much, and looks wonderful</li>
    <li> Moisturizes, but made me break out and I haven&#x27;t broken out in years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product used daily you shall be happy takes time to work,you have to accustomed to the product shall work.</li>
    <li> do not see any improvement for my wrinlkes</li>
    <li> Product as seen. Came fast!</li>
    <li> I like using this serum :)  It has the added benefit of Vit C and absorbs quickly. A definite part of my skin maintenance</li>
    <li> Very good product. Enjoyed it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Being a mid 30&#x27;s gal, I have been noticing my skin is not bouncing back like it used to. I read about this product while I was looking for some anti aging products that would be better for me than a whole bunch of chemicals. After using this for a couple of months I have be noticed that my pores are looking a LOT smaller. My cheeks, in some areas, look like they have been air brushed a little. I follow up with the sea infused moisturizer and I am good to go</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She said it improved her skin 50% . Thats a good number. She is continuing to use this product</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after use!  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles currently, but I really enjoyed giving this product a try. First off, it&#x27;s a vegan facial product, which is something new for me. I&#x27;ve not really read much on vegan products other then food items, so I was excited to try it. I applied it every day for about 7-8 days, and I thought it was easy to apply, I didn&#x27;t notice any bad reactions or issues with my skin. I did notice around day 4 or so, that I could feel my skin tightening up a bit more. I didn&#x27;t use a lot, as I didn&#x27;t have an noticeable wrinkles that needed to be touched up, but this product does work. I could feel my skin tightening and getting a bit firmer, and more hydrated. I noticed some of those fine lines you don&#x27;t even really noticed were filled in and my skin had a bit more of a glow to it. It didn&#x27;t look dried out, it looked nice and healthy and hydrated. I really enjoyed using this product. The directions were easy to follow, it was easy to apply, and it really did make a difference on my skin. I think the price is quite affordable for the product, and it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given a sample to try, and to provide honest feedback</li>
    <li> Great product.  I finally have found a product that I can see results with!  Great company to deal with!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.  Zero results even though I used it every single night on my smile, forehead and in between the eyebrow lines.  Bought this in June and have seen literally no difference.  No idea why this ranked as a top seller because it was SUCH a waste of money.  Dumb!</li>
    <li> Very effective serum.  I am in my mid sixties and found the serum to give me a more youthful look.  My son gave me this as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised by the results after even just a week.  I ran out and my other son gave me more for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I find the serum helps my daily moisturizer absorb even better.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with OZ Naturals- Vitamin C Serum.  To my delight, he crows feet to my eyes are gone and other facial wrinkles are very noticeably minimized.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer.  Didn&#x27;t notice any wrinkle shrinkage, but then I&#x27;m old.</li>
    <li> Love the this new serum. Oz continues updating  their products.  I used the previous serum and  was happy with the results.  This new serum is even better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in my face....</li>
    <li> I received a free 1 fl.oz. bottle of Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid to review. I started using the product the night I received it prior to going to bed. I applied it on clean skin on my forehead around the outer edges of my eyes (crowsfeet area) and on my neck. I have recently lost 65 lbs and I will soon be 62, so there is some loose skin that is starting to wrinkle. That comes with age in anyone but to varying degrees. I am fortunate that I have good genes and do not have a lot of wrinkles. That said, after a few days using this product, I did notice a change in my forehead area. The lines were still there but showed up a bit less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has vitamin C which is an antioxidant, vitamin E, which promotes the circulation of blood to the skin, getting rid of those free radicals. There is also green tea, which is a wonderful antioxidant and anti inflammatory which calms the skin and relieves puffiness. Hyaluronic acid acts as a heavy duty hydrating liquid that moisturizes and hydrated and can be used under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know about you but after years of getting little sleep, what with working, stress and raising kids,  which resulted in a few lines on my face. I think with prolonged use of a few weeks or even months, I will continue to see how well this serum works. The price is actually very good and the amount that gets used, should last for a long time making this a good purchase if you are looking for a bit of beauty help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I received a bottle of Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum for review and was not monetarily compensated for said review.</li>
    <li> Best item to look young</li>
    <li> Liked this product a lot</li>
    <li> Feels so good around eye area.</li>
    <li> Good stuff I really think it works!!!</li>
    <li> I loved it. It makes my skin look younger and it freshens up, tighten the pores</li>
    <li> Used for about three weeks now. Have not seen any major change in my skin. A little disappointed. Will continue to use to see if there will be a better result.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is working yet. But will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing....leaves skin smooth and soft. I recommend you try it!</li>
    <li> love this product, no need to use a lot. I combine with Retinol Cream for a glowing complection....</li>
    <li> Great product, high levels of hyaluronic acid not found in other products. No icky chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product because of all the great reviews, however; I really don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin or wrinkles after using it as directed for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> It does hydrate the skin but it also enlarge my skin pore. I should have stick with bio code brand. Regret that i made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Do nothing for me and i am 35 no wrinkles i just want this to add extra healthy for my skin and is being one month and nothing</li>
    <li> I have seen a remarkable change in skin texture and it gives me a healthy glow. I have been using it daily for 6 weeks now and have gotten comment as to what am I doing to look so vibrant! Thanks OZ Naturals!!!</li>
    <li> I got this in a gift bag at Fashion Week and i&#x27;ll tell you it was the most valuable gift in the bag.  I love this stuff!!  It&#x27;s thick, but absorbs fast and evenly.  It pulls my moisturizer deep into my skin and the end result is awesome.  I feel like it makes my skin look fresh and healthy in a dramatic way.  I would probably pay twice as much if I had to. The customer service of this product company is very co-operative. They answered all of my question those I had regarding this.</li>
    <li> always happy to have something to help with my skin. Did not see a noticeable difference.  Everyone has different so worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and did not have any issues with this product.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Make sure u use a moisterizer after applying serum. But serms to work well only been using for a few weeks. Like i said use little bits at a time, it goes a long way. My skin feels softer  an wrinkles slowly fading n have to use everday.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t really see a difference. went fast! wouldn&#x27;t reorder but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I for the first time started using a similar product.&lt;br /&gt;I am only 31 years old, but wrinkles are already visible, I can tell that I see result on my skin. However, I don&#x27;t know, whether there has to be so, but a liquid in a bottle in the form of jelly...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  Makes my skin feel great and I&#x27;m now taking better care of my skin.  Only been using the product a bout a week and no signs of changes in sagging skin yet but better moisturizer.</li>
    <li> No changes in my skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (provided to me for review) for a couple of weeks. Do I see miraculous changes? No. Did I expect to see such? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My approach to skincare is rather scattershot, perhaps because there is no solid science here, only marketing claims; I&#x27;m not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on fanciful advertising, nor am I willing to experiment with potentially toxic chemicals. So, I aim for products that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t contain chemicals considered hazardous or unhealthful on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database (Yes, I know it&#x27;s not the last word on certain ingredients, but for now it&#x27;s the best I have)&lt;br /&gt;2. Do contain ingredients that make some bit of scientific sense (such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, hyaluronic acid, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Feel good on the skin&lt;br /&gt;4. Have no annoying odors&lt;br /&gt;5. Are easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;6. Are efficiently designed, so as not to take up inordinate space in my medicine chest&lt;br /&gt;7. At least fool me into seeing some benefit on my inevitably aging skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received three OZ Naturals products for trial, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with all three, based on the criteria above: this Vitamin C serum, the Super Youth Eye Gel, and the Hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, the eye gel might my least favorite, but only because I prefer a rich emollient eye cream; this gel dries quickly and feels dry. Maybe it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but for those who are looking for more moisture, this might not fit the bill. To hedge my bets, I apply it, let it dry, and then apply a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the four-star rating, I give most &amp;#34;skin-care&amp;#34; product four stars simply because it&#x27;s difficult to know if it&#x27;s actually &amp;#34;working.&amp;#34; I did not knock off a star due to any features of the product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real changes in my skin.  It didn&#x27;t hurt to try, but no real improvements.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best serum I tried :)  the store department serum it&#x27;s a lot more expensive and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  Now this one I&#x27;m using for about a month and let me tell you,  my skin looks a lot better, it&#x27;s a lot smoother my acne are almost gone! I was skeptical but it wasn&#x27;t expensive, so I gave it a try, absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. My skin looks refreshed and practically glowing. I&#x27;d give this one 5 stars but the delivery is SOoooo slow! I&#x27;ve waited 3 weeks so far and still no sign of my order. The seller uses USPS and does not provide tracking. I ordered 2 bottles since my original order was very slow in arriving. My plan was to have one in reserve and re-order as soon as the first one was empty.  While awaiting this order - I ran out, ordered a competitors HA serum, it arrived in 2 days, is working well and I may make a permanent switch. Out of sheer neccessity!  Too bad. A great product but just not available.</li>
    <li> Like many Amazon customers I check out the reviews written by the customers who have tried a product to see what they say. As I read the reviews written on this product I found it disturbing to see so many that were written by “unverified purchases”.  I noticed few from yesterday and quite a few from the March 4th. I want to read feedback from someone who has tried the product, not an unverified source. I feel like I’m being tricked..</li>
    <li> it does hydrate your skin so that is good...but do I see any lasting results...well no.....I use it under a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The product came 2 weeks late. I got an email from the Owner of the company apologizing due to the delay that was the result of the weather. When I received it, it did not at all look like the picture. Inside the glass was NOT clear and looked a lot like Aloe Vera. I read the ingredients and aloe vera is the top ingredient and when I put it on my face, just felt like aloe vera - no tingling sensation, and definitely no visible results.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product less than a week but I believe I can see results already.  I gave it a 4 because i haven&#x27;t used it long enough for a good trial.  I would recommend to others to try.</li>
    <li> I bought this and a cream with the Hyaluronic Acid in it. I guess I was hoping for a miracle cure for my very dry and sensitive skin -- made worse by the cold dry weather. This made my face red, splotchy and it burned I had to quit using it. Might work for some but not for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference since I have been using it. Maybe I did not need it to start with.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now, and haven&#x27;t seen any change. It actually seems to be drying my combination skin out. Even though I use a moisturizer. Too bad...I was hoping for something, with all the good reviews.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed the bottle was nearly only half full. Have not tried product yet, will review when I do!</li>
    <li> HYALURONIC ACID SERUM FOR SKIN  (OZ NATURALS)  FANTASTIC STUFF, I HAVE TO HAVE THIS EVERY MONTH NOW! I CAN&#x27;T GO A DAY WITHOUT IT, MY WRINKLES ONLY AFTER LESS THAN 4-6 WEEKS OF USING THIS PRODUCT HAVE SHOWN SUCH GREAT WRINKLE IMPROVEMENT! I HAVE HAD TO RETURN SOME OTHER ITEM&#x27;S I HAVE ORDERED, OHHHHHH AT HOW IT FEELS SO GOOD TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WORKS GOOD AND I MEAN VERY GOOD! THANK YOU! I EVEN GOT A SUPRISE JUST YESTERDAY WHEN A GUY THAT CAME TO SEE MY MOTHER FOR SOME BUSINESS THAT HAD NEVER MET ME ASKED ME HOW OLD WAS AND I SAID 52 AND HE SAID WOW! I THOUGHT YOU WERE ABOUGHT 39 YEAR&#x27;S OLD! NOW THAT REALLY MADE ME FEEL EXTRA GOOD, SO YOU GUY&#x27;S KEEP MAKING THIS STUFF, HIRE ME, PUT ME IN CHARGE OF YOUR LAB&#x27;S AND I WILL SEE THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD WILL NEVER HAVE TO GO WITHOUT OZ NATURALS HA SERUM!  THANK YOU SO MUCH....  GLORIA MCCORMACK!</li>
    <li> Somewhat of a change.</li>
    <li> I do like my products, can&#x27;t say I have noticed a change in my skin tjough. Can I use all 3 products together? Any order? I always put my moisturizer on last. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It helps to cover the wrinkles</li>
    <li> A serum that leaves the facial skin plumper, smoothing any fine lines dramatically, while also imparting a soft and dewy, Rose-like glow that lasts! It works WONDERS!!! Super Youth Eye Gel used with this will absolutely AMAZE you! The results are very noticeable difference after only one use,&amp;it gets EVEN BETTER!</li>
    <li> Gives face a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the Best, but it certainly helps in moisturizing my face. I add a couple drops into the portion of BB or CC cream I&#x27;m using to help spread that more easily over my face. That helps me apply the cream, as well as adding moisture. Hylaluronic acid certainly is known to help moisturize. I also add drops to body lotions or body butter. I&#x27;m over 60, so any moisture I can add is great!</li>
    <li> Love it - use it daily.  It is a great base.</li>
    <li> Excellent anti-aging product - I instantly see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle of HA I&#x27;ve purchased from you, so I&#x27;d like to provide you with my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass dropper bottle and label are beautiful and of very high quality. However, It would be nice if the directions were on the label but I see you&#x27;ve listed them on your website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use I could instantly tell my skin was much more radiant and even tighter. This hyaluronic acid serum does an amazing job of lifting, tightening and plumping my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased plenty of other anti aging serums, some which were outrageously priced and I find OZ Naturals to be just as effective if not more effective than the higher priced products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, OZ Naturals is a highly effective anti-aging, anti wrinkle serum at an extremely low price &amp; I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Ordered two bottles...no change other than break-out all over face. I will throw the second bottle away. Does not do what is said.</li>
    <li> Feels almost invisible, absorbs quickly with no after feel secondary products go on beautifully. Almost feel instant lift or could be imagination but like the product. Second time to buy Oz line but different product, please with purchases. I have tried high end products ie: skinceuticual and the OZ products do not feel or smell like chemicals not to take away from other line but so far for price I like the results and will continue to use line and diversify when other products run out.</li>
    <li> Great product, instantly absorbs into the skin, without leaving any residue.  Have been using it for about 2  weeks now, I and I have noticed that my skin is looking good!&lt;br /&gt;Best is,  it is all natural :)</li>
    <li> Eh, no miracle results.  My skin was the same even after a month.</li>
    <li> i love it and thinkibg to purchase the second one. i apply it daily twice and feels the difference</li>
    <li> This serum has proved to be everything I had expected it to be after reviewing hyaluronic acid. I am 73 years old with minimal lines on my face (thanks to good and on going care for most of my life). This is certainly helping me keep my facial skin in peek condition.</li>
    <li> I definitely like this serum. At first I wondered if it was working, so I stopped using it. Then I realized it was working and quickly went back to it. It subtly removes fine lines and it seems to tighten my skin. It&#x27;s priced well under the competition. I think that OZ Naturals has something with this serum!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received compliments on the firmness of my face. I like it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of all the high reviews it got.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything different from this product than from the previous product I was using.  As always each person can experience different results.</li>
    <li> Great moisture! I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
    <li> Look my skin more hidrataded and soft.</li>
    <li> Hmmm I was really looking forward to the &amp;#34;facelift in a bottle&amp;#34; that was stated.  I basically see no difference whatsoever. I am giving two stars because I am willing to give it more time to take effect.  I appreciated the nice email I received from the company explaining how to use tis serum and suggestions. I can tell they really believe in their product.  The email said I would see results the first day but please give it 30 to notice the reduction of wrinkles.  When I read that it works by delivering moisture to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; up the skin that would fill in wrinkles it seemed so promising.  Sorry to say I really don&#x27;t even see the slightest change.</li>
    <li> Once I put the oil on I could feel my face tightening. I could see the difference in a week. My face was so smooth and soft The oil goes a long way when using it .The amount in the bottle isn&#x27;t a lot but it only takes a small amount to cover your face and neck. Love it!</li>
    <li> my favorite product ever ,can&#x27;t live with out ever</li>
    <li> Really nice product, applies well on the skin, feels good! Makes skin look really smooth , minimizes wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product and  I like it.  It goes on nicely and feels good on my skin.  I use it everyday as directed. You only need a small amount. My skin looks fresh and  feels smooth and natural.  I have very sensitive skin and had no problem with this product.</li>
    <li> This is what they say it is for:  Our 100% Pure Vegan Hyaluronic Acid You&#x27;ll See Immediate Results:&lt;br /&gt;- Delivers a youthful and vibrant appearance to your skin&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces the appearance of dark circles and puffiness&lt;br /&gt;- Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- Formulated with the highest concentration of pharmaceutical HA&lt;br /&gt;- Contains the same HA used in the world&#x27;s most expensive serums&lt;br /&gt;- Boosts Collagen Production For An Instant Youthful Appearance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t see any changes good or bad in my skin. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m using nothing at all. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I admit to not knowing what 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum actually was.  I was sold on the part of it that says, “The serum will help deliver your moisturizer deeper into the skin.”  I like that idea a lot.  When my skin is especially dry, it doesn’t feel like moisturizers do a lot to help unless I am willing to just slather them on and even then, I doubt that gets absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum does help make moisturizers more effective.  I can feel the difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been super dry this summer and I am always looking for the right product.  This was a key part to my skin care routine that I didn’t even know existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle really fights wrinkles, excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best Vitamin C Serum I&#x27;ve found on the market for the price. It has visibly reduced the lines, wrinkles and dark spots on my face and hands, and it firms my skin and improves the absorption of my moisturizers. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Just started using it. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  My skin loves it and I can really feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Loves the vitamin C drops so decided to add this to my daily skin care. Really like the oz products.</li>
    <li> Great price, great shipper, and I love this stuff!  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  Would not be without it;  this is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> my skin looked great after using it, but the next day my face was covered in whiteheads.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my skin.  It actually caused me to break out.  I thought it might be the same or better than another product I purchased through Amazon, but not true.  I wish to return this product, but I am 4 days out of the return period.  I&#x27;m not one to leave any negative feedback, but I feel like I deserve to be refunded for the money I spent on this.</li>
    <li> the skin in my face is very sensitive. i have oily spots as well as very dry spots so it is very hard to find the right product to treat both.  I regularly get pimples and blackheads and buildup on my nose which is hard to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;i have used other OZ Naturals products before and i love them all. i use mask first, then toner and this serum and combined all together they work greaat.&lt;br /&gt; This product turned my skin from dull, dry, flakey and lifeless to soft, dewy, glowy and moisturized. I&#x27;ve had it for seven days and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for the scarring to start to disappear but I feel so much more confident without make up now. I use it morning and night - as a moisturizer - and it&#x27;s like magic. it lifts your skin and tightens it. it hydrates it at the same time. it lasts me the whole day and when i get home my skin looks fresh and glowy.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I recommend this product, even just to try. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use. I am in love with this product. Definitely will buy again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any real results and I have been using it every day</li>
    <li> no change at all in my skin</li>
    <li> I use this two times a day.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the serum in conjunction with the Retinol Moisturizer for a couple of weeks, and I can already see a difference in the pain lines around my mouth. My skin also has a better texture - I had dry, flaky patches, especially around my nose that are already smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face I use the serum and then the moisturizer. I got the Serum at the request of the company for a review. As I needed moisturizer anyway I picked up this product. I am glad I did - I look forward to seeing what my skin is like after I have used the product for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face products are like any other product - some things work for some people, some things don&#x27;t. So far? This works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months now.  I am a 41 years old, very fair complexion (I burn easy), and prone to sunspots and dark patches.  I had one sun spot on my face that was getting darker over the last 5 years and really causing me some insecurity.  I started using this product to stop the age/sun spots from getting darker while I saved up for a Laser treatment.  Well....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed within the first week was that my complexion was even.  No splotchy redness around my cheeks and nose anymore.  The age spots were still there, but my overall complexion was restored to a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was this product is NOT a moisturizer.  It does leave my skin feeling a little dry and itchy if I wear it alone (on weekends).  You have to follow up with your regular moisturizer or this will feel uncomfortable if you are prone to dry skin.  It wears well under makeup and doesn&#x27;t seem to interfere with my other morning products at all.  I put this on my clean face, let it dry, then my Primer, then my foundation mixed with my face moisturizer.  Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was in my routine I forgot about it and went on with my life.  About 2 - 3 months later as I was getting ready to put my makeup on and noticed that the sunspot on my face was gone.  Not diminished.  Not lighter.  Gone!  Knock me over with a feather this stuff actually worked! (That never happens!).  lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I see a huge improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles, but that could just be because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention.  So my advise to anyone using this product - give it time.  Give it MONTHS.  Yes, you will see immediate results in the first week with your skin tone - but that&#x27;s just the tip of the ice-burg.  To see what this product can really do, you must give it time.  I wish I had taken a &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; photo, but I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to work (as nothing worked in the past).  But it does!</li>
    <li> Helps clear skin blemishes and aids in lightening sun damage.</li>
    <li> I received this free, and I also got the vitamin C and I was told to use both and I would right after my shower at night and I must say that I seen a improvement with my fine lines and the creases around my mouth and on my neck, it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
    <li> Amazing and reasonable  and natural ingredients</li>
    <li> still using, great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read and therefore been curious about Hyaluronic Acid to be very hydrating and giving a dewy effect so I gave this one a try.  This product doesn&#x27;t work as I thought it would.  After a few minutes, it feels like a dried gel and not supple.</li>
    <li> This with the eye gel and moisturizer makes my skin feel so great!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic serums, in general,  tend to sit on the skin and start to peel off when you apply makeup. I&#x27;ve been using in the morning  and it seems to absorb very well into the skin and causes no problems when applying a foundation.  But remember a little goes a long way.  It does&#x27;nt take much.  I have not been using long enough to review the effect on wrinkles.  I feel like it&#x27;s starting to help with the lifting and diminishing of fine lines.  Honestly need to use a little longer to see.  I&#x27;m pleased with how it feels on skin and works with the use of makeup.</li>
    <li> Using this in conjunction with the Oz retinol moisturizer, I only got very bad adult (cyst-type) acne! Never again!</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoyed this product. Can tell you more in one Month.</li>
    <li> Have used it with Revitol for 1 month but have&#x27;nt noticed anything - will continue until its gone and see if there are any results</li>
    <li> My Skin feels fresh and replenished after I apply it.</li>
    <li> Not clear as to what purpose this product was suppose to do?</li>
    <li> Very good serum but I am a fan of all the OZ Naturals products and use them every day and night.</li>
    <li> Not very effective. I&#x27;ve used many hyaluronic-based serums/treatments and this is one of the few that I felt did absolutely nothing. Definitely not worth the price. Go to the drugstore and get Hyaluron instead by Indeed Labs. Much better.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It works wonders for my skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I&#x27;ve been using it for  about 2 months. I do see results.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for more satisfaction with my wrinkles &amp; skin lifting.  Following application instructions since 10/2/14, my even-Skin Color improved very nicely, lightly lifted my lower chin &amp; cheek area, but the wrinkles by my lip corner areas &amp; the center area of both eyes above my nose, are still noticeable. Once a day application was very well received by my skin, so I applied the nite time routine &amp; all has been well.  No reaction of irritations.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this Hyaluronic Acid along with my moisturizing as directed &amp; lets see what happens. It is not working as fast as I thought, but 30 days will so be here.</li>
    <li> Upon application one can feel refresh and hydrated. The serums penetrated into the skin rather quickly and easily. Do not really fancy the smell. Helps other products be absorbed into the skin more easily. Doesn&#x27;t really show any visible changes to the skin. Read more here http://ireviewuread.com/post/124472245723/oz-naturals-hyaluronic-acid-serum-review</li>
    <li> Just concerned that it wasn&#x27;t in an amber color bottle. Have not used it enough to know if it works.</li>
    <li> It really works on wrinkles.  What I do is put it on my wrinkles, let it dry and put coconut oil on the wrinkles only.  Then I put a light facial cream on all and blot with Kleenex.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I was worried about having Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid on my skin at the same time but I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 3 weeks and so far no change in my skin wrinkles, none.  Apparently it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I will not buy it again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of hyaluronic acid - I use it daily as part of my skin care regimen.  This is really great for sensitive skin, and will not prompt breakouts.  I use a Retin A cream for acne, and using this serum daily really helps keep my skin moisturized.  No more dry flaky skin!</li>
    <li> Excellent serum, just in time for winter! :)</li>
    <li> I am still not sure if this is helping me however I do like the feel of it on my face, soothing, fresh.  Mosturizer goes on a great with this. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It feels so good on my face.  I use my moisturizer right after I put this on.  It seems to sink right in my skin and not stay on the surface.</li>
    <li> I have used hyaluronic acid before, this one with vitamin C is nicer.  I like the way my skin feels.  I use it under serum and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff is ok. It is just frustrating cause there is still a good bit left in the bottle but I cannot get to it with the short dropper.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Also, a little bit goes a long way. It seems dry, but when you put moisturizer on top of it, it really seems to go deeper into your skin. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased HAs in the past.  Based on the reviews, I decided to give this one a try.  What I like:  the eye dropper for sanitary purposes of this product.  I also like that this is more of a gel consistency vs. a thin serum (easier to spread before it starts drying)  And lastly, the results.. basically what I expect from an HA… helps with my moisturizer and plumping up of skin.  Very impressed with the follow up by OZ Naturals…basically to ensure product was working ot my expectations, some recommendations to optimize use, and CS that if I had any questions or concerns that they were available.  There are lots of HA products out there…and although this is the first time ordering from OZ Naturals, I foresee ordering from them again</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin appearance.  I will not be buying a new bottle.</li>
    <li> i think this is make dry my face</li>
    <li> This is incredible. I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far and I can already see and feel a huge difference on my face. I have dealt with combination and sensitive skin my whole life and have dealt with acne and as a result have had scarring. My skin is already much less flaky and I wake up with a glow. My makeup has been going on smoother and my scarring seems to already be improving. I also deal with redness and this has reduced the redness on my cheeks. I am excited to see the results after using it more!!</li>
    <li> love it and works so i order again</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.....tightens and diminishes wrinkles</li>
    <li> I sensing that this whole thing is a hoax.</li>
    <li> Really works. Like it alot.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months, I am 66 years old, I have no&lt;br /&gt;lines around my eyes, not many wrinkles. I really know this product has helped&lt;br /&gt;my skin to rejuvenate. I just gave one to my secretary to start using.&lt;br /&gt;Update been now using this product for about 1 1/2 years, still love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product, more people should know about this formula for their&lt;br /&gt;face.</li>
    <li> Tried different brands from department stores. Ended up combining 3 different ones to combat different issues.&lt;br /&gt;This is all in one. Works for anti aging, wrinkles and to even slim tone. It also moisturizes well.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quick too. Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used other hyaluronic serums previously and have been very pleased with the product.  This is one product that will ALWAYS be a part of my facial care.</li>
    <li> felt different than what I had bought in spas and salons heavier and stickier.</li>
    <li> I have just turned 25yrs. Old.i just started my 2nd bottle. I swear by this product, being young I didn&#x27;t expect to see nor feel changes. After applying the 1st time instantly my face felt fresh, I soon felt as if it was tightening. Especially in my prob area (forehead) after a few days of use I could nolonger see my forehead lines that wer starting to appear. I stopped using the product for 3wks until I reordered &amp; even with discontinued use no lines reappeared. Ever since I started usin this ppl always compliment my skin. Best anti aging product &amp; thank u to all who reviewed before me or else I would&#x27;ve never tried this.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> I like how easy it is to apply and how little is actually needed.  Also, it dries quickly and then the oxytokin moisturizer can be applied</li>
    <li> I have only used a week; but I am very pleased with the product, especially around the eyes. (I also purchased the eye cream.)  I have been a renova/trentinoin cream user for 15 years with excellent results; however, the cream is getting quite expensive.  Although I still plan on using the renova/trentinoin cream, I am hoping that I can use less of it by using this product. I will see what happens after a month. The product can quickly, but then everything comes quickly with Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of change with fine lines, I have noticed that my skin feels smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle oil but it does help my face look more moisturized.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the way Oz Naturals works to help your skin maintain moisture all day.&lt;br /&gt;this is my second order for this product and I am pleased with the results.  Be sure to moisturize after using produce. Works best that way!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  My face feels firmer and more youthful ( at my age that&#x27;s a challenge)</li>
    <li> My skin felt dryer and lines seemed worse.  It felt like a thin mask on my face and that my moisturizer didn&#x27;t sink in.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum....goes on very smooth and feels hydrating. I do have to use moisturizer after applying, I haven&#x27;t seen less wrinkles but I will buy again</li>
    <li> feels good on the skin.  Can&#x27;t really tell a difference on my wrinkles.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, so this is the time to show &amp;#34;proof in the pudding.&amp;#34;  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin.  that&#x27;s a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  i&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now.  Love the way it feels on my skin.  Not irritating to skin or eyes.  Seems it may be making some difference.  Hard to know for sure, as I&#x27;m also using Nerium (day time formula) on my face.  But this hyaluronic serum can be used close around eyes.  I apply it all over my face, and some on neck....it spreads and dries easily.  Then after a minute, I apply my moisturizer.  Something seems to be making a difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with high hopes, but it was just like all the other products on the market.  I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice results until I used this consistently for a month.  Then I started to really see the differences.  My wrinkles were less prominent and my skin looked smoother, the color more even, and my skin looked healthier.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles when you first use it.  This is a great buy for the money and it does work.  Don&#x27;t give up.  Give it at least a month before you decide if it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> Love this, use it daily!</li>
    <li> Superb product!  The serum is not drying and does not cause the skin to flake or peel.  It is easily and quickly absorbed into the skin and minimizes pores.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will continue to buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating 3 because I have had it about a month and haven&#x27;t seen any lines/wrinkles disappear yet.  I can feel tingling when it is applied, but nothing else.  I am going to use it all to give it a fair chance to do as advertised.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Love my skin from using!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with the vitamin C serum and my face feels very smooth along with it retaining more moisture.  A great combination!</li>
    <li> WOW! I am new to this brand and I received it for review and let me say I am impressed!! I started out by doing a patch test and LOVED the texture of this serum. Once I applied it on my face, it was like a surge of moisture needed. There was no greasy residue or drying effects and in the mornings, there&#x27;s no shiny t-zone. I have sensitive yet combination skin and I really love this serum. Try this and I really think you will be hooked! I now am, just don&#x27;t tell my hubby!!</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old and am looking for a good anti aging serum to prevent aging but at an affordable cost. I couldn&#x27;t have choose a better one! This serum is so affordable, a great amount for the price, and most of all effective!  I dont have many wrinkles my I can totally tell it made a difference in the texture and tone of my skin! I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far and my skin is radiant and so soft! Its so awesome I&#x27;m buying my mom one for Christmas!  Buy it! Theres nothing you wont like!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It comes highly recommended. But don&#x27;t be misled by the 100% pure Hyaluronic acid. What they mean is 100% of a 1% solution. Pure 100% Hyaluronic acid is a powder. It would take tons of liquid to dissolve into a serum. Even 25% Hyaluronic acid would be a thick paste, and it would be horribly destructive to your skin. A 1% solution is the standard amount used by practically all manufacturers. It is proven to give the best results. The other 99% of the serum is made up of other ingredients that vary by manufacturer (vitamin C, E, aloe vera, emolients, etc,) As long as you can trust that it is a 1% solution (best to choose the vegan/vegetarian type, the non vegan/vegetarian type is made out of the roosters&#x27; combs, among other things), they&#x27;re all pretty much the same. Don&#x27;t be misled by all the hype and the price. Also, most people don&#x27;t know that Hyaluroic Acid can be taken internally (as capsules or as a powder, a very small amount dissolved into your favorite beverage). Internally, it is used to improve the appearance of your skin and, especially, to improve joint health. In your joints it pulls moisture into the joints, which has a lubricating effect. (Search for Hyaluronic capsules or Hyaluronic powder here on Amazon). You can even make your own serum from the powder, it comes with the instructions on how to do this. This is what I do, because it is much, much cheaper. You can even create your own Hyaluronic Acid at home if you&#x27;re so inclined. Check out how to do this on YouTube)</li>
    <li> great love it thanks---pt</li>
    <li> after years of throwing away my money on crap that didn&#x27;t work, I was really doubtful. I am 54 and have many little lines on my face. this product really does work! not only are the lines softly disappearing, but age spots are lighting, and my skin is very soft now. I am also using it on the back of my hands and they look years younger too!</li>
    <li> So soothing on irritated skin.  So moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin that is dry and irritated from using Retin A and acid peels etc. This stuff soothes my burning skin and moisturizes and heals without being greasy whatsoever. No grease, no oil, just cooling moisture.</li>
    <li> Also wonderful customer service, they give you great instructions and advise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use as directed and you will be amazed with the results</li>
    <li> i think this is my third time ordering it !&lt;br /&gt;i love it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often that a skin product delivers better than expected for me. Mostly disappointed.  This does not claim to fade age spots but I&#x27;ve had a stubborn one that has SIGNIFICANTLY diminished and my overall skin tone is more even. Wish I could say the same for the eye cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work at all. Don&#x27;t trust the reviews. I received an email asking for a good review or to email them instead if I didn&#x27;t like it. I buy all my facial products on Amazon and have never seen so many reviews of any product ever. I would never buy this again. It doesn&#x27;t do anything good or bad.</li>
    <li> I chose a 5 star rating because of the integrity of the seller. This serum is thicker consistency then most, easy to apply and has softened my skin.  That in-itself is more then I got from other similar hyaluronic products......However due to my smoking for many years with nicotine affecting my skin, Maximum results are not the fault of the serum. I am very pleased that the seller OZ emailed me and took the time to give explicit directions and info on this product. It arrived before the scheduled delivery date. I will continue to use it as I&#x27;m sure I have not given it enought time to work. Thank you.</li>
    <li> apparently it does not work well with my skin type, i have followed directions with no luck-so there will be no reorder.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any changes at all.  Not likely to order this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! at first I was hesitant because of the price for the size but I am quite pleased with how little goes such a LONG way!! I have been using it for a few weeks now and can see the difference in my skin already!! I will be 30 this year but my face sure doesn&#x27;t show it!!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wishes to improve the appearance of their skin! I don&#x27;t even wear foundation or concealer anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about 2 months and there is a noticeable difference.  The pores are very small and my skin feels firm.  I follow it at night with Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir, and in the morning with Eucerin Daily Protection, so they may be boosting the effect of the Hyaluronic Acid.  But I&#x27;m getting the desired effect!</li>
    <li> Love this serum, works great and is gentle and natural.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! With only one week I already see results.</li>
    <li> Worked faster than expected and I noticed an immediate improvement!</li>
    <li> fast delivery just as pictured.</li>
    <li> Being 68 I don&#x27;t think there will be much of a change.  But it does feel good on and I really have only been using it for about a month.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Not showing any  signs of improvement to my face  I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am about finished with it and I really can&#x27;t say that I see any difference.  My face appears the same as far as wrinkle&#x27;s is concerned.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Minimizes my fine lines and slightly plumps my skin. Absorbs quickly. Essential for the winter. Check out my blog at smoothlineskincare.com</li>
    <li> It makes my smile lines look smooth</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Feels a bit tight after applied and dry but I add some nice moisturizer and it works! Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It immediately goes into the skin making it feel soft and diminishing the look of fine lines. I use it daily and will reorder. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the ingredients in this product, hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am still waiting to see results but am willing to wait a little longer.</li>
    <li> I saw no results at all.  Additionally, I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it.  I just seemed like a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this or I am fooling myself I use this twice a day morning and night and this is actually  helping with my laugh lines I am pleased</li>
    <li> For me is very good ....:)</li>
    <li> I was an esthetician for over 4 years and have used my fair share of high end products (innovative skincare, skin ceuticals, pca, etc.).  I was a little skeptical at first, but just decided to give it a shot and I am so glad I did because this stuff great!  Highly recommended by someone who doesn&#x27;t waste time on a bunch of crappy products.</li>
    <li> Within a month of using this serum I could see a difference in my skin.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference using this--waste of money.</li>
    <li> I almost never write reviews, but I seriously cannot stop myself from writing this one. I am an extremely skeptical person by nature, and I always read the one star reviews and work my way up to the more positive ones so I don&#x27;t get overly biased. I actually laughed out loud when, once I ordered this, I received an email from this company giving instructions. It said many people see results in one day but maximum results are seen in 30. One day? Uh, sure.&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 and what I was most self-conscious of were the little lines I developed right above my lip. I am newly a grandmother but emphatically do not want to look like one! I used this product once in the morning, once again that evening. Next morning I went to apply it again, and was absolutely, positively shocked to see...nothing. No lines above my lip. I could not believe it. I am checking the mirror constantly still to verify that they are, at least for now, gone. I am not sure how this is possible but I am thrilled beyond belief. I will use this daily for a long time to come, barring any negative side effects, of course. $16 for something that my $30+ creams and serums never accomplished after months of use? It is almost ridiculous. I am a very happy woman right now!</li>
    <li> Same review. Expected too much</li>
    <li> makes your face dry... really dry and red... better to use another one -  OZ Naturals -  Vitamin C Serum For Your Face (brown color)</li>
    <li> Unsure of promised results</li>
    <li> addicted to this stuff........love how it penetrates the skin!</li>
    <li> My skin tends to have a lot of dark spots. I unfortunately get them from the Hispanic side of my family and I know it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ll always have to contend with. I&#x27;ve tried many different products to lighten dark spots, but honestly nothing works well. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum from OZ Naturals has been great. Not only are my spots fading, I haven&#x27;t been getting them anymore either. I usually end up with dark spots after a breakout, but instead my skin is brighter since using this.</li>
    <li> I have only ordered one bottle to date, but I saw results immediately.  It really pulls in your moisturizer and smooths out your skin.  My make up stays fresh ALL day long.  I get home and look in the mirror and everything is in place.  My acne has calmed down a bit as well.  It is a wonderful product and a great deal for the money spent.  I would highly recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> No noticable difference even after three weeks.  Would not order again.</li>
    <li> Best face products you&#x27;ll ever buy. I&#x27;ve had an adult onset of angry skin, clogged pores, breakouts. Was using Ole Hendrix. &amp; Weleda still, breakouts. Once I switched to OZ NATURALS regime,  my face cleared up, still working for me 3 months in. Very happy !</li>
    <li> I think it?s working, but one is never sure...It is, at least, inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Not sure it is doing what it states.  Oz is a quack in my book.</li>
    <li> I have such a dry face and I love how this makes my face feel. The tightness goes away and my face moisturizer goes on so much better.</li>
    <li> I ran out of a product similar to this, but thought I would do a search, to try something different. I took a chance and bought  OZ naturals, it was less expensive than what I had been using. To my surprise it was great!!! I love it and would recommend to any one looking for a serum.Best</li>
    <li> Used it for 2 weeks now and I do see a difference in not only the fine lines and wrinkles, but the texture of the skin. will definately order it again.</li>
    <li> I waited till I was on my second bottle to post a comment on this serum. I was skeptical at first about the efficacy of the product but after using about half of the first bottle, I was convinced, my wrinkles seem to have diminished and my face appeared brighter. Kinda looks like I did a photoshop on my face! Even my husband commented that my face looks better!!! Always remember to use a moisturizer right after you apply the serum, that&#x27;s how it works. It helps that you get an e-mail informing you of how you should use the product, in my opinion that is great customer service!</li>
    <li> I can tell a huge difference in my skin tone and lessening of deep wrinkles after just two weeks! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this product, although I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks, so I&#x27;m not sure it has made any impact on my face, neck or chest. Feels smooth on skin with a light fragrance. I would have given more stars if they wrote an expiration date on the product. Instead it says &amp;#34;expires 2 years after purchase.&amp;#34; I doubt they are keeping track of this.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I use it with the Oz Naturals Retinol moisturizer and I can see my skin tone has evened out after one week of use. And, I can see my skin continues to improve four weeks after use.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference from before and after used of this product</li>
    <li> I like how this product goes on and how it makes my skin feel. I have sensitive skin and this seems to be soothing for it. As to anti-aging and all of that, I dunno. I&#x27;m also doubtful about the claim that it is of &amp;#34;clinical strength.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just used for the first time last night. I cleansed my face and let dry, then I used this product followed by my favorite moisturizer. It felt really smooth but not greasy or oily. In the morning my skin felt plumped and hydrated! I really like it, but I will edit later as to the long term affect. I&#x27;m anxious to see what happens to fine lines, tone, and wrinkles!</li>
    <li> ok but you must have a good moisturizer with it</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 6 months ago and re-ordered bc I felt like it was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; at helping my skin appear more even toned when used in conjunction with other products. I just received my new bottle of product and after applying I noticed it felt very watery. I looked at the packaging and they re-labelled the outer packaging from abt 6 months ago, now with &amp;#34;5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum&amp;#34;. I feel like the initial propaganda around this product from OZ Naturals was misleading. There are many reviews about this serum stating the actual % of HA is misleading. I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I have tried several hyaluronic products but this is my favorite. It does actually help to plump your skin and fills in the wrinkle lines. Love it!</li>
    <li> With recommendations, I have used this product with the vitamin C serum for about a month now, my skin looks visibly smoother and plumper. i started with the two serums and will add try different products as my other products run out.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Goes on clean and absorbs instantly.  Not greasy at all but leaves my skin feeling like there&#x27;s something definitely at work!  I have dry/sensitive skin and this product completely agrees with my skin.</li>
    <li> I have just used it for two weeks and noticed little improvement. Hoping that will change</li>
    <li> Best serum!  Noticeable results in only days.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I have been on a hunt for the best hyaluronic acid serum, or really any serum, to inject into my morning/evening beauty routines. I read somewhere that women needed to start using these kinds of products by their mid twenties! OZ Naturals sent me some of the serum, and I&#x27;m being totally honest here, this stuff is AWESOME. What I love about it is that the smell is very mild, not perfumy--it&#x27;s straight up serum. It doesn&#x27;t pretend to be any other thing than do what it does! And I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a firming in my under eyes (I used to squint a lot before I got glasses). I would recommend this serum to anyone and everyone! It&#x27;s also incredibly affordable--in Walgreens Hyaluronic serum can go for 40-50 bucks a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product and the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for your face, I can honestly already see improvements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You So Much!</li>
    <li> Thank you OZ Naturals! I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for so long now, and I&#x27;m finally seeing relief with my skin. It&#x27;s only been a week but I like what I see so far!</li>
    <li> This particular hyaluronic acide serum is too thick. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just about a week my skin looks and feels great! Nice healthy glow....fresh...clean....Love it!!</li>
    <li> I am currently using OZ Natural Hyaluronic acid serum + Vitamin C serum (morning) and their Retinol serum (evening).&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, the texture of my skin slightly improved: pores have shrunk and the skin is smoother. Not bad but nothing revolutionary. Really.&lt;br /&gt;So, because I am using a combination of 3 OZ Naturals products, it is a bit hard to give a precise feedback on 1 product in particular.&lt;br /&gt;Each morning, I use first the Vitam C serum then this one and a day cream. I feel Ok with the discrete results I obtain from these inexpensive products but it is the first time I am taking care of my skin. To resume my point: cheap price products for not very significant result: Fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else: One think to know: I&#x27;ve been attracted to buy OZ products because they have a great amount of very good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;Because when you buy something from them, they send you emails that encourage you to leave a good comment. When you do, they send you free samples! Nothing to see with the quality of their products that, to me are &amp;#34;so-so&amp;#34;as I already explained. I never played that game because I don&#x27;t find it fair.&lt;br /&gt;To resume: good comments &#x3D; free samples... and what about product real quality??</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 stars because that is the way it was presented....not based on my usage of it. What interested me was the fact that they talk sooo much about the importance of Vitamin C on your skin and saw that this one offers 22% instead of the 10 percent that I was using.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it one time since I got it yesterday and plan to give it my best and I really am excited! I guess we shall see!</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals have become my favorite product line. I love this Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I feel that it really plumps up and hydrated my skin. I noticed an improvement around my smile marks- they don&#x27;t appear so deep anymore :) I use the eye gel first (also apply some of that eye gel around my lip area), then I apply this serum followed by the Youth Cream. I also like the hydrating mask as well. I have been receiving compliments on my skin and I know that it has something to do with the products I am using. I also drink a lot of water and eat raw foods (80/20). There is no odor and it absorbs nicely into my skin. I am so happy this line is on amazon and is affordable.</li>
    <li> Great Product!! Recommended for all kinds of skin!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I just ordered my second bottle. I love the way it  makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> I have used almost all of the product now. Not to satisfied with it . It seems to asorbe into the skin nicely . Although I have yet to see any results . I have used EPY-Silk before this product . I thought I would try and use a less exspensive product . No to satisfied with the outcome . I guess you pay for what you get</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for a month. Still waiting for results</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a hyaluronic acid serum for some time now that doesn&#x27;t feel gummy or cost $100 dollars. Hyaluronic acid really has improved the texture and condition of my skin, and this serum is outstanding (not to mention incredibly budget friendly). My skin looks great, it works wonderfully under makeup, and didn&#x27;t break my bank. Don&#x27;t waste money on pricey stuff - it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers or come in a flashy bottle or have a designer brand name, but this is truly a great product.</li>
    <li> From start to finish I&#x27;m very pleased.  My order shipped on the date I was given.  I was a day late but I was due to the New Year.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day. After washing my face I apply a small amount  then use a good moisturizer.  I was a little secptial.  To my surprise my skin tone is more even an smooth.  The crows feet by my eyes are softer,  I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks I&#x27;m excited to see the results  after a month !!!</li>
    <li> I got a bottle with cloudy fluid inside, which is different with the picture showing on amazon.com.  I sent email to customer service and they explained that it is supposed to be cloudy.  Actually customer service proactively sent an email to me first to ask how I like the product and whether I have any question.  The product seems effective so far.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really notice a difference, I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for about a month. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this particular brand has a lot of other ingredients.  Therefore, maybe not as potent as it could be.  I do like that it dries quickly and not real sticky.</li>
    <li> Really a nice serum for the face; it is not sticky or gooey at all on the face.  My makeup goes over it with no problem at all.  I love their Vitamin C serum too.</li>
    <li> This was promptly mailed and arrived on the 2nd day of order. I have been using it for more than a week and have not noticed any changes. Wondering what the hype is about. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many serums, this ones has immediate results.  The minute I put it on my skin, I felt refreshed and my skin looked clean, clear, no tiny lines, and radiant.  Thank you for the best serum out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using a VitaminC product that is six times more exoensive. I get more action out of this one!</li>
    <li> I liked this, but did not see or feel the moisturizing effects that were advertised.  It is still a fairly good product, though.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does what it says.  My skin is very sensitive and this is the first serum that does not burn or irritate.  it dries very quickly so that it is not an issue when I apply my makeup on over it.  I actually use it on my hands and neck area as well and it has made a big difference!  You have nothing to loose with this product and I am a big skeptic of items advertised.  This isnot ne of them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to know how well this product works. It does feel good when it goes on. I keep using it and hope I see results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews ever but I want to share how awesome this serum really works. I have worked in cosmetics for 20+ years ( high end department stores ) and have tried just about every cutting edge expensive cream there is. Ladies give this serum a try... Hyaluronic acid is the secret weapon when you have expensive facials by professionals and has been my secret weapon since I know what ingredients are in all those expensive creams. I have great skin at 53 and find this brand about the same as a high end priced and labeled hyaluronic serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean your face well and never use a harsh drying facial cleanser, apply serum all over neck, face, around eyes carefully (I also apply carefully close to my lashes to get all of the fine lines - always test to make sure you are not too sensitive on any product especially near your eyes)  Wait for about 4 or 5 minutes then MOISTURIZE. This is an important part to get the really great results. I personally always use a GOOD MOISTURIZER (all natural or marine based)  In the evening I never skimp on moisturizing since this is when your skin repairs itself while you sleep. I have used several expensive serums and find for the price this brand is great! I use it am &amp; pm... I will definitely continue using this brand for the price and it&#x27;s working for me. ;)))</li>
    <li> Love it! Had used another hyaluronic acid before that didnt have vitamin c in it. Both my mother and I decided to try this together (me mid 30&#x27;s, her 60&#x27;s) and it has really made our complexions glow!</li>
    <li> I love this serum!!! I have used it 2 daily for a week and am amazed how my skin looks and feels so firm!!! Will be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was the &#x27;best yet&#x27; but haven&#x27;t seen the results I want.  I am 64 and have good skin, but I&#x27;m starting to see the fine lines and wanted to combat them.  The directions say you should see results in one or two applications, so far not so.  I will keep using the product hoping it will do the trick and if it works I will write back and change my rating.  I have only been using this serum for about a week.  Good luck ladies.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say thanks, this product is great for my skin.  It&#x27;s very much helped my dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> I have used 3 bottles already .&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this since January 18, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I am 37  I have fairly good skin&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing some faint wrinkles around my eyes  wrinkles under.&lt;br /&gt;So got this due to the reviews but was skeptic.&lt;br /&gt;I put  this stuff all over my face twice a day&lt;br /&gt;In the morning after the shower ,let it for it to try maybe 5 mins and then put rose hip oil and then a sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;In the evening after I cleanse my face with a neem cleanser . I apply a think layer let it dry apply organic avocado oil as my moisturizer.They apply an eye cream mixture vitamin E oil 100%  and Evening Primrose Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing results in 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Not one two day like someone say.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 4 months and I have no wrinkles around my eyes&lt;br /&gt;Not quite sure how it gets rid of them, but I am happy ?&lt;br /&gt;I think it plumps  the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll continue to use it. Ready to order a couple more bottles :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone skin is different.&lt;br /&gt; I believe for great skin  you have to :&lt;br /&gt; drink plenty of water&lt;br /&gt; health eating style (lots of fruits, vegetables and fish)&lt;br /&gt;2.Exercise. Regular exercise maintains healthy circulation and blood flow throughout your body, including your skin. If you&#x27;re exercising outdoors, though, remember to wear a sunscreen on your face that protects against UVA and UVB rays or use a moisturizer with sunscreen protection.&lt;br /&gt;3.Quit smoking. Studies find that smoking prematurely ages skin by disrupting your body&#x27;s natural process of breaking down old skin and replacing it with fresh skin. Smoking also triples your risk of squamous cell skin cancer (not to mention numerous other cancers).&lt;br /&gt;4.Manage stress. Stress can negatively affect your face (and the rest of the body). Incorporate stress-relief techniques into your daily schedule; perhaps try meditation or yoga or even just a relaxing bath atthe end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;5.Create a good skin care regimen. This one may seem more obvious, but don’t overlook the importance of daily cleaning and moisturizing. Use a gentle cleanser and find a moisturizer that suits your skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this all helps</li>
    <li> Love it!!! I see a big difference. Positive results. Not too oily. I will Order again. I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> As far as I can see it appears to be working, I have read the results from this product so I am trying it. great service and timing in getting this product.</li>
    <li> All this serum does is allows for creams etc. to be absorbed better...I used the bottle as recommended and did not see any difference in lines or wrinkles....wishful thinking!!  after it soaks in and the creams also soak in...your face feels soft...but it is still a wrinkled and will turn into a matte finish within a few hours...but it is cheap...so just reapply</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t used all of the product yet . I haven&#x27;t had any adverse responses.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to be able to purchase as a retail provider. Can you provide information? Also&lt;br /&gt;Need serum for scars.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was going to give it a few days before writing a review, but I&#x27;m on day two now and I can already see and feel a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m 36 (almost 37) and though my skin is in great condition for my age (I look younger than I am, and I&#x27;m hoping that continues!!) I am seeing the years around my eyes. What can I say? It happens. :) I apply the serum to my entire face in a very thin layer after cleansing and using my toner, and then immediately follow with my Q10 moisturizer. My face felt warm after the first use, not at all painful - but warm, and I knew immediately that it was doing it&#x27;s thing and working it&#x27;s magic. Last night after I washed my face before bed, I could already tell my skin looked smoother - nothing over the top dramatic, but it looked smoother and more even. This morning I again did my new face wash ritual, and after moisturizing and applying my makeup, I was SO happy with how my skin looked, especially around my eyes. I highly recommend this serum- especially to those of you who care about your skin, and also what you PUT on your skin. You may not really think about it, but your skin is your largest organ, and literally it absorbs what you feed it - it actually EATS what you&#x27;re using. You really have to think of it no differently than what you put in your mouth. Your body absorbs chemicals, parabens, false additives, etc. This serum is all natural and that is the # 1 reason I ordered it to begin with. The fact that I feel safe using it, AND it works - double bonus!!! On top of that, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced. Order it, you will be a happy camper.</li>
    <li> It did improve my skin quite a bit.</li>
    <li> seems to do the job for which it was intended.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes at all.It didn&#x27;t do anything felt like i was using water.I would not buy it again or tell anyone to buy it.Sorry!</li>
    <li> Works well but not as well as I thought it would..Too expensive to use on a long term basis would continue use if less expensive.</li>
    <li> Did not see a significant change with my skin since purchasing this product.  I was dissatisfied with the lack of results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for three weeks and I see absolutely no change in my skin. I bought two bottles, so we&#x27;ll see..... I know these things take time</li>
    <li> This product was delivered much later than communicated. I was disappointed due to the delay and voiced my disappointment via seller feedback. The seller emailed me immediately after the negative feedback was provided. The seller apologized and explained the delay was due to the weather back east. Despite the weather being out of the sellers control, he took accountability and refunded my purchase. Despite the delay, I was extremely impressed with the customer service from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product once I received it, the serum has really worked great after just a brief period of time. It feels great on my skin and I already notice a difference. I&#x27;m a product junkie and I believe paying a lot for a product that can transform or preserve your skin is absolutely worth it, as it is extremely important to me to take care of my skin and body. However,&lt;br /&gt;this product is inexpensive and provides the same or better results that some expensive products provide. I&#x27;m very impressed with this serum and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Well...can&#x27;t tell if it does anything.  I have used it twice a day as instructed on dry skin before lotion for a few weeks. Doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as the 30% C serum I have used in the past (from a different vendor).  However, I am aware of the variation in how particular skin types respond to the same product.  Perhaps others have had better luck.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this and just love it. You can feel the tightening almost as soon as it is applied and then I follow with a good moisturizer or serum about five minutes later as they suggest. Really like this product.</li>
    <li> everything Is now soft and smooth... and silky... love this, product... I am a new user so, cannot be sure over the long term as of yet, bit for now... well worth the feel it is giving my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried three different products and this one by far is the best.</li>
    <li> Made me breakout terribly all over, even though  I have dry skin. I had no breakouts before using this product, and now have terrible spots all over my forehead and deep cystic pimples other places.</li>
    <li> After buying this product, I received an email reiterating the proper use of the serum.  I&#x27;m thankful that I did and appreciate this attention to detail from OZ Naturals.  If I&#x27;m going to shell out money for a beauty aide like this, I want to use it properly for maximum results.  Following the application of the serum (a little goes a long way), make sure to slather moisturizer over your face.  I apply the serum at night, so top it with a heavy duty night moisturizer.  After three uses (once per week right now, but I could use it more frequently), I received the first comment from a 20-something co-worker, asking me (I&#x27;m 48) what I&#x27;ve been doing differently as I am looking more radiant!  OZ Naturals is the only thing different in my regimen.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it feels great on the skin</li>
    <li> I super love this one.in fact this is my third bottle already! I&#x27;m happy and satisfied of this product!</li>
    <li> Through years of neglect and hard living I suppose ... I caught a case of fritos on my bald pate a while back. It&#x27;s like I dumped the remnants of an ate through frito bag on my head ... sandy, nasty crumbs and stuff that on closer inspection look like little fritos. I noticed it myself first just scratching my head and didn&#x27;t think much about it. Then, other people like my wife started to notice it and say stuff like &#x27;ewwww, that&#x27;s nasty!&#x27;. I don&#x27;t look in the mirror much and that might be the reason I never got into moisturizers until frito head came upon me in spite of my wife&#x27;s years of advice which I failed to heed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I defoliated my head with a wire-like scrubby and pumped on the usual moisturizers like she said. No change. Then, I stumbled on this stuff by scientific accident and said to myself, \\&quot;Self. What the heck. Change up the goop.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I reach up to scratch my head now after a week ... no more frito head. It doesn&#x27;t improve my disposition but it does seem to knock down the fritos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star ... unexpected results</li>
    <li> Living in Arizona, it is good to find a product that after applying it on your face it lives up to your expectations it hydrates your skin and you can actually see the difference. It is the best ever in my experience.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  It doen&#x27;t leave a sticky film like other serums.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working what a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> After using this oil for about 6 months, people are beginning to notice the difference. I am told that I look younger. That makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it&#x27;s easy to use, pleasant smell, and I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritations.  I do think my skin looks nicer, but I&#x27;m still waiting, it has only been a month since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I think the telling sign will be how my skin looks in the winter after my nice tan goes away and I don&#x27;t see the sun for a couple of months.  I also use it on my hands at night, since a telltale sign of aging is your neck and hands.  I do see a difference in their appearance.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t opened so can&#x27;t rate the product.  It&#x27;s a gift for my sister.  Very well packed. I hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product everyday at night time i apply a small amount all over my face and it has worked very well on me my face feels vibrant, healthy, amazing,and looks radiant and yes i would recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my very honest opinion on this product</li>
    <li> loved it. I saw my skin improve as I was using it. I applied it twice, once in the morning and at night. It looks firmer, softer, and more livelier. My skin got the help it deserved. I recommend this product if you&#x27;re struggling to liven up your dull skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time but I can see a very nice difference in the &amp;#34;finish and polish&amp;#34; of the skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like how much product is in this, I dont like the smell but so fare i love it... I think it&#x27;s a lil messy and all come&#x27;s out once you open it but other then that it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I really like the consistency of the product.  I use it every night after I dermaroll and before I moisturize.  My skin has never felt softer.  I will be purchasing again once I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a beauty junkie, so I don&#x27;t usually re-purchase products.  But this is one product I have found myself re-purchasing every time I get down to the last few drops.  I honestly can&#x27;t be without this product, which is crazy, because I&#x27;m adventurous with my product usage, and love to try new things constantly.  This is the ONLY product in my beauty arsenal that I use every day, twice a day, and would not be without, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you have an idea of my skin type and situation, I&#x27;m  37 years old, with combination skin that tends to break out on occasion.  It can be sensitive and dry in the winter, and oily and acne prone in the summer.  This product helps whatever product I&#x27;m using at the time sink in and perform better.  I know this because I&#x27;ve switched it up and tried using the same products without this serum and they&#x27;re just not the same.  In my book, that&#x27;s a huge plus, because it works no matter what my skin situation is at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the lightening fast shipping.  With Amazon Prime, I&#x27;ve never had to wait more than two business days for the product to appear at my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, there are very few products out there that are able to perform beautifully on all skin types, work well with whatever products you&#x27;re using at the time, and show up at your door with lightening fast speed. These three factors make it a must have staple item.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite skin serum.  I use it twice a day and noticed a huge difference in my skin quality.  Worth every dime.</li>
    <li> I really like how it feels and my skin looks better right after I put it on.  But I think I need better moisturizer to go on top of this...</li>
    <li> Not at all.  Seems just another Hype from the good Doctor Oz.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything  for  me</li>
    <li> I have been putting different moisterizers, vitamin c and hyaluronic on my face but when I added OZ Naturals on my face seems like my face said, &amp;#34;Thank You Jesus!&amp;#34; My face looks so amazing after just a few uses. I will be buying this again and again!</li>
    <li> I will not purchase this item again.  I have noticed no changes to the texture or look of my skin.  All be it that I look great at 43, but it did nothing for my fine lines.  Not a product I&#x27;m inclined to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well</li>
    <li> I am please with this product.</li>
    <li> been using it for a couple of months.  Don&#x27;t notice any difference in my facial skin.</li>
    <li> this is fantastic.  It goes on smoothly and I am sure I can see a difference</li>
    <li> I bought this cosmetic because I thought is natural and organic. After using half of bottle I have shortness of breath, I checked the ingredients. The sodium benzoate wich cause lack of oxygen and can cause cancer in a long run according to naturalnews.com and many other reliable sources.</li>
    <li> I used it for a full month to really test its efficacy. My conclusion is mixed: it does give a tightening sensation when it dries, but that is due more to the additional ingredients than to the HA in the serum, so I don&#x27;t like that. My lines in forehead and between brows are not showing any marked improvement, especially compared to other serums I&#x27;ve used before.  I don&#x27;t think that I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff right there!</li>
    <li> This actually works!  I was skeptical b/c it&#x27;s Mr/Dr Oz, but pleasantly surprised how it has plumped up my laugh lines (and the frown lines between my eyebrows my last boss gave me!).</li>
    <li> Not sure if I can tell a radical difference but I do think it is helping my skin tone. Not an irritant for me, will try another bottle.</li>
    <li> You know, I think this is pretty good but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s terrific.  I&#x27;m not seeing/feeling a great difference in my skin but having said that, I take pretty good care of my skin anyway.</li>
    <li> Love it just love it thank you for offering at a great price I love Amazon</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and effective - I saw results in a week!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell weird, seems to work well. I like it and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to try out a vitamin c serum! I was a big tanning junkie in my younger days, so my skin nowadays.... It needs as much help as it can get!!! This serum has completely changed my face for the better!!! I&#x27;ve had people asking what kinda Treatment or doctor changed my skin Because the results were really that amazing and all it was, was this little bottle!!!!</li>
    <li> not sure I see a difference....it tends to dry my skin.</li>
    <li> Giving it time, my husband seems to think it is doing well around my eyes, crows-feet are reduced a bit, its early yet!</li>
    <li> Good price good product</li>
    <li> I bought it. I tried it. I saw no difference at all. Didn&#x27;t hydrate or moisturize. To say the least...I am disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Item arrived on time. Works great with my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way to watery, I don&#x27;t really see a difference using it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this at night for about a month and have seen some improvement in my skin.  Skin seems more hydrated and fine lines seem a little less visible according to my husband.  Going to keep using this product to see if there will be more changes in a few more months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks - my skin is softer and I have noticed a decrease in the appearance of my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; around my eyes !</li>
    <li> Great serum,my skin look smoother and brighter.I love it</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference and I will continue to use this product . It&#x27;s one of those things if you stop using it you can tell it helps</li>
    <li> For $17, how can you go wrong? This serum absorbs quickly and cleanly into skin and very little goes a long long way. I&#x27;ve found that I use about half of the moisturizer I was also which, likewise, absorbs much better and feels more effective.  I recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Best serum I have tried. Felt good on the skin. Seemed to improve; not greatly, but noticeable my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works just like it said. You do have to put a cream on afterwards because it feels better, not so tight. I will be reordering it. A little does goes a long way</li>
    <li> Besides containing hyaluronic acid (which is a really effective moisturizer) this serum also contains Vitamin C, which has been known to brighten skin and fade sun spots. You will also find skin-loving aminos in this serum, that will also work with the other ingredients to even out skin tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only will this serum lighten and even out skin tone, but thanks to the Hyaluronic acid in this serum, it will diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles too, making it the ultimate anti-aging  serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try out this serum over the last month and was more than pleased with my results. Just before I started using it, I noticed a super dry patchy area on my forehead right above my nose, that was starting to peel and look nasty even through my makeup. My regular skincare just wasn&#x27;t cutting it and delivering the much needed moisturizer my skin was craving. As soon as I started using this serum, I mean like the very next day, that super dry patchy area of skin that had been bugging me for the last week was completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I was completely taken aback by this. I&#x27;ve used so many products and got results over time, but I&#x27;ve never got such a quick dose of moisture to the skin as when I used my OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum! My skin was completely soft, supple, and plump by the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is actually extremely thick and you only need one tiny drop to cover your entire face. You don&#x27;t need to rub it into the skin like you&#x27;re use to if you use a lot of creams. Just pat into your skin, and you will notice your skin will feel less tight and much more moisturized right away! Just allow to dry before following up with your night cream (if you even need it)! I found that when using this serum I didn&#x27;t even need a night cream! I was getting all my anti-aging benefits from this super effective serum, as well as my much needed moisturize my skin needs, without having to use a second moisturizing cream!</li>
    <li> It seems to be working. But nothing overnight. After 2 weeks I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I really have seen a difference since I began using thus.  I  recently reordered the product.  The package was left by my door , and both bottles of serum were frozen!  Will it be any good?  I&#x27;m hoping someone will know the answer.</li>
    <li> I am 28 and started using this product approx 3 weeks ago. I can already see a huge difference in my complexion. I use OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid at night underneath coconut oil for moisturizer, and OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum in the morning under moisturizer with sunscreen in it. Highly recommend these products! I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in my slightly appearing wrinkles  (I AM only 28 after all), and a HUGE increase in the radiance of my skin. I figure you can&#x27;t start an anti-aging regimen too early!</li>
    <li> This product really helped several areas scrapped by my dermatologist.  The skin was still pink after a few months.  After using  those areas began blending in more after using this product.  Used on face, hands, and neck.  Instructions advise to apply, dry, add your moisturizer.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of beauty products with hyaluronic serum in it (it&#x27;s my absolute favorite....I&#x27;ve had it in creams, serums, supplements, and more!) -- and I have to say that I love this particular combo of ingredients.  Witch Hazel is near the top of the list and, as someone who loves it on its own, I really enjoyed its scent that came through.  The serum itself was thicker than any I have ever tried.  This is more like a gel....and I love this consistency more than the typical watery serum. I use this at night - after I remove my makeup, wash my face, apply toner, then this serum, then my nighttime moisturizer.  In the morning, my skin is supple and dewy.  I also like that there&#x27;s a 2 year shelf life. I received this in order to review and am already planning on ordering more!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product and so glad I read some of the reviews, it certainly has lived up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has it improved my skincare routine, it has hydrated my skin beautifully and makes it incredibly soft! I have super sensitive skin with some rosacea on my cheeks and oily skin that is prone to break-outs but this product has helped with both. I use once when I wake up before and once before bed. I can tell it is very good quality as it does not contain any drying agents and is nice for multiple uses without any greasy buildup or feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is on my &#x27;must have&#x27; list for my skin care now!</li>
    <li> I have a drawer full of serums and creams that just don&#x27;t work. This one us different. I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
    <li> I did not see any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I was using a different brand of Hyaluronic Acid and I love the OZ Natural! It&#x27;s great, I can see a difference. And the best part is other people could too. Two weeks from the switch, a friend complimented me on my skin, asking me if I was using something different. I will definitely be switching to OZ Natural Hyaluronic Acid</li>
    <li> This serum is a thick, clear gel that is completely odorless.  As is my normal practice, I initially tested this serum on the back of my hand.  I noticed that the formula absorbs quickly and produces immediate visual results.  There was a significant reduction to the fine lines on my hand so I couldn&#x27;t wait to have that same result played out on my face.  Over the past week I have noticed a significant result in the disappearance of the fine lines and wrinkles that I see around my eyes.  I am anxious to continue using this serum well into the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it surem oz naturals</li>
    <li> I use this with the Derma Roller. I am getting great results and will continue to use this for the way it leaves my skin smooth, even and soft.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time and noticed a difference immediately. Face was more hydrated in the morning. Did not have impressions on my face from the sheets. Amazing. Will continue to use and can&#x27;t wait to see how much more improvement I notice</li>
    <li> I bought this item on a hunch to see if all the jazz about it was true, and it was it seriously helps diminish the look of wrinkles and tightens up your skin!</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.... Which is good in the fact that it didn&#x27;t make me break out or cause any other problems, but bad in the fact that why did I waste my money? No improvement of skin. Fine lines, discolorations still there. Been about 3 months of use... Will finish my bottle, but doubt there will be any improvements.</li>
    <li> The Hyaluronic acid + vitamin C serum is a thick serum and you only need a few drops. The smell is organic and is quite pleasant. The overall feel of the serum is refreshing. I use it in conjunction with the Vitamin C serum after waiting about 5 minutes for that to absorb, then I apply the HA serum, followed by the Super Youth Eye Gel and Super Youth Retinol moisturiser.&lt;br /&gt;These products and Oz Naturals&#x27; cleansers are amazing and leave my skin looking smoother and clearer. Both affordable and quality products!</li>
    <li> This rich, odorless serum goes on cool and easy.  I noticed my skin seemed brighter after a week of using it and my neck seemed firmer! I did have a bit of peeling but that means something is working!</li>
    <li> I have just started using the product so it will be a while before I can really know how it performs, so far so good-. has not been harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of hyaluronic acid to help my skin look fresher and more youthful, and this is one of the best! It has a wonderful emollient texture that makes it easy and pleasant to apply, but doesn&#x27;t slow the drying. It smells like roses, and that&#x27;s a pleasant bonus. (I don&#x27;t like most product fragrances, but this one is light and natural). And, most important of all, it works wonderfully and causes no flaking, breakouts, or weirdness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should note: I apply this first and let it dry before I apply my moisturizer. The general idea is that hyaluronic acid pulls moisture into your skin and keeps it there; in itself, it does not moisturize. So I don&#x27;t know how well it would work if used in any other way, but it definitely helps my skin utilize my moisturizer and the difference is immediately visible.</li>
    <li> The list of ingredients in this product is impressive. It feels nice and smooth on my face. Although, I haven&#x27;t felt or seen much of a difference once I&#x27;m done applying it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> What a great product. I like that the ingredients are simple. I am tired of reading an essay list of ingredients in my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was allergic to the Hyaluronic Acid.  I used it and with Vitamin C for 3 weeks and woke up one day.  My face was red with blisters with a big blister under each eye.  It got worse after a few days and finally had to go to the doctor.]He gave me a cortizone shot and two prescriptions.  Now after 3 days my face, neck and ears have now started to clear up.  It was not your brand but it was one with the Hyaluronic Acid.  I urge all to be careful when wanting to try these serums.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you, Gail Tujague</li>
    <li> Very excited to see so many positive reviews about the product,I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new beauty stuff specially if it&#x27;s for my face. I first bought the Retinol Moisturizer and it feels amazing so I have high hopes for this serum. So far only applied it once, will wait to see results and update this review.</li>
    <li> I order this product twice and rhe first one arrived very good and the second I received without vitamine E and in different color and no box.  I did not feel confident to use it</li>
    <li> I mean at one time or another I did notice a glow or a extra glow in my skin, but now a days I don&#x27;t see anything about my skin that&#x27;s special. And I probably won&#x27;t be ordering any more of this product. But i still can&#x27;t say that I didn&#x27;t get any results for i could have gotten use to its results, or maybe my skin was already at such a good standard that it was only but so much it could do for me.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for one week; the only noticeable change is that my skin feels much softer, perhaps the serum aids in transport/absorption of the moisturizing night cream I have used in conjunction with the serum, which I would say is a positive.</li>
    <li> Ok , did not see any difference in my skin</li>
    <li> One day and i can feel the difference. My skin is really sensitive, especially my facial skin but i use it with no issue so far. Wringkle is start fading slowly, so it works. But i need more time to write a review accurately. Edit will come after i use it more</li>
    <li> Very thick and easy to apply to skin. The serum seals on the skin to locks in moisture.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days but I&#x27;m really liking this product.</li>
    <li> I just repurchased Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I liked the results!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try and review this product and I&#x27;m glad I did. I use this along with the cleanser and it helps keep my face looking younger and softer. I wouldn&#x27;t trade this for the world! It&#x27;s a great combination to use with the cleanser.</li>
    <li> It is definitely working.  In comparison to all the facial creams/anti aging products I have used, this one is working and the results shows.  I will be ordering two more bottles so I will always have it on hand. Thank you Oz Naturals!</li>
    <li> Did a great job at a reasonable cost. Use with moisturizer is a must. I will definitely reorder again.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating as I have seen a difference in the short time I have used product. I feel continued use will improve as I continue to use the product which is what I am hoping for.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. It&#x27;s very soothing and I have absolutely noticed a difference in my skin because it is so effective and drawing in the night cream I use on top of it. The vitamin C is wonderful on my skin and I love that it&#x27;s almost entirely natural ingredients. I have purchased it twice and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I saw results in just a few days and my skin continues to look better every day. I wanted the deep wrinkles around my mouth and chin to soften and they have. I&#x27;m delighted with the product! I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends and they have had the same experience.</li>
    <li> it makes my face feel really smooth after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;  I hope it working!  I guess I have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, wow omg should have bought something else, makes my dark circles more predominant, still very ugly..</li>
    <li> My skin is softer than my baby&#x27;s and my fine lines look smoother. My face looks more radiant than ever in my life and people always have thought I am younger than I really am (I am 33 and people think I am 26) but lately people have been guessing I am 24... wow! My skin feels amazing and I don&#x27;t think I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. I wash my face, tone, then use this serum, and then I use my usual eye and face cream over this. Plus, I quit tanning 4 years ago when I saw how my skin was getting worse... stay away from the sun people and quit smoking, that&#x27;s what I did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past month and like what it is doing to my skin along with my favorite moisturizer.  I would recommend it especially if yoiu are starting to see fine lines and a little sagging.  This product really helps and I think you will like it if you decide to purchase it.  Give it a try and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference. I employ several beauty regimens to keep my face looking young and healthy so it is hard to know what is actually working, but after purchasing this product I do see a marked difference so I am happy with that. I reccomend</li>
    <li> After one month I have not seen any changes. Although when I used pure Hyraulic Acid and a high quality Vitamin C cream together, I did see improvement .  Go figure!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for 5 months and just one word WOW!.  I am 54 this coming weekend and was taking a good long hard look at myself in the mirror and reviewing my beauty routine.  I have never sat out in direct sunlight as being blonde and fair skinned I burn very easily, but over time your skin looses its vitality and with modern day living, you need to keep on top of your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, and I know some of you will think &#x27;oh yes the drink more water thing&#x27; well let me tell you that I was not a great water drinker until I hit 50, and now I drink upto 2.5 litres every day and yes it does work, it keep me hydrated and improves brain function as well as helping to flush toxins from the body and supports my on-going healthy eating regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly your beauty routine is very important, I never go to bed without removing all traces of make-up.  I never use soap n my face, I use a good cleanser and toner.  To moisturise, I use this fantastic serum, which I found by accident on amazon which is the only place you can but this product and it is pretty amazing as it helps to plump out fine lines and acts as the carrier for both my day cream and my night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I use a facial scrub weekly, to remove dead skin cells and to brighten my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, I would thoroughly recommend this product, give it a try and you will be pleased with the results.  All my friends use it now, and when people guess my ages they say I look about 45, so a second WOW! so 54 is the new 45!</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent product! My face looks lifted, my pores look smaller and my skin tone is even! I love it, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> AWESOME, SILKY, SMOOTH, REFRESHING, FEELS TERRIFIC ON SKIN, SKIN LOOKS BETTER, FEELS BETTER,&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T USE A TON, JUST A BIT EVERY FEW NIGHTS BEFORE BED, DON&#x27;T OVER-APPLY OR IT LEAVES A FILM OR FLAKES, JUST A LITTLE...GREAT STUFF.</li>
    <li> I am noticing a difference in my skins texture</li>
    <li> Are all these reviewers just paid to leave good feedback? No difference seen with this even though I followed the recommended regime. Will not buy again. Does not plump skin, nor does it shrink pores, does not improve over long periods of time.</li>
    <li> I have already noticed the results from using this serum on my face! My skin is smoother and more youthful looking. I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> As good ad it gets. In a word...FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> I saw the difference after a few days.  Not only that, friends have commented on my skin saying I glow.</li>
    <li> Your skin will soak up this product and it feels pampering to put it on. Wish you got more for the price/</li>
    <li> I must say that using this thing feels good and smells good. Yet, I have not observed any effects beafter 5 weeks of diligent use (every night smeered on the eyelids, let it dry, then applied a moisturaizer for eyelids - the green gel purchased at Ulta). My eyelids did itch less, but the effect was just the same with the moisturizing gel without the Hyaluric Acid Serum.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It is making a big difference in my skin.It absorbs so quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff! It absorbs so quickly! Really am beginning to see a change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> This gel massages in well and is very soothing. It is working very well. I like it better than the NOW product which is a bit too gummy</li>
    <li> I have tried it all and this product seems to be doing its job. Makes my other products work better this is my second order just didn&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  It is one of the best serums I have ever used!  I use it morning and night and I will definitely keep ordering this!  Give it a try and you will love it.  I have super sensitive skin and find this serum perfect for my skin. Hope you will try it.  I am sure you will love it too!  Great for giving you clear skin and minimizing wrinkles. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference, very thick hard to get out of the bottle. I would not buy again .</li>
    <li> I like this product but would have reordered but I prefer the 2 oz bottle..Give me two different sizes to order from.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Every week my skin look more plump. Especially my forehead and the lines between my eyes.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see more immediate results.  Have not had anyone say they noticed anything any different but based on what you purchase at stores felt this was worth giving it 3 month try.</li>
    <li> I love this, it was packed well and exactly as pictured. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for something nice.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a week and have more time before I am to see good results. For now I can say the delivery by the company was on time. The box was torn and crushed a little but the bottle itself was intact. It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I work in the cosmetic industry,  and have used different serums from different lines.&lt;br /&gt;I combine this serum with my skin care system and I love the results. My skin looks so much healthy.  Highly recommend this serum, and the price is great,</li>
    <li> This is better than the prescription products (very $$$) that my sister uses from the dermatologist.  Price and quality are good.  This is my 3rd reorder.  Great for sensitive skin.  pwb</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product given the many glowing reviews.  I am almost 72 and have oily skin.  I have few wrinkles, but I have lost volume in the cheeks and jaw line.  I was hoping this serum would tighten my skin, as some have claimed; however, after three weeks of using daily I haven&#x27;t noticed any change.  It feels fine and my skin looks good, but not any different than it did when I used another similarly priced face serum with retinol (I am still using the same moisturizer which contains retinol and SPF 30).  I would like to purchase 100% pure or at least a higher concentration of hylaronic acid, but haven&#x27;t been able to discern the level of this ingredient in the ones advertised.  This product contains only 5% hylaronic acid, which I didn&#x27;t know until I received it.  I ordered two bottles and will use them, but will search for a higher concentration of hylaronic acid in the future.</li>
    <li> outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and information just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Skin is softer, smoother and plump after only 2 weeks.  I will reorder this product because it seems to do what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> At the beginning you can feel it working but after a couple of days the feel of tightness goes away.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything much, it&#x27;s more just some jelly serum and the squeeze straw thing, that is so old school. wouldn&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; serum, but I do feel it does what it is supposed to do, which is help deliver your moisturizer more deeply into your skin.  Dry skin does not have the glow of fresh, youthful skin.  Dry skin also allows your makeup to set into fine lines and wrinkles.  I apply the serum, allow it to try, and apply my moisturizer (I don&#x27;t use anything fancy - just the original Olay in the pink bottle, which I&#x27;ve used forever).  I do this morning and night.  In this Michigan winter where my hands are cracking they are so dry, this serum has provided me with soft, smooth skin on my face all day long.  As an added benefit, I need to use less of my liquid foundation.  After two weeks I don&#x27;t think I look younger, but my skin is soft, feels great, and has a nice glow.  I would never pay the full price they have discounted.  EVER.  But I would keep buying for twenty bucks or so, since it goes pretty fast using it twice per day.  I would also recommend it to anyone with normal to dry skin.  I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for someone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Just another con for vainly obsessed so......</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price. Follow instructions and you&#x27;ll love the product as I do. Use after using micro roller skincare therapy.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after one use. I use a light on my face at night then after I use this. When I wake up I swear it feels like I look younger.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Makes my skin soft but firm:) Will be ordering more for sure!!! I use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel very moist even in the dry rooms of winter. I use it with the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> Just Okay.  I&#x27;m over 60 and I saw no changes or improvement to my skin. I&#x27;ve found much less expensive products that do a better job</li>
    <li> I received these items with high expectations.  I have been using the,m for approximately three weeks now and I wish I could say they have changed my life, but ...I can honestly say that these three products:  OZ Naturals - THE BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin - Clinical Strength,  OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyaluronic Acid Serum- Clinical Strength 20% Vitamin C with Vegan Hyaluronic Acid and this product have produced minor results in my facial appearance.  I have used Olay products for years and see no difference between these three items and the Olay regenerist products I use normally.  I wanted to be able to give this a 5 star review, but in all honesty I cannot. I just feel it is not any better or worse than what is already on the market. I was hoping that at least one of these items might help to reduce the dark circles and puffiness around the eyes, but they do not do either.</li>
    <li> It is not Botox in a bottle, but my face is a bit smoother. I use Oz Naturals hyaluronic acid at night and Oz Naturals  Vitamin C in the morning.</li>
    <li> OMG BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED IT MAKES YOU LOOK SO MUCH YOUNGER! BUTTTT….MIX IT WITH A GOOD FACE LOTION BC IT WILL DRY YOUR SKY OUT</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now. My wrinkles have improved slightly. Make sure to read the instructions and wait for this to dry before putting you moisturizer on.  As it dries you can feel a slight tightening of the skin.  If I remember I will report back on any more improvement but for now I am pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I have beem using this for a week and i love the way it makes my face and neck feel. I can see the difference especially on my for head those little things that appear when i squink my eyes. Looking foward to seeing them get lighter and gone. I will write more in a few more days to give update but so far i love this moistururizing surem.</li>
    <li> I was given two Oz Naturals products to review, THE BEST Vitamin C Serum For Your Face and THE BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin. Both are do not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using both serums on December 14. Before using these serums my face was dry and flaky. My skin had a dull look to it. After using the products for two weeks my skin started to flake more around the nose and break out more on my chin and forehead. I messaged the company asking if this was normal and they were kind enough to explain the reaction and that it was the normal process of my skin detoxing from the chemicals I used on my skin before and that after 30 days things should clear up. I did notice my skin clear up and look brighter, the skin around my nose is still flaking though and I was hoping that would stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are easy to use, just use a small drop on your fingers and gently smooth into the face. The Hyaluronic acid serum is clear and is a thicker serum. The Vitamin C serum is clear and is more runnier. Neither really have any scent to them, at least not any that I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you trying this product out. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it might or might not work for you. You never know until you try.</li>
    <li> I love this Hyaluronic Acid Serum! I have tried others that were watery and did nothing. I like that this is thicker serum and it helps keep me from being so dry. Once it sinks in I do use moisturizer on top. I use this serum at night and in the morning my skin looks wonderful. I have had problems with redness and irritation for years but since using this serum my skin has calmed down considerably. Can&#x27;t beat this seller&#x27;s prices either!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks and I can all ready see a differance.</li>
    <li> The serum is silky. It plumps my fine lines and even the lines around my mouth and the two lines on my forehead that are medium fine lines. I would suggest wearing a moisturizer with it and only applying it to your lines.  It does have a shiny appearance, however, because it plumps those areas if you do wear makeup (I do not) I would think your make up would go on smoother.  When I put the moisturizer on over it, it just makes me look younger. I&#x27;m 39. I have dry skin and would never put this on my entire face all by itself, must use moisturizer with it.</li>
    <li> My mother bought this for me for Christmas and oh my god it&#x27;s MAGIC. I was gonna get plastic surgery before my mom got me this. Within a week I saw AMAZING results. If I wasnt so embarassed of the before picture id post it but guy seriously this thing tightens loose skin like a face lift would. I just cant express how grateful I am my mommy bought this for me :))</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the following products long enough</li>
    <li> I love this product and will buy more!</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful!!! Last year i suffered sudden eczema on my eyes and had a hard time calming it down. Due to how dry and sore they got and the continued use of a steroid cream, the skin around my eyes started to show signs of ageing (I am 25 years old). I was told that my age is a perfect age to start an anti-ageing regime with my skincare. So i was looking for something that would be gentle, effective and really keep the age off my skin. This stuff is truly a wonder!! It leaves my skin so incredibly soft. The lines that had appeared under my eyes since the eczema incident have all but vanished and my complexion is really healthy!! I will continue to repurchase this again and again. I am halfway through my first bottle and already have another one on the way along with the eye serum which i am eager to try out. I know that even miracle creams will not work for everyone but this stuff is really worth trying for yourself. I have sensitive pale skin and have had zero issues using this. I hope people who are on the fence with trying it will give it a go and see for themselves whether it is something you would like to make a part of your skincare regime :)</li>
    <li> This is my second order for OZ Naturals I love this product makes my skin soft and glowing I will order it again!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything but sent on top of skin. No change, very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I am 53, I write this because I feel its important to know what skin type this is being used on and the results.I have been using this serum for about a month.Both night and morning under a basic moisturizer. I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic reduction on fine lines and wrinkles at the corners of mouth and eyes even the deep frown lines between my eyes.I have ruddy complexion, and photo aging, my skin is smoother and evened skin color. Even my neck is much tighter. apply to moist skin . I love the results</li>
    <li> When I began using these products, I did so because of the reviews I read and because I had learned of this &amp;quot;dynamic duo&amp;quot; which is Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid. I chose the OZ Naturals products because they were best sellers in that area. After using creams and potions for decades and seeing no results, I found the more natural, the more simple, the more pure the product, the more results I saw as my face became more and more radiant and free of the sun damage I was accumulating. I was amazed at the transformation in virtually days. My friends were amazed. And so we had a party and used these products, which they are now ordering. I will never go back to overly expensive products that produce little to no actual results but a temporary mask. HA penetrates into my skin and I can feel and see the benefit. I will use this product as long as you provide it and am grateful for OZ Naturals and the purity and integrity of their products and pricing.</li>
    <li> I think this may be drying my skin out, second bottle but will not reorder, can&#x27;t tell a difference in wrinkles, but it coats the skin initially.</li>
    <li> I put this on my face after I wash and dry it.  Let it dry and put moisturizer on over it. It helps hold the moisture and brown spots are fading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. My skin looks so great!  The item arrived quickly too. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since Nov.2013. Now my husband start using it as well. My skin looks lot better and easy to use. With my busy schedule I cannot spend too much time for complicated steps. Then I found out about this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;On my second order, shipping was delay due to the weather. But they responded quirky and very helpful. I am very happy about their service and highly recommend this product. I know any great skin care products are not always for everyone but with their customer service why not try :)</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with this company who has had back orders. They are working very hard to make everything as right as possible. I need this serum as I like to try them all. I hope people will  continue to buy from them. They will communicate with you all the way to make things right. Thank you in advance for making this a great experience.</li>
    <li> First, I did not receive this in a timely manner, however, my concerns were addressed immediately! Secondly, the customer service for OZ Natural has been one the best I have ever encountered and lastly, when I did finally receive the serum, and had the oppurtunity to use it for a few days, I am currently pleased.  The point of Hyaluronic Acid is to retain moisture.  I use this as directed and the key is to let it completely dry prior to putting on moisturizer.  i have noticed that this product does help to retain the moisture in my skin and as I mentioned the customer service was prompt and direct.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with Time Rewind and I am certain it is the missing trick to helping that &amp;#34;ugh&amp;#34; look out of your face - when you really are just trying to stay fresh. I have only been using it for a few weeks but I feel like their products have given me enough results in this short period of time that I can honestly say there really is a difference. I&#x27;m not a big believer or trusting in facial products - rarely buy it at all, but now that I&#x27;ve entered the &amp;#34;not so young&amp;#34; time of my life, I did my homework and this is the stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat happy customer and believer in this product.  I rarely write product reviews.  I have rosacea and have NEVER had any success with skin care products.  Every product burned or irritated my skin.  I have done my research over 10 years to find ingredients that work for my sensitive skin.  This serum has dramatically soothed my skin and brought the inflammation down and nearly gone.  All the ingredients are similar to very pricey alternatives when it comes to treating inflammation.  Love that they are also all natural.  Tightens pores, clears and clarifies for someone with extremely sensitive skin.  Feels as gentle as water when applied.</li>
    <li> My product did arrive and I have been using it for a little over a week.  It&#x27;s hard to rate a product like this until you have used it for about 30 days or more.  So far I have not seen any great changes in my skin but I have really great skin already.  I&#x27;m just trying to smooth out the wrinkles some.  I will continue using this product until it&#x27;s all gone and at that time, depending on the results, I will probably re- order.</li>
    <li> My skin did not like it!  Became irritated , lots of redness.  I stopped using it.  Less expensive products work well for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to order this based on all the high reviews. My skin was very dry and I&#x27;d heard how great hyaluronic acid was for moisturization. When I got this the first thing I noticed was the smell. Not great. Not horrible but definitely not pleasant. When I put it on it came out as more of a gel than a serum also which was not what I was expecting. Getting a decent amount in the dropper was fun also due to the gel-like consistency. When I put it on my face it felt almost drying which I found very odd. I checked out the ingredient list and although I was pleased with a lot of good natural ingredients, I did notice witch hazel on there (higher than hyaluronic acid!) which is often used as an astringent. Perhaps that&#x27;s why. I used it for a few weeks but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. I&#x27;m only 28 so I don&#x27;t have many lines or wrinkles so maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t notice as much of a difference? Either way I tried the Cosmetic Skin Solutions Resurfacing Serum next which I found also has hyaluronic acid and I like that much better. That makes my skin feel more moisturized and also improves my skin texture. I really wanted to like this serum, especially since the price was great but I just didn&#x27;t see it doing anything for my skin. Not worth it. I&#x27;d rather spend a little more for something I see results with.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product which I use in conjunction with the Vitamin C Serum; I just recently started this product, but thus far I am very pleased! Oz Naturals always contacts you with directions for usage, and they are very helpful with questions you may have.</li>
    <li> somewhat greasy, kind of a strange smell but didnt irritate my skin and did feel smooth upon application., hopefully this will work out!</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of beauty products, what I like about this one is that it does moisturize but is not greasy. I am using it in combination with Thalgo relaxing cream and have really been happy with my skin. I have had no breakouts at all since using this product (usually I break out during or right before my period) and my skin is still hydrated. For the price I think it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> i like this product alot, been using it for only a week so i havent seen any changes but my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Great product, and company sent a detailed email with directions and recommendations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for some time and hasn&#x27;t done anything. Not only that but today I was browsing on reddit and found this link clearly supporting my feelings towards this product: http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/2qwlqo/has_anyone_tried_the_oz_naturals_hyaluronic_acid/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. It&#x27;s not as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Your skin looks radiant and smooth.</li>
    <li> This serum works great for adding moisture and plumping the skin around my eyes so my wrinkles are barely visible! Plus, it meets my high standards for being pure, natural and cruelty-free which is hard to find in a skin care product that actually works!</li>
    <li> Great Anti-Wrinkle serum.  This serum plumps all the little lines in the corners of my eyes and my laugh lines.  This hydrates my skin like no other.  This Serum is Vegan and cruelty free which is amazing.  Im very careful with what I put on my face and this stuff is great.  My eczema around my nose and hair lines is completely gone.  This stuff works wonder!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m almost 56 and I look about 38.  This is a vegan made product so I know that it is not harmful to the environment and it is cruelty free.  Thank you Oz Naturals!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this serum since I use and love oz&#x27;s vitamin c serum... But it caused acne breakouts on my face, and since I used about 1/3 of the bottle trying to convince myself it wasn&#x27;t the cause, I didn&#x27;t feel like I could return it.  I added the remainder to my body lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  This is recommended by my skin specialist but is available here at a much better price.</li>
    <li> This is a scam.  Do not buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my sensitive soft and breakout free, I use with my derma roller for anti aging treatment, I prime my skin with matching toner, so far the results have been great I use once a week.</li>
    <li> Good, but not results as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost at the end of this bottle and I will definitely order this product again.  It seems to give my moisturizer a little extra oomph. I&#x27;m very happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> Anything Dr Oz is a ripoff</li>
    <li> I have seen a change on my skin. It is better hydrated. My skin on my neck appears to be smoother.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My skin is glowing and smooth after using this product. I don&#x27;t really need put moisturizer. Hydrates skin well.</li>
    <li> I hate to run out of this stuff as it’s my skin&#x27;s lifeline.  It works well within the first few days but is incredible after a few months.  I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle now and my skin (age 45) looks better than I can remember. The customer service is some of the best I&#x27;ve yet to experience both on and offline. These guys know what they&#x27;re doing!</li>
    <li> I respect Dr Oz.  so when I saw him raving about this product  thought I would try it.  Amazing! Almost immediately I saw improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it at night before I go to bed.  Put a thin layer over my face wait till it dries then put moisturizer on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am on my second bottle and the wrinkles around and under my eyes are dramatically  reduced or gone.  Nothing to lose so try it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the Best Vitamin C Serum and I love how they both feel on my face and neck. I am starting to see reduction in my fine lines!</li>
    <li> Wish this item mentioned the witch hazel ingredient since I am allergic to it. Might be best to list all ingredients inside and not just the hyaluronic acid.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this but it broke my face out.</li>
    <li> So good.  They plump up my face.  With makeup, my skin looks great.  Just started using.  Stay tuned for more updates if necessary.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought anything from OZ Naturals.  I have heard so many great things about using Hyaluronic Acid on your face, so I got on Amazon and did my research.  I found that OZ Naturals had the highest reviews &amp; ratings for their HA, and so many great comments on the results their customers are experiencing using this product.  The price is also very affordable, and it is 100% HA.  They shipped it to me very quickly, and I was very impressed with a followup email, asking me if everything was okay with my product, delivery, etc., and also if I had any questions about the product.  I did have one question and sent an immediate email back to Angela.  Within an hour, she had responded back with my email with the info I needed &amp; was very nice &amp; professional.  I am very excited to continue use, for I too, have already noticed my face feeling &amp; looking more moisturized.  It absorbs quickly into your skin and feels great!  I am definitely a happy customer!  Thank you, OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> Three days of using this product I see a huge difference. Ski texture is improving and fine lines disappearing! Definitely can&#x27;t wait to see the results with continued use!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference I have been using this product for almost 4 months purchased 2 of them using this product faithfully very drying without a moisturizer don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this product...I don&#x27;t feel like it has lasting results (in other words, I don&#x27;t know that it actually REDUCES lines or wrinkles in any kind of permanent way), BUT, when I use it and then put face cream over it (as recommended on the bottle), I absolutely feel like my face looks fresher, less lined, etc.  I&#x27;m 44 years old--I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin and I finished the entire bottle. Will not be repurchasing. Still in the maket for a better product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to use before bed. My skin feels refreshed and rejuvenated every morning.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, NO ONE CAN GUESS MY AGE NOW. AWESOME SERUM!</li>
    <li> I really think it works. I have been using it for almost a month and I intend to order more</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF...PERIOD. I thought I could detect a difference with the first use. It has made my skin smoother brighter and helped to fade dark spots. I also use thier vitamin c serum as we&#x27;ll. Be sure you use sunscreen!! I LOVE OZ NATURALS!! And nobody gave me free anything...I did research and decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I think the bottle with the orange writing was better</li>
    <li> I Love, Love, Love this stuff!!  my skinn hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s.  I will never stop using hyaluranic acid, I&#x27;m glad I came across this beauty in a bottle!!!</li>
    <li> The title of the product listing includes &amp;#34;Facelift in a Bottle&amp;#34; implying it has the effect of a medical procedure.  Has the FDA approved this product as an over-the-counter drug?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product shows a 72% discount from $67.95 to $18.99. Yet on the Oz Naturals website the product is priced at $18.95.  So how is it that I am getting a discount?</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I used one from a different company.  Although, I also got instant results even from the other company, I like that this is a slightly thicker consistency and I  got more for my money.  I have combined it with using the Derma Roller and I just can&#x27;t get over the wrinkles are filling in and the texture of my skin looks years younger!!! I have purchased some for my sisters!!!</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped for in this product!! Love it! My skin looks so much softer and younger and I will continue to use it every day!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading about Hyaluronic Acid in a health magazine. It made my face feel soft and smooth right away.  I am 66 years old and my face had fine lines around my lips and on my cheeks.  I was amazed after two weeks when I noticed that the  lines seem to be fading away.  I really had to look for them.  I wonder if I stop using the product, the lines will return.  I&#x27;m thinking yes so I will be using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> Made me break out the first time I used it. Very sad about it. I&#x27;m hoping with continued use it is just clearing out my pores and will work wonders on my skin like the reviews said online.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for six weeks, and I absolutely love it!!!  My skin is so soft, and glowing.  I love to wake up in the morning and apply OZ Naturals to my face and neck.  A must have for women, a definite confidence booster!</li>
    <li> I am such a sceptic. I tried this and just love it.  I put it on every night after my night moisturizer has time to set. Actually right before bedtime. My face just seams so much smoother and honestly looks so much healthier. I put about a dime size in my hand and dot it all over my face barely rubbing it in. I pay special attention to the area of fine wrinkles, near my eyes and upper lip .  I have been using it for about two months and it will probably last me about 8 months. I love it.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about buying this product but I was reading the reviews and was sold on it. This stuff is amazing! My skin felt so smooth after applying this under my moisturizer. My face is not as oily as it use to be. My skin feels and look smother. I have purchased my second bottle. Good stuff! I now want to try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I love this Hyaluronic Acid Serum with C.  I use it as part of my skin regime.  I have derma pen treatments monthly and I use this everyday.  Excellent product for the money.</li>
    <li> Skin texture has improved, smoother and softer, also feels clean and refreshed. Also use a light moisturizer. Just a dab daily, both morning and night has made a difference. Very pleased with results.</li>
    <li> Applying with the derma roller, followed by a collagen mask.  Really working as lines are softening very quickly.  I smoke so the lines around my lips are prevalent.  With the derma roller and this stuff followed by thick moisture cream, I wake up to not so many lines!</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C out there, feels good on my skin and refreshes my skin with a bit of tingling and feels good and healthy!</li>
    <li> I bought the second one but of course I still have the same rinckles. Going to keep using it to see if something interesting will hapen with my face.</li>
    <li> Great product for hydration and over all skin condition. I have been using twice a day for almost 3 months and haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of fine lines improving, but it helps other skin issues for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get how much of a different experience I&#x27;ve had with this than so many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I don&#x27;t know why they call it a &amp;#34;moisturizing serum&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s VERY drying.  I always put moisturizer over it.  Both my husband and I tried it for about six weeks and it showed no improvement with the dark spots  or anything else for that matter.  It was just a waste of money and time.  Yuck</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks and am happy with what it is doing for my skin.  It feels soft and smooth after i use it.  No stingy or foul smell.  It is thick like a gel and has great coverage.  i will continue using this and plan to reorder when I run out.  After 2 weeks of using (I only use it in the evenings, a few drops) the bottle hardly looks as if I have used any so it will last for a while.  After I put this on and let it sit for a few minutes to make sure it dries, I then apply my moisturizer over it. Great product, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully. Prompt service and I will order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my wrinkles...not anything!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that I waited for a very long time for the product to arrive, it fails to deliver any differences in my skin. Will not buy again nor do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into serums (I just turned 37, am very fair, have some wrinkles and sun spots/freckles).  This serum definitely makes my skin smooth and a bit tighter and brighter, but I haven&#x27;t noticed super duper dramatic results (I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months).  I have naturally very dry skin, and after my shower I put a bit of this on and my face gets super dry, so it takes about 3-4 layers of lotion to quash the dry feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the golden-colored bottle, because I do like this brand and its all-natural ingredients, and think that it does work.</li>
    <li> I like this serum A LOT! Makes my skin feel fairly hydrated and soft. I prefer this over the hyaluaronic creams/lotions by far.</li>
    <li> Really made my skin smoothe and felt more toned. Used daily</li>
    <li> I have been using almost daily with moisturizer afterwards and I have noticed some difference in the looks of my skin.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchase of Hyalauronic Acid and I&#x27;m only using it for one week . I saw a positive difference in my skin after the first application .&lt;br /&gt;Next time I might buy a different brand just to be able to compare .&lt;br /&gt;Very good product .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend !</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old - I use the product daily - It is a must have! Makes my skin shinier and healthier and I see less wrinkles than prior to its use! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it twice a day and see no difference in my skin as of yet.  It&#x27;s been three weeks.</li>
    <li> At this point, I have just used this product five times.  No problems.  Apply the serum before your face completely dries (from washing).</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see that it does anything to hide or subdue wrinkles. It is surely benign, does not harm to skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Thank YOU to OZ Naturals for sending me their Hyaluronic Acid Serum to test out. I am very attracted to the OZ Naturals line (and of course I’m a huge fan of their Vitamin C serum) because of the essential ingredients list and that there are no filler items like parabens, sufates and alcohol. I’ve purchased my second bottle of Vitamin C serum! I really looked forward to trying their Hyaluronic Acid Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love how this serum can be used daily and works well with my sensitive - yet acne prone skin. Ugh, living with my finicky skin sucks. I have used the serum once a day for 3 weeks and my friends have asked what I have been doing differently. I told them I stopped wearing foundation (because I look like a light bulb mid-day with this hot weather) and I’ve been using serums regularly. My friends said, “Wow, it looks like you are wear foundation.” I personally don’t notice a difference but my friends sure have. I guess it is because I use to have severe cystic acne and it has always made me very self-conscious of my skin – foundation on or off. Anyhow, I like how the clear serum goes on gently and it is thin in consistency like something between water and gel. My skin feels hydrated after using this product. It’s like using a hydrating toner. I can’t wait to see the long term results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in the hopes of diminishing fine lines/wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been using it around my eyes and forehead in the morning and at night for a few months. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. It&#x27;s supposed to be a moisturizer as well and my skin feels more dry after putting it on. I use 10%glycolic acid for my moisturizer and that actually works. It smells nice and I had high hopes but no results! Won&#x27;t purchase again. The search continues.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ and I cant say enough about it. I will buy again! I will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like. Too many ingredients. Not so natural.</li>
    <li> not sure yet, ordering more to confirm if it is working</li>
    <li> My skin loves this serum and I apply it morning and night with a light moisturizer in addition at night.  Great product and good for this 67 years olds skin.</li>
    <li> I have not had this [roduct very long.  Results are supposed to take 30 days, so I have to wait and see...</li>
    <li> I was hoping for good results because this product is highly rated. It is not suitable for my skin because it has aloe in it.</li>
    <li> OMG absolutely a face lift in a container. This product is amazing. It diminished  my fine lines in 2-3 weeks. Using this product on a daily basis will totally eliminate the need for dermal fillers. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned 49-year-old African American female. I have had problems with acne for years. I do not have a lot of wrinkles, but even at this age, I still have bouts of acne. I have blemishes from acne scarring. I have been using OTC retinol for years, helps with my acne.  I have been using this serum for about 10 days and within the first week my skin looks brighter and smoother. Usually it takes weeks before I see the dark spots begin to fade after I have had a bout of acne. But now after starting the serum, the new spots fade quicker and the older spots are fading also. Also, flare ups do not last as long as before. I use product twice a day morning and before bedtime as directed. After allowing to dry, I apply OTC retinol product and then a moisturizer to my face and neck. When I wake in the morning I can definitely see an improvement in the appearance of my skin overall. The great thing about this product is a little goes a long way and you can&#x27;t beat the price of under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of OTC acne products since I have been in my 20s, and aside from getting a prescription for Retin A, which was the only RX that would help control my acne (which is very expensive), this is the best product I have found in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind getting older, I just want to look as good as I can for as long as I can. I will definitely be using this product from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great makes face feel smooth will order again</li>
    <li> I returned both products because they did nothing for me. My skin looked no better after using them. I was quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> This serum is thicker than most I have tried.  It absorbs quickly into the skin, is easy to apply because of its consistency.  I immediately noticed and difference in my skin after only a week.  I will keep buying this one.</li>
    <li> So far seems like a good product.  Do not see much change in skin yet after a week.</li>
    <li> So-so product. Didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin texture or didn&#x27;t see a decrease in fine lines when I finished my bottle. I will not reorder again.</li>
    <li> I believe that his does an  amazing job and works so well inconjunction with Genefique! Have reordered already.Thanks Oz Naturals.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and works well, especially helpful since I live in the high desert where the average humidity is less than 15%!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Dr. OZ!&lt;br /&gt;JB from Buena Vista, Colorado</li>
    <li> Easy to use and apply.  Use it morning and night and have seen some lessening of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I have noticed my skin more moist and the wrinkles around my eyes are fading away, still using this product.</li>
    <li> I like this serum and I use it everyday in the morning and afternoon. My skin felt more smoother after applied it on the face. It works as expected. I will get more of it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. My skin felt so soft and hydrated after just the first use! It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I have noticed a big difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. I have gotten a lot of compliments lately about how radiant my skin looks and I make sure I tell everyone who asks about Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum!</li>
    <li> Love this product! There has been such an improvement  in my skin...fine lines have almost disappeared . Was recently told I look 15 years younger!</li>
    <li> I have just celebrated my 3rd, 25th birthday (making me 75).  I bought this amazing little bottle of serum as a last resort to try to get rid of some of the aging in my face and neck.  I have been using it for about 4 months and have notice some real improvement in the lines around my mouth and eyes.  I have very prominent &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around my eyes that I inherited from my father.  They have improved a lot.  The most dramatic difference I have notice is on my neck.  The sagging, wrinkling has been lessened quite a bit.  I am not telling you that it has taken away all of my facial flaws, but I am telling you there has been a tightening and smoothing and I appreciate all the little blessings I can get.  It was more than worth what I paid for it and I plan on making it a permanent part of my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> No noticeable line reduction around the eyes at all.  I will use the remainder of the bottle (due to the cost), but I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference after just 3 uses!  My skin is brighter and more even-toned.</li>
    <li> At my age (57)...I try to find products that work better on my face! With this product...I don&#x27;t see the results that I see with other the products I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on day three and I definitely have noticed results. Best product that I have found so far for dulled tone, enlarged pores and crow&#x27;s feet. Can&#x27;t wait to see what day 30 will look like. Trying the eye serum next.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as amazing as the reviews that I read before I bought it. I can just vaguely tell any improvement.</li>
    <li> This product softens the skin and greatly aids in the absorption of other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> One of the best I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I use this product after the refresher spray and follow up with the moisturizer. I have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin tone since using OZ products.&lt;br /&gt;This product was received for providing honest product feedback.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I have tried a couple different kinds.  This one is great,  leaves my skin hydrated.  I have many issues I am working to improve and so far OZ Naturals has been the brand I am going for for each of those needs.  I truly am seeing my skin improve in just a matter of weeks.  I think the price is great, for the results I am getting it is a bargain.  I have probably spent a small fortune on beauty products since I turned 30...and I have spent 80 and 100 dollar products without results at all.  I will continue to use OZ Naturals I am confident I will also continue to see results.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a lot  of improvement on my wrinkles . Ok product.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin and fine lines in the last 3 weeks. Great product!</li>
    <li> has softened deep lines - will keep on using it</li>
    <li> Product performs as advertises. Very Happy</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE  DOESNT DO WHAT IT SAYS, IT DOES.&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO SORRY I ORDERED IT.</li>
    <li> It may seem a bit odd for a male to want to try out Vitamin C serums, but once I passed the 30-year-old mark, I started paying more attention to my skin. Therefore, I have trying out many different beauty anti-aging beauty products this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of 1 fl oz Oz Natural 5% Hyalurnoic Acid + Vitamin C Professional Moisturizing Serum, which is 92% natural and 72% organic, last week. This type of serum is meant to plump &amp; hydrate your skin, balance your skin&#x27;s moisture levels and to help decrease surface lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like other serums, it is best to spray a toner on your skin before applying. Additionally, you can use a Vitamin C serum with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and of course it is recommended to use a moisturizer afterward as the serums will help your skin absorb the moisturizer faster. I haven&#x27;t used the serum long enough to see any permanent results, but I have been using it on my face and neck for the last few days without any side effects. My skin always breaks out after I shave. This morning after I shaved, I added the serum to my neck, followed by the moisturizer and my skin didn&#x27;t breakout. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed by the  Oz Natural 5% Hyalurnoic Acid + Vitamin C Professional Moisturizing Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed reviewing this product for Oz Naturals!</li>
    <li> Helped some, not as much as anticipated.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks and is working well, I have also been exfoliating more regularly as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin so I like the light consistency of the serum, it&#x27;s kind of a gel, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, a couple of my co-worker have made comments about my skin looking good and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it in the morning and night time under my night moisturizer and feels so soft when I wake up.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product so i can&#x27;t really tell the difference just yet..but so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
    <li> Trying this serum out for wrinkles around my eye. It may be helping some. Will update after I&#x27;ve had enough time to fully evaluate the product.</li>
    <li> Great Product leaves my skin soft and smooth I love it!!</li>
    <li> I like this. OZ Naturals serum I left on for only 5 minutes the first time as a skin test on my sensitive skin, no issues! Now I use regularly as they suggest. Good product, my skin looks and feels better - more even toned.</li>
    <li> I like my OZ C serum i like it am not breaking out like other products</li>
    <li> Love the OZ line; this does help give plumpness from moisture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oz HA serum for over a month along with the vitamin c. Neither have worked yet for me. Giving them 3 stars because I&#x27;m going to give it more time.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this scrum, if you use it constantly you will see the results!</li>
    <li> Have been using this as directed for  two months now and I honestly don&#x27;t see any real results from the other products I&#x27;ve been using. USe it if you want to as it may have different  results for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week as per directions in the night,&lt;br /&gt;for two days i felt very dry &amp; tingling&lt;br /&gt;from third day, my skin started looking stained/tanned - 2 shades darker then my usual complexion (as if I had returned from a beach vacation, with lot of suntan.)&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know how to  get rid of this tan, totally disappointed</li>
    <li> I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT AFTER READING ALL THE PUBLICITY IT WAS GETTING THRU THE MEDIA. I HAVE USED ONE BOTTLE AND I REALLY DON&#x27;T SEE ANY RESULTS ON MY SKIN! I AM GOING TO KEEP USING IT AND HOPEFULLY I WILL SEE RESULTS AFTER THE SECOND BOTTLE!</li>
    <li> This is a waste of my money, this product is nothing but water with some oil mixed in it, JUNK</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and right from the beginning I noticed a difference. There is a marked improvement in the firmness, and fine lines on my face. I also use it in my neck and decolletage. Hopefully it will only continue to improve!</li>
    <li> This goes on easy and my skin drinks it in! I saw a real difference with in the first month. I have softer lines and a more transparent complexion. I use around my eyes am and pm. No irritation and softer look immediately. The price is excellent and one bottle lasts me two months.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product under the sun-no kidding. I read the reviews on this product and thought okay, another bogus product, but something urged me to go ahead and try it. I could see a difference in my skin the first day. It was so smooth and just drank in the HA! I use the Simple Replenishing Moisturizer after applying the serum. Then I apply my makeup and my skin looks awesome! Can&#x27;t wait to order the eye gel from Oz Naturals!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from another company and it smells awful and burnt my skin. This does a better job, smells great and no damage to my skin. I look 10 years younger with this serum, smoothing lines and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its working but I am using it every day.  My face has not gotten worse or better.  I can say I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this product but after the first week of use not only could I tell a difference but I had several of my coworkers ask what I was doing differently.  My skin is smoother, softer and simply younger looking.  Not only did this work for me but my coworkers were so impressed they are now using this product.  Don&#x27;t want to be without it!!</li>
    <li> I am seeing a diminishing of lip lines and crows feet within a week.  Wonderful product !!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it !!</li>
    <li> First time I used this product I got a huge pimple exactly where I put it on. So, if you are acne prone be careful!  I did like the moisturizing effect of the product on my hands and that&#x27;s where I will be using it.</li>
    <li> So far so good- Seems to add tone &amp; texture to my skin- The sellers are very responsive to all questions-</li>
    <li> I have used this before and I think it has made my face brighter and more hydrated than before I use it.</li>
    <li> This OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid serum is a MUST have! My skin is dry, so moisturizer has always been very important for me. As I am getting older, I find that I need more than just moisturizer. This serum is just incredible! After washing, exfoliating and drying my face, I apply this serum every night. I let it dry and follow it with my moisturizer. Wow! What a difference! My skin no longer still has blotchy dry patches since I started using this serum and my wrinkles are much less defined. My skin is smooth and looks so much better. I am so happy I found this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product as the base for my moisturizers. I have such dry skin in the winter, but with this products, the oz eye serum and oz retinol moisturizer I have perfectly hydrated skin every morning. The serum is supposed to help with transferring your moisturizer deeper into your skin for a better result and it does exactly that!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll I have waited to see how this serum works, I just finished my first bottle and I am ordering me another one and also one for my daughter to try. I will say the serum made my skin glow and feel great!!! I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic I&#x27;m totally sold on this product. :)</li>
    <li> i purchased this along with the VitC&lt;br /&gt;they booth are good i use this in the night and the VitC serum in the morning&lt;br /&gt;have been using it for a week now. it felt good on my skin&lt;br /&gt;will update this review after a month of trying</li>
    <li> Excellent, it does help correct some signs of aging.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t change the appearance of my skin at all.  It momentarily made my skin feel tighter after application, but the feeling didn&#x27;t last very long and there was no visual benefit to using the product.</li>
    <li> i love this product, makes my face feel soft and hydrated. It absorbs quickly and it is very light. All you need is a drop, using the dropper included, on each cheek and you are set.</li>
    <li> I loved it!  Most moisturizers break my skin out, and this is gentle enough, I have not.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think I see any difference at all from the time I started using it until now.  If it has helped my skin in any way, it is not a noticeable change.  I will continue to use this product until it is gone and perhaps I will finally see something happening at a later time.</li>
    <li> Not as reported.  Throw away!!</li>
    <li> i have been using this serum for about 6months. I get an amazing results around my eyes and my mouth and my skin looks at lease 5 years younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Makes my face softer - love it</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing.  My sun spots are almost gone and the rather deep smile lines around my mouth and eyes are greatly dimished after about three months of using it rather regularly before going to bed with a good moisturizer. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just turned 60 yet many people think I am in my 50s and I believe in great part that is due to using the Hyaluronic acid serum and the organic Vitamin C serum on my face for the past year or so.  Love this product and can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I found that it is a little heavy under make-up, especially in the Texas heat/humidity, so I use this only at night. I have super sensitive skin, and it hasn&#x27;t caused me any trouble.</li>
    <li> I arranged for this product to be tested by a professional model, whose image has appeared throughout the country. Of course, her appearance is of supreme importance. She tested two Oz Naturals products: The Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Vitamin C Serum. Here is her professional assessment, in our own words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These two products are excellent! I REALLY love these ones. I put on the vitamin C one first and let it dry which only takes less than a minute. Then put on the H.A., let it dry, and then use my regular moisturizer. The HA particularly feels like it is lifting my skin up and tightening it, but not in a bad way. Makes me feel instantly younger. The bottle with the stopper on these items is a real plus so that they stay fresh without vitamin depletion. I would definitely purchase these. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, excellent products--happy to give a big 5-STAR RECOMMENDATION!</li>
    <li> Great product, at my age my skin can use all the help it can get to keep a youthful look and feel.  Natural products are always the best and give me the most repeatable performance,  I use hyalauronic acid for my joints also.  Well, worth the money and delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;CJ</li>
    <li> ******I Was Given A Free Bottle of this Product for an Honest Review****** I use the hyaluronic acid serum as part of my daily routine to help protect my skin when I go out. Easy application, great rose scent and my skin looks fantastic and I live in the city with all kinds of smog, dirt and junk in the air, my skin is protected and hydrated and bright! Dries quickly and I can wear make up with no mess. I just turned 50 and I am getting tons of compliments. As an African American, I have a challenge finding skin care products that work, I am really enjoying OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased 2 of this product had I known it would not work as described.</li>
    <li> This little vial will give you that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her to only use this product besides her nightly facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first weeks she started to some improvement on the fine line and wrinkles. After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance. Her skin had a fuller youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this serum. This is coming from a woman that has been using \\&quot;St. Ives\\&quot;, since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> Feels good going on, slick application.  Gets my skin ready for night time moisturizer... No oxidation after months... would buy again.</li>
    <li> It works to improve skin texture, and I like this one better because it has the hyaluronic acid.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin</li>
    <li> I love this &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good product, i&#x27;m currently testing a second bottle but it is still early to evaluate it.</li>
    <li> Incredible!  Makes my skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE.</li>
    <li> This feels really nice on the face but I don&#x27;t see any plumpness immediately.</li>
    <li> No BIG difference...will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This was the first product by Oz Naturals I tried.  This is a good, high quality serum which delivers tightened skin!  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  Reduced fine lines, tightened and moisturized skin at a good price!  I am using this serum with the Vitamin C Serum also by Oz Naturals, and I almost prefer this one better!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been blown away with any noticeable results. Trying to erase brown spots, so fair nothing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.  Am a nurse who worked for skin care specialists with access to all products not available to most.  This is the best i have used.</li>
    <li> First I have to say that I am really impressed with OZ naturals They work well yet do not irritate my skin and this one is no exception. This serum goes on very nice and smooth and drys quickly so I can use my other skincare product with it . it does not make them pill which is a huge deal for me and I like that you get a lot of product in this bottle and that makes it a nice value. My skin is softer and has a more natural glow about it . This one is very natural and I dont have to worry about unsightly pealing or redness when using it.&lt;br /&gt; I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking  .</li>
    <li> I have never received so many compliments on my skin since I&#x27;ve been using this product. No one believes I am as old as I am and I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations. You can&#x27;t go wrong, especially when you compare the price to the skin care products in the stores, which, by the way, all have questionable ingredients in them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used similar products, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I really can&#x27;t say that I have seen any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Has help my skin tone and goes on great.&lt;br /&gt;Update- I just ordered my 2nd bottle of this.  It is amazing stuff.  I have had people ask me if I am using something on my face because it is fantastic.  I am 55 and I hardly have to use any foundation anymore.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I cant say anything , didnt see any difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks under the Oz Vit C Serum -Great Combo, Great Results!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this-I have since ordered several other products for Oz Naturals. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is my first serum. I am 34 years old asian female with minor initial signs of aging . I bought this product to prevent any aging signs. Iam using it for over a week, twice a day and so far I like. I received compliments that my skin is glowing and better. I have not noticed any changes yet, however I do like it and don&#x27;t have any complains. I have oily skin and no break outs or acne which is good.</li>
    <li> Not sure, but think it has been close to a month. I have never smoked but do have a huge smile, therefore I have those &amp;#34;smoker&#x27;s wrinkles&amp;#34; around my mouth. They have become pretty deep in the last couple of years, I am just turning 65. This has made a huge difference in them, along with my frown lines between my eyebrows. I have been enjoying looking in the mirror and not &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; so old by what i see is reflected back. I do accept the aging process, but I have to say this product has made quite the difference. It is well worth trying it, not expensive at all and just disciplined to do it every day and night and the rewards are worth it. I would highly recommend this product. I mean, it is a quite change, it is not like getting a face lift but I am loving it and feeling more energetic and driven to take a little bit better care of myself. This product has motivated me to care again:)</li>
    <li> as a woman of a certain age i have tried many serums and creams to keep my skin looking its best...i tried this product and to my delight i saw a difference within the first week of using it...i feel that my skin is firmer around the chin and lower cheek area, particularly my &amp;#34;marionette&amp;#34; lines.  honestly i believe they are less noticeble than before i used this product...i did my research and found this hyaluronic acid serum because i learned that hyaluronic acid and vitamin c are the key ingredients to firm and smooth aging skin..this product, proudly made in the USA contains both of those ingredients and again, i urge others to try it..i will be purchasing it again...just give it a try and enjoy the results...ps...i was NOT paid or rewarded to give this review..i just wanted others to know that it does make a difference, a positive difference in the texture and appearance of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, i wrote the above review a few weeks ago, and I&#x27;m back again to say that i have reordered this product because i believe it really IS making a difference in my skin...a review of the ingredients indicate that vitamin C and hyaloronic acid are in the top five and other products that i have seen that cost much more, don&#x27;t have either of these products in the top ten list of ingredients....so i&#x27;ll use this and probably be back for more next month -- it works that good....i, too, was skeptical, but just try it....you may get the same great results that i have been getting...</li>
    <li> sticky and didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
    <li> Love the feel on my skin. I have only been using a few weeks. I have not noticed a big difference in wrinkle reduction but my face feels softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> This makes a huge difference in the lines on my face.  I use it with phytoceramides.  My sister even sees the difference!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! So far I have been really impressed with the OZ Naturals product line!</li>
    <li> I am on my second, no third bottle of this product.  I did read some negative reviews, esp regarding customer service, but I&#x27;m here to tell you I have the complete opposite with this company.  I started using this in November 2013, and when I went to my family holiday party, I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I received on my skin.  Now, I&#x27;m almost 60, so any compliment is a good one, but more than one person asked me if I&#x27;d had &amp;#34;some work done&amp;#34;!!  When I was just about out of my first bottle, I ordered a second, but received a very kind email from the company stating that they were in the process of producing more product, and I would received mine as soon as possible.  after a few days, I decided to order another brand, I figured what the heck, and it was a little bit cheaper!  Well, ladies let me tell you, what a mistake!  This new product was clearly not the quality of the OZ Naturals.  I will never order any other brand, in fact now I order two at a time when possible.  I&#x27;ve even got my daughter using it, and have shared my secret with my good girlfriends!  Thay are all fans of the product as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to Customer Service, when I was informed of the delay in receiving my product, I emailed the company to let them know that I was waiting for my order, and in fact not only received a response, but also was refunded my shipping costs for my wait!  That&#x27;s great customer service in my opinion, and I will be a life-long (whatever is left, lol) customer!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but a friend talked me into trying this product. I was very pleased at the results.</li>
    <li> This Hyaluronic Serum is the truth! This is my best friend now in my skin care regimen. I get so many compliments on my skin and how young I look for a girl my age 50 +. Love it!</li>
    <li> So far, this is a great product. I&#x27;ve only had it for three days but my skin is noticeably better.</li>
    <li> Just received this. Seems to work great so far. Not drying my skin out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a bit skeptical of Hyaluronic Acid Serum but when used with a good moisturizer right after the Serum has been absorbed, my skin stays moist most of the day.  A winner.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle, I wear this every morning under makeup. Highly recommend! My face is smoother and glows.</li>
    <li> I use this serum along with Premium Niacinamide Cream + Vitamin B3 Serum.  The two together give me luminous skin with less fine lines.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Yes, I was skeptical, but after using it there was a noticeable change in the first week.  I have been using this for months.  Apply to a cleansed face, let it dry, then apply your moisturizer.  I look much younger with the diminished lines, and I feel younger too!</li>
    <li> Not sure yet. Need more time. I haven&#x27;t been consistent . I haven&#x27;t noticed any big changes to my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! It moisturizes the driest skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 42.  I started using this around my eyes with a hyaluronic acid eye cream afterwards.  I don&#x27;t have a before and after per se, but I really notice a difference.  Wrinkles around my eyes are lessened.  the skin is more taught and doesn&#x27;t have that sagging, loose skin look.  I also use on my sun damaged chest and my neck along with a retinol moisturizer.  my skin looks smoother and more supple.  I also started a couple weeks ago using all over my face and notice decrease in appearance of my forehead lines. also i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clogging my pores - which is a major bonus because i also suffer from horrible perimenopausal acne.  fun! and it seems to have made my skin texture smoother overall.  i use it once a day in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that i also use a glycolic and salicylic serum treatment on my face after using the hyaluronic serum.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any complications / bad interactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the addition to your regimen.  i wish i had discovered it 10 years ago!</li>
    <li> Really like this serum. I use it daily and at night. At night I put it on then use my moisturizer. I can feel it really going deep into my skin. I&#x27;ve used other serums and I think I&#x27;m going to really like this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference, but maybe it takes a while.  So, I can&#x27;t really evaluate this product with any accuracy.</li>
    <li> It is working really well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see the difference in my skin. don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
    <li> I have spent THOUSANDs of dollars at the department store for the &amp;#34;wrinkle cure&amp;#34;.... I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by this stuff! After two weeks of use I can see a difference in my skin. It looks brighter and I do notice a small reduction in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> it is working very well THANKSi received this at a special price for myreview works great this is my second  b ottle.</li>
    <li> I love all of Oz Natural products and love this serum. I have a regimen going with them. I have noticed an improvement in my skin after starting Oz skincare. I use the Organic Skin Toner (am/pm), Vitamin C Serum (am), Retinol Serum (pm) and the Super Youth Moisturizer. I&#x27;m 51 and look younger for using these products. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have used this for nearly a year now with excellent results.</li>
    <li> I am nearly 71 years old, but look far younger, according to other people&#x27;s views! Since using my Oz serum the lines on my face fade to a certain extent after applying my favorite OZ Naturals! Will use for ever! Can I get a discount on larger quantities? Shame this has to go to the USA for deliveries, but nevertheless will be ordering again and again and again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandy</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my skin. Don&#x27;t recommend. Total waste of money. I bought based on all the good reviews and I was mislead.</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does my skin, It keep my face looking young and healthy. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Been using this faithfully, but only once a day. Slowly seeing differences, my skin seems smoother.</li>
    <li> Adds needed moisture to my skin after using various acne products.  It works great</li>
    <li> bought it for a friend and she loves it</li>
    <li> It just pure glycerin and it is not moisture my skin as I expect..I thought some serum that tone my uneven skin and adding extra shining texture into it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Changed my skin with in a week ! Love this product !</li>
    <li> I love this. It feels smooth on application and my skin is looking better over the period I have used it .. this is my 3rd bottle ..</li>
    <li> I use this first after washing my face and using  a toner. It dries quickly and goes on nice. I follow it up with the Oz Retinol Cream.</li>
    <li> Not in love with this product.  It puts a film on your skin when you apply it that causes your skin to stretch a little tighter.  I have not noticed a big difference in wrinkle elimination after using this product for two weeks every day and I have a moderate amount of wrinkles at 60 years of age. I prefer Neutrogena Ageless Intensives deep wrinkle moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a bad bottle or something, along with the Vit. C serum and the moisturizer. These products have not done a single thing for my skin. In fact, I feel like the fine lines around my eyes have gotten worse over the last month since I started using these products. It&#x27;s like I haven&#x27;t been using anything at all. I&#x27;m surprised there are so many good reviews!</li>
    <li> pretty good.  looks like it hydrates the skin and brightens.</li>
    <li> Still trying this to see if it makes a difference</li>
    <li> My 4th order, really love it - works well with my skin</li>
    <li> Love this one, highly recommend! Will purchase more. Thanks for a product that works!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> Excellent item. I recommend</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference with this serum, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something?</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum has exceeded my expectations for six weeks in a row.  The fine lines around my eyes have all but disappeared and even the somewhat deeper lines around my mouth have greatly diminished.  It&#x27;s wonderful to look in the mirror and see a more youthful face looking back!!  I&#x27;ve simply followed the directions and use it morning and night, followed by my moisture cream. Adding this product to my daily routine of exercise, healthy eating habits and a positive outlook on life has been one of the most rewarding things I&#x27;ve ever done.  Thank you OZ Naturals!!  (And, by the way, I&#x27;m 65 years old).</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing what the advertised benefits suggested.</li>
    <li> Good product has helped my wrinkles on my face will continue to use !!!</li>
    <li> Seems to really work.  I use it on my forearms for sun damaged skin.  They are looking surprisingly better with minimal treatment.  FB</li>
    <li> This product goes so nicely onto my skin after I cleanse and before I put a moisturizer on. I have very sensitive skin that will break out if it doesn&#x27;t like a product, and this one is gentle enough that my skin loves it! It feels and smells like aloe.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 days as directed (I wash my face, use toner, apply serum, and then moisturizer) and have very noticeable results already. I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> Like! it seems to work😊</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed that I hadn&#x27;t seen the results many reviewers described. I did notice that my skin felt slightly more hydrated, which was good for someone like me with incredibly dry skin. There was an initial tightness, but that passed after a while. I may have to try other things that people suggest should be used in tandem with this, but for now I&#x27;ve opted to set this aside for something else.</li>
    <li> After having used this product for a few weeks, I feel confident to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;I can truly see a difference in my skin, it doesn&#x27;t break out as much anymore, is smoother and honestly, it did help to shrink pores a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, they did not disappear (which I did not expect), but I can tell a visual difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have researched a lot before making my choice on OZ Naturals, but the shipment/service was prompt and I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle, very refreshing, and the serum soaks in fast. I use it at night, before my night-time cream, and in the mornings under my make-up. It does not create any issues under make-up and my &amp;#34;combination skin&amp;#34; actually doesn&#x27;t get as oily by the afternoon as it used to. So, I am happy with the results thus far, and will re-order once I run out.</li>
    <li> Too many drying ingredients for my skin.</li>
    <li> Been using faithfully twice a day since receiving the Serum....no change yet......still using and hoping!</li>
    <li> My second bottle! I loved it so much I went through the first one fast. I could see a difference in a few days. In conjunction with my favorite moisturizer my skin looks better than it did after a year of using more expensive products!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference. I have used this for about a month now and see no difference in my skin quality or reduction of fine lines. 3 months ago I started taking Phytoceramides and saw immediate improvement in my skin. Then I tried the OZ Hyaluronic Acid and can&#x27;t say I have seen any changes in my skin. I do put it on my forehead and the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my forehead is much dryer than before. I also put it on the fine lines around my eyes and around my lips as well, but haven&#x27;t experienced the dry skin problem in those areas. I&amp;#34;m not sure if I will purchase this product again. Unless I happen to see improvement before I finish the bottle I won&#x27;t order another. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I bought OZ Naturals The Best Hyaluronic Acide Serum and the Best Vitamine C Serum, I have been using both every day/night. It is not greasy,  and easiler to apply, I  do not see skin improvement, not lighten the skin, nor reduce fine wrinkle.</li>
    <li> Yep, just like it says, it is the best. As in my other reviews of Oz Naturals, when compared with much more expensive serums, this product comes out ahead. I have gotten so many compliments on how fresh and  young my facial skin looks (I&#x27;m 65) since I started using this product. It does what is meant to do and is very easy on the wallet as compared to much more expensive Hyaluronic Serums. You won&#x27;t regret switching if you are not already using it.</li>
    <li> 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum -Another fabulous beauty find, OZ’s Hyaluronic Serum acts to plump up and hydrate your skin while stimulating collagen in order to reduce the appearance of fine lines. Again, something I need in abundance.  First you put on the serum and allow it to dry before putting your moisturizer on top of it. This serum smells amazing because it’s scented with geranium essential oil. It also has a distinctly aloe-y consistency when spread on the face; very light and yet slightly viscous or sticky. That sticky sensation dissipates after a minute or two of drying. The serum is a lovely consistency; liquidity enough that it&#x27;s easy to apply and move around your face but gel enough that it doesn&#x27;t run all over the place before you&#x27;ve had a chance to apply it. It has a very slight scent, but it&#x27;s really pleasant; I detect rose which is a smell I&#x27;m always happy to have in my beauty products but I know there are just as many people who hate the smell as there are that love it. You have to work with it very quickly because as soon as it comes into contact with your skin it sinks in, something that I love about it, it makes my skin care routine very fast. Firstly I cleanse and tone my face as usual, then I apply the serum. As soon as it&#x27;s been applied there is no residue on the skin at all, within a couple of seconds it&#x27;s completely disappeared and you&#x27;re ready for your moisturiser. I use this all over my face, even up to my lash line on my eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or affect my sensitive eyes in any way, it even helps my eye cream to not effect them, something I really wasn&#x27;t expecting. There isn&#x27;t one point there that I can disagree with. Now about the serum: in the past I have used products containing hyaluronic acid, but apart from how much active ingredient is actually in the bottle, it seems that the synergy with other components is crucial. This serum is packaged in a glass bottle with a dropper to facilitate precise application. The contents are 1 fluid ounce or 30 ml, which is pretty standard, but you need very little to cover your whole face and neck, making this product really good value for money. It looks like it can easily last a couple of months.  With gentle massage, the almost clear gel sinks in easily and dries quickly. You then apply your favourite cream or oil on top, which now has a much better chance to penetrate and actually do some of the wonderful things promised on the box. A serum is a carrier, so it is very important to choose an effective moisturiser or nourishing cream to apply afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample of OZ Natural’s Professional Moisturizing Serum for this review, no compensation was given and all opinions are my own.ounce or 30 ml, which is pretty standard, but you need very little to cover your whole face and neck, making this product really good value for money.

    <li> This product did help with fine lines, not deep ones. My skin was firmer, but not as moisturized as I hoped.</li>
    <li> This OZ Naturals is amazing! I not only use this under my eyes but I like to use this product on my neck as well. Goes on wet and feels nice after it dries. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn or irritate my skin. I say give it a try, especially for the price. I got this product discounted for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have just started using it and it seems to be working but needs more time</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It tightens my skin for a youthful appearance</li>
    <li> First product that I&#x27;ve used that doesnt cause more acne!  I already deal with hormonal acne on my chin so finally finding something that keeps my skin hydrated but doesn&#x27;t cause more break-outs is a win for me.  It has given my skin a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. I use it morning and night. Absorbs quickly and works nice under makeup.  I can&#x27;t tell if it has helped with wrinkles since I dont have deep ones. (faint lines starting)  Maybe it&#x27;ll keep them away though ;)</li>
    <li> I have seen no improvement after 4 weeks- wasted money</li>
    <li> on my second bottle thinking that I did not give it enough time to help with those fine lines and wrinkles ....Still not much of a difference and surely will not purchase another bottle 1</li>
    <li> I just love the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I have never been a fan of serums before, but I can clearly see why this is a benefit now.  I use this before my moisturizer and it really helps to prepare my skin!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product! Purchased 3 bottles, did not want to review 1st bottle yet. The second bottle worked well, making my pores smaller and plumping my face. The 3rd bottle did not seem to work as well, but I will continue to use this product. The bottles are a little different in labeling, and not sure why. But Overall, Love the product and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it right before moisturizer and my skin stays hydrated. My makeup looks great for hours since I started using the serum. It is so affordable!! It is now part of my daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals are excellent and this one is the best hyaluronic acid I have found.  It goes on very well and provides great moisture leaving your skin soft and supple</li>
    <li> I use this at night under my tretinoin cream and it helps keep my skin hydrated even though it absorbs very fast. I use the vitamin c serum in the morning under moisturizer and sunscreen and I think my skin is looking pretty good. I am 37 with years of sun damage but I&#x27;ve been taking good care of my skin since my early 20s, so you can&#x27;t really see the sun damage.</li>
    <li> Meh, I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> The dropper doesn&#x27;t work well, and it is difficult to get the product out of the bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure yet as to the quality of the product, but I have had other serums that were more liquid and able to smooth better on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 8 weeks and the difference in my skin is astounding. I have always been suspicious of this type of claim, but I went ahead and bought it, along with the sea-infused moisturizer. My face is smooth, firm and soft -- as well as having a better glow to it. The serum is very easy to use -- I put a double drop on one finger, spread it through the four fingers on both hands and spread it over my face and throat. Before it dries I press I into my skin. When it dries I then apply the moisturizer. My skin is old, but one would never guess just how old. I love this serum and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am absouletly obsessed with this product. The company asked me to write a review and honestly I would have either way. My skin is looking GREAT thanks to OZ Naturals!!</li>
    <li> So far I have seen improvement I hope to see more .Makes the skin feel great .</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing!!!!! And it really works well if you use their Sea Infused Moisturizer afterwards. Since I&#x27;ve been using OZ Naturals my skin is definitely more youthful looking. I&#x27;m even getting compliments! I love this product and would highly recommend. I also love the company for being cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Love all of the OZ Naturals products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I loved this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 22 years, I had a deep line round my mouth, it now disappear because of this great serum.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great product! This product does a great job. I feel like My wrinkles are disappearing before my eyes. So glad this product was developed!</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have tried with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C.  Goes on smoothly, I apply this first morning and night, and once dried I apply moisturizer, which is also Oz Naturals product.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid is an important ingredient when it comes to skin care, espeially dry skin. I have been looking for a good hyaluronic acid serum and accidentally found this one. I bought it due to a high review and curiosity of the result. And I am totaly happy with this serum because as soon as I use this serum, my skin is less dry than it used to be. Also, I love the scent of the serum so much. It brought me a relaxing feeling when I applied on my face. You should definitely try this one :)</li>
    <li> I love this Serum.  It made my face so smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Makes big difference on my faces. I was able to see the soften and brightening with second week of using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin care product.  This product helps to tone your skin, before using your moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Have only used it for a couple of months, and do see changes in the skin. Good price compared to other skin products&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Hyaluronic acid creams and like them better...this doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything for my skin.  It dissipates too quickly so I had to use quite a bit each time.</li>
    <li> havent had any changes in skin but it goes on nice</li>
    <li> It is the best. Buy it . Use a moisturizer,after it dries. It glides on and a small amount covers your face. I use it everyday and it is amazing!</li>
    <li> Finishing my second bottle!! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; but works for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and I think it&#x27;s awful. Tried using it with a good moisturizer under make up and was horrified to see it formed a layer of what can only be described as dried Elmer&#x27;s Glue on my face after about 10 minutes. Far from plumping up and &#x27;deeply moisturizing&#x27; my skin it acts as a kind of freeze drying mask that rubs off in crumbling layers. (so definitely a no no under make-up.) I tried it at night-(again with a good moisturizer)- hoping it would reveal the transformative wrinkle busting glow the product description promises. If you had painted egg white and lemon juice on my face then thrown a fine layer of white dust over the whole thing for good measure I feel it would have achieved a similar effect. No stars . won&#x27;t buy again. Annoyed.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this serum which is designed to make moisturizers more effective. I feel like it helps use less moisturizer as it spreads evenly over my face after using the serum.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I received an email from this company asking if I would be willing to try three of their products and give a review. I can only vouch for my email, but there was nothing about me giving the product a good review. So I said sure. I had no idea what an explosive subject it is. I guarantee that I am a real person who won&#x27;t gain a penny for my opinion, nor would I want to, as paying for a good review is no different than stuffing a ballot box. So here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I used this product in the evening after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;- The serum is very light, almost like water and went right into my skin without leaving it sticky (which I dislike).&lt;br /&gt;- This is company&#x27;s serums are the first I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;- A little bit goes a long way, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;- I have noticed a difference in my skin. Most notably that it seems much firmer, and the smile lines around my eyes and dimples aren&#x27;t nearly so noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;- I do use a very light moisturiser once I&#x27;ve given the serum time to be completely absorbed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these products have been a surprise. They work well for me, although everyone&#x27;s skin is different and even different ages can cause uneven results. I also appreciate the lack of chemicals. The price for these products is VERY reasonable. I have used products like this that cost a fortune and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well (or at all). I look at using good products as a means of holding off aging for as long as possible. Perhaps someday I will look in the mirror and decide that I want something more drastic, but I&#x27;m not there yet.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have lived my whole life in the harsh FL sunshine. Now that I&#x27;ve hit my 40&#x27;s, I feel like I need to do more to combat aging and keep my skin hydrated. I use this product in conjunction with the OZ Naturals Youth moisturizer and I love the combo! My skin is smoother and I feel like after a few weeks of use I can see a more even skin tone. I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any great results yet - it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> works great!  clean and clear skin finally!</li>
    <li> Really like this ... will reorder</li>
    <li> Great product.  Has helped to improve the texture of my face and neck. Helps to firm my skin.  Going to purchase my second bottle.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Make sure solution is not separated before using.  I was using this product with no results initially.  Solution had separated and I gently rotated until it was mixed together.  Then applied properly saw intense results quickly.</li>
    <li> I have tried a previous OZ Naturals skin care product, the Super Youth Eye Gel, and was very satisfied with the results in diminishing wrinkles and smoothing the skin below and around the eyes. I have used other skin care products which contained both hyaluronic acid and various botanical extracts and had excellent results: noticeable the same day within 15 - 20 min of use therefore anticipated good results with this product as well. This product lived up to my expectations and it does *exactly*  what is stated on the box: &amp;#34;diminishes surface lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen.&amp;#34; I have used this serum daily over several days and can see a difference initially within 15 - 20 minutes after application (this is the truth).. Exactly what I expected as other products in the past gave me similar results within the same time frame. The smooth skin is even more noticeable within a couple of hours after use and continue throughout the day and for me last well into the next day. The first area of results is where I have smile lines on my cheeks, right below the corners of my nose. The wrinkles are *definitely* less evident, honestly almost gone, much smoother and the skin remains soft. Use the eye dropper applicator to apply a thin layer of the serum over the chosen area, let it dry, but first apply your choice of moisturizer. Received a gift coupon to purchase product with option to review. The ingredients in this product are clearly listed on the box: organic aloe, witch hazel, botanical hyaluronic acid, kosher vegetable glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, wild crafted green tea, germanium essential oil, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and a few other ingredients that help stabilize the product. I highly recommend this skin serum for anyone who wishes to reduce facial wrinkles and have the appearance of more youthful skin. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]</li>
    <li> As prescription Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I love this serum! Notice my crows feet/laugh lines around my eyes seem less noticeable. Continuing to buy!</li>
    <li> I love the serum, but last two bottles have not been filled properly! The bottle in photo is still unopened!</li>
    <li> i was hoping for a little better result</li>
    <li> feels nice on my face and works well makeup.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very soft!</li>
    <li> This has done absolutely nothing to improve my skin in any way. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This feels like it hydrates nicely. Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet....</li>
    <li> did not seem to do as well as other serum/cream I tried.</li>
    <li> I LOVE: OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, OZ Nat Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and OZ Nat Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer (daytime or night time).  Of course I only use OZ Naturals Products ALONE with &amp;#34;Oil Of Olay 7 in One Total Effects Moisturizer&amp;#34; (for daytime-under makeup). I have oily and some semi-dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I also make Green Tea Astringent.  (&amp;#34;Green Tea Classic&amp;#34; w/ caffiene -- boil 2 bags as directed with Kentwood &amp;#34;Spring Bottled Water&amp;#34;, let cool-may add more spring water to make a lil less concentrated/make it last longer.  It will last approx 1-2 wks if kept in fridge. Smell to see if rancid-green tea doesn&#x27;t last too long!), Then I transfer to a spray bottle, put in fridge, get really cold ---- I use astringent with a cotton ball works wonders!!!  Tightens the skin on my entire face -- esp around the eyes ! It also helps reduce dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness -- I prefer a natural astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also use coconut oil all over my face and Vitamin E and Rose Hip Seed oil under my eyes for night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say after crying for the last 8yrs after my fiance died...Jon, My Love Rest in Paradise...I miss you so much my love! .....&lt;br /&gt;My face looks awesome!!!  I had many deep wrinkles from crying so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched for a few months before I was able to find all the natural info I listed.  Thank you so much for the natural facial products!!!  Its so hard to find anything whether its facial, body or food that does have all kinds of unwanted and harmful ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DENISE</li>
    <li> Does nothing.  Purchased based on the reviews and so many people using it.  I then bought a no name brand of serum at Rite aid and see no difference</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have bought this product, I alternate between this &amp; the straight Vitamin C oil from OZ Naturals. I think they are great for giving you that radiant, youthful glow.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product...I am in love with it!!!  I am the one that will pay whatever it takes on the expensive products at the store for wrinkles, but after trying this for just 1 week I already see the difference. My skin is very dry because I am in my late 40&#x27;s and when applying this first then my moisturizer it soaks it up! My face is smoothe and wrinkles are not looking as evident as they were. It only takes a small amount, and when it dries then apply your moisturizer over it then BAM!  I use it at night and wake up to a soft smoothe face. I am very impressed with this product and will continue doing business with the company I purchased it from. IN LOVE WITH MT FACE NOW!</li>
    <li> This anti-aging serum is truly amazing! After using it for 2 weeks I noticed my skin was smoother and hydrated. I love that it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty-free as well. This is a must-have for your facial regimen if you&#x27;re looking to have moisturized, youthful looking skin. I definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve also been thrilled with the OZ Naturals customer service too.</li>
    <li> Feels light on the face and neck.</li>
    <li> I could see a difference in 24 hours...unreal !!!!</li>
    <li> I did like this serum. I have been using this for a while. Used two bottles , and I can tell a difference in the way my skin looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more.  Jenny</li>
    <li> Good stuff - smooths out facial lines.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very soft and smooth.  After application of Hyaluronic serum make sure when it dries you apply your own skin moisture on top.  I have not been long enough using this product to really give it a far rating at this point.  Sorry</li>
    <li> some difference only used three weeks</li>
    <li> Best beauty find EVER! Started using this 10 months ago along with a derma roller and my skin is transformed! Healthy, plump, no lines, love this product; i&#x27;m hooked for life! The only downside is that when I stop using it because I run out the plumping and glowing effects disappear which means I&#x27;ll be a customer for life! So glad I tried this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for six months.  Has made a real difference in my skin.  Use it with the roller on alternate nights.</li>
    <li> Love this product, don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer and I notice a huge difference if I switch products.</li>
    <li> will absorb quickly in to skin...follow with a great moisturizer at night can also be used during the day with a moisturizer under makeup</li>
    <li> nice prod. but  don&#x27;t expect permanent results,  does seem to help on a temp. basis though .&lt;br /&gt;Have now used this, Cosmedica and Voila Ve and don&#x27;t see much diff. between the three other than the Cosmedica is&lt;br /&gt;a much better value .</li>
    <li> What can I say. it seem to make my skin look great. better than a cream.</li>
    <li> excellent product - using it twice a day - easy to use - under Revitol .</li>
    <li> I apply at night after I washed my face. I apply it on my face, neck, and around my eyes., My face feels so smooth and even, all over.</li>
    <li> I love serums and this is one of my favorites.  Absorbs easily, and no greasiness at all.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love how this product feels and makes my skin look.!</li>
    <li> what A GREAT PRODUCT !  AS BEAUTY CONSULTANT I had try all products .  This is just amazing . keep it in the frig or very cool place .  Enjoy</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. .... I will reorder. ...</li>
    <li> I HAVEN;T USED IT LONG ENOUGH. SO FAR ITS OK</li>
    <li> I have almost finished my first bottle of Oz and I have not noticed any changes at all. I will continue to use it for a while longer to see if there is any change.</li>
    <li> this is a great product</li>
    <li> So the best review I can give is to share what a former colleague wrote when I updated my profile picture!  &amp;#34; Kim .....what&#x27;s your secret? It been 10 years since I saw you last and you haven&#x27;t aged a day! You look marvelous!&amp;#34;  OZ Naturals is my secret...  At 53 to have found such amazing products that literally roll back the years!  I am an Oz Naturals loyal customer!  Every product just improves the quality of my skin. Its affordable, easy to use and feels weightless.  I have been using these products for a year and continue to try new ones as they come out have been pleased with the products, but more importantly the results! My skin looks better today than in my 30&#x27;s.  Thanks OZ!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over  a week. I have noticed some amazing results. My fine lines and frowns are a lot less noticeable. I&#x27;ve been told that my skin is glowing. I have been recommending this product to anyone that asks me what I have been doing differently.</li>
    <li> Plumped up my upper lids.  They had been sagging some, and this was bothering me.  I use it every night with another wonderful product that has eliminated the fine lines around my eyes, Revlon Eterna with progestin.  I&#x27;ve used the gambit of moisturizers from Chanel to Olay… these two products are reasonably priced and work for me.</li>
    <li> I need to start this review by saying that my husband has noticed a change in my skin. My husband is a country boy that never notices anything. Lol&lt;br /&gt;This product has reduced the appearance of my fines lines. I no longer have puffy eyes and my skin looks vibrant and young. I&#x27;m 39 years old and I haven&#x27;t always been kind to my skin. As a teenager I went to tanning beds and was always in the sun. So I have sun damage. But with this product I am finally seeing a change for the better.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this for a review but my opinion are my own. And I will always have this in my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I use this serum under other moisturizers. Goes on easy, works well with my other products.</li>
    <li> I bought this on 10/20/14, got it not long after. I have been waiting to write a review until I had been using it for a while. It is the best, my face feels tighter,smoother,. The smell is not over powering, and a little goes along way. It is now 11/05/14, my face is not dry, or peeling. So I found the one that I will keep buying from now on.&lt;br /&gt;My next will be the vitamin c, and the toner.&lt;br /&gt;So try it even if your skin is like mine sensitive, it won&#x27;t hurt or burn😀.&lt;br /&gt;And no nobody paid or offer me anything free for my opinion, it is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all at Oz Naturals (Craig).</li>
    <li> I heard about these two ingredients as a way to get rid of wrinkles and I have been using this with a vitamin E creme. I do see a improvement after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought one for me and other for my neighbor and we both liked</li>
    <li> Love the follow up from customer service, very nice serum.</li>
    <li> Its just not very effective without layering it with other products.</li>
    <li> Do you have dry facial skin? Does it look uneven?  You&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to correct the situation too haven&#x27;t you? About a month ago I was approached by OZ NATURALS. They wanted me to try their products and see what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;  I got the products and I was skeptical. I have lots of dark spots on my face and it&#x27;s dry.  I&#x27;ve been fighting with these issues for thirteen years.  I read the directions and the ingredients so I&#x27;d know more about the product.  I began to use the OZ NATURALS and I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These WORK!  My skin is softer and younger looking.  The products are so easy to use and take no time to get use to. Especially if you already have a skincare program you follow.  I used the VITAMIN C SERUM, the HYALURONIC ACID SERUM  and SUPER YOUTH EYE GEL.  Each one felt so wonderful on my skin and the results will astound  you.  I get so many more compliments on my skin tone since I used these products.  I&#x27;m not just spouting off either.  I&#x27;ve never used top quality products for my skin before these. Mostly because they contain things I&#x27;m allergic to.  The OZ NATURALS are so much fresher and wonderful.  You will be doing yourself a favor by buying these products.&lt;br /&gt;  I didn&#x27;t find any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I gave this one 5+ cheers out of 5 because it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  ~Product provided in  exchange for a fair review~</li>
    <li> I bought this serum at Dec, 2013.  At that time, they gained almost all 5 stars reviews and No. 1 sale at it&#x27;s category.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, their price are attractive, I think worth for a try. As I live in HongKong, so need to ask a friend to ship to me.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the serum made my skin very dry  and more sensitive to sunshine. There&#x27;re some brown spots developed on my cheeks after using this for 2 weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d returned them to OZ and got their refunds. But, could not compensate my skin being irritated and the expensive shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this. My skin was very dry and flaky and now it feels so soft and plump after a month of use. I felt the results within a week of using it.</li>
    <li> I received this for free to try out and I really like it. It leaves my skin so soft. Serum absorbs into skin quickly. Does not leave heavy or sticky feeling on skin. Face does feel smoother after use.</li>
    <li> Good product and the price is lower than all other stores</li>
    <li> I love the smell! I will order again just for that! I have noticed my skin looking more smooth, but is it a miracle wrinkle remover? I will hold my judgement right now on that.</li>
    <li> I really like the product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after using this product.</li>
    <li> when I first apply it I could feel by skin tight up, but with the second application all I got was really dry skin , it said to use a moisturize with it. So far their is no change in my skin with update it any thing change</li>
    <li> This serum goes on nicely and dries quickly without leaving a sticky residue. I have noticed an improvement in the fine lines and have not had any adverse effects. I have very sensitive skin and tend to react to just about everything so I have to very careful about what I use. This serum worked well on my sensitive skin. My face feels soft and tight. I used the product for two weeks, once a day before I really started to notice a difference in the lines of my face. The changes are not overnight miracles. I doubt that product exists. Another thing I like about this serum is it is odor free. That is a big plus for me as I am also sensitive to smells. I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a serum and tends to have sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> I was offered To review this product for free and absulty love it. I buy lots of skin products for much more and none work as wonderful as this one. thanks</li>
    <li> Have high expectations with this product. Will continue to use daily.</li>
    <li> this stuff worked great for me!</li>
    <li> Love this serum, could see a difference in my skins tightness and the fine lines are softened, I will b ordering again!</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and nothing changed. It is a waste of time and money. It was like putting water on my face, except water would make my face look better than this.</li>
    <li> I really did like this and I believe I saw some repair of my skin as far as lines, but my age spots are still there unfortunately.  But I will try again.</li>
    <li> This serum is the best I have ever used.  It goes on easy, not watery.  Noticeable difference in my skin and age spots have diminished.  Finally I have found something that works and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  Thank you OZ Naturals!!!!</li>
    <li> I feel like 5% is very minimal but i guess not too bad with vitamin c and jojoba oil in it.</li>
    <li> Dr.Oz,this stuff does not do what you said it would do! Will not buy again. It does not help wrinkles.Only made my face more dry than it was,even with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> After one use, I saw a slight change. I look forward to seeing how well it works. Skin under my eyes immediately felt and looked smoother.</li>
    <li> I believe this serum is helping my skin to stay soft and youthful looking, but it does not correct dark spots on me.  I like the way it makes my skin feel; so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great!  Takes care of small wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  It makes your face very sticky!  I think this one was a mistake on my part.</li>
    <li> Love it . My skin starts to see  a little  difference with less wrinkles</li>
    <li> skin so of fresh loking</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery, great product, great packaging, great experience!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Causes me to break out.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, face seems more hydrated, slightly more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> The product comes with no instructions and no list of the ingredients anywhere! I threw it away because God only knows what is actually in the bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just a couple of weeks and can already see a difference in my skin...the fines lines on my face are fading. This product really delivers and I would highly recommend it to others. I&#x27;ve even ordered some for my Mom and sister,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nikki</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oz Naturals products now for about six months and am very pleased with the results. I have many allergies and sensitivities and have had a lot of difficulty finding a facial care regimen that didn&#x27;t cause me problems. Before discovering the Oz Naturals products, I was using a natural, olive oil based soap and moisturizer. I had not found any skin care supplements like retinol, alpha hydroxy or other acids I could safely use.  I had frequent breakouts and a couple of dry, rough patches that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I tried.  My skin was always blotchy looking, so I constantly used foundation to help cover my uneven skin tones. I started using the Oz Ocean Minerals Facial Cleanser, then added the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, the Eye Gel and the Super Youth Moisturizer. Those rough dry patches I&#x27;d had for several months completely disappeared within the first week of use and in less than two weeks, my skin tone had improved significantly and my breakouts were gone. I was amazed!  Now I rarely have any breakouts, and I my skin tone is so even that I frequently go out without using foundation - something I wouldn&#x27;t have dreamed of doing before. A little of this product goes a long way.  I use only three drops for my face and neck combined.  After almost six months of use, I still have a third of the bottle left, making this an excellent value. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
