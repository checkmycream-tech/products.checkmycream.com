<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the middle of the road on this product. I&#x27;m not quite sure it repelled the insects as much as non-essential oil products. However, I still continue to use it as I feel better with this on my body then one with DEET.</li>
    <li> only repels for short time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in a diffuser. I think it&#x27;s helped with the Mosquitos roaming around inside our home.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I&#x27;ve made lotion bars for my little niece and nephew, 8 and 6.  We live in north Michigan so lots of mosquitoes.  I make small lotion bars to fit their hands and Insect Shield is the best.  Keeps bugs away, smells awesome and works great in the lotion.  Great for adults too.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I mix it with witch Hazel and it keeps the bugs away. Smells really good too!!</li>
    <li> I have two mosquito repellants, one is mechanical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Bug off Synergy for quick trips outside when I don&#x27;t want to fire up the mechanical unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  seems to work&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  some people might not like the smell&lt;br /&gt;  If you want to dilute it and spray it&lt;br /&gt;  on you have to provide your own spray&lt;br /&gt;  bottle.</li>
    <li> This product had a nice smell and seemed to work. I am thinking of adding it to a carrier oil to make it last longer. I put it directly on my skin even tho it says to put it on clothing, etc. as I know my skin is fine with these oils...</li>
    <li> this bug off oil is excellent. using this blend of oils is easy to use. smells wonderful the blend of oils used in this is very soothing to the soul  and works great!!&lt;br /&gt;love the natural idea of no longer having to use things with deet&lt;br /&gt;this bottle makes a good amount of spray if you follow the mixing directions.&lt;br /&gt;will be buying more in the future&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This morning I went photographing flowers in a mosquito-filled area.  I put this on any part of my body that was exposed and only got one bite...on my wrist and I probably just didn&#x27;t get enough there.  The nasty critters were all over my camera equipment but stayed away from me.  I wish it was in spray form, but I guess I could do that myself.  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> Stll got bug bites. Worked pretty well for mosquitoes only. Unfortunately the smell that repelled the mosquitoes also repelled me.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase! The price was right and it arrived quickly. I mixed about 28 drops of it with witch hazel and store it in the fridge, it works very well at keeping mosquitos away. I walked for 2 hours in the woods and didn&#x27;t get one bite! I highly recommend this product for those looking for a natural remedy.</li>
    <li> Went on vacation to Trinidad in the summer &amp; this SAVED my sister and I from the bugs. Mixed with witch hazel, it really did the trick!</li>
    <li> It actually worked and its natural!  Those pesky Mosquitos just flew right by us...not one bite...smells nice too.  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am happy I purchased this item, but I do not think I will buy it again.  I am using this as a mosquito repellent, and for me, it has too high concentration of citronella oil for me.  I diluted this blend to 5% with a carrier oil, and had mixed results.  I saw mosquitoes pass on biting me, while others seized the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 5/20/15**&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a second time, after getting eaten up by mosquitos while mowing.  Before application, I literally had around 5 mosquitos biting me and a lot more swarming while actively mowing.  After spraying this concoction, not a single mosquito bite!  I will raise this a star, and continue to monitor its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Strong smelling of course. Once in a carrier oil, easily applied to skin for protection from mosquitos -- they did seem to stay away from me as I trudged through wetlands where mosquitos number in the thousands or more! Not sure it works against ticks but I&#x27;m still hoping. Today, I used it for a second time, and it was not as effective. I think that once mixed with the carrier oil, the essential oil &amp;#34;fades&amp;#34; somewhat over a few days. Perhaps adding a few more drops will boost its potency?</li>
    <li> Use it as an \\&quot;air freshener\\&quot;. If you have an empty one of those two-half plastic air freshener containers, with at least one half having \\&quot;vent holes\\&quot;, put a few drops of this strong-smelling oil on half a paper towel, put the towel into one half, and use the \\&quot;vented\\&quot; half to adjust the scent&#x27;s intensity. And yes, it has worked for me so far. The current resident house fly seems to have gone into hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, June 2013: Apparently it can TREAT bug bites as well. Normally mine swell up, and this product, used without any dilution, stopped ones I had gotten from doing that.</li>
    <li> I literally have been using this as a bug repellent that I put directly on my body. I put it in the places where you release your nature ferimones so that the mosquitoes only sense the repellent and don&#x27;t come anywhere near me! It&#x27;s is suggested that you dilute the oil, but I just put one drop and it works perfectly. I will never go back to ever using bug spray...ever!,</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Smells great and protects from all insects. Safe for children, pets, and great for equines too. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both get bit every time we go outside wearing this. I used 20 drops in a tiny travel hairspray bottle mixed with 1/2 witch hazel &amp; water. Started off doing 10 then bumped to 20 drops. Tonight I was out in my drive way under 5 minutes and went in because bugs were all over:( currently I am scratching the skin off my ankle from 3 bites.</li>
    <li> You can make your own homemade insect repellant with it.  Mix several drops with witch hazel.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It keeps the bugs off in Texas.  I use just the concentrate and rub that directly on my skin.</li>
    <li> The oils arrived exactly as expected and in the time frame expected.  I was very happy with the oils, and look forward to ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have been making my own bug spray for years.  I am one of those people who gets all the bug bites while other around me are bite free.  I have been buying all but TWO of the essentials oils individually that are in this product.  This is the perfect blend and much cheaper than buying all the esential oils individually.  I have been using it for days in the garden and it works GREAT!  Recipe I use is simple 1/2 water, 1/2 which hazel and as many drops of esential oil as you like.  Put it in a spray bottle, shake before spraying, and perfect bug protection.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I will never buy bug spray again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil for use in a natural bug-repellent centerpiece I found on Pinterest. I&#x27;m honestly not sure how effective it actually is at repelling bugs in that capacity, but it smells nicer and is healthier than a regular citronella candle! I have heard that it works well when applied to pulse points.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to repel mosquitos.  I tried it plain - a drop on each shoulder and that didn&#x27;t help.  One would think that having it full strength would do the trick.  So I got the witch hazel to mix it with but haven&#x27;t gotten around to that because the pests have pretty much left so I have had no need for it.</li>
    <li> Loved it. I made natural bug spray for my daughter with it and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it and buy more as i need it myself.</li>
    <li> The product smells great but you can&#x27;t spray directly on your body.  I work in the heat with shorts and tanktop on, If I can only spray the stuff on my clothes the bugs still bite me.  It didn&#x27;t keep late summer \\&quot;No see-ums\\&quot; from swarming my face nor Deer flies from biting me. Won&#x27;t buy it again.  Shipment was fine though. Transaction was smooth from vendor.</li>
    <li> Works good smells good</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. In fact I attracted more mosquitos. Diluted with some oil and applied on several areas of my body.</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell and it works!</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome product. Not one bite. Dilute in oil and your ready to Go. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It works really well. In the deep south we have lots of mosquitos, and with all the rain this year they are out in force! The Insect Shield Energy Blend has kept them off! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great smell and Works! Used this in Belize last week, wore as my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; to keep away the bugs during the start of the rainy season and smells nice but not flowery so good to wear.</li>
    <li> this stuff works!  One drop behind both knees and at bend in my elbows and I can go out and water my garden and come in without bites, that is amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells great and totally kept my husband from getting eaten alive like he usually does on our vacation! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly.  The smell is SO much better than transitional insect repellents.  I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how I would like this product when I originally got it because I have tried everything. I have an allergy to mosquitoes and have yet to find a spray that works well. I made this into a spray using witch hazel and it was wonderful. Works well and I haven&#x27;t had any irritations to it. It also doesn&#x27;t smell gross which is wonderful.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly, I&#x27;m happy with the product, I will order again thanks!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff works.... i would probably know better if it didn&#x27;t but so far either i have been avoiding the insects or they have been avoiding me. i used it all summer,&lt;br /&gt;i like the smell but my wife hated it and won&#x27;t use the product.&lt;br /&gt;if you like citronella you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Diluted this in fractionated coconut oil and store it in an amber glass rollerball bottle which makes it portable and easy to use. The oil is pure so this small bottle makes a lot! We tested it during a Boy Scout camping trip this summer (East Coast and near the beach...lots of mosquitos). We took the spray containing deet as well just in case but we never used it. We rubbed this on all exposed skin and the only bite one of us got was through clothing!</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and works really well. I mixed it with witch hazel to make bug spray and it keeps mosquitoes away for about an hour or two before you have to respray.</li>
    <li> Mixed bug spray recipie from previous reviews.  I used on myself and the dogs no ticks for the dogs and no bug bites on me.  Will definetly use again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! NO mosquito bites during my entire visit to Fla. First time in my life. I bought another.</li>
    <li> This works fantastic for repelling mosqitos!</li>
    <li> I add several drops to a 4oz bottle of witch hazel and before I go outside I mist it all over my clothes. I also use avon skin so soft oil for on my skin as a second line of defense. The smell is zesty and not unpleasant...but I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a perfume though.</li>
    <li> I use this product each and every time I go outside to tend my animals or work in the garden. Great for keeping away all those nasty biting bugs that sometimes can&#x27;t even be seen. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if that is a good or bad thing.  What good is it if you can&#x27;t stand the awful smell long enough for you to be outside in it.  Exactly.  3 stars.</li>
    <li> Works ! Mosquitoes stay away, no more scratching, no more buzzing, what more can you ask for with a drop or two from a product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The smell and feel are great, but I had mosquitoes and flies drawing blood on me, so I won&#x27;t chance it again.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I am every mosquito&#x27;s dream buffet and can never enjoy time outside without dipping myself in DEET.  Thought I would give this a try since my girls seem to gave inherited my &amp;#34;yumminess&amp;#34; instead of being a mosquito no-mans-land like their Dad....and I hate to DEET them every time we do outside.  I mixed this with witch hazel and water in a big spray bottle and stepped out into our swampiest part of the yard and NOT A BITE!  For someone like me, this oil is nothing short of a miracle....thank you!</li>
    <li> This oil really keeps the bug away!  And it has a pleasant lemony smell too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been in a real buggy situation yet but this is the nicest smelling citronella based natural bug repellent I have smelled.  I mixed 30 drops in a small 2 oz misting spray bottle that was 3/4 full of natural distilled witch hazel.  Caution on the bottle states NOT to use the UNDILUTED oil on skin.  It is the same formula as the formerly named product, &amp;#34;Bug OFF&amp;#34; which was a good repellant.</li>
    <li> Too bad the bottle leaked out in shipping.</li>
    <li> Love that I can make my own bug spray! Mixed 1/4 cup witch hazel, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and 20 droops of this EO in a small spray bottle  and wallah- a chemical free mosquito repellant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good natural bug repellant with a tolerable scent.  This one is great.  The smell is citrus which I like.  Will buy again.  Wish it came in a bigger bottle though.</li>
    <li> This works... So much better than a spray!</li>
    <li> This stuff perfectly it keeps the bugs away, and smell great. Thank You</li>
    <li> Bought this oil to make my own and safer bug repellent. It actually worked for me. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have two small dogs and both have had reations to topical flea solutions.  I decided this year I would try to go natural.  I bought this product, rosemary oil, and peppermint oil.  I put 10 drops each in a small spray bottle (10 ml) and fill the up the rest of the way with witch hazel.  I spray them all over (esp. belly) while covering their eyes.  I do this everytime we go out.  I also spray myself.  We took a walk on a local nature trail which goes throught the woods around 8am the other day.  Not only did it keep the mosquitoes and fleas away, but the deer flies were repelled.  Mind you, I had the bottle with me and kept constant vigil, spraying as we went. I hope this continues to work throughout the worst part of flea season in Ohio.  If so, they have a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I am going to use this in my diffuser once i get it to keep the silly bugs out of my house I hope.  I have high hopes!</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this bug remedy! I bought it to help with the mosquitoes while we were camping my 4 year old nephew and 2 year old niece both were burned. One had boiling water poured on his hand and the other one touched the stove. Bug Off was the only thing that I could think of to use. I knew that essential oils have many benefits so I tried Bug Off! In a few minutes after applying this oil to the crying toddlers the red disappeared and there wasn&#x27;t any sign of the burn! Oh yes, one more injury, my 15 year old nephew grabbed the metal hot dog stick and just had a little red left after Bug Off because he didn&#x27;t tell me right away. Thank you, we all are so thankful!</li>
    <li> This tiny bottle goes a long way! I&#x27;ve been mixing it with witch hazel and pouring it into an atomizer to make my own on-the-go bug deterrent. Started with a 5% solution and still got a few bites (not nearly as many as I used to get, though!) and am currently trying out a 10% solution.&lt;br /&gt;That solution makes a pleasant, citronella-smelling tincture that I&#x27;m happy to spray all over -- on my clothes, on my face, in my hair -- and it doesn&#x27;t leave an icky residue that makes me feel like I have to shower or worry about staining or damaging any upholstery I sit on.&lt;br /&gt;People have teased me about my \\&quot;fluffy spray\\&quot;, but at least I&#x27;m not inhaling commercial body sprays (nobody likes the taste of Off, mosquitos and humans alike!) and putting yucky, sticky chemicals on my skin! I love this and will certainly buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Plant Therapy, for making this Bug Off!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Strong citronella odor</li>
    <li> The stuff never worked. I tried it out the day I got it &amp; the following day as we have tons of Mosquitos. They still land &amp; the still bite.</li>
    <li> Was not bothered by any bugs while camping in the woods. Would definitely recommend as a natural alternative to bug spray. The scent is a little strong but does the job so it is tolerable and there are no harmful chemicals so I felt comfortable using it on my small children.</li>
    <li> I mixed 30 drops with some witch hazel in a spray bottle. I sprayed my windows, entrances, and have used it on my legs and arms when going outside. It smells lovely. I don&#x27;t know that is has done much for keeping bugs away at least for me. I live in rural Michigan and there are bugs just everywhere soooo it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it and I had to get some pesticide stuff. I am sure it helped with the mosquitos as the citronella smell was quite noticeable but maybe I just live in an area with so many mosquitos that it can only go so far. I will add when I spray the mixture on my legs it makes them very soft and silky which I like so much I plan to buy other scents of essential oils from this brand to use on my skin regularly. In short, definitely a quality brand... but all natural bug repellents only go so far...</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Highly recommended to ward off dangerous vectors in our recent times.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed mine with witch hazel and sprayed it on all of us.</li>
    <li> This served me well.  It worked as a natural repellent and as opposed to chemicals that make me ill.  It had a natural smell that was not offensive.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I bought this, but still wanted to at least give it a try.  WOW!  It really does work, and it also smells great.  I tend to give a couple extra squirts just for the scent of it.  My son doesn&#x27;t like getting sprayed so he tends to go without any protection and will be covered in mosquito bites while everyone using Bug-Off will only have one or two. (we live in Wisconsin and mosquitos can get thick in the summertime)</li>
    <li> The smell is strong, but it keeps the bugs away! I usually mix it with my lotion and place it on any exposed areas.</li>
    <li> Bug Off Synergy works well with diluted in witch hazel and water (proportions can be researched online). Re-application is needed every few hours but I prefer this to chemical repellants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mosquito magnet. This stuff works.</li>
    <li> I mix this oil with witch hazel and vodka for bug spray. I wear it while working in my garden and it keeps off the flies. I also spray it on my dogs as a flea and tick spray. Eliminates the use of harsh chemicals that are absorbed through the dog&#x27;s skin and ruins their coat. I like the smell and it is refreshing to spray on several times in the heat. It does not work as well as commercial chemical repellants but giving up toxic chemicals for a few extra bugs is worth it.</li>
    <li> Bug Off Synergy really works here in southeastern Oklahoma where we have lots of mosquitoes and other pesky biters this time of year.  It certainly works on me.  It even keeps the flies away which are outside and bothersome most of the morning and afternoon. I just put a couple of drops in the palms of my hand, rub them together and lightly brush them over my hair, clothing, arms and legs. I&#x27;ve tried it other ways and find my method most effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the quick delivery from this merchant.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Not a single mosquito, spider or other bug bite! Diluting in a spray bottle and spraying on bedding works great as well. I even oiled my wooden fruit bowl with it, and not a single fruit fly. Use a paper towel under the fruit so the oil doesn&#x27;t get on it.</li>
    <li> Great product, great savings, easily comparable to Young Living just much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Terrific at keeping those pesky gnats and mosquitoes away.</li>
    <li> nice product, pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> We have hundreds of spiders around our home, and lately, I&#x27;ve found more and more black widow spiders.  I mixed one part Witch Hazel with one part distilled water, 8oz total; 4oz each.  Afterward, I added 40 drops of Bug Off Synergy.  I sprayed this mixture everywhere, especially around the 16 exterior security video surveillance cameras.  No more spiders and no more spider webs.  I placed several drops of Bug Off Snygery on my palms and then wiped my hands on my neck and arms.  Mosquitoes and flies are repelled.  When they come within two feet of me, they execute an about face and fly away.  This essential oil will be marvelous for trips to the mountains as well as on hunting trips.  Bug Off Snygery essential oil really works!  It&#x27;s safe and effective and best of all, NON-TOXIC.  Try this product, you&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make my own bug repellant. It works great! Added 20 drops to witch hazel. Telling all my friends. Much cheaper than buying all the essential oils individually</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! Just ordered my second bottle so I don&#x27;t run out this summer. Sat out yesterday evening a literally watched those little buggers hover around me, but never land. Re-apply often, just a dab on each arm, leg and behind the neck.   I feel so much better using this product on me and my family - sure beats applying a repellant with such a high level of DEET that melts  nail polish, eek. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with this product (mixed with a fractionated coconut oil carrier oil) on two evening on my deck so far, with happy results! Once again I can enjoy my desk in the evenings! Thanks for making this blend available!</li>
    <li> I used this for a project found on Pinterest&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice smell and did keep the bugs away</li>
    <li> Made bug spray with this essential oil blend using witch hazel.  It smells nice, although I did add a little more lemon essential oil to round out the smell.  Have to be careful with lemon EO because it can make skin photosensitive to the sun.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t know that the EO worked all that well.  I may not have used enough in the spray, though.</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT WORK. THE MOSQUITOES ATE ME ALIVE. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I mix with apple cider vinegar and water.</li>
    <li> Used to make some gifts and all recipients were pleased and commented on the effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> This product is a definite must buy if you spend a lot of time outdoors.  It works well in an oil warmer used outdoors.  It is also effective added into candles.  It has a very strong scent so go easy when making sprays or anything to be rubbed on people or animals.  It definitely works. A drop added to some mineral oil kills ear mites quickly in dogs and cats, but use a light touch when appplying it because it can irritate their skin.</li>
    <li> I found a recipe online for homemade bug repellent and decided to purchase this essential oil mixture to use in it. It smells really good and although I wasn&#x27;t happy with the cost it works really well and has paid for itself already. I used a 12oz. spray bottle, filled it 1/2 full with witch hazel, added 40 drops of Bug Off Synergy Essential Oil Blend, and filled it the rest of the way with distilled water.</li>
    <li> It repels most insects but not all.  I made it into a spray with witch hazel.  I use it on my dog too as its supposed to be safe for them, not for cats tho .. I know cats are sensitive to EOs.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it does work however I found that I had to apply a lot or apply often. We still had swarms of bugs around but were not be it bitten. The smell was nice and overall the product works better then any other bug spray product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It seems to keep the mosquitoes away rather well.  I have used it twice, the second time being out in my garden here in the midwest where, due to all the rain, the mosquitoes have been way too plentiful.  The only thing I did not care for about this product was that it seemed too warm on my skin when I put it on the first time.  I do not like to be too warm, esp. in the summer when it is already hot., especially if it is humid.  So the first time, tho it kept the bugs away, it made me a bit uncomfortable.  I also get sweaty more than the average person, and it seemed to sting a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the second time I used it, I mixed it in my hand first with some Pennyroyal oil, which is very cooling and has a measure of protection from the mosquitoes itself.  This time, not only did it keep the bugs away, but this combination was very cooling to my skin. ( Pennyroyal is not to be used by everybody, esp. pregnant women, but I have used it for years and never had any problem with it.)  Pennyroyal  was helpful with mosquitoes, tho not as good as the Insect Shield Synergy.  Perhaps I&#x27;m on to something, at least for myself.  One could perhaps use eucalyptus or peppermint oil with the above formula, for the cooling effect, if - like me- that would be more comfortable.  I don&#x27;t think mosquitoes are attracted to either eucalyptus or peppermint.</li>
    <li> This stuff if VERY strong.  Use sparingly.  It does seem to work, though.  My wife put a drop on the forehead of a calf, and nearly instantly the flies quit coming to her face</li>
    <li> On its own, it keep away some things like the biting flies but not my mosquitoes. Which was the whole reason I purchased this. I have them so bad that I actually don&#x27;t go outside. I tried adding it to a water/witch hazel mix and I tried it straight. However, I used this as part of a homemade blend where I added lemongrass, lemon and eucalyptus oils to a grapeseed oil base. Then I had good success. So it wasn&#x27;t a completely useless purchase this way.</li>
    <li> I used this in a mix of water and witch hazel. I added a bit if peppermint because I love the smell. And it works SO well!! I spray it on my family when we are out late ( when the Mosquitos are biting) and we stay bite free. I even wear it when I go walking and love how it doesn&#x27;t stink. I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> Very potent. Small amounts evenly spread around your body works well. Love the Aroma. I like wearing it like regular essential oils.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful aroma. You would never guess it was a bug deterrent. I love essential oils and use them daily. This is sure to be a reorder and a new favorite.</li>
    <li> Fabulous stuff. Keeps off all sorts of Florida swamp creatures. Just mixed it up with witch hazel and I&#x27;m good to go. Very very economical too. Love it. Love that the skeeters and black flies hate it. Makes me love it even more.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews. It smells great, so I won&#x27;t return it. I applied it right out of the bottle (undiluted) and it still did not keep mosquitos away from me. Maybe it&#x27;s me.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with witch hazel and put it in a spray bottle.  It really works well and smells good too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait til warm weather to try this and see if it truly works. Scent is pleasant so it won&#x27;t be difficult to wear when going outside. Now I just need to get more carrier oil</li>
    <li> I put on a good amount of this stuff and walked out the door for a walk with my dog.  Well, fast forward and I&#x27;m swatting off loads of mosquitoes and am already developing a bite.  Meanwhile, I REEK of this stuff.  Terrible!  No idea how this has such high reviews but it doesn&#x27;t work at all for me, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Mixed 1/2 witch hazel with 1/2 water and about 40 drops of Insect Shield to make 2 ounces.  Sprayed all over my body to the point my skin was damp.  I went out to work in the garden and it was almost as if it was attracting the bugs.  Horse flies, flies etc. would land on my skin and then bite.  I could smell the essential oil (not a bad smell) so why did it not keep the bugs away?</li>
    <li> I used this oil blend to make an all-natural mosquito repellent spray. After spraying it on you, the mosquitos will either not come near you or will land on you, but not bite you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix: 30 drops inside a spray bottle that contains half witch hazel and half water. [I used a spray bottle that used to have eye glass cleaning solution, 12 oz]. Re-spray yourself every so often. The bottle will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Mixed this with coconut oil as a bug spray and it works! We have had a lot of rain here in SE Texas and the skeeters are out of control.  Amazing oil! What a great bargain.  Bug spray without the nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good scented oil to add to a mixture of vinegar and water for a homemade insect/tic/flea repellant. This oil fits the bill! Great smell, but not feminine - quite unisex. Doesn&#x27;t bother skin or eyes. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This oil is the real deal. My family refers to me as &amp;#34;The Bait&amp;#34; because apparently, I&#x27;m pretty tasty. I get 75 bites a leg when others don&#x27;t get a single bite. So normally I&#x27;m loading up on the deet poison and having to take a half hour shower to get it scrubbed off of me--and I know I&#x27;ve already absorbed a ton through my skin. I hate it. This year I was determined to take my health into my own hands, so I read about all the different oils I could buy. Then I found this, read the reviews, and bought it. I&#x27;ve made the BEST insect repellent I could ever use, and it truly works for me. I mixed witch hazel (the cheap kind with 14% alcohol) with distilled water and a little vegetable glycerin, and a lot of this oil. I shake it up and apply VERY liberally, sometimes a couple times an evening--but I have remained unbitten all summer long. It&#x27;s a miracle, lol. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Did not get any bites</li>
    <li> I orderd thie product to make a natural bug spray for my family. It worked wonderfully not a single bite while using it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and works great</li>
    <li> We have been using the insect shield for a week now and evidently, insects are not thrilled about the smell the essential oils emit, so upon approaching, they bounce back and fly away. Pretty cool, I must add. We dilute the oil as per instructions (1:20). The smell is moderately pleasant (not vomit-inducing). Overall, we are happy with the choice.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It works so well &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!!! Definitely will purchase again!!! Thank you very much!!!</li>
    <li> It works! But you have reply pretty often.....</li>
    <li> Works well. I used witch hazel as the carrier. Reapply often. Even works on flies.</li>
    <li> Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;works great at keeping odors away. keeps flies away too!!!  :)&lt;br /&gt;sad thing my baby is allergic to lavender. :(</li>
    <li> Mixed 40 drops with 8oz vodka and a little water...added a few drops of lavender oil and seasame oil....put it all in a spray bottle and it WORKS~! Smells great too!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more for sure~!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how sorry I am I bought this product. It very well may work on mosquitoes, but storing it is the problem. I put some in a spray bottle with witch hazel, then after using some, put the bottle away in the bottom drawer of a 4 drawer cabinet. I didn&#x27;t think any more about it, but after a few days, every drawer in that cabinet as well as everything in it was  permeated with a repulsively strong odor. I had to throw out good stuff. Who knows when the cabinet will be useful again.</li>
    <li> I usually mix my own concoctions, but added this for times when I don&#x27;t feel like making my own mix. Strong smell, in a good way. Worked well. Got the ants off my counters and kept flies away from my dogs :)&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite brand so I knew it would be a winner. Price is excellent too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work well and left a funky smell on the cats.  Maybe it needs to be diluted??? Thanks anyway.  When you have fleas, you have to try anything....</li>
    <li> This product seemed to be exactly what I expected. I&#x27;m using it in homemade insect repellent and it seems to work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Great for warding off mosquitos, gnats and no-see-ums!!  Smells good too!  Diluted, a little goes a long way!  Better than I had expected.</li>
    <li> seems to work, will see how it does this summer.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly I received this order and it was packaged so there was no chance of breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells great, reminds me of summer nights. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in a bug spray that is safe for my family to use.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and I don&#x27;t seem to be bitten as much when I use it.  It&#x27;s pretty pungent at first but after the citronella wears off a bit, the patchouli scent comes through and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> The product smells nice and I feel comforted knowing it it&#x27;s all natural. I&#x27;d say it works on about half the family and I feel like I have to put a decent amount on. I think I&#x27;ll try diluting with a little less water to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> I had recently seen a recipe for a mason jar insect shield that had almost the same mix as this blend.  I followed the directions which added lemon slices and lime slices with a branch of rosemary and a floating candle to use around a party.  This blend enabled me to make many mason jar insect shields which were pretty and lit up tabletops around my party.  Pretty and they worked with many positive remarks from party goers concerning the scent and the fact there were no insects.  I will be reordering this!</li>
    <li> This smells nice, but I think thats about it. I found some instructions online for a mixture (1/4c water, 1/4c witch hazel and 50 drops of this) and that didnt work. I added more drops but that didnt work. Someone told me to mix it with coconut oil and rub it on for more staying power - I have not tried that yet but I am going to imagine that too wont help.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fairly well. Has a nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> This product is the amazing. I mixed with witch hazel. I saw the bugs around me but the didn&#x27;t bite. I will be purchasing soon.</li>
    <li> My natural go-to bug repellent, mix it up myself with witch hazel and purified water in a spray bottle. Smells clean and natural, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or break me out. And it works like gangbusters! I can&#x27;t recommend this essential oil blend enough!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Love that the citronella is not over-bearing like a lot of commercial bug sprays. I am using this in a version of &amp;#34;camper&#x27;s soap&amp;#34; &amp; in a mister bottle w/ carrier oil.</li>
    <li> So far has worked great! Have watche the pesky Mosquitos buzzing around, but no bites so far!</li>
    <li> This essential oil blend, used with a carrier oil, really works to repel insects without dangerous chemicals. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. I watched mosquitos fly around me but none landed. I finally found a safe way to repel insects!</li>
    <li> I am one of those people that if any kind of insect bites I am guaranteed to be one of those people! I use it in an atomizer (just a few drops) and have had very few welts on my body from a bug bite. It can also be diluted and applied directly on the skin when going outside. Since it is made exclusively from plants I don&#x27;t worry about Deet side effects! I would definitely recommend this to others as an alternative to other commercial products.</li>
    <li> This oil does help keep the mosquitoes away, but it smells so great that now I&#x27;m using it as a sachet for the living room and kitchen. I really like the clean, outdoorsy smell.</li>
    <li> This has a nice fresh citrus/herb scent and a little bit goes a long way.  Does not seem to disturb my dog when I place a few drops on his bandana and rub a drop through his fur.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells better than expected, keeps the Mosquitos away.</li>
    <li> Update to last review...I finally received it! You definitely smell the citronella, I believe it will work great :) we have a lot of Mosquitos at our cabin this time of year, feeling better about using something natural.</li>
    <li> We just dab some here and there on our garden gloves.  No unwanted mosquito visitors!</li>
    <li> Love it..natural insect repellant always better choice than chemical ones.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time on my kids and myself to repel the giant mosquitos we have here.  I don&#x27;t take time to dilute it, I just dot it around our ankles, wrists, and other exposed skin and it has worked as good as the OFF I used to buy (which is pretty nasty stuff).  But the best thing about this oil, is that it removes/kills ticks on dogs! I have two little outside dogs, and I always keep my yard sprayed, but I try not to put any chemicals on the dogs. I have had them for about seven years, and they have never had fleas or ticks. Yesterday, I was outside and one had a tick on his chin (gross), and I didn&#x27;t have any tweezers handy.  I had this Insect Shield oil sitting there on the patio table, so I just wet the tick and the area around it with the oil, then went inside. I forgot about it, but went outside in about 6 hours ready to pull the nasty thing out, and it was GONE! Gone, and there was just a red scab on the dog&#x27;s chin.  So, this oil is amazing!!!  I suppose I can&#x27;t be sure that it actually killed it, but it got it off the dog and I didn&#x27;t have to touch it, so it&#x27;s good stuff to me (and I sprayed the yard that afternoon).</li>
    <li> I hate using to smelly, greasy bug sprays that you buy from the store that are also chucked full of chemicals, but where I live, that was my only choice.  So when I saw Bug Off and the reviews I ordered it right away.  To my surprise this stuff REALLY does work!  ANNNNNNNND it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to run into the house immediately when I was done outside to wash this off because there was no filmy residue or yuck smell left behind.  I will never run out of this stuff!</li>
    <li> the ticks and the bugs are leaving me alone this year and that&#x27;s great...plus so much nicer smell than all the other poisons that traditional repellents use!!</li>
    <li> Recently made our annual bug spray which usually involves mixing a variety of our own oils and using several bottles to do so.  This has cut that down to one bottle!  Love this blend, includes all the key ones pests hate and it&#x27;s strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working wonderfully so far!</li>
    <li> My Husband seems to be honey to all flying insects. He found this product helpful .</li>
    <li> I mixed it with some witch hazel for a homemade bug spray and worked perfectly!  I love it! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> The reason is because it&#x27;s not exactly the season to worry about bugs.  I have used it to make balms.  The oil is strong and has a nice consistency.  I cannot say whether it would be better than mixing the various ingredients on your own, particularly for the price.</li>
    <li> Right after I made insect repellent using this oil, those pesky flies that won&#x27;t leave you alone and drive you nuts began to land on me. I sprayed this on and 15 minutes later realized I hadn&#x27;t been bothered since.  It lasted all evening even though there was no scent left.  The flies came close but never landed. I love it!</li>
    <li> I wish I could say this product worked for me but unfortunately it has not.. We had taken over my fianc&amp;eacute;s grandmothers house and she had a bunch of cats that we had to get rid of because of all the flea&#x27;s they had (and for financial issues) and she also had ants galore coming in that continue to come in even though I have SEVERE ocd and keep this house SPOTLESS, so I purchased this to see if it would help at all because right now we cant afford the super expensive bug repellent that works wonders so I made a spray out of this oil and sprayed it EVERYWHERE and yet it doesn&#x27;t even faze the flea&#x27;s or ants.. I&#x27;d say the only things it has done for us is ATTRACT a TON of bees and I mean ALOT of bees! So many that I have to keep all my doors shut (in this dreadful HEAT) OTHERWISE I&#x27;m killing at least 5-6 a day in my house and we&#x27;ve got 3 kids so there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m risking them getting stung especially my oldest because he is allergic to bees. Iv looked everywhere outside for a bees nest and have not found one at all and yet they are swarming outside my house but weren&#x27;t before I started using this!  Anyways, the other thing it has done is massively stink up the house and seeing I can&#x27;t keep my doors open to air it out there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to continue to use this (besides the fact that it don&#x27;t work). Didn&#x27;t work for mosquito&#x27;s either because I would open our doors up at night time because its still really hot and by night time the bees aren&#x27;t flying around trying to come in but the mosquito&#x27;s sure are! I had mixed the oil in a carrier oil so the flea&#x27;s would hopefully not try to chew us up anymore (which they still did) but the mosquitos still did too! It&#x27;s like this stuff ATTRACTED the bugs instead of repel them and obviously that is NOT why I bought this.. This is very disappointing and frustrating 😒</li>
    <li> I have been getting horribly bit up this season already and am not fond of all of the additives in traditional bug sprays so I tried this as an alternative. The label does not say this product is safe for direct contact with skin, it suggests diluting and misting on clothing. However, I placed about eleven drops in two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and applied to skin assuming it was safe (prior to reading label) and I did not have any negative reactions, which is impressive given my sensitive skin. In any case, it worked perfectly! I was out by a river for a few hours in the evening and not a single bite! I personally enjoy the scent, though I will say it is very potently scented so be sure to dilute appropriately.</li>
    <li> I attract mosquitoes like no one Ive ever met.  In fact, if you normally get a few bites, just stand around me.  You&#x27;ll be ok because they all flock to me!  I used this while I was in Outer Banks, NC...got a few bites.  But I cant figure out if it was just a light skeeter season or if this stuff worked.  Because no one really got bit up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice though!</li>
    <li> I purchased this blend to make my own bug-repellant spray and it is the best formula I have tried to date. It smells great and it works! I have always been one of those people that attracts blood-sucking pests like a magnet and we have a farm so staying inside all summer is not an option. We also live in the deep South where the mosquitoes are terrible. The only thing it does not work against, for me, is biting flies which we have a ton of because of the livestock, but even DEET sprays do not work on them so I can&#x27;t be too disappointed. I make my diy bug spray using everclear, a little water, neem oil, a drop of dish soap, and 30 drops of this oil blend. I can make 7-9 bottles of repellant from this one bottle of e.o. which is wuper economical. The first day I tried out my mix was a day we went cat-fishing. My husband and I sprayed down as soon as we arrived and didn&#x27;t have a single bite for a solid three hours. We could see the mosquitoes swarming around us but they wouldn&#x27;t land on us. Love this product.</li>
    <li> It really repels mosquitoes!  Some mosquitoes would come close but would immediately fly away!  Best choice if you don&#x27;t want poisonous deet.</li>
    <li> Mosquitos are very attracted to me. I tend to get bit way more than the other people around me. It&#x27;s really frustrating, especially since I now live in an area that surrounded by lakes and marshes. Even when I use repellants with a very high DEET concentration the mosquitos still hover inches away, taunting me and occasionally still attempting to bite. I bought this product because I now have an infant, and also because I know that applying as much DEET as I need to to get decent results can be hazardous to one&#x27;s health. I followed the instructions for this product and made a ~3% dilution in witch hazel and alcohol, and put it in a spray bottle. For me, I found that on average it does a better job at repelling mosquitos -- i.e., they actually stay away as opposed to hovering nearby. The downside is that I must reapply every 45-60 minutes. I also don&#x27;t like that it has patchouli in it. The patchouli smell is not very strong, but it&#x27;s still there. I&#x27;ll take it over the DEET smell, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over-all I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I&#x27;m buying a second bottle, but will also be keeping my eye out for something with a similar formula but sans patchouli.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works okay unless you have horrendous mosquitoes.  It does wear off more quickly than chemical insect repellent, just spritz it on more often.</li>
    <li> received this quickly and with good packaging.  Waiting to try this out this summer, I am going to dilute it with witchhazel as a bug repellant</li>
    <li> I mixed 3 drops of this in my body lotion when going to a state park for a few hours...and was pleased to find myself not covered in ticks and mosquito bites at the end of the day (which my friend who was covered in OFF with Deet definitely can&#x27;t say!)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I love the smell, but it&#x27;s tolerable since you really don&#x27;t have to use much at all!&lt;br /&gt;(I actually found this to work better than DoTerra TeraShield)</li>
    <li> I love this product! I mixed it with some almond oil to dilute it and make it go further. It still works great after diluting.</li>
    <li> Wow! It really works. Where was this product when I was a kid?</li>
    <li> I took a chance when I ordered this product. We live in the lowcountry with Sandfleas and I was looking for something more natural for my four month old. I made a bug spray with this oil and it seems to so a pretty good job. I do have to reapply frequently if we are outside for a while.</li>
    <li> I just got the product and have not had long enough to make a very valued review yet. I have used it once and it did protect my grandson from getting bite. The mosquitoes are furious this year and they seem to love him. The one evening he was here, it worked wonderfully and protected him, so I am very optimist and please with the one use. Also the smell is nice .</li>
    <li> Great stuff, bugs don&#x27;t like it, but I do! Was able to let friends use it on a hike when they didn&#x27;t have anything. No DEET for me! Quick shipping also.</li>
    <li> Only natural concoction I&#x27;ve ever had success with! I mix it with a cup of lemon juice, half a cup of vanilla and 16 oz of water - works like a charm</li>
    <li> I use this along with lavender in a blend of witch hazel for myself, kids and my pets to keep the fleas and flys off.</li>
    <li> Like in my childhood when camping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I remember, I can smell this odor, spreading it on me to scare bugs and mosquito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it, it works just as it always had. My friend didn&#x27;t like the smell so didn&#x27;t put any, guess who was bitten ? :)</li>
    <li> I am a mosquito magnet and this works as well as any other insect repellant I&#x27;ve used. My husband thinks it is too strong (smells strong of citronella) but I like it better than commercial repellants. I don&#x27;t hate the scent.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this but its isn&#x27;t as effective as I would like, I use it in a spray bottle with witch hazel and I put a few drops in my fragrance free moisturizer that I slather after the shower... I got 3 bites today and it had been only 2 hours ago that I applied the spray. It is not as effective as DEET, obviously the con of all natural means not as effective. Still keep using. I think I will try child friendly repellent next</li>
    <li> I am sad to admit that this didn&#x27;t work at all - where we live you can&#x27;t even get out to the car without being gorged by 40 mosquitos.  I tried it diluted in witch hazel and I tried it undiluted straight on my skin - didn&#x27;t work! :(</li>
    <li> I mixed this with witch hazel fluid as suggested, and mixed it quite strong... yet the children were actually bitten more than normal.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve had some extra rain.  It smells wonderful though; just like a citronella candle.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well! I put 40 drops in a small spray bottle and dilute with witch hazel.  It works great, even in the summer in Florida.  Love it!</li>
    <li> i expect it can have bug off function. im living in rural area.  actually, i dont know its work or not because i use many stuff to anti-bug at the same time.  but i love the strong smell.  very refreshing.  i use it after bbq in home to refreshing the air in my home.</li>
    <li> I made a solution with half witch hazel and half filtered water, added some of this oil blend (number of drops depending on how much liquid), and sprayed it on myself exposed areas (except my face) before going to bed, and my mosquito roommates left me in peace. I also spray it on my ankles when I go out. It would probably last an hour or two.</li>
    <li> In love!!! I use this in a mix of water and witch hazel and spray my feet and ankles every night or when we go out into the garden. No more bites! VERY STRONG smell, fyi. It really works though!</li>
    <li> We mixed this oil blend with witch hazel in a small spray bottle and use it for bug spray on ourselves and our daughter.  It works great for times when there are a few bugs that you need to keep away and the smell is really nice!</li>
    <li> I mixed this with witch hazel and it really does work to keep the Mosquitos away.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I sprinkled this oil around my vegetable garden to keep bugs away and it was awesome! a few drops did he trick and  lasted 3-4 days! great way to keep my home garden organic!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works great. Even my family of skeptics agreed it worked...and smells better then the chemical poison repellents.</li>
    <li> Great for making ones own bug repellant. Without harsh chemicals or skin irritants, the bugs don&#x27;t like it! Super stuff</li>
    <li> Seller was prompt and product is great! Arrived well packaged. I&#x27;m using it to make my own candles for outside, but I used some today to make bug spray. We live in the woods on a lake, so bugs and mosquitoes are a HUGE problem, but they are keeping their distance now!</li>
    <li> Really like the product, so naturall , perfect size to travel because is so concentrate you can mix it with you cream or oil and last you more than one holiday ,love it!!!</li>
    <li> ... but, unfortunately, so do the mosquitos.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this up, but I will continue my search for an effective, natural bug repellent.  All Terrain is still better, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My favorite vacation spot is a lake in Maine, marred only by the mosquitoes. I decided this year to ditch the DEET and try something more natural. This essential oil blend, mixed with witch hazel and water, has been fantastic. The results?  No bites!  The smell is nice and lemony. So far the whole family has been reaching for my homemade bug spray. Thank you for this product!</li>
    <li> This bug off synergy blend really works! Keeps the bugs away and smells great. Please use CAUTION and DO NOT use UNDILUTED! This will burn your skin when undiluted.</li>
    <li> My yard is full of mosquitoes so I have tried everything to keep my kids from getting bites.  This is the only thing I have found that works!  I put the blend into lotion bars and now my kids can play outside without being worried about bites!  I highly recommend this to anyone with children who is looking for a more natural solution for repelling bugs.</li>
    <li> This seems to do the trick in keeping mosquitos away, but it may also keep others away. The citronella scent was very strong. I am one of those people who mosquitos feast upon, but this seemed to keep them at bay. After spending several hours outside, I awoke to find just one bit from some daring little bugger. I was impressed with the results, I just wish maybe it came with a more appealing smell.</li>
    <li> Incredible products!  Great service</li>
    <li> This oil blend worked very well. I forgot about my ears, so the first time I went out, the mosquitoes flocked to my ears.  I put the oil on and they left me alone. The company offers a money back policy if not satisfied, which is wonderful, but not needed for me!  It does have a strong odor--check out the ingredients; personally I like the smell and it smells a lot better than other things I&#x27;ve tried. It did not bother my skin...I did dilute it.  I am so relieved that I can finally go outside without being swarmed.</li>
    <li> This seems to be quite helpful in repelling mosquitoes.  It smell pleasant and I don&#x27;t need to use very much for it to be effective.  I would definitely recommend it.  Also, shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Works well for pup and myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to make a DIY bug repellent and trust me, it works! Went to the lake 2 weekends in a row and the only time I got bit was the 2nd night when I forgot to put it on. Trust me, it works!</li>
    <li> I put a few drops in my hands, rub together then lightly rub all over exposed skin. I literally watched a mosquito land on me 3 times and did not bite but flew away.</li>
    <li> Usually I make my own blend for bug repellent, however I decided to give this a try. Even though many of the reviews were unfavorable, I took the risk.  It worked just fine. It was quick and easy to make a spray repellent. that worked. I mixed it into a witch hazel solution</li>
    <li> Looking for something to be able to enjoy our backyard again. This worked perfect and smells really well. Never thought of using a EO to fight off bugs, but a small amount goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> Have been very impressed with Plant Therapy EOs. Using this one &amp; citronella to make a bug repellent spray!</li>
    <li> I dilluted with witch hazel and it smelled pleasant compared to icky deet! Not sure how effective it is yet, but doesnt hurt!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely keep all the bugs away, but we definitely have fewer bites without messing with heavy pesticides. And I don&#x27;t mind the smell. My 8yo boy didn&#x27;t like the smell but tolerated it on his legs.</li>
    <li> This product not only smells great, but it also actually works. Mosquitoes love me. They also love my five-year-old-daughter. My husband jokingly refers to us as his &amp;#34;bug repellent,&amp;#34; that&#x27;s how much the bugs love us. But this great-smelling essential oil really keeps them away!</li>
    <li> Used for insect spray and soy candles made at home. Really works. Very pleasant scent. Plan to use again next year.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  We live along the gulf coast and with all the rain lately we have been inundated with flies mosquitoes and gnats when sitting outside on patio. My husband is literally a bug feast and has not found anything to repel bugs. I hate the smell of bug sprays even the &amp;#34;natural &amp;#34; ones. They don&#x27;t work!!  I ordered this and mixed as per the directions. It&#x27;s smell great and the bugs have gone elsewhere.  I much prefer non chemical products...better for everyone.  Get this if you have a flying bug issue!!</li>
    <li> Have not made bug spray with it yet, but this product is definitely legitimate essential oil blend.</li>
    <li> Worked great with witch hazel. It makes a excellent mosquito deterent.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product, since Spring bugs have been attacking me and my skin reacting negatively,  even at 90+ degrees I have to wear long sleeves and sweat tops which was unbearable, I  got scared of the outside, bugs bite me inside of my house also, I tried every bugs spray cutter, off, deep woods and the list continues. I stumbled upon this product and through desperation give it a try, since then I&#x27;ve encountered armies of bugs and I have not been bitten once, I could not wait for the chance to review the product, worth every penny this save my summer and very satisfied pleasant smell too, thank PlantTherapy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product and rather confused by it as well. We tried to use it two ways: Diluted to 5% per manufacture instructions and undiluted on pressure points based on information we found online from other users. We have 6 members in our family that this was used on. My 2 sons and I rarely ever get bit and we used this product both ways with no difference in the number of bites we get without it. Mosquitos love to feast on my husband and 2 daughters and this product did nothing to repel them. As a matter of fact, it seemed to attract MORE Mosquitos to my eldest daughter, this being the confusing part. I&#x27;ve included a picture of my daughter&#x27;s leg after we had been camping for 24 hours. This is by far the most she has ever been bit, and during a time when none of us seemed to have an increase in bites even though we were in the same areas the whole time. We went to the store after this and bought traditional repellent because my daughter was miserable. Though she was still bit occasionally with this, it was nothing like when she was using the oil. It may work for some people but I would not risk it if I were you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blend to try as a repellent, since we are removing chemicals from our lives.  We&#x27;ve moved to a coastal area and are bothered by all types of biting things.  I added about 5 drops to a container of coconut oil....maybe about 1/4-1/2 cup total.  My son and I used it on our legs and arms, and neither of us had any bite whatsoever.  Unbelievable. The smell was not unpleasant, and we don&#x27;t have to worry about killing off any brain cells.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, just a few sprays with some diluted witch hazel and it saves me from all those bites. You want to add extra coverage though because they can be really hungry.</li>
    <li> This stuff was great! I bought two bottles cause I live where there are many bugs and biting things. I mixed with some water and sprayed this on and around my dogs house and bedding and on our chairs outside as we enjoyed the bug be gone days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil blend after a friend recommended it. Northeastern summers get very humid and mosquito filled, and I was avoiding going out at night for fear of being eaten alive by mosquitoes. I have used it to go out walking and I have not gotten bitten once so far! The bugs really do stay away from this stuff. I use it straight from the bottle onto the skin, applied to all exposed skin except my face. This way I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying. There is a slight burning sensation but I have not experienced any skin irritation. The only downside is the strong scent of citronella, but I&#x27;m getting used to it. I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural - no nasty toxic pesticides.</li>
    <li> This product smelled realy nice. I used it to add to the homemade sunscreen I put on my kids. Their school takes them on nature walks around the campus and we haven&#x27;t had one bite all summer!</li>
    <li> I do so love the way Bug off smells, but I would not rely on it for full protection against insects.  We have a lot of mosquitoes in our yard and I had been using deet based repellent, but it is so oily and it stinks and I had to be very careful not to get it in my eyes or on my lips.  I really hoped this product would be an alternative, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as deet.  It works better than nothing at all, but a few of those pests manage to get through to my flesh.  I would not be concerned about a bite or two, except that West Nile has been found in our area. Natural products are wonderful if they are effective, and some truly are, but this one is just not as effective as I wished it would be.  Sigh!  goodbye pretty smell, back to the stinky deet for me.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I had a B-Que with about 20 guests. No one had any repellent but me. The bottle was quickly passed around and we all enjoyed the outdoors without being bit. I will order more for sure.</li>
    <li> Great product, very fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently become interested in using essential oils in place of scarier chemicals. I hate wearing bug spray because it usually smells terrible and feels sticky. I ordered this product to mix with witch hazel to use as a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - it smells very different when mixed as opposed to full power so if you smell it straight from the bottle and don&#x27;t like it, give it a chance mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - it DOES keep the bugs away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - Whether or not you like the odor will be completely based on personal preference. I liked the smell at first but get sick of it after a few minutes. I don&#x27;t really care for the cedarwood scent. On the other hand, my mom loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;**Since I don&#x27;t really like the smell on myself, I actually use this product in my chicken coop to keep mites and other bugs away and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend looking over the oils included and if you aren&#x27;t sure if you will like all of them, start with the small size. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the product really works!  I added a little peppermint oil to it because I like the scent, but it is great the way it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this and it helps a great deal. And I like the smell</li>
    <li> Diffused the &amp;#34;bug off&amp;#34; as we were sitting outside for several hours and everyone was so surprised that there were no mosquitos.  We&#x27;ve tried it twice and no bugs.  I&#x27;m thrilled! I&#x27;m going to make a bug spray with it too - hopefully it works just as well!</li>
    <li> Great bug spray repellent.  Mixed with water, vodka and insect shield for my own bug repellent concoction.  Smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with witch hazel and made a spray. It seems to deter bugs away. Angel it better than a lot of bug sprays</li>
    <li> Not sure how well this works as a bug repellant, but it smells better than the store-bought products.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil and then went to the Plant Therapy website and found a recipe to make our own bug spray.  So far it is keeping the bugs away and we are so happy we purchased this oil.</li>
    <li> sometimes it wok sometimes it dont</li>
    <li> I mixed this oil blend with witch hazel and put it in a &amp;#34;re-purposed&amp;#34; steel spray bottle.  I brought it along on my first ever camping trip to the White Mountains.  Not a single bug bite!  I also like the scent.</li>
    <li> Mixed this up water in a spray bottle. Works a little &amp; smells great. I still end up spraying w/ bug spray.</li>
    <li> I live in North Texas and have been using this about a week. It seems to keep the mosquitoes from biting!  Bonus, it smells good.  Would by again.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast service</li>
    <li> It works! and it smells really good. Not like straight citronella. We have mosquitoes and they stay away. It even keeps away some flies.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a bug spray without deet this year since I have young children. This product did not prevent Mosquitos from biting in southwest virginia.</li>
    <li> A few drops of this product smells really good when diluted in 1/2 Witch Hazel and 1/2 water. I purchased it to fend off mosquitoes indoors. If it succeeds, I&#x27;ll give it a five-star rating.</li>
    <li> love that there&#x27;s a mixture like this and you can dilute it with witch hazel and put it in a spray bottle for repellent!</li>
    <li> I was a little doubtful even after all the glowing reviews, but this is wonderful. I am generally a bug magnet and even deep woods off leaves me with a few bites, this was far superior to that and smells quite a bit better. We also sprayed around our tables while we were camping and it kept the gnats away. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I will be buying more. It keeps the flies away at dinner time :)</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well. The mosquitoes were vicious this year because we&#x27;ve had a lot of rain.  I guess I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> It smells very nice, but is not very effective against gnats in my backyard.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I gave it a week and i&#x27;m sitting here scratching the 50 cent piece sized welts all over my legs.  I was having a hard time with the scent anyway- patchouli just brought back too many memories of college in the 90&#x27;s.  I also diluted it to 5% and it still stings a bit. back to the brain damaging deet.</li>
    <li> I am making homemade fly/bug spray for my horse and this has turned out to be an important ingredient.  Since I added this, my formula has worked even better.  All natural very important.  Generous size.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Here is the recipe for creating a bug spray from this, from Plant Therapy&#x27;s blog:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you will need:&lt;br /&gt;Insect Shield Synergy&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Natural Witch Hazel (You can also use Apple Cider Vinegar)&lt;br /&gt;4 oz Spray Bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Fill half of the 4 oz spray bottle with water. Add the Witch Hazel or Apple Cider vinegar to fill the bottle almost full. Add about 20-50 drops of Insect Shield Synergy. The amount will depend on the strength you need. For children start out at the 20 drops. Adults can add up to the 50 drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: http://essentialoilblogging.com/2013/06/10/diy-all-natural-bug-off-spray/</li>
    <li> So far so good. Went on a garden walk over the weekend. There were definitely lots of flying insects but we did not have any bites. Usually my partner would come away with at least 10 in a situation like that. We haven&#x27;t tried it at night in a mosquito area, but day time back yard -5 stars. The scent is very pleasant, mostly lemon grass and eucalyptus. I mixed it with witch hazel and put it in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Great bug repellant! I love to use it!</li>
    <li> Smells really nice, not to potent and keeps bugs away!!! Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Love the essential oil, will be ordering more for sure. Great seller</li>
    <li> I went online and did some research prior to buying this product. In one day, I&#x27;d been bitten about 21 times on my left arm and about 7 times on the right arm while tending my garden... and was very frustrated, but did not want to use a chemical insect repellent. I&#x27;d tried some others products prior to purchasing Insect Shield Synergy but they were either effective for a short period of time or not effective at all. Bothersome and pesky flying critters REALLY dislike this product. I&#x27;m thrilled that I can now go outside and not have to worry about being bitten.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it works.  I am very happy to have an alternative to spraying pesticide on my kid.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This oil seems to work fairly well, but the bottle is pretty small for the price.  I made a few batches of spray and now its gone.  Since we re-apply it very often, it didn&#x27;t go far.</li>
    <li> I used this to make bug spray and bug lotion bars--very pleased with each!</li>
    <li> :) Thank you for the prompt order, it was exactly the product i asked for. smells nice, will try it on bugs this summer</li>
    <li> Mosquitoes absolutely love me.  I have tried blending my own repelant, but they didn&#x27;t work that well. I tried this one.  I had to mix more oil per witch hazel, but I think that&#x27;s just because I am a strong magnet to these stinkers!  No fault of the oil.  I love the way it smells too!</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep the bugs away from my mom when she is outside, and it works pretty well!</li>
    <li> I just splashed this stuff on and kept everything away and smells intoxicating. For other customers look up other products from plant therapy like hazel nut to mix with it and last longer. Do not put it on upper lip or lips it will burn. This product is better than having deet which is a corrosive and known to cause cancer.</li>
    <li> Used this as an alternative to the normal brands with deet in them.  Seemed to help keep knats, mosquitoes, deer flies, etc. at bay. Only disappointment was the extraordinarily small amount of the product (1/3 oz) which, given the price, is nowhere near being an economical solution.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Arrived super fast.Was packed very well and there were no spills. Works for all natural bugs spray -tried n tested on my kids!</li>
    <li> Compared to the Doterra essential oil, it is a lot cheaper, but I have to admit that Doterra&#x27;s bug-off smells just a touch better... still I&#x27;d rather pay less and deal with a slightly less pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Very concentrated. Highly recommend using gloves, covering face and eyes from inhalation for tranfer&lt;br /&gt;To spray bottle. Not recommended for direct contact to skin</li>
    <li> Prompt service. This essential oil blend effectively reduces bugs, bug bites.  Nice to have a safe, healthy option.  Well pleased with product and service.</li>
    <li> Worked really well, I just wish I diluted it because it only lasted about a week or two in the dead of summer! Other than my disregard for the label, I highly enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> It works well it just smells overwhelmingly of citronella and nothing else. I found this oil blend searching for lemon balm and probably should have read the ingredients more thoroughly. I&#x27;d rather smell like patchouli than this sickening stuff.</li>
    <li> works well  and the smell doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you</li>
    <li> I put a few drops on cloths and placed them where we were having insane mosquitoes as a result of several flash floods.  It was incredible how well this worked!  We went from eat up with mosquito bites to none.  Yay!  Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Maybe we have super mosquitoes or something, but this hasn&#x27;t done much to keep them away.  I wanted something natural to use, but I end spraying chemicals along with this or I get covered in bites.</li>
    <li> Not sure that it works very well to keep mosquitos away but I thought i would try it. I had a recipe that called for this oil, apple cider vinegar and water.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great way to naturally, without toxins, ward of nasty mosquitoes!</li>
    <li> an elderly friend called to ask if I could please examine her cat as he has been acting odd. I checked and he was covered in fleas! so was his bedding and of course her chair. Rather than spread poison all over her house I got an overnight delivery of this wonderful brew. I made a home made mix to spray on her stuff and ordered a gentle mix to spray on the kitty. A M A Z I N G! Fleas were dropping dead before our eyes. The smell was pleasant and it didnt burn our lungs or our eyes to use it. It was safe for kitty to lay on without fear of him getting sick from licking it.</li>
    <li> This did nothing to ward off mosquitoes, who came to feast on me as usual, the three different times I applied this (full strength, not diluted!).</li>
    <li> I love the smell! But I got it to rid off mosquitos while we sleep but unfortunately it does not seem to work. Either that, or my husband&#x27;s blood is just too yummy so he attracts them in spite of everything.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma, not that unnatural stuff, and it works well.  What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Followed many different recipes from reviews and online.  Even tried applying it straight.  Didn&#x27;t keep mosquito away.  In fact, the scent attracted some more gnats to me by the river.  Wish I could return it but  Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow return - so keep this in mind before you spend your hard earned cash.</li>
    <li> It actually works! My skin overreacts to mosquito bites. One nip and it turns bright red to brown and itches for days. It&#x27;s really aweful because it&#x27;s never just one bite. So glad I found this stuff. Very happy that it&#x27;s natural because I am not willing to put chemicals on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this to make home-made, chemical free bug spray.  It works well and smells pleasant.</li>
    <li> Use it on my horses as part of my homemade recipe for fly-spray.  Bronco, ACV, Pine Oil, Insect Shield and Skin so Soft.  As a filler, you can use water or a little pine sol, whichever you choose or none at all!</li>
    <li> It certainly smells like citronella, but the mosquitos don&#x27;t seem deterred.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every natural mosquito repellent out there :)  Most of them do not seem to do much.  A number of them also smell rather horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, this one seems to actually work.  Our yard is infested with mosquitos.  Impossible to be out there without getting swarmed.  After rubbing this on, the cloud of mosquitos dissipates.  May still get one or two circling around, but definitely a big improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell of the oils is actually pleasant.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a natural product that is actually effective.  Everyone including my toddler loved putting this on.</li>
    <li> smells good but that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> This product works GREAT and you&#x27;re not spraying yourself with dangerous poisons. I can put this on and walk through mosquitoes and not get bit. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Another tool in my mosquito repelling arsenal! A great find, simply mix in this formula in with witch hazel in a sprayer, diluted depending on sprayer size. I keep my sprayer in the fridge because it feels so good sprayed on these increasingly hot summer days. Very pleasant smelling, but most importantly, it totally repels mosquitos - they can&#x27;t stand this stuff. Arrived well packaged from the manufacturer, and I&#x27;ve already recommended this item to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I just got back from spending two weeks in a busy city in India and did not get one bug bite while wearing this. The last day I forgot to use this and ended up with at least 3 bites. I used it on the back of my neck, wrists and tops of my feet.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in good condition.  I have only used it a few times in the last few days but it seems to repel the bugs as detailed.  I am very happy with the Bug Off oil.</li>
    <li> LOVE plant therapy EO! I use the brand frequently and like the insect shield. I&#x27;d purchased it, hoping it&#x27;d keep the gnats away while my kids were playing outside but unfortunately it only attracts them more although we live in FL and I&#x27;ve been told virtually nothing detours these gnats. It seems effective on other bugs.</li>
    <li> I have looked up which essential oils are believed to repel bugs and this little bottle contains them.  I am using this to clean the house and in our fabric softener in hopes of repelling the buggers this summer.  I like the smell and a little goes a long way.  I received the bottle quickly and it was securely wrapped and sealed -- meaning no leaks.</li>
    <li> I tend to be skeptical of \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; products, but this stuff WORKS! Just returned from E Africa and  had only one mossie bite in a month. Amazing! The  woody scent is strong, but for me, not unpleasant. .</li>
    <li> Strong smell but it seemed to keep the bugs away, it worked better than some of the other products...................&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product if you can handle the smell</li>
    <li> I recently spent 9 days in the tropics where the bugs are thick and mosquitoes are small but are mostly fang. My travel companions wore many different kinds of Deet and Non Deet insect spray while I spritzed myself with my Bug-Off blend. I had NO idea if this would work or not, but I had only one bite during my entire stay while the others received many (many) bites during our trip. If there are bugs, they will find me, so I&#x27;m a bit of a freak of finding any way to keep them away. And I think I finally found my magic. I am more than happy with this product and will use it only moving forward. No bad smell, no oily/greasy residue and all natural. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> The blend smells really good and it seems to work against bugs as well (only tried it for one night so far). I sprayed it on the window screen and curtains where the offending buggers were coming in and there weren&#x27;t any bug bites for the night. I only diluted it with water (about 8 drops for an ounce) so I hope that works. Haven&#x27;t fully tested it yet because it&#x27;s been a pretty mild summer bug-wise.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for both the dogs and humans during our vacation in Northern Wisconsin. I mixed about 5 oz of witch hazel with 5 oz of water and about 50 drops of this oil.  Sprayed it all over my clothes and the dogs back and legs.  I sprayed in my hands and rubbed onto dogs ears and faces as well as my own face.  I have sensitive skin and had no reaction to this spray/oil blend.  5 different humans and 4 dogs used this and the deer flies and mosquitoes really stayed away.  I will buy this again and would recommend to others. The first day I did not apply the spray by hand on the dogs ears and faces and the flies were terrible.  I was very liberal with the spray from then on and the dogs were much more comfortable.  This smells mainly of citronella but I did not mind the smell. The dogs did not seem to be bothered by the smell either.  Good non-toxic way to keep the biting insects away.</li>
    <li> I use this product in lotions I make for myself. I simply enjoy the mixture of scents in this product, I don&#x27;t necessarily use it as a \\&quot;bug off\\&quot; product. Fairly strong scent so you do not have to use very much. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I live in central Texas, where it&#x27;s hot and the weather is largely unpredictable--a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes.  For whatever reason, they find me delicious.  After recently learning that catnip oil is supposed to be a powerful mosquito repellent, I went looking for some with the intention of concocting a homemade application of some kind.  Well, it&#x27;s pretty hard to find pure catnip oil at reasonable prices that hasn&#x27;t had the active compound, nepetalactone, filtered out.  But I came across this Bug Off stuff and decided to give it a try.  Since it smelled so fresh and herbal, I decided to put it on the pulse points of my wrists and neck (like you&#x27;d do with any scent) but, as a test, not my legs or ankles.  The surprising result was that the vile little vampires left my upper body completely alone (although my calves and ankles certainly took some abuse that day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had one occasion to use it so far, but I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.  I gave five stars because although I&#x27;m sure there are chemicals that could be more potent (at least at first), this is aromatic enough that no one has to know it&#x27;s really repellent (if you&#x27;re even slightly the essential-oil-wearing type anyway), plus being an oil it soaks in instead of evaporating, and it comes in a tiny bottle which makes it fantastic for traveling.  Bonus: I didn&#x27;t even have to break out the cauldron; it ships ready for practical application.  Win!</li>
    <li> Made my own bug repellant with it.  Seemed to work well.  Beware it is really strong smelling stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this in lotion bars, both my mother and I spend a lot of time in the garden and this has worked great.  Added benefit is that if we forget to apply before gardening and get a bug bite, rubbing some on after the fact has helped stop the itch and burn from the bite.</li>
    <li> We used this essential oil blend on our camping vacation this summer.  The mosquitos really did &amp;#34;bug off.&amp;#34;  I added it to purified water in an atomizer and it was convenient as well as effective.</li>
    <li> Since moving to new town, I&#x27;ve been suffering from mosquito bites.  I have scars from last year&#x27;s bites, and gave up on enjoying my yard this summer.  But, I still go outside for a few minutes from time to time.  My choice was between (1) spraying deet \\&quot;poison\\&quot; on me and shower off later or (2)get bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews here, I mixed this Bug Off with some carrier oil and purified water (vodka probably is better.) Sprayed it on me and went outside.  Unbelievable, but I did not get bit!  I used only a few drops of Bug Off, because I don&#x27;t care for strong fragrance of anything.  Bug Off smelled quite pleasant for me.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and had high hopes for this product but it doesn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything other than makes everything smell a bit like lemon pledge. I tried mixing it with witch hazel, I tried just using it directly on my skin and furniture, I tried mixing it with vodka (and spraying it) Nothing. I&#x27;m disappointed but kind of thought it was too good to be true really.</li>
    <li> Me and my Daughter had a big summer problem with Mosquitos bites. We usually use Off Woods, and still not working well. I use some drops of Insect Shield on the paper towel and rub all over her skin and live the paper towel inside her backpack. She came from summer camp with no bites at all. Very good protection and happy summer!! Best ever</li>
    <li> It smells fabulous.  It works better than 90% of the products I have tried.  It feels fabulous.</li>
    <li> this works very well for me most of the time! i put three or four drops in my palms, rub them together, and then rub my skin and clothes from my feet to my head, including my hair. i usually will get no bites at all when i do this. EXCEPT when i go out to my alley. it&#x27;s like a forest of brush and trees around the back alley, and i was out there talking to a neighbor the other day after having just applied this. those skeeters out there are tough! and  they feasted on my legs like i was fresh meat. this isn&#x27;t to say that the mosquitoes aren&#x27;t bad up closer to the house, because they are. and without this stuff, i get attacked within seconds. so even though the alley-skeeters are tougher, i still think this is the most effective product i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> works on must of the bugs. have to reapply about every hour to keep the mosqitos off.</li>
    <li> I made about 4 oz of DIY insect repellent, using 2oz filtered water, 2oz alcohol free witch hazel, and about 30 drops of Bug Off.&lt;br /&gt;My friend and I sprayed our skin and clothes, then we went for a LONG walk along a creek next to tall grass and weeds. I was wearing shorts and short sleeves. Neither of us was bitten by anything... which has like, never happened to me personally. THIS STUFF WORKS.</li>
    <li> I put four drops in a spray bottle with 1 cup glycerine.  It worked great.  We have some gnats that fly around a seating area we use in our back yard,  but I hate to spray myself with chemicals, so I bought this to try.  It worked great and it still smells pretty good, too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t mixed up our bug spray yet because its off season here. But it smells identical to the locally made organic stuff my grandpa use to buy when I was a kid. If it is indeed the same combination of oils, I&#x27;m sure it will work just as fabulously as the stuff I&#x27;m used to. Sure do wish they still made it. But I have high hopes this will be just as great! This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever anticipated mosquito and sand gnat season!</li>
    <li> Love the idea of a natural bug repellent.  I have not found one that works well yet.  So I cannot attest to the reliability of this product but I am hopeful.  Also, I think the cedarwood is too strong for my taste and they could have left out the patchouli.  So if you have an aversion to cedarwood and patchouli, pass on this product.  Other than those two, I like every other ingredient.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions on bottle- spray it on - not sticky- and it&#x27;s seems to keep mozzies from biting.Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This product really works. It is highly concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on to keep the bugs away. It arrived sooner than I thought it would, almost right after I ordered it. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Of course it&#x27;s smelly but it didn&#x27;t keep the bugs from biting me and gave me a headache</li>
    <li> Used this in my recipe for homemade bug repellent spray! It appeals to us due to having an asthmatic son, &amp; he does not do well with the harsh bug spray out there.</li>
    <li> I sprayed it on my legs that a fly was biting and the fly left me alone which was nice. I diluted with water.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I am using it while visiting family in Midwest, keeps chiggers off me and other little critters.  Mixed it with some water and put it in a sprayer and sprayed around the doors where to hundreds of flies hang out waiting to come in.... It worked!!!!  Keeping the flies away for hours!</li>
    <li> Works great, just as well as deet or other chemicals. OK smell. I am very happy with it. Arrived a day early.</li>
    <li> I found the formula on the Internet: 3oz apple cider vinegar, 3 oz water, 6 drops oil...so far I&#x27;ve been able to work in my garden and the bugs seem to leave me alone. The smell of the oil is so light, you don&#x27;t notice it after the initial spraying. I use it on my dogs to drive off fleas and ticks and so far it appears to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing repairs on my chicken run.  I first went out unprotected, and had to deal with insects buzzing and landing on me.&lt;br /&gt;I finally went inside and dabbed some oil on my inner elbows and knees, and the back of my neck.  When I returned to work, not a single insect bothered me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great, natural alternative to bug spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I have been continuing to use this blend and it continues to work great!&lt;br /&gt;I do not dilute or mix it with anything, just a few dabs in body parts where bugs might aim for.&lt;br /&gt;Wrists, ankles, neck, knees, and elbows seem to be the most effective placement.  I also add a few drops to my hair for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s made up of natural oils, I&#x27;m not concerned about regular use.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the Bug Off Synergy Essential Oil Blend, I mixed it with witch hazel in a small spray bottle. I spray my clothing and areas on my back deck where we often dine outside. The smell is absolutely divine and it seems to work at warding off pesky pests really well.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! We use it and no mosquito bites! I am very happy to have a nontoxic solution for myself as well as the little people in my life.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for summer.  Bugs stay away! Wish for larger bottle!</li>
    <li> I added this to some witch hazel in a spray bottle and we used it on the patio at night.  No one got bit by mosquitoes AND everyone said they loved the smell!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like putting poison on my dog, so this is a great alternative and it makes him smell good, too.  Take a 16 0z spray bottle, fill half clean water and half witchhazel.  Add 40 drops of BugOff.  He stands there and waits for us to spray him before we go out for a walk.  The other chemical topicals don&#x27;t prevent the ticks and fleas from attaching themselves to animals.  The Bug Off keeps the bugs away, off my dog and out of my house.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice, but my bugs did not go away. We have hundreds of Lady Beetles and I was hoping this would do the trick.</li>
    <li> This insect oil appears to work very well. Occasionally a very determined insect finds one area that was not covered. Not at all a fault of the oil. We will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> mix this with water and witch hazel .  great when camping i spray on the ground and chairs, dog and myself.. keeps ants away too</li>
    <li> Great value! I purchase cheap candles from the dollar store etc. and add a few drops of this to the top prior to lighting. Saves a fortune! I also mix it with witch hazel and spray it on our horses (keep away from face). It works as well as expensive alternatives!</li>
    <li> Works well for mosquitoes, but seems to actually attract wasps and bees. Bought this for the Amazonian jungle, and ended up not using it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to a location without many wasps, it&#x27;d be great, but if it&#x27;s dense woods our jungle, don&#x27;t bother, the natural stuff isn&#x27;t suited to the job.</li>
    <li> I needed a very small amount of this. Mixed it with witch hazel and put it in a glass spray bottle. It smells very natural, no more toxic chemicals! And it definitely keeps the mosquitoes away from me at my house. I was getting mosquito bites every night and then I started using this and the bites stopped. I have yet to take it somewhere with a SERIOUS mosquito problem. I will update the review if anything changes, but for now, so far so good, I recommend it! Considering how much repellent you can make with this oil, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: I tried keeping ants away (we do have a major ant problem) with the oil alone and it wasn&#x27;t too effective.)</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;I will never go anywhere without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diluted in water it makes excellent anti-mosquito spray, anti-inflammation spray, calming spray and it also smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> I Used this Camping on myself, kids, and dog. We all came away form a 4 day camping trip with no Bug bites.... We Were with some friends that used OFF bug spray, and they all had bug bites at the end of the trip. I will never use onother product... This is the best. You do have to apply about every hour, but on the up side you are not spraying DEET all over yourself...</li>
    <li> i have an outburst of mosquitos in the house recently. while doing a lot of research on the products, i purchased this item hoping it is more effective than the deet products i used. unfortunately, it is not effective. I mix the this with witch hazel as recommended but still get bitten a lot. I don&#x27;t recommend this item for serious users.</li>
    <li> I mixed this in with my homemade sunscreen for a recent trip to Mexico. It works well when I could still smell it but out hiking in the jungle I should&#x27;ve brought more with me to keep the bugs away since I did end up with some bites. I think that for camping in the summer, I&#x27;ll make a spray bottle of the stuff like other people on here have suggested so that I can apply it more easily and often. It&#x27;s nice to have some sort of repellent though since I usually don&#x27;t use anything!</li>
    <li> I bought this essential oil to mix with coconut oil for a natural bug repellent for myself and my dog.  It smells a lot like citronella more than anything else.  My boyfriend says that we smell like a bunch of hippies when we have it on...which I will take as a compliment over the strong smell of typical bug spray chemicals.  I can&#x27;t speak much for the effectiveness yet, but we are going camping this weekend, so I&#x27;ll update when we return.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work, so I&#x27;m not really sure what to say.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good quality oils, however.  This company hasn&#x27;t disappointed me in the past, so if it didn&#x27;t work for you either, don&#x27;t let that put you off from their other products.  I have bought their individual oils and made very good perfumes and room sprays, and also used them in an oil warmer.  Next time I try this, I&#x27;ll probably buy another warmer and try it that way, instead of in a witch hazel spray.</li>
    <li> Helps....but must cover and protect to. Of course, this felt like the summer in the rain forest.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It works very well in repelling insects when we are in our back yard.  You do not need to use very much and it smells very nice and natural.  Plus, it contains no DEET so you feel much safer using it.</li>
    <li> This works great. I mixed it with some witch hazel and vanilla.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great too!! Trust me.. I live in the South where every biting bug known to man lives.. and.. they all bite me if I&#x27;m outside more than 10 minutes. I use this oil on all my hot spots, back of elbows, knees, wrists and a few other places and I can sit out by the pool for hours with no bites.. not even a wasp circling me.. I am now able to walk down to the river with my dogs and not be covered in mosquito bites!! I will be purchasing this oil over and over again!!</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this mixed with witch hazel to make my own bug spray this year but my research has shown that this mixture has pretty much every plant scent that deters the bugs so I am expecting great things!</li>
    <li> Bug Off worked well on a recent camping trip.  I applied it every few hours as recommended &amp; mosquitoes stayed away.  Mosquitoes love my blood so I am very pleased that it worked.  I mixed it with equal parts of vodka, witch hazel &amp; distilled water.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It smells great, like a cross between citronella and lemon. I mixed it with water and made a bug spray out of it. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet but I think it will work. I bought this oil to go in a diffuser for when we&#x27;re sitting outside and it&#x27;s a very strong oil so I think it will work. Testing it this weekend!</li>
    <li> This formula seems to work just fine and smells okay too. I forgot to use it last night whilst on patio and went to bed scratching!</li>
    <li> We enjoyed the natural smell of the oils mixed with water but I purchased it so we could enjoy our outdoor patio that houses an herb garden.  When I sprayed the Bug Off on my plants the bugs came in swarms.</li>
    <li> It does not last as long as I had hoped and has a very strong smell.  I find it pleasant but my husband does not.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with witch hazel and it did not work. We were still constantly eaten by mosquitos. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Mixing about 30 drops with half water and half witch hazel in a 12 oz spray bottle. I thoroughly spray myself and husband whenever we are outside. That also means respraying after a few hours or reentry to the outside. He minds the scent, I do not even notice it after the spraying.</li>
    <li> So nice to have a bug repellant that works without all the harmful chemicals. I also like it because I don&#x27;t feel I have to hose off as soon as I come in the house and am around my birds and other animals.</li>
    <li> Bugs love me. I mean REALLY love me. I&#x27;ll be sitting with 5 other people and I&#x27;ll be the only one getting bit. I bought this stuff as bug spray for my 2 month old daughter, afraid bugs would like her like they like me. It seems to work well enough for her, because she&#x27;s never been bit. As for me, I have to apply it often but as long as I do, it works pretty well. It also smells very nice and I always get compliments on it&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> This does work.  Mosquitoes would still come close, but not land or bite.  This is very potent stuff but it has a good smell.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice - pleasant,even, but not as effective as I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;Used it first time during a very humid, warm spell with LOTS of mosquitos.&lt;br /&gt;I get bit before anyone else ever does.  It seemed to help for awhile, but&lt;br /&gt;not completely, and certainly not as effective as deet.&lt;br /&gt;Good as a supplement, tho, when trying to use as little deet as possible.</li>
    <li> this stuff works well. I haven&#x27;t seen this in any of the stores. have not seen in the store. Never see this in the  stores anymore. i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This wet summer has turn my backyard into a bug war zone. I mix this product in a spray bottle with items listed in other reviews. Stays bug free! So happy now.</li>
    <li> Works better than DEET products!</li>
    <li> This oil works. I tried different natural repellents, but not one worked this good for mosquitoes. I could not go out in my garden without being bitten by mosquitoes and chiggers. Since I like gardening I had to do some about it and this works. No bites anymore. I just put a few drops into a bottle with water and a little oil. The oil to make it last longer once I spray it on me. I can still see the mosquitoes, they&#x27;re everywhere, but they  don&#x27;t touch my skin anymore. It also works for chiggers. I don&#x27;t like the smell too much, so I add a little from my body spray (coconut) and now I really like it. And it last very long.</li>
    <li> its works great against mosquito!!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical, but I loathe the smell (and taste, as it will always invariably get in my mouth somehow) of standard bug spray. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.  As a previous reviewer suggested, I mixed it in a spray bottle with witch hazel and water. Smell was lovely and worked pretty well at repelling bugs! I saw two downs sides however, one is that even in it&#x27;s full strength form, the scent dissipated quickly and I found myself reapplying quite often. And second, I&#x27;m not sure what portion of the concoction caused this, but something in the spray began melting the plastic bottle I had it in.  Not bad, but a little unnerving as I sprayed it on my skin haha. It was a cheap bottle though so I guess it wouldn&#x27;t take much to break it down.  Overall spray smelled nice and worked well! Pleased with my experiment!</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work but it did not.  The mosquitoes just zoomed in for the feast anyway. The smell is sooooo strong I could only wear it at home. So I am still looking for a natural mosquito repellent.</li>
    <li> Works great at keeping the insects off! Just a little messy being that it is an oil but so much healthier to use than commercial bug repellants.</li>
    <li> Worked great, just need to reapply regularly.</li>
    <li> Was &amp;#34;aromatic&amp;#34; but was very handy to carry for touchup but protection during mission trip to Guatemala.  Kept the skeeters at bay.</li>
    <li> This is great and smells good too.  I just wish there was more of it.  I am in Texas where it has been raining constantly, and we are inundated with mosquitoes.</li>
    <li> This year has been a mosquito hell for me here in the mountains of Northern California.&lt;br /&gt;I was a mosquito buffet. Every time I would go outside to water my garden, go for a walk etc.  I would get bitten, (no exaggeration) 25+ times. It got the point of not wanting to going outside at all if it meant covering my body with DEET&lt;br /&gt;So, when my package arrived I put a couple of drops in the palm of my hand, rubbed my hands together and lightly brush them over my hair, clothing, arms and legs and then went outside...&lt;br /&gt;NO BITES! zero...zip...NONE! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and still no bites.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it keep the mosquitoes away, it also seems to keep flies, bees and yellow jackets away too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It is unanimous! THIS STUFF DOES WORK!&lt;br /&gt;It has been nearly a year since my original review, since then, I have given bottles of Bug-Off to family/friends traveling to Florida, Hawaii and various parts of California including the Sacramento Delta.&lt;br /&gt;EVERY ONE of them came back and said that it worked unbelievably and that they were SO glad they had it.</li>
    <li> This seemed to work very well for an all natural bug off oil. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the harsh chemical but then you are not putting harsh chemicals on your skin. Most people fail to realize that the skin absorbs what is put on it so this is good for adults and kids alike.</li>
    <li> While citronella and neem are effective bug repellents, the former is like nails on a chalkboard to my sinuses, the latter smells like long dead meat. It would take some skill to put them into an essential oil blend that blended well enough that it actually smelled bearable. Challenging, no doubt, but it can be done. I guess I had high expectations of this blend, what with the patchouli and and other oils in it, but no. This oil smells like neem and citronella clashing together in an epic battle of foulness with nothing blending in it whatsoever. I get angry when I smell it, it is so offensive.</li>
    <li> I was outside sitting at the patio table after having put on my new purchase, Bug Off.  My wife came home from somewhere, walks through the house where I had put it on to out back where I was seated.  She was probably 8-10 feet away and while approaching is whiffing with a very sour look on her face and says, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that smell? It smells like rotten eggs.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it smells like rotten eggs, but it is a very very strong scent. To me it&#x27;s a cross between citronella and lemongrass.  My wife could smell something a mile away, I on the other hand can rarely smell hardly anything.  Two drops of this stuff on your palms spread over legs, arms and neck goes a long way.  You reek with this stuff on.  Reek means to be pervaded by something unpleasant, and yes, that may be the best way to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Yes, I think it seems to work quite well and that is why I give it 3 stars.  The problem is, not only will mosquitoes stay away, but so may family, friends, and you may not even be able to stand yourself!</li>
    <li> I love the California Baby bug spray, but the price has gone up recently in the past 2 years.  This is a perfect alternative.  Mixed up a spray with about 15 drops of the Bug Off, a pinch of salt (as recommended in another review), and half witch hazel, half water.  Smells great and does not leave the skin oily.  Let&#x27;s hope this works!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a deet free mosquito repellent for use at the home. I first used it diluted and applied it with a spray bottle. I still got bit. Then I thought maybe I need to make it more concentrated and did that; I still got stung. Then I just applied the oil directly on me; still got stung. I wanted to use something more natural to avoid deet and because I dont like the smell of deet. This product doesn&#x27;t work at all and it will make you smell like a nursing home. Mosquitos were landing on me like I had nothing on. So if I have to smell anyway, next time I&#x27;m just going to use something that I know works- something with deet in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted something more organic.  I made a spray bottle with olive oil - a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Was hoping this would work for me as nothing else has, but the mosquitoes still feasted​ on me. :-(</li>
    <li> We live the deep south and bugs are constantly driving us nuts.  I put some witch hazel in a small spray bottle and added two drops off the BugOff.  It smells like a citronella candle and works for hours,  So happy that we can have a repellent without all the chemicals.</li>
    <li> I wanted this oil to include in my homemade suntan lotion for our trip to the Sian Kaán Biosphere in Mexico.  I think it&#x27;s working OK, but it&#x27;s been really windy all week.  Maybe that&#x27;s why the bugs are staying away.  It smells mostly of Citronella, not a bad smell at all.</li>
    <li> It smells great but not convinced it works.  I put it on last night as the sun was setting and was still attacked by mosquitos. I&#x27;m not sure if its because they are super bad or what.  But I love the smell!</li>
    <li> I add this to my sunblock recipe and EVERYONE raves that they love the scent!</li>
    <li> It really Works mosquitos will stay away . Love. It .</li>
    <li> I got this to take with me on a trip to Hawaii. We did some volunteer work clearing out weeds for a forest reserve there, and the insects did get pretty bad. I took a spray bottle filled with half and half water and witch hazel and added 40 drops of this to it. It worked very well at repelling insects, but didn&#x27;t last all day. I had to do a few reapplications throughout the day, but overall much healthier than DEET! Back in Tennessee it has worked at keeping insects away too, so overall a great purchase. It has a very nice aroma as well.</li>
    <li> excellent product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This essential oil mixture works really well in my homemade bug spray.  I mixed about 20 or so drops of it into my bottle of 2 parts witch hazel, 1 part vodka, and 1 part water with a dash of olive oil.  You have to really shake it well each time since the essential oils tend to go straight to the top of the spray bottle.  My little ones have been bug bite free with it minus the deet.  Makes me just feel more at ease about spraying them.  My middle child has a bad mosquito bite reaction so I am thankful for my bug off synergy!  The only (mild) complaint is the overwhellming citronella smell.  I wish the lavender or lemongrass were stronger.</li>
    <li> Great product, added a few drops of essential oil into the garbage can, and flies are gone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bought this essential oil blend with the intention of making a pesticide-free bug spray (after much research I&#x27;d found that DEET, skin so soft, and other well known bug sprays contain various amounts of pesticides). Initially I was leary because I&#x27;ve heard stores of homemade bug sprays not working, but mine does! The spray I&#x27;d made works wonders. My spray is in a 16oz amber spray bottle and contains about 8oz witch hazle, 100 drops insect shield, 20 drops peppermint essential oil, 2Tbs melted coconut oil, and 2 shots of vodka. I swear by this stuff!</li>
    <li> works as well as young living</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get bit, but they didn&#x27;t go away, they still buzzed around me.</li>
    <li> I love plant therapy oils. I&#x27;m sad to report that if you attract mosquitoes like I do, then you&#x27;re going to have to use DEET. I tried this on a short walk in the woods and I had bites within five minutes. Bugs don&#x27;t go after My husband, So it worked just fine for him.</li>
    <li> I like this product, can add a few drops to mint water and it becomes a natural repellant, safer then DEET.</li>
    <li> This product really seems to work. We put a drop on each arm &amp; leg (&amp; sometimes the neck too) and are bite free. So it seems to do what it claims to do. However the smell is really strong (as it should be) and is too overpowering for me to wear. I did try using less, but it did not work as well then.</li>
    <li> The bugs are out. So, will be using the above a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Is this safe for pets??</li>
    <li> This worked great on my trip to the northern woods of New Hampshire. The weather was wet and the bugs were out but they steered clear of me. I took the advice of other reviewers and reapplied every 45-60 minutes. I mixed some in a spray with witch hazel but also found myself just dabbing some oil on my neck, wrists, and ankles. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love these essential oils to combat bugs.  This product effectively repels fleas and mosquitos and has a pleasant fragrance.  I used this product on my cats and dogs and myself in a spray bottle with witch hazel.  I also used the oil directly on a citronella bracelet to recharge it.  This works great while I am grilling outside on the grill and sitting at the picnic table....</li>
    <li> I mix this with Homestead&#x27;s Alcohol Free Witch Hazel and it makes a fantastic natural bug spray. You will need to reapply here and there, but it definitely beats spraying harsh toxic chemicals on your body and exposing yourself to such unhealthy mainstream bug spray.</li>
    <li> seemed like the bugs could get through after a while.</li>
    <li> it works but it does not last for long.</li>
    <li> It seems to be keeping the insects away and doesn&#x27;t have an intrusive fragrance.</li>
    <li> It works with most insects, I can for sure say I&#x27;ve had no tic issues which is why I wanted the product for camping something safe for my kids to put in their hair and ankles without having to worry about dangerous chemicals, every camping trip tics have been an issue, this was the first that was tic free. I don&#x27;t mind the citronella smell.  But those mutant Mosquitos are still a problem.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to be repelling insects.</li>
    <li> Mixed with witch hazel and made my own insect repellent. Heavy citronella smell, but the smell was more pleasant than any of the store bought sprays.  I used for daytime coverage in a mosquito heavy area and did not get any bites.</li>
    <li> and works about the same as another herbal product I tried.  That one came in a spray can and was easier to use but more expensive.  This product works for me in a casual setting, deterring mosquitos.  When I go into my thick swampy woods I use a strong non herbal toxic spray.</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple of times, but the mosquitoes have stayed away!  Would like it to include a recipe for how much to mix up &amp; how long it lasts in a bottle.</li>
    <li> This smells God awful but works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I live in the country and used this last night with a mixure of witch hazel and water. We sta out and I did not get bit once!!!</li>
    <li> A lot of people comment on this saying is smells bad, but I actually love the scent! It does smell like citronella,  but it has a very pleasant blend of other smells as well. Being from Nebraska where the mosquito&#x27;s are ALWAYS bad, the smell of citronella is a little nostalgic. I have used this twice in a spray bottle with witch hazel and I have not been bitten yet, and I am usually a mosquito magnet!</li>
    <li> We went to Panama in the beginning of the wet season when all the bugs hatch/wake up and are looking for blood.  I deluded the Bugg-Off with witch hazel and sprayed frequently.  I love the smell of it and would give it 5 stars if it were as effective as deet containing sprays(which others in our group were using).  I will continue to use this simply because it is non- toxic and as the worst of the bug season will be over soon.  I got no mosquito bites but the no-see ums were not as deterred.</li>
    <li> It has an extremely strong, potent aroma. Be sure to dilute properly. Take caution around kids as citronella, although very effective, is dangerous in its undiluted state. I diluted it witch hazel.</li>
    <li> As natural as this is it works as well if not better than other similar products that I have tried such as Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I do mix it with witch hazel and distilled water as other reviewers suggested.  For me and the baby this stuff works awesome.  I actually love the smell of it and I am not a huge citronella fan.  There are enough other essential oils in here to cover the citronella smell just enough that I like it.</li>
    <li> I am totally amazed how this product works for me.  I&#x27;m usually a magnet for black flies, but once I sprayed this on I had no problems.  Diluting the oil with witch hazel, I made up two bottles one for myself and the other a weaker version for my dog.  Hoping I never have to wear a net over my head again to keep the bugs from biting while I&#x27;m out in the yard or going for a walk.  Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I&#x27;ve used all different types of repellant and until now nothing has worked for those pesky stable fiies that bite my legs while I&#x27;m kayaking! All I do is wet my hands, put a couple drops of Bugoff on, and nothing bites me! Great product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this stuff is amazing! I mixed one part distilled water, one part witch hazel, 40 drops of Bug Off oil, and 5 drops lavender oil. Yes you have to reapply often. Yes the citronella scent is the strongest of all (but I like the smell). But I could literally see the bugs leave. Even my mom tried it and got the same results. I will definitely be using this product often.</li>
    <li> Would like to have had an instruction sheet on best ways to use this product.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it needed to be diluted, or if it should be used full strenth.</li>
    <li> works great....glad I found this!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  I plan on using it for Alaskan no-see&#x27;ums.  I hope it works.</li>
    <li> The mosquitos here in Tampa , FL are not phased by this product. I saw no difference in the amount of mosquitos that came after us. We mixed it with witch hazel as recommended. We tried it full strength and it gave a slight burning sensation on the skin. Disappointing because I was so hoping this would work.</li>
    <li> We used this blend of essential oils while traveling in the Caribbean recently. We mixed some of the drops with witch hazel to make a nice, non-toxic body spray.  We were traveling in an area where the mosquito population was quite high (rainforest area) as was the threat of Chikungunya, the latest mosquito transmitted illness that is spreading much too fast. We applied the spray each day, multiple times. The scent was very pleasing to us, but not so attractive to the mosquitoes. The spray worked great, we didn&#x27;t get a single mosquito bite nor did they seem to want to land on us at all. Our experience is such that using a natural product like this is far better than using a toxic deet spray.</li>
    <li> a few drops of this product added to witch hazel and sprayed on allowed me to be outdoors all spring and summer with no bug complaints at all.  i live in the country where we experience black flies in spring,  mosquitos in summer and fall, and deer flies during the summer.  ugh but this concoction works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty useful in repelling bugs.  I still get  mosquito bites but perhaps a little less.  I hosted a play date outside and all the moms there liked the smell and they sprayed a whole bunch on their kids and babies.  I know not everything natural is good for us, but at least I feel this product is better compared to more  commercial counterparts.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my five year old grandson, he cannot go outside without becoming a bug feast. Dab this on his ankles and bugs do not bite, he loves it!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Put it on and no bugs...very happy with this product.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Do not water down.  I added it to witch hazel and sprayed my entire body!  I became a magnet for the mosquitoes.  I think that the oil is great, just use it straight!</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t help&lt;br /&gt;mosquitos were bothering me the same</li>
    <li> I used this in a bug spray that I made at home.  Along with lemon juice, vanilla extract and this Insect Shield (Bug Off) Synergy Essential Oil Blend, it makes a great bug detractor.  It works really well and smells really nice.  I will buy more</li>
    <li> I used it to make mosquito repellent lotion bars for my toddler. So far it works well. It smells like good quality concentrated oils.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with witch hazel in a mini spray bottle.  I spray it on my hands and rub on my children&#x27;s legs before school.  No more mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Another great oil from Plant Therapy! I live in South Carolina where mosquitoes are horrid. I seriously think they target me, no lie. I started researching the dangers of DEET and decided that I will never use that on myself or children again! I wanted a natural alternative and this was it. Every oil in this blend repels insects which is excellent because there&#x27;s no need to purchase those oils separately. I&#x27;ve made a spray and lotion using this and I&#x27;m very happy with them!</li>
    <li> I have, for some reason, a high quantity of spiders in my abode and have been consistently spraying this oil with a mixture of water and a small amount of dish soap around my room. It seems to be working, as I haven&#x27;t seen any in my room, but there are still lots of them in my bathroom. I sprayed a lot on a huge spider that was on the wall and it seemed to confuse the spider and make it fall over, but it obviously doesn&#x27;t kill it. For a natural way to keep spiders and other bugs at bay, I think this is pretty good, especially around where you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It works ok, but not great. If you want a better way, I would buy food grade (that&#x27;s important) diatomaceous earth and puff that around, it seemed to work the best out of everything I tried and it kills spiders, ants, silverfish, etc.</li>
    <li> Received the oil in a timely manner and it does a wonderful job.  I used a recipe I found on Pinterest (http://www.livingwellspendingless.com/2014/05/19/homemade-bug-repellent/).  It smells nice and it moisturizes, which is great in a dry state!  Thank you for the great service and wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Man I was using products with deet in it like Off and Repel, NO MORE!!! That stuff is bad for you. Did some research and came across this. Experimented with it in the field. A friend of mine was scared to use it because it says do not put on skin undiluted. Well I just added water and couple of dabs of this Insect Shield. He ended with tons of bite and I had one because I forgot to slather that area. There was another guy in the group and he saw the difference and wanted some haha. BTW the smell is nice, pretty pleasant. Hopefully this oil isn&#x27;t bad for the clothing, if anyone know please do tell. My next experiment will just be with Pure Therapy citronella oil and see if that is more potent than this Insect Shield. I&#x27;ll update later on in the future.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells strongly of citronella.</li>
    <li> I mixed 40 drops with 6 oz of Astringent and 6 oz of water (did not have distilled).  It stopped the bugs for awhile, but they soon returned.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my third bottle of this product.  Although I still really like it and would recommend that others give it a shot, it seems like this bottle was less &amp;#34;potent&amp;#34; than the previous two. Or maybe we just have mutant mosquitoes this summer. I can&#x27;t be sure.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t work on godzilla bugs, you are going to smell really yummy while you are getting bit...  But seriously, this is NOT going to be DEET level effective at keeping bugs away, but if you would like to avoid all the nasty chemicals in bug repellent and don&#x27;t mind frequently reapplying the spray, you should give this a shot! Speaking of the frequent applications, make sure you are not applying this straight to your skin!!! It needs to be diluted to be safe for application on the body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few nights now and not only do I love the smell but I haven&#x27;t gotten bit once. I was at a bbq and I just splashed a little on my wrists and neck(like perfume lol) everyone commented on how much they liked the smell and while I was eating wasps kept away from me and bothered everyone else!! win win, I&#x27;ll be buying this again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Made some wonderful bug spray for my husband who seems to attract every kind of bug you can think of. He has told me how great it is. He said he was very impressed, and that is high praise coming from him!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to make my own bug spray since I don&#x27;t like to spray poison on myself to work in the yard.  It seems to work pretty well except at dusk when the mosquitoes are pretty vicious.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading about all-natural bug sprays. Mosquitoes really seem to love me, and I&#x27;m terribly allergic to their bites. Mixed about 10 drops of this oil with 3 oz of witch hazel, and it worked like a charm to repel bugs. I find the scent to be pleasant and not overwhelming, though it smells more like citronella than anything else. I really like that I can keep the pests away without using harsh chemicals that irritate my skin. Given how little I had to use for my mixture, this small vial should last several seasons!</li>
    <li> This product shipped according to schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get bitten by sand flees when I  take my walk, but since trying this product, NO BITES!&lt;br /&gt;I rub a few drops in my hands and then massage lightly on my feet and legs.  I don&#x27;t mind the odor and find it fades&lt;br /&gt;after a while.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to see if it keeps hornets and yellow jackets away as I am highly allergic to their stings.</li>
    <li> Mosquitoes love me. I can be outside for one minute, and one (or more!) will find me. I was at the point of HATING to go outside! I was forced to soak myself in OFF spray just to grill food or play catch with my son. UNTIL I saw this stuff. I put it directly on my skin (primarily ankles, legs and arms) and I got through the rest of the summer with NO BUG BITES!!!! It has changed my life. My son says it smells like fruit loops. It does have a smell, but it&#x27;s fine. And I prefer it to the OFF spray any day!</li>
    <li> smells great. Wish it worked a little bit better</li>
    <li> Mixed with witch hazel and water... In a spray bottle... Great bug spray.</li>
    <li> Seems to work better than bug spray, I mixed it with witch oil.</li>
    <li> Husband is over the moon as he has been an insect target for years. Great product and non toxic.</li>
    <li> This insect protection works better than any other natural product I have used. However, since it is an essential oil, it is a very small amount for the price and compared to some of the other available products. I finally tried putting some in a small spray bottle that would carry easily in my day pack and I mixed it with water. Of course, it separates and you have to shake before spraying but it seemed to work just as well diluted and was certainly easier to carry around. If this company would make a larger bottle with spray capability I  would never buy any other insect repellent. The bottle is glass and I think you could use the hard brown plastic and still retain the integrity of the product. The smell is very pleasant and this oil is more effective than any I have used. it is the price and bottling style that prevent me from ordering again.</li>
    <li> Mixed it in with some sunblock. Put the concoction on all exposed areas but my face. Face was attacked but the applied areas they wouldn&#x27;t even attempt to get close to. Works perfect!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, and I am in love with it. The fact that it is all natural is what drew my attention to your product. It works well, and smells so much better than all chemical insect sprays. The best part, it doesn&#x27;t damage your skin. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> used it this Summer when mosquitoes became too friendly.  It works well.  Just rub a couple of drops in your hands and apply on your neck, ears and pants bottom.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to prepare a recipe for a bug spray.  I read the other reviews where one stated it was on the bottle-but it wasn&#x27;t.  I tried 10-20 drops in Whichazel, but that wasn&#x27;t successful at my sons football practice.  I order all my essential oils from Spark Naturals and they are pharma grade.  I am thinking I wasted my money here.</li>
    <li> We have a real mosquito problem in our back yard with those big striped black ones. Without repellent, I can count two dozen bites on a kid after thirty minutes of play. I was looking forward to trying this repellent since it contains cat nip oil which has been demonstrated to repel mosquitos. Unfortunately it did not reduce the number of mosquitos biting my kids or myself. Perhaps this is due to the big mix of stuff in this mix. Catnip oil is one of the last on the list.     I also ordered some pure catnip oil and that worked a lot better. I use on cc for 30 cc witch hazel in a spray bottle and it works great. There are some reports out there that catnip oil is an irritant but I noticed no problems with me my wife, my kids or friends. The problem with catnip oil is it doesn&#x27;t smell that great so could be combined with other oils. I would like to invite the creators of this insect shield product to make something that is mostly catnip oil with a couple other things to make it palatable to people like my wife who do not like the smell of catnip oil.</li>
    <li> Mosquitoes are bad down here in Texas.  I have tried single essential oils to try to combat them but it takes a BLEND to keep them away.  Love that I have found a way to keep bugs away without spraying chemicals all over my body.</li>
    <li> We live in Texas... aka \\&quot;Bug Central\\&quot;. We bought Bug Off Synergy to rid our patio of mosquitos prior to an outdoor party. Even the folks who usually get bitten a lot escaped without a single bite. It can be mixed with a carrier oil or with water in a spritzer bottle... but we just sprinkled it around the yard directly from its bottle. Works for about 3 days, up to a week when the weather is hot and dry. Will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> It works but the price is way too much but I was desperate.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other natural bug repellant products and this was the best.  I fill a sprayer bottle with witch hazel, distilled water &amp; at least 10 drops of this.  This kept away mosquitos &amp; other bugs.  You could actually see them fly toward you, then fly away.  I don&#x27;t worry about toxins of spraying this directly on my skin because it is natural essential oils...</li>
    <li> as described therefore fully meeting expectations&lt;br /&gt;arrived well packaged and on time&lt;br /&gt;my thanks</li>
    <li> Use this product every year to make soap for my cousins dog . She love it and it keeps the bugs away form Mina the dog. I add other oil for fragrance .</li>
    <li> I mixed it with grapeseed oil and put it in a spray bottle and I love using this on me and my children! Works very well to keep the mosquitos from biting</li>
    <li> I just bought this to make homemade non-toxic bug spray for those pesky mosquitoes and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! It has all of the essential oils you need in one simple bottle, so it keeps you from buying several different oils to mix. Just add 10-20 drops(or more depending on the size of your bottle) to a spray bottle filled with witch hazel. The smell is great and the feel is non-greasy protection that you can feel good about putting on your kids. The best part is it actually works!  I will never go back to regular bug spray again!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tested this while camping, but it works great when I&#x27;m outside in the evenings watering the garden or picking up sticks in the yard. I just put a few drops in my palms and dab a little on the pulse points (behind ears, in elbow and knee creases, on wrists and ankles). Also, the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to mosquito bites and was concerned I was using too much DEET.  I live by a lake and have NEVER gotten bit when I spray this on...and it&#x27;s been 2 years now that I&#x27;ve been using it.  I put 15 drops in a  4 oz dark glass bottle filled with 1/2 distilled water and 1/2 witch hazel.  Some of my family loves the smell, some ... like me ... don&#x27;t really like it.  I have added more lavender and lemongrass oil to mine and it still works great.  A friend of mine sprays this on her dogs and says it&#x27;s been a lifesaver.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this!!!</li>
