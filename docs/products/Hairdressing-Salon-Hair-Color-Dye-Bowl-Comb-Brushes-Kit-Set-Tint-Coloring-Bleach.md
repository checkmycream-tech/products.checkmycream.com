### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Still, great price for what it is!</li>
      <li>It is perfect size and quality is good.</li>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>I ordered it for my wife for coloring her hair at home and she is happy with the product.</li>
      <li>She used it and says that its what she needed so she is happy with it.</li>
      <li>Great to mix clay masks in.</li>
      <li>if it&#x27;s user error I want to be fair.</li>
      <li>So I am happy with it :)</li>
      <li>The bowl is handy though.</li>
      <li>bristles broke and bent very easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but better to invest in a better kit.</li>
      <li>and also I can get the sections of my hair better.</li>
      <li>I was expecting better.</li>
      <li>I always have my sister dye my hair because it&#x27;s a lt cheaper than in the salon, and I trust her more than anyone else.</li>
      <li>I love the brushes too.</li>
      <li>Easy to work on my hair</li>
      <li>It works fine</li>
      <li>, varying sizes of brushes made available makes it easier for the consumers depending on their preferences.</li>
      <li>Its cheap too.</li>
      <li>The handles of these brushes are just about at the right size for holding while applying hair color.</li>
      <li>I like it very much</li>
      <li>First off it took weeks to come.  </li>
      <li>Besides the long wait for delivery, the product is very cheaply made and the prongs on the comb bit broke on my first time using it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
      <li>I really like the brushes.</li>
      <li>The hairs on the brush are also very cheap and a few came off as I was using it.</li>
      <li>, I just expected to be able to reuse them over and over again, but I barely got one use out of the brushes themselves.</li>
      <li>I bought this set so she can use it instead of old plastic bowls.</li>
      <li>you get what you pay for, is just ok, the brush quality is not good.</li>
      <li>and I can dip the brush into the bowl and spread it onto my hair without the dye dripping down my face or back so much</li>
      <li>Made it easy applying hair color even behind the back of my head.</li>

<li> I think they are designed for certain parts of the hair you want to reach, but really, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
<li> They arrived much later than all of my other orders that were placed the same day, I believe it does ship from China, so I understand that it of course would take longer to arrive.</li>
<li> The brush also doesn&#x27;t pick up much product and hardly applies anything to my scalp...</li>
<li> I guess you get what you pay for, took a long time to arrive</li>
<li> have not used it yet, but I can imagine I will need to split the two batches of color I usually have to use for my long hair into two even smaller batches when I do use it.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little bit small,  but enough for me.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair, but I don&#x27;t think this should keep these combs from making proper parts.</li>
<li> and they&#x27;re pretty dirty.</li>
<li> but I like the little measurements.</li>
<li> ALSO it was missing one of the brushes.</li>
<li> Takes 3 weeks to come and is missing pieces.</li>
<li> Missing the comb/brush piece.</li>
<li> Bowl is a little small and the brushes are a little flimsy but they&#x27;ve worked out well.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong by ordering this item.</li>
<li> I know this isn&#x27;t an expensive set</li>
<li> Very poor quality.</li>
<li> The brushes are crap and bowl is small</li>
<li> Crap quality</li>

    <li> Plastic, flimsy. you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The bowl is tiny but it gets the job done. ALSO it was missing one of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better. Crap quality and they&#x27;re pretty dirty. You get what you pay for though.</li>
    <li> It is perfect size and quality is good. She used it and says that its what she needed so she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Works as predicted. Even sent along extra items above what was in the product description. You can&#x27;t go wrong by ordering this item.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for, is just ok, the brush quality is not good.</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes. Made it easy applying hair color even behind the back of my head. The color was even from roots to tips.</li>
    <li> Thank you i recieved it as asap</li>
    <li> The plastic is cheap and the bowl came broken. The hairs on the brush are also very cheap and a few came off as I was using it. it gets the job done though, albeit with not all the finesse of the more expensive, quality brush sets.</li>
    <li> I always have my sister dye my hair because it&#x27;s a lt cheaper than in the salon, and I trust her more than anyone else. I bought this set so she can use it instead of old plastic bowls. It works fine and it&#x27;s very well made. I love the brushes too. I think they are designed for certain parts of the hair you want to reach, but really, I&#x27;m not sure. LOL. She&#x27;s the one who does the trick but this set definitely helps her a lot.</li>
    <li> Pretty small bowl. have not used it yet, but I can imagine I will need to split the two batches of color I usually have to use for my long hair into two even smaller batches when I do use it. Still, great price for what it is!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but better to invest in a better kit. The brushes are crap and bowl is small but I like the little measurements.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set.  First off it took weeks to come.  Then the bowl was cracked.  I called lady said to send picture.  I did and they still have never replaced it.</li>
    <li> They arrived much later than all of my other orders that were placed the same day, I believe it does ship from China, so I understand that it of course would take longer to arrive. Besides the long wait for delivery, the product is very cheaply made and the prongs on the comb bit broke on my first time using it. It served it&#x27;s purpose and it did manage to get the job done, I just expected to be able to reuse them over and over again, but I barely got one use out of the brushes themselves. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to work on my hair</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for, took a long time to arrive</li>
    <li> Bowl is a little small and the brushes are a little flimsy but they&#x27;ve worked out well.</li>
    <li> The cup it&#x27;s a little bit small,  but enough for me. I like it very much</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my wife for coloring her hair at home and she is happy with the product. So I am happy with it :)&lt;br /&gt;Also, varying sizes of brushes made available makes it easier for the consumers depending on their preferences. The handles of these brushes are just about at the right size for holding while applying hair color. Its cheap too.</li>
    <li> Package was incomplete, the two brushes did not arrive. Very poor quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> bristles broke and bent very easily.</li>
    <li> I know this isn&#x27;t an expensive set and I&#x27;m no expert, but I bought this just to use the brushes to apply an oil treatment to my scalp. I have really thick hair, but I don&#x27;t think this should keep these combs from making proper parts. The brush also doesn&#x27;t pick up much product and hardly applies anything to my scalp... so, I feel generous by giving it a 3, but if it&#x27;s user error I want to be fair. The bowl is handy though. For the price, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use from this. Great to mix clay masks in.</li>
    <li> Missing the comb/brush piece. Go figure. Takes 3 weeks to come and is missing pieces.</li>
    <li> This works well for dying my hair and for bleaching it it gets all sections of my hair without having to use a store bought bottle. I can pour contents into this bowl and I can dip the brush into the bowl and spread it onto my hair without the dye dripping down my face or back so much and also I can get the sections of my hair better.</li>
