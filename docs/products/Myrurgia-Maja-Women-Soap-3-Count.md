<li> Maja soap is becoming increasingly difficult to procure for some reason.  </li>
<li> I expected a different design on the box, the Maja woman, instead of just the brand name and colors.  </li>
<li> creamy and helps my skin not be dry</li>
<li> Instead I got square plain black n red labels</li>
<li> I like the round design.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on this soap for 30+ years and have had trouble finfing it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It was a little slow to arrive.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed to find that it&#x27;s no longer made in Spain, and I miss the full-color image of the Maja (which means good-looking woman).  </li>

    <li> Remember my mother using this soap when I was a child. Still smells the same  Use in drawers as a sachet but when u use in shower smell fades quickly, Would buy again, though</li>
    <li> Great product and seller. I buy this product every year for gifts. The ladies love it.</li>
    <li> I brought these for my mother-in-law for christmas.  I know she really enjoys them.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap - have used this over 50 years - now much easier to purchase because of Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Myrurgia Maja Women Soap are the best soap I ever used. I have used these soap in the past for many years. But when I move to Texas I couldn&#x27;t fine it in the stores. I&#x27;m glad I found them.</li>
    <li> Lovely, old-fashioned soaps that are hard to find, so I was happy to find them through Amazon. Very nice presentation in a gift box. I love the long-lasting scent!</li>
    <li> My mother used this soap and my sister found this online and sent me some.  It&#x27;s an unusual fragrance... in fact, my husband loved it so I bought him the rectangle shaped soap for Christmas... I love this soap!</li>
    <li> creamy and helps my skin not be dry</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this soap not only for bathing but it makes the bathroom smell lovely. A great gift as well.</li>
    <li> If you like the scent, you&#x27;ll love the soap. If your nose is sensitive, steer clear!</li>
    <li> Good fragrance .lasting.</li>
    <li> The soap brings back memories from my childhood, when both my mother and grandmother used it.  It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, not overpowering.  I was a little disappointed to find that it&#x27;s no longer made in Spain, and I miss the full-color image of the Maja (which means good-looking woman).  But the scent is wonderful, and that&#x27;s what counts.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the soap as your photo reflected. With the Spanish dancer.. Instead I got square plain black n red labels</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Wife. she really loves it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on this soap for 30+ years and have had trouble finfing it!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleasrd</li>
    <li> Maja! My sensitive skin loves it!</li>
    <li> I used to see this soap in stores in Florida but up here in the northeast I just don&#x27;t find it. I love the scent of this soap. I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and this is just delicate and nice. Beautiful package too.</li>
    <li> My Dad, who is no longer living, always gave my mom this soap. She mentioned it around the holidays so I thought what a great gift if I could find it... thank you so much for having this and sending it to me so promptly. It was one of my mom&#x27;s favorite gifts! I&#x27;ll be buying more from you.</li>
    <li> Maja soap is becoming increasingly difficult to procure for some reason.  Maja has a timeless scent that has endured decades.  Good quality products seem to past the test of time.</li>
    <li> The soaps were good but I expected this fragrance have more of a chypre scent. Maybe the fragrance has changed over the years.</li>
    <li> Love the spicey aroma.  A very pleasant soap if you want a stronger aroma.</li>
    <li> It was a little slow to arrive.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the scent I was looking for - I will not be reordering this one - thank you</li>
    <li> I really like this soap and the Mayrurgia Maja products.  I expected a different design on the box, the Maja woman, instead of just the brand name and colors.  I like the round design.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have to order some more of this soap plus some cologne .Its got its own spicy scent and its very sexy.</li>
