      <li>Great for older people</li>
      <li>I always used good products on my hair, but this one really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>I thought I had to have my own large bottle</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will enjoy it</li>
      <li>Welcome back Kerastase!!!!!</li>
      <li>But if you have any propensity to skin allergies please be thoughtful about using this product.</li>

      <li>Worth the buy...</li>
      <li>Maybe pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Good to use in combo with other Kerastase products!&lt;br</li>
      <li>She was right.  </li>

      <li>Don&#x27;e use a large amount in your hand.  </li>
      <li>It has really helped my aging hair.  </li>
      <li>Too soon to really tell but</li>
      <li>Conditioners didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>These products are gentle on aging and color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Does it cost too much?  </li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job</li>
      <li>I have only had a chance to use it twice and while it smells really nice, makes my grey hair sparkle in the sun</li>
      <li>The good results are worth the price, but it is not expensive when you realize that a little bit foams up to a lot, so I use less.</li>
      <li>he product did deliver in terms of offering soft and easy to manage hair, and the frizzes of middle age were addressed as well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for split ends.</li>
      <li>Have never experienced such joy with a shampoo before.  </li>
      <li>I never spent this much money on a shampoo before, but was getting discouraged that my hair seemed beyond help.</li>
      <li>The salon poured some of their Kerastase Age Premium Bain Substantif Shampoo in my hand and theirs was a clear color where mine was a milky color.</li>
      <li>I reach for this one nearly every day.</li>
      <li>I was informed by stylist that the one I purchased could be old and had oxidized causing the milky color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This keeps my hair gentle, soft rather than brittle, dry, and fluffed.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and have been through several bottles over the last few years.  </li>
      <li>I never thought that shampoo especially made for mature hair would make a difference</li>
      <li>and it is never dry.</li>
      <li>Other, much cheaper, products will do the same thing.</li>
      <li>I stopped coloring it some years ago, so it is mostly gray, and it was looking weak and dry, and did not act like my hair.</li>
      <li>my hairdresser swears that this shampoo will increase the volume in my thin, fine hair.</li>

<li> The itchiness on my scalp has gone away and this shampoo is delicate on my hair.  </li>
<li> Way expensive for shampoo.</li>

<li> A very small amount lathers a lot!!  </li>
<li> but I was so wrong!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using this shampoo from the recommendation of my stylist.  I have an itchy scalp and the drugstore shampoos I used for this would leave my hair stripped and damaged.  This is the second bottle I am on now.  The bottle lasts about three months and I have long hair.  You only have to use a dime sized amount of the shampoo. My hair is processed so I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t damage it any further.  The itchiness on my scalp has gone away and this shampoo is delicate on my hair.  I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It makes a significant difference in the way my hair looks and feels.  Maybe pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I never thought that shampoo especially made for mature hair would make a difference but it does.  Welcome back Kerastase!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product is awesome,which is why I came to the internet to order it. It is pricey but worth it. Will never use this company(vendor) again. My product has not arrived, even though they say it shipped 10 days ago. bummer.</li>
    <li> Loved the product. It has helped my hair tremendosly. I  was having problems with hair falling out and now it has almost stopped.</li>
    <li> OMG, My prayers have been answered. I have a laundry basket filled with bottles of shampoo + conditioner that have disappointed me. This keeps my hair gentle, soft rather than brittle, dry, and fluffed. Brilliant chemistry!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Shampoo.I have been looking for a shampoo that would work for me for quite a while, this is worked wonders on my hair. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> These products are gentle on aging and color treated hair.  A little goes a long way.  Worth the buy...it will last for months.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this line of shampoo and I loved the sample she shared with me.  I thought I had to have my own large bottle and glad I did.  I love this.  You do not even have to use a conditioner.  Have never experienced such joy with a shampoo before.  Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> My mom love it! It´s really good !</li>
    <li> Had high expectations for this, but no better than other shampoos as far as I can see.  Would not purchase again.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything substantive (no pun intended) to help hair issues, especially related to post-pregnancy or stress hair problems.</li>
    <li> This is a fake, NOT l&#x27;Oreal shampoo inside</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Good to use in combo with other Kerastase products!&lt;br /&gt;You will enjoy it I am guessing.  My hair is curly.</li>
    <li> I am a sixy five year old woman with thin blond-gray hair.  This product makes my hair feel thicker and stronger.  I noticed the difference after only one use.</li>
    <li> I have only had a chance to use it twice and while it smells really nice, makes my grey hair sparkle in the sun and you don&#x27;t need much to do the job, I will say that I&#x27;m not that impressed with the product. Other, much cheaper, products will do the same thing. Now if it was half the price or even a quarter of it I would give it another star or even two. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again unless, after using it more, I find a much bigger difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> A very small amount lathers a lot!!  Love the price too!  I will always go through Amazon to get it!</li>
    <li> When I received the package the envelope was wet. When I opened it I discovered that the seal was broken.&lt;br /&gt;After using it twice I noticed my hair was on the dry side. I stared to wonder if this was actually a Keratase product in the bottle. I took the bottle to a salon  that carried Keratase products so I could compare. The salon poured some of their Kerastase Age Premium Bain Substantif Shampoo in my hand and theirs was a clear color where mine was a milky color. I was informed by stylist that the one I purchased could be old and had oxidized causing the milky color.&lt;br /&gt;She suggested that I stop using. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean and smelling great.  I have tried several different shampoos over the past few years and this beats them all.</li>
    <li> I never spent this much money on a shampoo before, but was getting discouraged that my hair seemed beyond help. I stopped coloring it some years ago, so it is mostly gray, and it was looking weak and dry, and did not act like my hair. Conditioners didn&#x27;t help much. So after a little research, and against my skepticism about &amp;#34;shampoo for seniors&amp;#34; I ordered this Kerastase.  I have to say my hair looks younger, the ends aren&#x27;t sticking out every which way, and it has better volume. The good results are worth the price, but it is not expensive when you realize that a little bit foams up to a lot, so I use less.</li>
    <li> While I think this product is overpriced.  It has really helped my aging hair.  I am 48 and hormone changed had left my hair dry, breaking, and lifeless.  I always used good products on my hair, but this one really does the trick.  Give it time to work.  Don&#x27;e use a large amount in your hand.  make sure you also use the conditioner and the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; once or twice a month.  I am also taking a vitamin for skin, hair and nails... All is much better!  my hair dresser told me to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this age shampoo, being over 60 it is great for my hair.  would recommend this product to anyone .</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife.  Her texture improved.  It gave her more body.  Nourishes hair.  Highly recommended for split ends.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kerastase for about 2 years and like it better than anything else I have tried.  It keeps my aging hair looking pretty darned good!</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for a couple of years.  It has made my hair stronger and softer.  I am 57 and color my hair and it is never dry.</li>
    <li> THE best shampoo for those over 40!! AMAZING! My hair feels and looks better than it did when I was 20~</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I love this shampoo and have been through several bottles over the last few years.  Does it cost too much?  Yes, in my opinion, it does, but I keep buying it.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped even before applying conditioner.  In fact, for some time, I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner after using this shampoo.  If you can afford it, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I tried a small sample of this product that came in a Birch Box and decided to buy it. The product I received and used seemed different. The sample provided extra body for my aging hair but when I used the product from the bottle it left my hair feeling stiff and a bit gummy. I discontinued using it and cannot recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Great product when combined with conditioner</li>
    <li> I had been using Kerastase products for quite a while when my hairdresser suggested I switch to Kerastase Age Premium Bain Substantif Shampoo as well as Kerastase Age Premium Conditioner; I like both products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for older women with colored hair.  It is the only shampoo which gives me silky hair, even in the winter with harsh, dry heat.  And no static electricity.  Use the conditioner too.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend.  She was right.  It is good.  I will order it again when I finish this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommends Kerastase products&lt;br /&gt;I love using them&lt;br /&gt;They do wonders for hair and are great for color treated hair</li>
    <li> I will admit I was skeptical that this would compete with my favorite hair products, Pureology, which I&#x27;ve used for years but I was so wrong! This shampoo blows everything else out of the water! I have beautiful, shiny, full hair again! It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> Way expensive for shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday shampoo. It is for mature hair by my stylist reccomends it to everyone to rotate in between other Kerastase shampoos. I use it every now and then.</li>
    <li> Great for older people</li>
    <li> Too soon to really tell but my hairdresser swears that this shampoo will increase the volume in my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Kerastase Age Premium Bain Shampoo, and while I do have allergies, I have never experienced any allergy to shampoos, exept with Kerastase.  I broke out in a rash, with swelling on my chest, shoulders and back after using this product.  he product did deliver in terms of offering soft and easy to manage hair, and the frizzes of middle age were addressed as well.  But if you have any propensity to skin allergies please be thoughtful about using this product.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s expensive, if you think about this product replacing both shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s worth it. It feels like a luxurious shampoo and it takes less time. I reach for this one nearly every day.</li>
