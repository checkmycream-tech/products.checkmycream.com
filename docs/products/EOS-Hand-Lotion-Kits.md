      <li>but I love my lotions</li>
      <li>Perfect for your purse or even back pocket.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and feel of this lotion.</li>

      <li>Fresh flowers is my favorite, but they are all lovely.</li>
      <li>I purchased one, then had to get some for friends, the lotion is very nice, the blossom fragrance is ok, which is the only one I&#x27;ve tried, but did order the three pack which I have not received yet, looking forward to the cucumber sent......</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of EOS lip balm already</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of lotion to get nice smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>so I was pretty sure I would like the lotion.  </li>
      <li>Is not at all greasy but goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>Each cream was in its own individual original pack</li>
      <li>Three different scents...very nice.</li>
      <li>Very convenient!</li>
      <li>Exactly as featured.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like using this product  because i like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Hands immediately felt soooo much softer.  </li>
      <li>but the green one kind of leaked out when i got it</li>
      <li>The bottle is small (love the shape!)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Just small enough to fit into a purse.  </li>

<li> Her hands frequently dry out and crack because she&#x27;s in the medical field and constantly washes her hands.  </li>
<li> /&gt;She isn&#x27;t crazy about the scents and it doesn&#x27;t provide real long lasting relief for extremely dry hands (which is probably because this lotion isn&#x27;t super thick), which is why I did not give the rating 5</li>
<li> Small enough for purse or dedk drawer.</li>
<li> My product arrived a bit late</li>

    <li> Wifey loves this stuff.  I won triple points for buying her the 3 pack!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion, it smells really nice. The size is perfect for leaving in my drawer at work. Will buy more when these run out.</li>
    <li> Just small enough to fit into a purse.  Very convenient!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of EOS lip balm already so I was pretty sure I would like the lotion.  The scent is very light but still pleasant and stays on the skin through more than one wash (I work in a clinic and am washing my hands constantly).  Is not at all greasy but goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  The bottle is small (love the shape!) but you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of lotion to get nice smooth skin.  I keep one of these in my purse at all times and have one at my office.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Not only do I like these but all my gal friends do too!</li>
    <li> I purchased one, then had to get some for friends, the lotion is very nice, the blossom fragrance is ok, which is the only one I&#x27;ve tried, but did order the three pack which I have not received yet, looking forward to the cucumber sent...... but for the money they&lt;br /&gt;are perfect for your purse, just to cute!</li>
    <li> Good value, perfect packaging and nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> I love it. Best Hand Lotion for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice hand lotions. Small enough for purse or dedk drawer. Three different scents...very nice.</li>
    <li> It is so awesome - love it</li>
    <li> This vendor gave me one of each hand lotion just as requested. Each cream was in its own individual original pack you may see the pictures on my insta account trendsoffafshion</li>
    <li> I really like using this product  because i like how it makes my skin feel. I just wish they had a bigger select in bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> love  it, nice stocking stufffer.</li>
    <li> Fresh flowers is my favorite, but they are all lovely. Nice purse size.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter. She loves them.</li>
    <li> Love these lotions!!! Great for purse and backpack</li>
    <li> this lotion doesn&#x27;t smell good nor does it rub into the skin well</li>
    <li> The cream consistency is nice but the perfume smell is way too strong for me. I gave them away. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> very nice hand cream....thnaks!</li>
    <li> You just cannot beat eos products.  Hands immediately felt soooo much softer.  Will be sharing with my friends (maybe....)</li>
    <li> My product arrived a bit late but I love my lotions</li>
    <li> My Co-Workers loved their stocking stuffers for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Good hand lotion, my gf loves these!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife.  Her hands frequently dry out and crack because she&#x27;s in the medical field and constantly washes her hands.  She likes this lotion line.  Especially in the convenient carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She isn&#x27;t crazy about the scents and it doesn&#x27;t provide real long lasting relief for extremely dry hands (which is probably because this lotion isn&#x27;t super thick), which is why I did not give the rating 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for someone like me with semi-dry hands I believe this would be a great lotion.  These just aren&#x27;t manly enough scents for me.</li>
    <li> Ordered as a gift.  Granddaughter loves the product.  Came within scheduled timeframe and well packaged.</li>
    <li> but the green one kind of leaked out when i got it</li>
    <li> Love the scent and feel of this lotion. Perfect for your purse or even back pocket.</li>
    <li> love them.. great scent and size..</li>
