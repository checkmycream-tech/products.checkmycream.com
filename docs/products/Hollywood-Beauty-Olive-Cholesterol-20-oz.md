      <li>The product came on time and works great.</li>
      <li>As a result, I have been trying to figure out which products best suit my hair, because we know that what&#x27;s good for one person, isn&#x27;t always good for the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but, it&#x27;s like I feel my hair enjoying it); thank you Hollywood for the best product at a great price.  </li>

      <li>buying!It smells really good &amp; has great ingredients (castor oil, olive oil, tea tree oil, jojoba oil, avacodo oil, coconut oil, and egg protein TO NAME A FEW)</li>
      <li>I rinsed my hair and it was silky smooth like butter...</li>
      <li>After rinsing, my hair was tangle free, shiny and</li>
      <li>The smell is light</li>
      <li>Love the fact that I now have a good deep conditioner for my hair.</li>
      <li>This product is a breathe of fresh air!  </li>
      <li>Better than much higher end product I used.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews quickly on my phone before purchasing and decided to give it a shot...</li>
      <li>softened, smoothed, straightened like nothing else all for super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>
      <li>It also helps with my dry scalp and leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh AND even smells good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and chocked full of good things for my hair!</li>
      <li>However I choose to use it, my hair feels amazing and almost instantly detangles</li>
      <li>Great moisturizing deep conditioner for my natural 4C hair.</li>
      <li>and she said her hair has been so shiny, soft and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice big tub</li>
      <li>Because of the price, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>I think it is useful</li>
      <li>Washes right out without buildup.</li>
      <li>beautiful shiny curls with hardly any styling product</li>
      <li>This product did not work for me and usually when products have great reviews they usually work this is the first time something with great reviews did not work for me.</li>
      <li>It left my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE how my hair looked and felt after I rinsed this deep conditioner out!</li>
      <li>and it made my hair feel so very manageable!</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t exactly look like I came out of the salon</li>
      <li>love that it contains castor oil, olive oil, glycerin, tea tree oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, egg protein, as well as aloe vera, rosemary, sage, white nettle, and chamomile extracts.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the normal cholesterol treatments because of all of the natural oils and extracts.</li>
      <li>First off let me say I did not buy this on Amazon</li>
      <li>Will most definitely be buying again....</li>
      <li>The ends were not only non-frayed looking, but they looked healthy and full and you could actually see the true length.</li>
      <li>but it looks pretty darn good for the small price I paid for this product.</li>
      <li>But this product truely works with more than half the price.</li>
      <li>It really works wonders.  </li>
      <li>but my ends are VERY damaged to the point that they are so frayed</li>
      <li>Your hair will really &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The second time, I wet my hair, and then applied a generous amount from ends to roots, wrapped my hair in a mist towel, and waited a good 15 mts.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>Not only this, but in general my hair was less frizzy, more straighter, and the ends were so luscious that they actually had a nice blunt flip to them, as if they were freshly cut.</li>
      <li>Third , you don&#x27;t need to do anything special for it to work.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair feels so shiny and soft after my first use.</li>
      <li>After washing my hair, I slap a nice amount in  my coarse, very dry hair.</li>
      <li>so now my hair is a bit oily/sticky, but this conditioner most CERTAINLY did its job.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because it&#x27;s pretty thick, and I know that I have a lot a hair</li>
      <li>4 C).I didn&#x27;t have any high expectations foe this product, it just saw it for $4.99, so I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>and I see lots of high reviews on website.</li>
      <li>I was prompted to write this review because even though the dry texture is somewhat there due to the many split ends (only true way to get ride of them is to get a cut), the fact that my ends don&#x27;t even look split but look fresh amazes me.</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to be this soft.</li>
      <li>but till last night this is the first product I love and will keep using I have hair like an African American</li>
      <li>stuff  goes on my hair very smoothly, and gives my hair extreme curls !!!</li>
      <li>No small feat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I decided to give it another chance about a month or two ago and it made my hair feel soft and silky!</li>
      <li>first time using this last night and my hair just LOVES this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 year</li>
      <li>Im going to try this out on my 5 year old.</li>
      <li>It has made my hair really soft.</li>
      <li>I went to the beauty supply store and grabbed this as an after thought because I was going to buy one of those overly priced natural hair care conditioners.</li>
      <li>After my hair dried it was silky smooth</li>
      <li>wow.  </li>
      <li>not this soft I like texture .</li>
      <li>With this my hair is soft, holds moisture and grows faster without additional breakage.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny - a natural shine, not an oily shine.</li>
      <li>I put it on right after my shampoo mix while the hair was still wet...</li>
      <li>My hair was extremely dry the first couple of days</li>
      <li>At first I tried using this as a leave-in, but all it did was dry my hair out.</li>
      <li>My curls came back to live with in minutes of applying this product and they are soft to the touch.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the best conditionner I&#x27;ve used by far. Really love this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon, but I got it at my local CVS store. This stuff is amazing and so good for you! I think it&#x27;s better than the normal cholesterol treatments because of all of the natural oils and extracts. It makes my hair so soft and shiny - a natural shine, not an oily shine. It also helps with my dry scalp and leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh AND even smells good. If you&#x27;re looking for an alternate conditioner or an add-in or even a monthly treatment, this is totally for you!</li>
    <li> When I used this conditioner in the past, it always left my hair rough and dry. Idk what happened but I decided to give it another chance about a month or two ago and it made my hair feel soft and silky! The smell is great as well. I added a little olive oil in it to make it a little bit more moisturizing and this stuff works wonders and its under $4 so you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Walgreens(combined with Hollywood Beauty olive creme) for around $4. Because of the price, I thought it was worth a try. Boy am I glad I did!!!!! After washing my hair, I slap a nice amount in  my coarse, very dry hair. I apply a plastic cap and let it sit for about 20 mins. I then detangle and rinse and my hair feels like silk! Like another persons hair :) I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and will continue buying!It smells really good &amp; has great ingredients (castor oil, olive oil, tea tree oil, jojoba oil, avacodo oil, coconut oil, and egg protein TO NAME A FEW) TRY IT!! YOU WONT BE SORRY!</li>
    <li> I decided over a year ago to transition back to my natural texture. I&#x27;m Latina with 3c texture. As a result, I have been trying to figure out which products best suit my hair, because we know that what&#x27;s good for one person, isn&#x27;t always good for the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using this last night and my hair just LOVES this product! Look at the ingredients and you will see that this is a super great buy, a winner! I cowashed with this and left it in awhile while I showered, then rinsed it out and it made my hair feel so very manageable! This is a must have!</li>
    <li> Okay! I always try new things because I have African American hair. I&#x27;m black so my hair gets dry. I was trying to make my hair softer but not this soft I like texture . My hair is 3c 4a so I&#x27;m going to try this on my daughters hair because I&#x27;m guessing that this stuff would make hard to manage hair manageable because my hair is so soft this morning. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to be this soft. I like my kinkyness. But I know that this stuff will repair damaged hair</li>
    <li> I stepped away from the cholesterol creams for awhile... Like always I end up coming back lol. I put it on right after my shampoo mix while the hair was still wet... I put on a grocery store bag for a couple of mins... I rinsed my hair and it was silky smooth like butter... After my hair dried it was silky smooth like I had a perm or something. I have not relaxed in a while... Oh btw I did mix a little jbco in mine as well... Will most definitely be buying again.... This time it wont be one I will be stocking up!!!</li>
    <li> First off let me say I did not buy this on Amazon I was at CVS Pharmacy and seen it on sale picked it up and fell in love with it I have tried everything else but till last night this is the first product I love and will keep using I have hair like an African American but I am white so I went to so many hair styless and they had me try the expensive stuff didn&#x27;t work. But this product truely works with more than half the price.</li>
    <li> I think it is useful and I see lots of high reviews on website. But I did not received it for more than one month, and I ask for refund. But I think I will try it next time.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at the local Walmart for around $2.50.  I read the reviews quickly on my phone before purchasing and decided to give it a shot...after reading 5 star reviews I knew I had to try it for the price...well.....this stuff quenches like nobody&#x27;s business!  I have thick, 4a tight coily springy curly hair...this made my curls hang and relax.  I could tell it was a winner when I rinsed it out.  The smell is light n lovely and my curls were shiny and healthy..not oily!!!  I did deep conditioning method but placed plastic cap on hair and got under dryer for 5 minutes.  Voila...beautiful shiny curls with hardly any styling product needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this one weekly.</li>
    <li> I have multi-textured hair, and this inexpensive cholesterol treatment moisturized and defined all curly/coily textures on my head. No small feat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cholesterol for ten months now (since the end of February). I&#x27;ve tried this product several ways: as a rinse-out conditioner, co-wash, deep conditioner, etc. However I choose to use it, my hair feels amazing and almost instantly detangles itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it contains castor oil, olive oil, glycerin, tea tree oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, egg protein, as well as aloe vera, rosemary, sage, white nettle, and chamomile extracts. I plan to stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more detailed review, check out: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/hollywood-beauty-olive-cholesterol/</li>
    <li> I have curly mixed coarse/medium hair.  This product leaves my hair tame and silky.  No more frizzy tangled mess.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair &amp; this works wonders for me.  I applied this after shampooing &amp; conditioning &amp; then put on a deep conditioning cap . After drying my hair , my hair was the softest its been in months.</li>
    <li> Amazingly great product. It makes my hair feels so shiny and soft after my first use. Better than much higher end product I used. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I decided to pick up this product because my ends seemed dry and my hair would frizz a lot.  It really works wonders.  I even shared the outcome with my sister who lives in Florida and she said her hair has been so shiny, soft and healthy looking.  I use it as often as I wash my hair and based on the temperature&#x27;s humidity level.  My hair doesn&#x27;t exactly look like I came out of the salon but it looks pretty darn good for the small price I paid for this product.</li>
    <li> It smells good but I gave it a four because it doesn&#x27;t soften my hair, no matter how long I keep it on, it won&#x27;t soften it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me and usually when products have great reviews they usually work this is the first time something with great reviews did not work for me. It made my hair really tangled and dry. This is a bit thick and thick conditioners do not work well for my thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I have sisterlocks and after coloring them a couple of weeks ago I couldn&#x27;t get over how dry and over processed my hair was looking and feeling. I went to the beauty supply store and grabbed this as an after thought because I was going to buy one of those overly priced natural hair care conditioners. I saw this one for $3.99 and said why not..Well Im glad I bought it. It comes in a nice big tub and since I do have sisterlocks I really slathered this stuff on and coated all of my locks and put a plastic bag on my head for about an hour while I did other stuff around the house. When I rinsed this out my hair felt so moisturized even after I let it air dry. I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair or stop looking in the mirror to see the shine. Your hair will really &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is for all the extra ingredients that I cant pronounce and alcohol is the 2nd ingredient. Why? Im going to try this out on my 5 year old. She has what you naturals call a 4a-c hair coil and her hair has gotten really dry from summertime swimming. I&#x27;ll update after I do her hair.</li>
    <li> I have to say for only 2.99 at my local target this product is leaving me speechless. I have coarse curly 3c/4a curls that had been in a bun for about 2 weeks. My hair was so thirsty and needed some nourishment. I picked this up not really knowing if it would be as moisturizing as it was but I must say it is phenomenal. My curls came back to live with in minutes of applying this product and they are soft to the touch. This will definalty be a deep conditioner in my curly girl regimen until I can no longer find it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 year and I currently dyed my hair blonde.  My hair was extremely dry the first couple of days so I decided to use this produced and wow.  First of all is smells great, even after you wash it out and put styling products you can still smell it. Second of all, you get a lot of product for a low cost.  Third , you don&#x27;t need to do anything special for it to work.  I put it on my wet hair and put it in a clip while I finish shaving and washing. Then I washed it out and detangled with my finger and then put Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner and suave gel.  It left my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my local drug store,  CVS. I have curly, thick natural African American hair (4 C).I didn&#x27;t have any high expectations foe this product, it just saw it for $4.99, so I decided to try it.  Wow!!! I used it as a Co-Wash and my hair  fell in love!!! I use it for deep conditioning mixed with my Lava Clay, and also mixed in my Pre-Poo Sundae:-)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff  goes on my hair very smoothly, and gives my hair extreme curls !!! I have to stock up on this miracle in a jar!</li>
    <li> Every other week I put this in my hair.  I leave it on for a couple hours with a shower cap.  It has made my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> Awesome a lot cheaper than hair mayonnaise.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.... over all.... Already see results with just a week of use...dislike the texture a bit... Though!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have used for my hair. I relax it but it grows in rather course and tends to be dry. With this my hair is soft, holds moisture and grows faster without additional breakage. I would imagine this would be perfect for natural hair as well. Great product. I will be stocking up. I have purchased from CVS in the past with the actual olive oil to mix in. I put a cap on or sit under the dryer.</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally curly African-American hair.&lt;br /&gt;After having a conversation with a relative of mine about hair, she mentioned to me that I should try using Cholesterol because I told her that my hair tends to become a dry curly afro once it dries with product in it (that product usually being Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie).&lt;br /&gt;I was Family Dollar last night and I just happened to see this product and I thought why not try it, especially because today I planned on washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair about 4 hours ago at noon and I LOVE how my hair looked and felt after I rinsed this deep conditioner out! I kept in my hair for 15 minutes or so and omg YES.&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to put Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curly Soufflé in it so now my hair is a bit oily/sticky, but this conditioner most CERTAINLY did its job.&lt;br /&gt;Also, because it&#x27;s pretty thick, and I know that I have a lot a hair, it is useful to really spread it out and don&#x27;t be afraid to let some water help with the distribution. And the amount of this product is a total plus. :D</li>
    <li> Does wonders from my hair. Love the fact that I now have a good deep conditioner for my hair. And smells rather nice :)</li>
    <li> Buy it think its hair cream not shower cream i hate cheating</li>
    <li> This product is a breathe of fresh air!  My hair loves it after being so dehydrated, dry and needing moisture the best co-wash item ever especially when deep conditioning hair under a drier for 35 mins and rinsing out with cold water locking the oils in my hair (sorry but, it&#x27;s like I feel my hair enjoying it); thank you Hollywood for the best product at a great price.  Oh, btw I did stock up.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing deep conditioner for my natural 4C hair.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at a local CVS simply wanting to give it a try because of the price. I have waist length hair but my ends are VERY damaged to the point that they are so frayed, it looks like my hair doesn&#x27;t actually go past half my back. At first I tried using this as a leave-in, but all it did was dry my hair out. The second time, I wet my hair, and then applied a generous amount from ends to roots, wrapped my hair in a mist towel, and waited a good 15 mts. Then I shampooed and used regular conditioner. I noticed the miracle after I brushed my 95% dry hair out. The ends were not only non-frayed looking, but they looked healthy and full and you could actually see the true length. Not only this, but in general my hair was less frizzy, more straighter, and the ends were so luscious that they actually had a nice blunt flip to them, as if they were freshly cut. I have never seen my hair so healthy. I was prompted to write this review because even though the dry texture is somewhat there due to the many split ends (only true way to get ride of them is to get a cut), the fact that my ends don&#x27;t even look split but look fresh amazes me. May not be the same results for everyone though.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every product out there to try and fix my dry, brittle, frizzy African-American natural curls and this inexpensive jar did the trick! It&#x27;s thick and chocked full of good things for my hair! After washing, I slathered it on and put a plastic cap on top and waited for about 1 hour.  After rinsing, my hair was tangle free, shiny and my curls were actually elongated and bouncy!  This is truly a miracle as my hair looked and felt like straw!</li>
    <li> Washes right out without buildup. Defines hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this at target for around $4.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have african hair, but my hair was extremely dry, damaged, and curly from a failed perm and multiple hairdyes/bleach.&lt;br /&gt;This softened, smoothed, straightened like nothing else all for super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Wet my hair, put in some coconut oil, drenched my hair in this product, and wrapped my hair with a moist towel for around 30 min. Amazing results.</li>
    <li> Love it! The product came on time and works great. I would definitely recommend the product.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
