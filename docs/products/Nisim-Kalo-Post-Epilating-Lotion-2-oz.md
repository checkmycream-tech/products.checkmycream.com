### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and i see nothing permanent for sure!!!!!</li>
      <li>go between my at home treatments and it works great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am not going to lie, it is a torture device, but it works wonderfully with the Nisim Kalo lotion.</li>
      <li>perhaps after waxing is better, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me, at all!!!!</li>
      <li>That being said, it fades within an hour or so, so I will continue to use it hoping that the stink means it must give GREAT results!</li>
      <li>It worked wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>

      <li>Authentic Product  sold by the seller with excellent communication.</li>
      <li>Thank you for a good product.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line: I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s why it was effective in that area.</li>
      <li>Nice conditioner for the skin</li>
      <li>I can honestly say it does work.</li>
      <li>I have honestly seen a reduction of hair after I waxed</li>
      <li>Okay, so I have been through all the hair removal tricks, products etc over the years and felt so fed up with trying things and never getting results..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t always review products unless I know that it works for sure.</li>
      <li>I think everyone with a hair issue needs to go thru  the trial and error process and decide what works best for that individual.</li>
      <li>Interesting product.</li>
      <li>I already ordered three more bottles...</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t powerful but it isn&#x27;t good by any means.</li>
      <li>I am for sure a work in progress.  </li>
      <li>but if you start now, by next summer you&#x27;ll be looking great!</li>
      <li>Just make sure to use the correct hair removal method and apply the correct amount of times as directed.</li>
      <li>Mom happy is really what it&#x27;s all about, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
      <li>place I&#x27;ve seen the most improvement is my underarms.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years love it</li>
      <li>Wanted more of a face cleaner.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The lotion needs to be able to enter the follicle.</li>
      <li>The hairs are always thinner and more</li>
      <li>Do this for 4-6 epilating treatments and your leg hair should start to become softer and more</li>
      <li>its working great thus far !!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how it works!</li>
      <li>Most hair removal or inhibiting products in my opinion always smell so strongly of chemicals, but this one seems to be practically scentless.  </li>
      <li>and when i applied the KALO, i am sure that it got into these hair shafts as well and had some effect on these hairs as well because those hair are growing slower and when i try to remove them with tweezers, they are coming out so easily with no pain---almost as if they are some what weaker...</li>
      <li>I will give a more detailed review</li>
      <li>i would sy it is good because it really does soothe the skin ,</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I am going into this with a good deal of skepticism, and fully prepared to realize I&#x27;ve been ripped off by yet another company promising to help me be hair free.  </li>
      <li>If you already wax or epilate then this product is perfect for you because all you have to do is rub it in 3 times right after and 3 times the next day and Ta-Da!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fine with shaving or waxing or eliptating</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important</li>
      <li>I would often pluck, and sometimes shave, in order to keep the smooth consistency on both sides of my face.</li>
      <li>At one time I was paying a whole lot more for Vaniqa - this does work better -- for me.</li>
      <li>I just finished my first bottle and bought two more.</li>
      <li>it works significantly faster than it says it would, even for people that have a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>Extremely friendly with your skin.</li>
      <li>(&lt;br /&gt;i bought this product because of all the positive reviews, and i&#x27;m still going to purchase more.</li>
      <li>For $20 you&#x27;d expect the bottle to be full.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re feeling really scientific, treat a patch on your arm or leg where you&#x27;ll have normal hair growth to make a good comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face has been hair free since then (6 years!), but I just had a baby, and like so many women it caused me to grow facial hair.  </li>
      <li>But make sure you follow the directions exactly -- it is mainly for post plucking/waxing.  </li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m just getting lucky with that.</li>
      <li>This is definitely a quick fix and requires patience in its use</li>
      <li>This product is helping tremendously.  </li>
      <li>works ok thought it would last longer, I was expecting more do to others remarks</li>
      <li>but then its really light in the first place</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice great efficacy (slower hair growth, less growth, etc).</li>
      <li>The smell is very light and the constancy is like a soft lotion.</li>
      <li>(wish me luck!)&lt;br /&gt;i know it&#x27;ll take a couple of months to see if it actually works, which means i&#x27;ll probably have to order 2-3 more bottles, and that&#x27;s fine and dandy</li>
      <li>Yes, at full price it&#x27;s a bit pricey; but it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I tried to make sure that both days I fit my three applications in between me coming home from work and me taking a shower later that night after the gym.  </li>
      <li>I read all the reviews on here and decided it was worth buying once to try it out</li>
      <li>leading up to that, you&#x27;ll be delighted to see your hair growing in more slowly and with finer, lighter-colored hairs.</li>
      <li>leading up to that, you&#x27;ll be delighted to see your hair growing in more slowly and with finer, lighter-colored hairs.t about 10% of hair is affected each time, and that 10% is permanent after six treatments.</li>
      <li>I have used it on my face, underarms, and bikini area and have never been burned by it nor has it ever left a rash of any kind.</li>
      <li>After epilating rub the cream into the legs so that it becomes absorbed.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and many products leave a rash on me.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed more hair growth, not less.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m incredibly pleased that it works much better than other hair minimizing lotions and even the prescription Vaniqa</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m trying it on my face, neck, and legs right now</li>
      <li>Since I am a model I pretty much have to be smooth all the time, so I have tried laser hair removal, laser reduction and wax every week.</li>
      <li>the price is a bit high but for me it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>So far this one seems to be fine.  </li>
      <li>Why not give a smaller bottle so that people don&#x27;t think they are getting more product for their money?</li>
      <li>In addition, you should also apply it three more times the next day.</li>
      <li>she no longer needs to use the hot wax now.</li>
      <li>(and it&#x27;s much cheaper than that!)  </li>
      <li>:)....I know everyone is different but for me.....</li>
      <li>Expect this stuff to burn the first time you put it on.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s taking about 3 weeks or more for the hair to START to grow back in</li>
      <li>let the hair grow back over the period of a month or more, THEN epilate and treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will most definitely buy it again and start using it for my underarms and legs</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Do this 2 more times (about 15 minutes in-between) that same day.</li>
      <li>I just want to share my first thoughts so that people who are buying it for the first time know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used KALO and i must say that it leaves ur skin soft and smooth..</li>
      <li>I got this and just used it for the first &amp;#34;session.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m classifying a session as the two days that you use it after your waxing.  </li>
      <li>Since it was just the first use I can&#x27;t say anything about how it reduces hair growth</li>
      <li>The smell is funny (You will know when you use it) and you wont notice it until you rub it in.</li>
      <li>When I first tried this I wasn&#x27;t convinced.</li>
      <li>I am a first time user...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got this for Mom, when I got her the epilator as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;She said this does slow down the re-growth of the hair, and makes them thinner, when they grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ever going to completely stop it, but her legs do look smoother, and feel softer when she uses this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s happy with it, and happy she no longer needs to use the hot wax now. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing Mom happy is really what it&#x27;s all about, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> So I have always had a facial hair problem.  Ever since I was 13.  It got so bad I was shaving my face.  I eventually bit the bullet and made the financial commitment to electrolysis.  It worked wonderfully.  Cleared my face completely.  I even got all those little white hairs off.  However, it took me 3 years to get all the hair off my face, and about $8,000.  My face has been hair free since then (6 years!), but I just had a baby, and like so many women it caused me to grow facial hair.  Again.  So I&#x27;ve already started electrolysis again, and I&#x27;m hoping that by using this cream it will cut my treatment time in half.  I went back to the same electrologist, and even though I don&#x27;t have near as much hair as I did last time, I&#x27;m still looking at about a year and a half of treatment to get rid of what I do have.  This product says a noticeable difference should be seen within 4-6 weeks of use, and continued use may be needed to see desired results.  So I have a plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought enough of this stuff to last me for 6 MONTHS.  That is triple the treatment time listed.  I just used it yesterday after my electrolysis appointment as instructed.  3 times, and I&#x27;m going to use it 3 times today.  I will continue to use it as instructed for the 6 weeks in conjunction with my electrolysis.  When the 6 weeks are up I will come back and give another update as to how it is working.  Whether or not I see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I will finish using the rest of what I have for the remainder of the 6 months, and then I will come back and give yet another review detailing my final opinion of the product.  If it works?  I will most definitely buy it again and start using it for my underarms and legs so that hopefully one day I can be completely and totally hair free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t work?  You will see a rant a mile long about this company and product for false advertising, capitalizing on the pain of others, and a crappy product.  I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t happen, but I&#x27;ve been burned by hair removal products plenty of times in the past.  I am going into this with a good deal of skepticism, and fully prepared to realize I&#x27;ve been ripped off by yet another company promising to help me be hair free.  I only tried this one because of the many good reviews, and because this product explains it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair, but helps to keep it from growing back in correlation with other hair removal methods.  It advertises itself as an aid of sorts, not a solution.  That is why I&#x27;m giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve given it three stars now because 1) It actually makes my skin feel softer after rubbing it in, so at least it works as a lotion. 2)  It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and many products leave a rash on me.  So far this one seems to be fine.  3)  It doesn&#x27;t smell god awful.  Most hair removal or inhibiting products in my opinion always smell so strongly of chemicals, but this one seems to be practically scentless.  I don&#x27;t notice anything at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that is my review so far.  The six week mark will be June 27.  I will give a more detailed review then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUNE 27:  Pending...</li>
    <li> Recommend using it, it does what it is supposed to do if used as recommended.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this product after using the NONO 8800 and I am definetly seeing results form both products.If you can afford it , I suggest both products for anyone!</li>
    <li> When I first tried this I wasn&#x27;t convinced. Then I read some reviews and started following the recommendations for multiple  (3)  applications daily. Now, I&#x27;m impressed - I definitely have less facial hair in need of removal on a daily basis. At one time I was paying a whole lot more for Vaniqa - this does work better -- for me. I think everyone with a hair issue needs to go thru  the trial and error process and decide what works best for that individual.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say if it works or not; I&#x27;ll update when I start to notice a change. I just want to share my first thoughts so that people who are buying it for the first time know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions: The smell is very light and the constancy is like a soft lotion. I am disappointed with how little is in the bottle however. For $20 you&#x27;d expect the bottle to be full. It feels like it is half empty. Why not give a smaller bottle so that people don&#x27;t think they are getting more product for their money? I feel like this is enough for 4-5 uses, but I&#x27;m still being sparing just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using an epilator for the first time, your legs will be very sensitive and covered in red dots. Expect this stuff to burn the first time you put it on. I suppose the burning means it&#x27;s working and getting into the hair follicles like it needs to, but it can be off-putting when your legs are already highly irritated. It says &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; on the bottle, but the first go was far from it. The following day however it was soothing since my legs were still irritated. Really, it just feels like what you would expect from a lotion on irritated legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important you follow the instructions. After epilating rub the cream into the legs so that it becomes absorbed. Do this 2 more times (about 15 minutes in-between) that same day. Repeat the following day (3 applications 15 minutes apart). Do this for 4-6 epilating treatments and your leg hair should start to become softer and more sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you if that last part is true, but I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks to let you know!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and have only been using it for about three days, but I can already tell that it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my teenage years, my birth mark, a patch of dark skin on the left side of my jaw, became more pronounced and hairs started to grow out of it (weird, I know). I would often pluck, and sometimes shave, in order to keep the smooth consistency on both sides of my face. However, as I kept plucking, the hairs would grow faster and thicker. Basically, I was at a point where whenever I got home from school and work, I had to tweeze off the hairs on my birth mark so that I would not look like a freak when I go out in public. This chore of an activity went on for years as I did not have money for laser treatment or any other kinds of expensive hair-removal procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, to my luck, I came across this product while surfing through Amazon. Needless to say, I was reluctant to buy since there were quite a few negative reviews on the lotion. However, I finally gave in and decided to try it out myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement, almost three days have passed and I have yet to pluck! I do not know how well this lotion will work in the long run, but so far I can honestly say that it has given me a feeling that I have not felt in a long time. I no longer have to keep up with the daily tweezing and worry about the facial hair on my birth mark growing uncontrollably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are unsure of how this product works, you have to pluck your hairs and not shave! The lotion needs to be able to enter the follicle. Once you have tweezed or waxed, apply this product once and then twice more on that same day. In addition, you should also apply it three more times the next day. You do not need to keep using the lotion until AFTER your next hair removal process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do not like to tweeze or wax, you can also purchase this product called the [[ASIN:B001FXUTUM R.E.M. Spring Facial Hair Remover]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to lie, it is a torture device, but it works wonderfully with the Nisim Kalo lotion.</li>
    <li> Authentic Product  sold by the seller with excellent communication. Does a fabulous hair removal soothing lotion  to prevent hair from growing back.  I&#x27;ve used it for years love it and it works over time.</li>
    <li> The bottle is not that small, I have had mine for almost a month and still have a lot left.  I use it everyday - sometimes more than once.  I mainly use it on my face but believe me I have dark course hair all over the place.  I have honestly seen a reduction of hair after I waxed - I was waxing at least once a week just to keep up with it, but now I have gone almost 3 and no waxing - yes there is hair growth but not like it was before.  I think I would buy this product again, it is a cheap solution to the expensive products that are out there.</li>
    <li> Bought this one because of price. I have very dark coarse chin and mustache. After using for about 3 months now the hairs come in much less heavier. Used to have to remove hair every other day now I can get away with 2 days of growth. So... to me it is working. The directions say to use twice on hair removal day and three times next day. I usually just use it after hair removal and if I remember again that day and hardly ever the next so if you were to do it as directed I am sure after 2 months you would have much much less hair. So I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone with the &amp;#34;Italian Curse&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and seems to work as a post epilation lotion. However it smells TERRIBLE! I threw it away. Will never by this brand again.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user... I used it last week after epilating......and yes my skin got bumps after epilating but went down after 2 days.......I epilated again and this time around didnt get any bumps.......I used KALO and i must say that it leaves ur skin soft and smooth..The hair isnt growing back as fast.....ALSO, when i epilated there may have been some hairs that were very short to catch and when i applied the KALO, i am sure that it got into these hair shafts as well and had some effect on these hairs as well because those hair are growing slower and when i try to remove them with tweezers, they are coming out so easily with no pain---almost as if they are some what weaker...:)....I know everyone is different but for me.....its working great thus far !! LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day, after plucking and it helps the hair from growing back as quickly or as dense.</li>
    <li> It says on the label that it also works when used after shaving.  I assumed that it would just take longer, but DO NOT PURCHASE this item if you plan on using it after you shave. perhaps after waxing is better, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me, at all!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a little over 2 months and have seen not much improvement but will give it at least an additional month</li>
    <li> I am Middle eastern with lots of thick black hair, and I have tried everything, I am so hairy I can&#x27;t shave I have to wax or epilady. SO hairy that I can epilday every week. I figured It can&#x27;t hurt to try this out on the small chance that it would work. AND IT DOES! I just finished my first bottle and bought two more. I put it on after waxing, threading, or epilady (bikini, legs, face)and I have seen a HUGE reduction in my hair, the thickness of strands and the amount per area that they grow out in, As long as you use it after hair removal from the root of the hair you are going to see results!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00275FRMW Nisim Kalo Post Epilating Lotion 2 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this since May 2011, not much difference in seeing the result of removing hair (eg. legs, armpits, under lip, and private parts).  I have to admit that I only shave but goodness  after 7 bottles I should see something. NOTHING!!!  After I complete my 7th bottle, no more giving this company my money.  I only bought the 7th bottle because I bought the Surgi-Wax Hair.  But my painful experience with the Wax is worst this this Kalo hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;What am I doing wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/21/12: I saw a few spots that that no/very little hair (private area).  So let&#x27;s see how this will work out.  I suspect that if this is used (shaving), extra patience will be needed to see results.</li>
    <li> I have nothing to say on it&#x27;s effectiveness as I&#x27;ve only had this product for two days, including today. But I can say that this thing better not be a very disgusting joke by a disgruntled male worker because it smells absolutely horrible. I&#x27;m desperate and determined enough to keep putting it on my face, but every time I open the cap and get a whiff, I reconsider using it. It evokes a, &amp;#34;Something About Mary&amp;#34; comedy sketch scene that&#x27;s only funny from the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll repost with effectiveness when I&#x27;ve figured it out in awhile. Until then.... Just hoping I&#x27;m not the butt of a joke.</li>
    <li> this is not a permanent hairloss treatment. Not sure if it works, if it does.. It just wan;t for me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product if used as suggested. I only have problems when when I, in my busy schedule do not take time to apply more than once a day.</li>
    <li> I like it. Haven&#x27;t used it very long, but will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner for the skin but I didn&#x27;t notice great efficacy (slower hair growth, less growth, etc). also smells a bit like K9 anal glands ;(</li>
    <li> works ok thought it would last longer, I was expecting more do to others remarks</li>
    <li> I got this and just used it for the first &amp;#34;session.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m classifying a session as the two days that you use it after your waxing.  Since it was just the first use I can&#x27;t say anything about how it reduces hair growth but I will say that the few hairs that I had to tweeze because they were missed came out VERY VERY easy.  And that&#x27;s amazing to me since I have thick course hair (mixed ethnic background lots of thick curly hair on my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin.  I also think that the bottle will last a while as well.  My only complaint is that it smells TERRIBLE.  I tried to make sure that both days I fit my three applications in between me coming home from work and me taking a shower later that night after the gym.  Seriously, I felt like I smelled like a hobo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how it works!</li>
    <li> Does not work as indicated. Followed directions on back. Does not remove hair. It comes back. No good. REFUND REQUESTED</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find something that will permanently remove &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; colored hair for years and was hopeful this product would work.  Nope.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t know if this works because i cannot tolerate the scent. The odor is horrible.</li>
    <li> Fake products... I used it, but it didn&#x27;t make any progress</li>
    <li> Wow you can actually tell the hair growth stops and slows.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend reading product directions and follow then to a T&lt;br /&gt;If used twice daily for a while it really works!&lt;br /&gt;And no skin irritation and overpowering smell.</li>
    <li> Interesting product. Combined with waxing, it has helped a lot to lessen hair regrowth. Extremely friendly with your skin.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on here and decided it was worth buying once to try it out (although I bought it somewhere else that I had a gift certificate to).  I have PCOS, so I suffer from bad facial hair growth...I have to shave &amp; pluck daily, and left alone, I could easily grow a full goatee and sideburns.  This product is helping tremendously.  I&#x27;ve used it for two-three weeks.  A couple of times a week, I&#x27;ll pluck as much as I can before shaving.  I apply it three times that day and three times the following day, as directed.  Even when I don&#x27;t pluck and only shave, I apply it once before getting ready for the day.  The hair I&#x27;ve plucked hasn&#x27;t grown back in yet, so there is a definite decrease in growth time.  And the hairs I&#x27;ve only been shaving are coming in more slowly.  I&#x27;m still having to shave daily, but I can at least tell that it&#x27;s not growing as much.&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the one thing wrong with it -- it smells horrible.  Really bad.  But the smell fades within a few minutes, and I&#x27;ll take it to finally have some peace with this problem that is a daily struggle.  In addition, it makes my skin really soft and moisturized.  I&#x27;m incredibly pleased that it works much better than other hair minimizing lotions and even the prescription Vaniqa (and it&#x27;s much cheaper than that!)  If you also have this struggle, it&#x27;s worth buying once to at least try it.  But make sure you follow the directions exactly -- it is mainly for post plucking/waxing.  From what I&#x27;ve read, it doesn&#x27;t always work to slow the growth if you&#x27;re just shaving.  I guess I&#x27;m just getting lucky with that.</li>
    <li> I used this product before so I knew it would work. I use it on my beard, don&#x27;t like shaving. Have been using it for about 2 months as of this writing and my beard has slowed down and is easier to shave. Will keep using it and hope it will slow down beard evern more, it did before. Thank you for a good product.</li>
    <li> Did not see a difference after use for several, several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed directions completely, so this was not from error on my end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, I forgot to reapply it later on during that day like its directed to, but I have noticed that it does delay hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last couple of years and can truly say it works!! I&#x27;m a black female with hormonal hair growth and it has helped minimize this hair by lightening and making it thinner over time. This is definitely a quick fix and requires patience in its use but it does work!!</li>
    <li> this product does work as described, but you have to use it correctly. don&#x27;t expect it to work faster than the product label says it will. too many people give this product poor reviews and claim it doesn&#x27;t work but, in their own reviews, they admit to using it improperly. in that case, whose fault is it, really? my vacuum doesn&#x27;t clean anything if i just wheel it out into the living room and stare at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you buy your first tube from their website (way more expensive), you&#x27;ll at least get a product guarantee. if you&#x27;re not satisfied, they&#x27;ll refund you for your first tube (so only buy one!). if your expectations are realistic, and you&#x27;re a patient person, buy it from amazon instead and save a lot of money. treat a small area like your chin, upper lip, or underarms where you can successfully complete at least six treatments before deciding to stop or buy more. if you&#x27;re feeling really scientific, treat a patch on your arm or leg where you&#x27;ll have normal hair growth to make a good comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;important things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no shaving! the hair has to be removed from the root in order for the lotion to enter the follicle and do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t use the product once daily. use it three times spaced out over the first day after you epilate, three times spaced out over the second day, and STOP. if you&#x27;re using it daily, you&#x27;re probably thinking of vaniqa, which works differently and effects different results (vaniqa isn&#x27;t permanent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it takes six treatments to START seeing results. if you&#x27;ve been waxing/epilating for a while, you&#x27;ll see results a little sooner. after 2 treatments, my arm hair is growing back fine and light brown-blonde instead of thick and dark brown but i&#x27;ve been waxing them for 2-3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t epilate too frequently. there&#x27;s nothing magic about the number \\&quot;six\\&quot; for treatments, so doing treatments a week apart will only waste money and frustrate you. the website explains that about 10% of hair is affected each time, and that 10% is permanent after six treatments. if you epilate too frequently, you&#x27;re only treating 10% of a small amount of hair. let the hair grow back over the period of a month or more, THEN epilate and treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- keeping all that in mind, expect to see very gradual permanent hair reduction after about six months. leading up to that, you&#x27;ll be delighted to see your hair growing in more slowly and with finer, lighter-colored hairs.t about 10% of hair is affected each time, and that 10% is permanent after six treatments. if you epilate too frequently, you&#x27;re only treating 10% of a small amount of hair. let the hair grow back over the period of a month or more, THEN epilate and treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- keeping all that in mind, expect to see very gradual permanent hair reduction after about six months. leading up to that, you&#x27;ll be delighted to see your hair growing in more slowly and with finer, lighter-colored hairs.</li>
    <li> I only just started using this product in conjunction with laser hair removal that I&#x27;m having done, so I will update on how well it works or doesn&#x27;t work over the next few weeks. However I simply could NOT wait to post in regards to the smell. It REEKS! I actually started looking around to see if my dog was in the room and had farted, then I went and checked my daughters diaper and finally the garbage in the kitchen until I realized it was ME! It smells like something died and is rotting. That being said, it fades within an hour or so, so I will continue to use it hoping that the stink means it must give GREAT results!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 9 months ago, 3 bottles, used it about 8-9 times. You can definetely see a difference in the hair regrowth. After maybe 4 times I saw results, less hair grows back and the hair that does is somewhat thinner. It&#x27;s an awesome product, you just have to follow the directions. After 8-9 times of using it I now only have half the hair I started with. And I have really dark hair and light skin so dealing with all the shaving and waxing and creams is crucial. If you already wax or epilate then this product is perfect for you because all you have to do is rub it in 3 times right after and 3 times the next day and Ta-Da! your hair stops growing! You do need to realize it&#x27;s not gonna work overnight, it does take time but if you start now, by next summer you&#x27;ll be looking great! ;)</li>
    <li> Ive used this on my upper lip a few times and it has made a difference my upper lip hair is barley noticeable and takes longer to grow than before but then its really light in the first place so that&#x27;s why it was effective in that area. I also used the spray on one of my lower legs to compare the two and the only thing it did was delay it for a few days and now its exactly as it used to be even though ive done it several times I havent been using this long enough or as consistently as im supposed to so i really cant judge how well the product works but i will continue using it on my upper lip and brows correctly and update you guys.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  Be patient when use on course hair.  Gentle on skin.  Easy to use.  Good product.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Yes, at full price it&#x27;s a bit pricey; but it works pretty well. I would use it after epilating / waxing (not sure if it&#x27;s really worth it after shaving, though it does slow the hair growth down). Yes, it has an unpleasant scent AND you have to use it three times the first day after epilating/waxing and three times the second day (it doesn&#x27;t instruct as to hoe long to wait to take a shower so i just let it sit in the irst night and was up about 2-5 hours after the second day application. It DOES impede hair growth. It DOES slow it down. I wish it was a little cheaper, but since it&#x27;s a fraction of electrolysis and such, i will be using this until my body hair is no more. I&#x27;ve tried it on the face a bit, but i got nervous, so I just don&#x27;t use it there.</li>
    <li> im still using it, they said about a year, im almost there, will see if really works, so far its less hair, and not as thick</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! it works significantly faster than it says it would, even for people that have a lot of hair. I waxed/epilated my full legs and applied Kalo when it arrived in the mail 2 days later. Let me tell you, IT WORKS! I have extremely fast hair growth but that was no match for this cream. My only complaint is the price, $30 for 2 ounces is kind of expensive so I apply minimal amounts daily to make it last longer. Bottom line: I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> it slows the growth down for1 becasue you epilate the hair from th root, so it takes just a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; time to grow back and this spray adds a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; more time to grow back, i have been using this for over a year now and i see nothing permanent for sure!!!!!</li>
    <li> i have high hopes for this product. i&#x27;m trying it on my face, neck, and legs right now (wish me luck!)&lt;br /&gt;i know it&#x27;ll take a couple of months to see if it actually works, which means i&#x27;ll probably have to order 2-3 more bottles, and that&#x27;s fine and dandy i dont have a problem with ordering a few more bottles.&lt;br /&gt;my only real issue is the smell.&lt;br /&gt;the smell is absolutely disgusting. it&#x27;s a combination of fish, eggs, and must. GROSS. i have to put it on in cycles during the night because i refuse to put it on during the day and smell like all that in public.&lt;br /&gt;i hope it works, desperately so, otherwise i&#x27;ll have wasted money, time and effort, in smelling like a rotting fish corpse :((&lt;br /&gt;i bought this product because of all the positive reviews, and i&#x27;m still going to purchase more. i just really, REALLY wish the company could make the product smell less gnarly :((</li>
    <li> i would sy it is good because it really does soothe the skin ,whenever i get a burn from hair remover cream it pacifies it ,i dont knw how well it works yet at minimizing hair growth but will continue to use product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this item works or not because I honestly couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. It isn&#x27;t powerful but it isn&#x27;t good by any means. Something around female body odor, chemical makeup cream with a light fragrance desperately failing to cover it up. So if you want to smell like the poor old lady in the nursing home that wears too much cheap perfume and lipstick than this stuff is for you.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before,this is my second tube,I feel it does help slowing hair growth,without a prescription medication.Thank you</li>
    <li> works as expected. It takes continuous use but it does inhibit hair growth. I have used it on my face, underarms, and bikini area and have never been burned by it nor has it ever left a rash of any kind.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now. I can honestly say it does work. I mainly use on my chin, upper lip and eyebrows. I remove hair by either tweezer or threading. My hair grows fast. This product has reduced the hair growth substantially. Shaving doesn&#x27;t work people. You need to remove the hair by it&#x27;s root and then apply the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;What a godsend of this product. I have had no issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Kalo! I&#x27;ll keep at it.</li>
    <li> Kalo works well with plucking!&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows slower in the area I pluck once I apply this kalo lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Get past the slight stench it can have once applied, it fades away quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube,and the hair grows thinner and thinner,so I highly recommend sticking with this product.it is a permanent way to get rid of that unwanted hair,so be patient!</li>
    <li> I used it for a year...waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work!!! It is terribly expensive, as all the products in the &amp;#34;Kalo&amp;#34; line are and I am very disappointed. Never ever ordering from this garbage company again.</li>
    <li> I am someone with very thick, dark hair and have struggled for a long time to find a solution to get a smooth bikini area. Since I am a model I pretty much have to be smooth all the time, so I have tried laser hair removal, laser reduction and wax every week. Nothing worked. Until I started using Kalo. After three months of proper use (waxing and applying) I have barely any hair left in the area and maitenance is something I now only have to do once a month, as opposed to once a week. This stuff is amazing and I recommend it to anyone looking for a legitimate hair solution that won&#x27;t send you broke. Just give it a chance to work and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product DOES work! I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to use an epilator (or waxing) to remove the hairs from the roots before applying this THREE times (15 minutes apart) immediately following hair removal, and then THREE times again the following day. It makes a world of a difference in the effectiveness of this product if you follow the direction provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place I&#x27;ve seen the most improvement is my underarms. Each time I epilate and apply Kalo the hair takes longer and longer to grow back, and less and less each time. Before discovering Kalo, when I would epilate, the hair would begin growing back a week later. Now it&#x27;s taking about 3 weeks or more for the hair to START to grow back in and even then it takes about 6-8 weeks to grow in fully, and even THEN it&#x27;s always less hair than before. The hairs are always thinner and more sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally used it on my bikini area (I didn&#x27;t before because epilating that area is TORTURE, but I bit the bullet and did it) and the hairs in that area are also taking their time growing back in, and this time they&#x27;re much fewer and sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works. I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t always review products unless I know that it works for sure. The people who are saying this product does not work are not using properly and are even admitting to it. Please, do not listen to these people. If you were thinking about purchasing this, do not hesitate. Just make sure to use the correct hair removal method and apply the correct amount of times as directed. You WILL have slower hair growth and the hair does come back less and less each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue using this for as long as possible, if not for the permanent hair reduction then as least for the delay in hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. As others have said, it seems to have made the problem worse. I have noticed more hair growth, not less. I pluck daily now, where I didn&#x27;t used to have to before.</li>
    <li> It appeared to be working at first, then I realized it was wishful thinking. I have been using this product for four months, and there has been no difference. It is garbage, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000RE8GYG Nisim Kalo Hair Inhibitor Lotion Permanent Hair Remover 2 oz]]I have been using Kalo for about 2 weeks now.  I think it is working.  I am getting my neck, chin, and around my lips waxed and then using Kalo.  My hair is much thinner growing back and quite possibly not coming back in areas. I am for sure a work in progress.  The product is so worth it  to me, as I hate having a hairy face.</li>
    <li> it stinks I didn&#x27;t keep up ith it to see if it works so I don&#x27;t know how well it does but it smells ... I wasted money</li>
    <li> Okay, so I have been through all the hair removal tricks, products etc over the years and felt so fed up with trying things and never getting results..I unfortunately inherited the hairy gene from both my mom and dad so course dark leg hair was always a problem and it made me feel so self conscious! I&#x27;m fine with shaving or waxing or eliptating but my leg hair would grow back harsh within 4-5 hours! And for some strange reason goosebumps sped up the process so winter was always the worst. I purchased my first bottle of kalo and the kalo spray after buying my first eliplator which was about 2-3 months ago..I shave in between because I hate feeling prickly hair but I applied both after either process and I have noticed alot of improvement! After 2 days of not shaving my hair that does grow back is much less course and for me..2 days of not shaving is a miracle! I&#x27;m continuing to use this product the price is a bit high but for me it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought the product, and I will say it works.  You have to be persistent, but it does its job.</li>
    <li> Wanted more of a face cleaner. This is a hair removal or it slows down the growth. The smell is funny (You will know when you use it) and you wont notice it until you rub it in. And I was rubbing it on my face.</li>
    <li> Well I just started using this product like 3 weeks ago... and it&#x27;s working!!!! I&#x27;m an African American woman with you know what!!! The hair grows back slower and thinner!!! I already ordered three more bottles... Just apply as the instructions say and you&#x27;re good to go!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it works, it will take a while to know.  I will keep using it and get back with you.</li>
    <li> Awesome. It really does work be patient and try to either pluck or wax hairs. Im using this along with my flash n go between my at home treatments and it works great!</li>
