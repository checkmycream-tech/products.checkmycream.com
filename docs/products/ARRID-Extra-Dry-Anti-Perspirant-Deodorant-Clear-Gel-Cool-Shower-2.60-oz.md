<li> IVE BEEN USING THERE ULTRA FRESH SCENT CLEAR GEL IN THE MEAN WHILE</li>
<li> AND A HALF NO STORES IN THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS INCLUDING SUBURBS CARRIES THIS.</li>
<li> This gel type does not last as long as the traditional deodorant stick.  </li>
<li> so I  am afraid to try it while doing more extensive physical activities.</li>
<li> I have used this foe a long time.</li>
<li> I do feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but again I have not really tested this out while working out or anything because it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>
<li> After a few months of using it, however, I have apparently become immune to it and will lose the sweat protection that I used to get all day with it.</li>
<li> This may be for you if you like a wet gel type deodorant.  </li>
<li> After an un-successful search for this item at the local stores- and being told&lt;br /&gt;the item was not available for sale.  </li>
<li> NONE OF THERE OTHER SCENTS WORK</li>
<li> My hubby uses it and swears by it, even over all the other &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; brands and deodorants that are out there.</li>
<li> Thus, if you want the product to last, I recommend depositing the liquid slowly by myopically turning the &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> AND A HALF</li>
<li> It is not available in my area.</li>
<li> This is just while I am doing very little activity at all</li>
<li> I usually use a spray</li>
<li> Again, what works for one person doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you.</li>
<li> We don&#x27;t want to settle for less !!!!</li>

    <li> This is the only deodorant my boyfriend wears and we can&#x27;t find it anywhere but here! Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> After an un-successful search for this item at the local stores- and being told&lt;br /&gt;the item was not available for sale.  So I cane home and went on line and-low and&lt;br /&gt;behold there it is.  So I purchased three. I also know where I can buy more.  So I&lt;br /&gt;thank you so very much for being there when I needed you.&lt;br /&gt;You can determine a title -thanks  LuLu</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and love it! Couldn&#x27;t find it in this scent in the stores so I got it here.</li>
    <li> I have used this foe a long time. It&#x27;s the only one I can use. The others break me out. I was so excited that yall had it and cheaper than I was paying at Walmart. Thanks again</li>
    <li> This may be for you if you like a wet gel type deodorant.  If you are used to the traditional sticks like me then this may take some to get used to.  This gel type does not last as long as the traditional deodorant stick.  It does smell nice. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I am happy with the cost of it  Thank you for carrying this product that I like to use</li>
    <li> The container can provide too much &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; given its design. Thus, if you want the product to last, I recommend depositing the liquid slowly by myopically turning the &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> For the price, this deodorant is amazing. It goes on clear, smells great and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. After a few months of using it, however, I have apparently become immune to it and will lose the sweat protection that I used to get all day with it. That is my own fault though and doesn&#x27;t reflect on the product itself it&#x27;s just for people who don&#x27;t have a severe problem with sweating. My hubby uses it and swears by it, even over all the other &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; brands and deodorants that are out there. We stocked up on a few of these since they are an Add-On item and, for the price, it was an absolute steal.</li>
    <li> Relied on reviews for this purchase.  They were right; this is a very good product.  I will purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I really like Arrid because it works and has a pleasant aroma. Ilike the gel best because it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue&lt;br /&gt;on my clothes. Try it and I think you will agree.:-)</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. This is my favorite deodorant. It is not available in my area. Amazon comes through again! Received product on time and as always and in great condition!</li>
    <li> WOW IT LOOKS LIKE NO 1 CAN FIND COOL SHOWER CLEAR GEL ARRID ANY MORE...IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS IN ALL THE STORES FOR A YEAR AND A HALF NO STORES IN THE WHOLE CITY OF DALLAS INCLUDING SUBURBS CARRIES THIS. IVE BEEN USING THERE ULTRA FRESH SCENT CLEAR GEL IN THE MEAN WHILE WHICH SEEMS TO BE ALOT MORE WATTERED DOWN AND DOES NOT KEEP SWEAT AWAY. NONE OF THERE OTHER SCENTS WORK AS GOOD AND SMELL AS GOOD AS THIS COOL SHOWER SCENT PLUS ITS IN A CLEAR GEL WHICH I PREFER OVER SPRAYS OR WHITE ROLL ONS TO AVOID STAINING CLOTHES. THIS IS GREAT I GOT 12 AT 2.25 EACH WITH FREE SHIPPING SINCE MY ORDER WAS OVER 25 BUXX.. NOW I HAVE ENOUGH OF THIS TO LAST ME FOR A YEAR OR A YEAR AND A HALF..... SO I WILL BE BACK TO ORDER SOME MORE IN 2 YEARS....LOL THANKS AMAZON</li>
    <li> Nice, compact size, perfect for travel.  I usually use a spray but this is more appropriate for travel and offers good protection.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these at stores any more. Great deal.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me, I am hot natured and all the others do not work.  Also the local stores and pharmacies have quit carrying this gel type with Arrid and so am very glad to find on Amazon and price is great.</li>
    <li> I love it. Had to start ordering online cause they stopped selling in store. I recommend</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product because of the positive reviews I read while researching for a working deodorant. For me personally this deodorant doesn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry. The scent isn&#x27;t very pleasing but more of a men&#x27;s cologne aroma which wears off to just arm pit stench after a few hours. This is just while I am doing very little activity at all so I  am afraid to try it while doing more extensive physical activities. I do feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but again I have not really tested this out while working out or anything because it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me. I actually feel like other deodorants I have tried but thought weren&#x27;t great blow this brand out of the water. Again, what works for one person doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal!!! I loved the scent and wetness protection, my clothes don&#x27;t. Stain or burn just a bit will do ya</li>
    <li> Why stores are not carrying it I don&#x27;t know, but it is my favorite. I buy 3 at a time just so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> This is the only deorant for us that works!!!!!  We don&#x27;t want to settle for less !!!! We CAN&#x27;T FIND IT IN ANY STORES AROUND !!! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLEASEEEEEE !!!!</li>
