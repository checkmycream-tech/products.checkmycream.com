      <li>I don&#x27;t even own the thing and thank god</li>
      <li>and I liked it.  </li>
      <li>the wig looks nice but the wig cap shows through sometimes.</li>
      <li>I liked the bangs, but I just wanted to let anyone who wanted to know about the bang.</li>
      <li>She said that is perfect for what she wants to do.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to comb-if you know how to comb hair correctly.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to restyle bangs to suit!</li>
      <li>Great price, quick ship, accurate portrayal of product.</li>
      <li>Overall very happy with it!</li>
      <li>The wig is honestly okay</li>
      <li>Has a nice band inside the wig to help secure it to your head.</li>
      <li>This wig was full and this has to be one of my favorite wigs!</li>
      <li>is that it tangles easily (which can be helped with detangler).</li>
      <li>It has a pretty nice colour, came out sort of purplish for me, but it was still silver.</li>
      <li>This wig is cheap.</li>
      <li>Love, love this high quality wig.</li>
      <li>Great if you wanted a grey ish silver wig that tangles.</li>
      <li>Gets tangled easy and color was more grey than silver in my opinion, but still decent quality, ok color, good fit, arrived on time, and decent price.</li>
      <li>The only thing good about this thing was it shipped in six days.</li>
      <li>It takes patience to comb it out but it frays the fibers a bit and leaves it with a more frizzy look than straight.  </li>
      <li>It is 100% true to color.  </li>
      <li>and I think its so pretty!</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the right wig.</li>
      <li>wig is high quality, soft, and as advertised, i reccommend buying from this seller :)</li>
      <li>And that would maybe be ok if there was enough hair on it to put it in some braid or something</li>
      <li>My daughter thought the wig was exactly as shown.  </li>
      <li>Reallllllyyyyyy long wig, but looks great as long as you brush!</li>
      <li>It tangles easy, falls out, obviously made out of Dollar Store type- wig strands.</li>
      <li>If you want a nice wig, buy a more expensive one.</li>
      <li>I understand mix ups happen, but I was very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Love this wig, carefully packaged</li>
      <li>so the thinness doesn&#x27;t show through too much.</li>
      <li>Purchased this wig around summer time, it was better than expected!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have the tangling problem that I read on many of the other reviews.  </li>
      <li>Though sometimes it gets tangled easily but it&#x27;s not like I can&#x27;t brush it out, it&#x27;s expected from a long wig that it&#x27;d get tangled easily</li>
      <li>Was not thick enough and tangles far to easily.</li>
      <li>I could have gotten something better at party city for half the amount</li>
      <li>which was SUPER appreciated as the cosplay I have in mind requires me to have long bangs.</li>
      <li>Actually if you want to wear some hair in the back and some in the front you cant because you&#x27;ll be able to see the tracks of the hair wefts that were far apart and un even!</li>
      <li>Also, it is more grey than white.</li>
      <li>I cut it short and will wear it ocasionally for fun</li>
      <li>I had to buy a new wig after a day of wearing it because it got way too tangled.</li>
      <li>It tangles very easily and is hard to untangle.</li>
      <li>I got this for my Rosario + Vampire Inner Moka vampire cosplay, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It is not realistic enough to wear every day and it tangles so easily.  </li>
      <li>This wig is super long, feels nice and is very thick (for the price, especially).</li>
      <li>i had a black wig and within a week of when i wore it it got super tangled.</li>
      <li>the wig tangles very fast, so do other products from mapofbeauty.</li>
      <li>Even though the wig is very inexpensive, I would not recommend this wig to anyone with a larger head or long hair.</li>
      <li>The top of the wig is rather thin but for what I use it for it doesn&#x27;t bother me because you can buy headpieces to accent it</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this wig, however it did not live up to those hopes.</li>
      <li>It tangles so easily, and being the one who had to fix it, its pretty much impossible.</li>

<li> It tangles so easily, and being the one who had to fix it, its pretty much impossible.</li>
<li> It was very thin -- you could see the weaving at the top and etc -- and you could tie it in a ponytail and see through all the hair.</li>
<li> The bangs actually turned out to be fairly long</li>
<li> Initially, I had thought that the wig was suppose to be 65cm long, so seeing it longer was quite the shock.</li>
<li> rather it be too long and need to cut than it be too short.</li>
<li> Also, for future buyers, wigs like these come unstyled, meaning the bangs are very long.</li>
<li> A little difficult to manage but overall not terrible.</li>
<li> Long straight synthetic wigs just arent managable and this one is so thin is gross</li>
<li> Would definitely order this in other colors.</li>
<li> I like the length and the only other thing</li>
<li> I mean I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high quality wig</li>
<li> I had to clip back the bangs and may end up cutting them, but I much prefer that over them potentially being too short.</li>
<li> Fortunately enough, the reason I didn&#x27;t give this less stars is because I was braiding the wig anyways, and found ways to cover up the \\&quot;bald spots\\&quot; on the cap while braiding it.</li>
<li> Like other reviews stated, this is REALLY long</li>
<li> Very silky and Thick!</li>
<li> Its thin at certain places and the cap might show through.</li>
<li> They literally sent me an empty package with no explanations or anything in it.</li>
<li> I bought this wig MONTHS ago and today my mail carrier showed up and handed me an empty package.</li>
<li> I cut about 3 inches off the ends due to how frizzed the ends became.  </li>
<li> Extremely unimpressed.</li>
<li> The hair does tend to tangle easily due to the length.</li>
<li> I have to admit, I&#x27;ve bought quite a few wigs on Amazon, and this one disappointed me the most.</li>
<li> They are long, almost down past my chin.</li>
<li> So now I have no wig, they charged my card, and I have to explain to a little girl why she still doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; wig that she was supposed to get 2 MONTHS ago.</li>
<li> Its much thinner and the bangs are not nearly as well kept or neat. :(</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t cause it&#x27;s a waste of his money.</li>
<li> Also is rather heavy.</li>
<li> Mine is extremely, EXTREMELY thin, and she will not last a day.</li>
<li> The wig itself is a pain to try and put on because the part that holds it on is too small.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t the same type or style of wig that is in the picture and the thing sheds like a sick animal.</li>
<li> SERIOUS RIP-OFF.  </li>
<li> This is a rip-off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thin, everything shows, it came really purple, and just very very bad quality.</li>
<li> Not impressed at all!</li>
<li> So just be warned: it&#x27;s very thin.</li>
<li> * if you buy this and want to post a bad review beware the company sends you like three emails a day wanting you to remove it.</li>
<li> Do NOT buy this wig, you will immediately hate it.</li>

    <li> Gets tangled easy and color was more grey than silver in my opinion, but still decent quality, ok color, good fit, arrived on time, and decent price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig. I haven&#x27;t worn it too often though since it&#x27;s a lot of hair but everytime I do I get tons of compliments! I would recommend anyone to buy this.</li>
    <li> This wig is super long, feels nice and is very thick (for the price, especially). I had to clip back the bangs and may end up cutting them, but I much prefer that over them potentially being too short. And yes, it does tangle. You will have to buy some detangler spray and a wide-toothed comb to keep it under control.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to manage but overall not terrible.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Rosario + Vampire Inner Moka vampire cosplay, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Love this wig, carefully packaged and I think its so pretty!</li>
    <li> The only thing good about this thing was it shipped in six days. That&#x27;s it. It wasn&#x27;t the same type or style of wig that is in the picture and the thing sheds like a sick animal. You can see the wig cap just by looking at it in the box. It tangles easy, falls out, obviously made out of Dollar Store type- wig strands. I wouldn&#x27;t let my pet wear this. SERIOUS RIP-OFF.  2 dollar wig sold for 20$? Yeah. This is a rip-off.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting.  The wig was stringy &amp; falling apart. I could have gotten something better at party city for half the amount</li>
    <li> Purchased this wig around summer time, it was better than expected! Very easy to comb-if you know how to comb hair correctly. Very silky and Thick! Works very nicely for Sophie Hatter cosplay. Color is perfect (as depicted in item picture.) and it&#x27;s easy to restyle bangs to suit! Overall very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Was not thick enough and tangles far to easily. The wig itself is a pain to try and put on because the part that holds it on is too small. Even though the wig is very inexpensive, I would not recommend this wig to anyone with a larger head or long hair.</li>
    <li> I read a ton of reviews before i bought it and just hoped it wouldn&#x27;t be a disaster. the second this wig touches itself it tangles no amount of combing and detangler will fix it. And that would maybe be ok if there was enough hair on it to put it in some braid or something but there isn&#x27;t. Actually if you want to wear some hair in the back and some in the front you cant because you&#x27;ll be able to see the tracks of the hair wefts that were far apart and un even! I mean I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high quality wig but this is trash I cut it short and will wear it ocasionally for fun but i wish i didnt buy it. Long straight synthetic wigs just arent managable and this one is so thin is gross</li>
    <li> My daughter thought the wig was exactly as shown.  Great price, quick ship, accurate portrayal of product. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this wig, however it did not live up to those hopes. The one plus I have is that it got to my house in around three days! I opened the package and tried it one, instant tangles. I tried to brush them out but that led to shedding. I tried to put some detangler on it and it didn&#x27;t help. Also, just a warning... the bangs do not look like they do in the picture. They are long, almost down past my chin. I liked the bangs, but I just wanted to let anyone who wanted to know about the bang.</li>
    <li> This wig was perfect for my purpose which was as a halloween costume.  It was actually very nice quality and I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews stated, this is REALLY long but I&#x27;d rather it be too long and need to cut than it be too short. I didn&#x27;t have the tangling problem that I read on many of the other reviews.  Was a great investment for the price. I will definitely get several uses out of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig a while ago and use it only for photos.  It is not realistic enough to wear every day and it tangles so easily.  It takes patience to comb it out but it frays the fibers a bit and leaves it with a more frizzy look than straight.  I cut about 3 inches off the ends due to how frizzed the ends became.  The bangs are not styled the way the picture depicts.  I cut the bangs eyebrow length fringe style.  It is 100% true to color.  It is quite shiny.  The top of the wig is rather thin but for what I use it for it doesn&#x27;t bother me because you can buy headpieces to accent it so the thinness doesn&#x27;t show through too much.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;ve bought quite a few wigs on Amazon, and this one disappointed me the most. It was very thin -- you could see the weaving at the top and etc -- and you could tie it in a ponytail and see through all the hair. Fortunately enough, the reason I didn&#x27;t give this less stars is because I was braiding the wig anyways, and found ways to cover up the \\&quot;bald spots\\&quot; on the cap while braiding it. So just be warned: it&#x27;s very thin. It has a pretty nice colour, came out sort of purplish for me, but it was still silver. I like the length and the only other thing is that it tangles easily (which can be helped with detangler).</li>
    <li> Reallllllyyyyyy long wig, but looks great as long as you brush!</li>
    <li> The wig is honestly okay it&#x27;s not the best quality and it ended up knotting up a lot when I layered it with another wig lmao.</li>
    <li> This wig is cheap. If you want a nice wig, buy a more expensive one. That being said, its wearable. It tangles very easily and is hard to untangle. Its thin at certain places and the cap might show through. Also, it is more grey than white. Also, for future buyers, wigs like these come unstyled, meaning the bangs are very long. This allows the buyer to style them in whichever way they need to. I bought this wig for a cosplay. I had to buy a new wig after a day of wearing it because it got way too tangled. It might be good for a one night event like a halloween party or something like that.</li>
    <li> Great if you wanted a grey ish silver wig that tangles. **** if you buy this and want to post a bad review beware the company sends you like three emails a day wanting you to remove it.</li>
    <li> My friend bought this wig for a cosplay, and ended up braiding it. When he went to go take it out, it was literally a nightmare. It tangles so easily, and being the one who had to fix it, its pretty much impossible. It&#x27;s all straight now, but so much hair came out, and it&#x27;s honestly the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever seen, and I fix a damn lot of wigs. It&#x27;s very thin, everything shows, it came really purple, and just very very bad quality. Do NOT buy this wig, you will immediately hate it. I don&#x27;t even own the thing and thank god I don&#x27;t cause it&#x27;s a waste of his money.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig MONTHS ago and today my mail carrier showed up and handed me an empty package. They literally sent me an empty package with no explanations or anything in it. So now I have no wig, they charged my card, and I have to explain to a little girl why she still doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; wig that she was supposed to get 2 MONTHS ago. Not impressed at all!</li>
    <li> I did NOT get the wig shown here. Mine is extremely, EXTREMELY thin, and she will not last a day. Shes shorter, thinner than the picture and came with none of that packaging. Extremely unimpressed.</li>
    <li> Go this for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume.  She said that is perfect for what she wants to do.  Great cost too.</li>
    <li> Initially, I had thought that the wig was suppose to be 65cm long, so seeing it longer was quite the shock. The bangs actually turned out to be fairly long which was SUPER appreciated as the cosplay I have in mind requires me to have long bangs. This wig was full and this has to be one of my favorite wigs!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. the wig looks nice but the wig cap shows through sometimes.</li>
    <li> Though sometimes it gets tangled easily but it&#x27;s not like I can&#x27;t brush it out, it&#x27;s expected from a long wig that it&#x27;d get tangled easily</li>
    <li> Used this for a cosplay and I liked it.  I had to cut the bangs to what I wanted, but it worked.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right wig. It was supposed to be white but the one I got was blonde. I understand mix ups happen, but I was very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> the wig tangles very fast, so do other products from mapofbeauty. i had a black wig and within a week of when i wore it it got super tangled. now when i wear it my friends make remarks about how messed up it is.</li>
    <li> Love, love this high quality wig. The hair does tend to tangle easily due to the length. Also is rather heavy. I clipped back part of the bangs to style it the way I wanted. Has a nice band inside the wig to help secure it to your head. Would definitely order this in other colors.</li>
    <li> the photo is quiet deceiving as to how the wig actually falls. Its much thinner and the bangs are not nearly as well kept or neat. :(</li>
    <li> wig is high quality, soft, and as advertised, i reccommend buying from this seller :)</li>
