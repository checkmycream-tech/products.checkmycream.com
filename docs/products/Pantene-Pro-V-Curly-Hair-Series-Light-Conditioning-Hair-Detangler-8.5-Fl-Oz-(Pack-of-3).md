      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and gets the job done</li>
      <li>/&gt;-may not be effective on intended hair type</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells awesome, and moisturizs really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, it has a really nice scent to it</li>
      <li>Nice aroma too.  </li>
      <li>Reading all the great reviews I was excited to try this.</li>
      <li>Even if I wash my hair before bed and spray it a bit in the morning, still very easy to detangle.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Very light and makes my curly hair manageable .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different detanglers and this one is the best for the money.  </li>
      <li>I  love it</li>
      <li>They love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it.</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t have curly hair (more wavy than truly curley)</li>
      <li>Now I make sure we have some on hand.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be without this as it leaves my hair so much more manageable, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a better detangler at any price point.</li>
      <li>This product is great if you have curly hair because it&#x27;s much lighter than the original.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
      <li>This seems to work decently well and has lasted a good while.</li>
      <li>to fine textured curly hair.</li>
      <li>I use it on my 4-year-old daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-pumps out in fine mist</li>
      <li>After purchasing the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Light conditioning detangler, she doesn&#x27;t cry anymore</li>
      <li>This spray in detangler is light.</li>
      <li>Lightly scented fragrance which doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>Good that it was completely sealed in plastic but lost some of the conditioner.</li>
      <li>More Tears\\&quot; detangler but has better moisturizing properties so tangles in my shoulder length hair are much easier to remove.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and clean.</li>
      <li>But this one is special because it&#x27;s specifically for my hair type.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite kind of detangler and our local stores rarely have it in stock.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a true detangler, try 10 Minute Miracle.</li>
      <li>I love this product, particularly when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
      <li>Thanks Pantene!!</li>
      <li>I am finally able to grow my hair very long without the problem of having it get so tangled that I need to cut it shorter to be able to comb it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d order this again if Marrakesh Detangler wasn&#x27;t available for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I love this product it does exactly what is says it detangles my hair after I get out of the shower but is light and does not interfere with my other products.</li>
      <li>Not only does it help detangle the hair but it leaves it in much better shape than it started, it looks so pretty.</li>
      <li>The only product that works better is the Nexxus detangler</li>
      <li>Just ordered 6 more for the next year!</li>
      <li>So it works pretty good for detangling, like it should, but I&#x27;ll probably keep looking for something better to tame my massively curly hair.</li>
      <li>It does the job on my kids hair, but its not as good as J&amp;J No More Tangles.</li>
      <li>I also like that this leaves my hair nicely conditioned without making it greasy or weighed down.</li>
      <li>I used to use the Tresemme Heat Tamer spray but this stuff works so much better on my long extra fine wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>It lingers for a long time and has a fresh, clean scent.     </li>
      <li>I really hope Pantene sticks with this one.</li>
      <li>and this works really well for her hair.</li>
      <li>I use this detangler everymorning, and it really helps me comb my hair.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that I don&#x27;t have that much hair and that it is straight, so</li>
      <li>Extremely fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I originally bought it for a friend who lives in France and can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
      <li>this detangler works better for me than others I&#x27;ve tried, including the other varieties of Pantene detanglers.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s my fault since it&#x27;s more for other hair types.</li>
      <li>I originally bought one of these at a local department store.</li>
      <li>The price on this is also extremely reasonable (especially when a coupon is available), and I&#x27;ve purchased this for around $2/bottle with Amazon coupon offers.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoy just putting it on after I blow dry or do my hair.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s decent for the price.</li>
      <li>I am in love with the Pantene detangler for curly hair (green bottle).  </li>
      <li>I am going to buy a few more soon.</li>
      <li>I simply towel dry my hair and spray it with this product, scrunch it and massage it throughout my hair from top; to bottom and run a comb through it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize that this was more for people that had curly hair, but as an Asian female with straight, long hair, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>It is light and makes it easier to work out the knots, but when it dries and I don&#x27;t put any other product in my hair, it frizzes out.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try out a new one and lo and behold</li>
      <li>No, it is not a gel, serum or mousse, so it doesn&#x27;t completely define or calm frizzy hair, but it definitely helps.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find it in stores, so I&#x27;ve ordered this item in 3 packs through Amazon many times.</li>
      <li>the plus side it does have that typical Pantene clean scent.</li>
      <li>so when I ran out of my old detangler</li>
      <li>My 10yr old granddaugther loves it.</li>
      <li>I even gave a bottle to my Daughter in law for her to use for herself as well as her two young daughters.</li>
      <li>As far as moisture goes, I didn&#x27;t see any differences and my hair still gets tangled at the ends</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product in that it helps condition my hair and gives the waviness to it some &#x27;bounce&#x27;, without leaving it feeling crunchy (like some other &#x27;curl enhancing&#x27; products) or weighing it down.</li>
      <li>My daughter has long, fine, straight hair which tangles easily, in a dull bird-nest style.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Makes my hair look greatr with no other products added.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair soft and shiny and I can actually run my fingers through my hair.</li>
      <li>However, I used this product mainly as a detangler spraying it on wet/damp hair and then going through it with a wide toothed comb.</li>
      <li>I just let my hair dry naturally and with this spray, my curls are softer and my hair stay shiny all day.  </li>
      <li>A little bit about my hair, I don&#x27;t have that much and</li>

<li> This product does not detangle hair and is a complete waste of money.</li>
<li> I have color treated hair, and due to some damage from past bleaching my hair can become very matted when wet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff! It helps me be lazy with my hair just by pumping up my curly tousled look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the most difficult time in the past finding leave-in conditioners to work with my curly hair. I don&#x27;t like using serums because they involve combing my hair with my fingers to saturate each strand, leaving it stringy and flat once it dries. Detangling sprays are the way to go. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brands in the past, and really you can&#x27;t go wrong with many of them. But this one is special because it&#x27;s specifically for my hair type. My hair has never looked so curly before. I wash my hair, spray the detangler lightly (too heavy and your hair will look greasy within a few hours), distribute it with my fingers, and leave it to dry. It turns out perfect every time. Without it my hair is just a frizzy mess.    The second ingredient is a silicone called amodimethicone. I&#x27;ve heard some bad things about silicones, but I think people are just paranoid about cheap hair ingredients. I don&#x27;t notice any excessive drying or build-up in my hair, so I&#x27;m not worried about it.    The smell is awesome, too. It lingers for a long time and has a fresh, clean scent.     I really hope Pantene sticks with this one.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair (a perm), it always looks frizzy after it dries, so I spray this on while it is still wet, and let it dry (no hair dryer), I don&#x27;t brush or comb it out either.  It has a nice look, no fly-aways or frizz all day (unless it is windy!).</li>
    <li> This is always my go to leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It smells awesome, and moisturizs really well.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
    <li> This product does not detangle hair and is a complete waste of money. If you are looking for a true detangler, try 10 Minute Miracle. I have Phyllis Diller hair and that&#x27;s the only product on the market today that actually works. It&#x27;s pricey and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite kind of detangler and our local stores rarely have it in stock.  So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed they discontinued this item</li>
    <li> It made my hair feel plasticky when applied, and harder to deal with. I have thick hair with thin strands. Didn&#x27;t make the tangles easier to get out.</li>
    <li> I love this product, particularly when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I originally bought it for a friend who lives in France and can&#x27;t find it locally. I gave her 2 bottles and kept 1 for myself. She has a tangled mane of hair and this is the only product that works for her. It reminds me of the \\&quot;No More Tears\\&quot; detangler but has better moisturizing properties so tangles in my shoulder length hair are much easier to remove. Lightly scented fragrance which doesn&#x27;t linger. In my experience it has never left an oily residue and doesn&#x27;t flake like some leave-in conditioners. Convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> It keeps your hair from tangles.  I couldn&#x27;t get it the last time tried to order it.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair, and due to some damage from past bleaching my hair can become very matted when wet. Although I don&#x27;t have curly hair (more wavy than truly curley) this detangler works better for me than others I&#x27;ve tried, including the other varieties of Pantene detanglers. I also like that this leaves my hair nicely conditioned without making it greasy or weighed down. It&#x27;s hard to find it in stores, so I&#x27;ve ordered this item in 3 packs through Amazon many times. The price on this is also extremely reasonable (especially when a coupon is available), and I&#x27;ve purchased this for around $2/bottle with Amazon coupon offers.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without this as it leaves my hair so much more manageable, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a better detangler at any price point.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the Pantene detangler for curly hair (green bottle).  I couldn&#x27;t find that at a S&amp;S price, so tried this instead.  It works as well as other, cheaper detanglers, but not as well as the curly haired version.  I use it on my 4-year-old daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different detanglers and this one is the best for the money.  Although this is labeled for curly hair, my daugher has very thick straight hair and this works really well for her hair. We use it every day.  The only product that works better is the Nexxus detangler but that is too expensive for every day use.</li>
    <li> This item is great for the fly aways.  Nice aroma too.  I am going to buy a few more soon.</li>
    <li> went walmart hopping one night to find this product, after several visits, decided to order online.  can order in a 3-pack, daughter is extremely happy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that this was more for people that had curly hair, but as an Asian female with straight, long hair, it doesn&#x27;t do much. I decided to give it a try when it went on sale because EVERY TIME I was done showering, my hair would have this lumpy knot in the same place on the left side of my hair. It was truly annoying, but the product did not work for me. I guess it&#x27;s my fault since it&#x27;s more for other hair types. However, it has a really nice scent to it and I enjoy just putting it on after I blow dry or do my hair.</li>
    <li> It does the job on my kids hair, but its not as good as J&amp;J No More Tangles.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have curly hair because it&#x27;s much lighter than the original. For some reason, you can&#x27;t find this one in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Reading all the great reviews I was excited to try this. Each time it my hair with an odd feeling. Almost like this was a texture adding product. Now I have 3 bottles and I can&#x27;t seem to give this stuff away.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side it does have that typical Pantene clean scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product in that it helps condition my hair and gives the waviness to it some &#x27;bounce&#x27;, without leaving it feeling crunchy (like some other &#x27;curl enhancing&#x27; products) or weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously curly hair and every detangler I have tried is either expensive as hell or does not help get the tangles out at all. This seems to work decently well and has lasted a good while. It is light and makes it easier to work out the knots, but when it dries and I don&#x27;t put any other product in my hair, it frizzes out. So it works pretty good for detangling, like it should, but I&#x27;ll probably keep looking for something better to tame my massively curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick, curly hair. I use this detangler everymorning, and it really helps me comb my hair. If you have long, thick, curly hair, then this detangler is for you!</li>
    <li> I used to use the Tresemme Heat Tamer spray but this stuff works so much better on my long extra fine wavy hair.  I just let my hair dry naturally and with this spray, my curls are softer and my hair stay shiny all day.  Less breakage on my hair too.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver for my little red heaed beauty. She has very dry curly long red hair and cried every time i brushed her hair or combed it. After purchasing the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Light conditioning detangler, she doesn&#x27;t cry anymore and it keeps her hair from being frizzy. It&#x27;s a great welcomed product. Thanks Pantene!!</li>
    <li> I love this product it does exactly what is says it detangles my hair after I get out of the shower but is light and does not interfere with my other products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just ordered 6 more for the next year! Makes my hair look greatr with no other products added. Extremely fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Very light and makes my curly hair manageable . It leaves hair soft and shiny and I can actually run my fingers through my hair.</li>
    <li> I originally bought one of these at a local department store. After I ran out, I was happy to see this three pack on Amazon. Good savings. I can now use it liberally without worrying about running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have medium to fine textured curly hair. This spray in detangler is light. The smell is a little odd, but not unpleasant. I spray it in every time after I shower, whether I mousse my hair after or not. It makes combing through my hair a breeze, and it also limits the frizz a bit. No, it is not a gel, serum or mousse, so it doesn&#x27;t completely define or calm frizzy hair, but it definitely helps. If you don&#x27;t always want to be putting a ton of product in or if you have trouble brushing your hair after showering, try this (maybe in a single bottle first). If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll end up wanting the 3-pack eventually.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and it&#x27;s decent for the price. A little bit about my hair, I don&#x27;t have that much and what I do have is very thin and straight. Despite all of this, I constantly find my hair in crazy tangles so when I ran out of my old detangler I thought I&#x27;d try out a new one and lo and behold I found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that this product is meant as a leave in conditioner. As far as moisture goes, I didn&#x27;t see any differences and my hair still gets tangled at the ends and I see no changes to the texture. However, I used this product mainly as a detangler spraying it on wet/damp hair and then going through it with a wide toothed comb. It smells amazing and gets the job done however I realized I needed A LOT of pumps to get my hair untangled. Keep in mind that I don&#x27;t have that much hair and that it is straight, so I don&#x27;t know how helpful this product will be if you have thick curly hair (which is what the product is actually meant for).The good news is that each bottle comes with 8.5 oz and this is a three pack deal so it&#x27;s definitely a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;-pumps out in fine mist&lt;br /&gt;-gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;-cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-requires a lot of pumps per use&lt;br /&gt;-may not be effective on intended hair type</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, fine, straight hair which tangles easily, in a dull bird-nest style.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes it sleek, silky and shiny: at camp all the girls in her cabin tried it, and convinced their parents to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it is great regardless if your hair is curly or not.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find in stores, so Thank You Amazon for the 3-pack!</li>
    <li> My curly hair series dies detangle which makes styling easier the extra conditioning protects my locks from heat damage and knots. The scent is light and clean. I like using this product on wet, damp and dry stages.</li>
    <li> Have ordered before, would order again. Only 1 issue, one of the bottles leaked. Good that it was completely sealed in plastic but lost some of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t had much luck in the past with detangler for my kids.  My oldest has thick hair that tangles almost as soon as you finish brushing it and brushing is no fun .  I picked this up because it was on sale and needed something to try.  Now I make sure we have some on hand.  Not only does it help detangle the hair but it leaves it in much better shape than it started, it looks so pretty.</li>
    <li> I have searched  for years for a detangler ,for myself and granddaughters .I found several that range from 10.00 dollars too 25.00 dollars a bottle,just when i was about too give up and simply cut my wavy waist length hair I decided too look on amazon and found this product.Since it was less than 15.00dollars for a 3pack I never dreamed that this product would solve my problems,it was such a bargin!!!  My 10yr old granddaugther loves it.I  love it and I hope pantene don&#x27;t realize the value of this detangler lol!!</li>
    <li> This came as a set of 4.  I had no problem with 3 of them, but one of them, the pump didn&#x27;t work.  Solution: Take a pump that worked and place it in the bottle that didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;d order this again if Marrakesh Detangler wasn&#x27;t available for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I had stopped trying to find products in my price range to detangle my hair after shampooing as nothing I found seemed to work the way I needed it to. This product does exactly what it says and it smells great. I simply towel dry my hair and spray it with this product, scrunch it and massage it throughout my hair from top; to bottom and run a comb through it. I am not losing half the hair I do with other products that promise the same results. I am finally able to grow my hair very long without the problem of having it get so tangled that I need to cut it shorter to be able to comb it. Even if I wash my hair before bed and spray it a bit in the morning, still very easy to detangle. I recommend this to anyone who has problems with tangling hair. I even gave a bottle to my Daughter in law for her to use for herself as well as her two young daughters. They love it.</li>
    <li> this is a very good hair detangler, doesnt have a strong smell, which is nice and it does the work!</li>
