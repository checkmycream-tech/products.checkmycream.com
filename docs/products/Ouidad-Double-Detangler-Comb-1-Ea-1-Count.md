      <li>I just love this Detangler comb.</li>
      <li>Happy with my order fast shipping</li>
      <li>I find this comb works just as perfectly on my bob as it did on my long hair.</li>
      <li>Worth it!!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s best on combing wet or damp hair.</li>
      <li>This comb is great for natural hair.  </li>
      <li>works great on my curly natural hair.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect detangler and the product was delivered timely and as expected!</li>
      <li>I think that all of these features contribute to its being easy to use and maneuver.</li>
      <li>The comb gathers the excess product on the groove between the teeth, and afterwards the product is easily rinsed off the comb.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair and this comb separates and and allows my ringlets to shine.  </li>
      <li>that suits me just fine.</li>
      <li>This comb was worth every penny and more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally purchased it.</li>
      <li>so this is better and worth the money.</li>
      <li>her hair has never been so smooth and tangle free.  </li>
      <li>I makes detangling a breeze and it is easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>melt/bend, I highly recommend light but more durable carbon combs!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>It was worth every penny!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, the product was packaged adequately, did arrive on time.</li>
      <li>It also arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This comb worked so well in my daughters hair so much better than a normal comb.</li>
      <li>only good thing about the Ouidad Double Detangler is that it is a great hammer alternative for some household needs when a toolbox is too far from reach.</li>
      <li>Secondly, I was able to remove all of the knotted mats she had accumulated in her hair in about an hour (probably would have been faster if she would have sat still!)</li>
      <li>Really gets rid of knots!!</li>
      <li>So unless you really have huge unruly hair, you wouldn&#x27;t need this.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth the money.</li>
      <li>After 6 months of use I noticed I was loosing more hair in my detangling sessions that I used to with my old comb.  </li>
      <li>I must say that it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>and it is so worth</li>
      <li>It is completely worth every cent I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t snag or tear ends, tear free and super high quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the other ouidad hair products.</li>
      <li>Used it right away</li>
      <li>This is a very large comb.  </li>
      <li>and I have curly/coily-kinky type, fine textured natural hair.</li>
      <li>Well in my opinion this comb is just like my first experience with Shea</li>
      <li>This comb does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it was after removing 2 week-old 2-strand twists and spraying her hair with a mixture of water, conditioner, and JBCO.  </li>
      <li>My $2 Jilbere shower comb actually does a better job</li>
      <li>All-in-all not terrible, but definitely not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
      <li>It IS heavy; not so much that you&#x27;re lifting weights, but it IS weighted; I don&#x27;t see why this is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>This was a curious product as it is extremely large and might be suitable for combing your pet lama&#x27;s or any sheep you might have running around your yard.</li>
      <li>This comb is quite heavy, so it&#x27;s not the best for little girl&#x27;s hair, but it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve always needed.  </li>
      <li>1)finger comb - tiny knots/or for just QUICK detangling and then SKIPPING steps 2-4!  </li>
      <li>I comb my hair and it glides threw tangles and really helps with knots.</li>
      <li>This comb works really well.</li>
      <li>I really like the weight of this comb.</li>
      <li>The comb is really two combs stuck together.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this comb very often anymore.</li>
      <li>Do not re-comb whole head of hair at once.  </li>
      <li>Although this item is very pricey for a comb...</li>
      <li>I have very kinky curly type</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the perfect detangler and the product was delivered timely and as expected!</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW:I don&#x27;t use this comb very often anymore. I do find it to be a bit too heavy and turns out that it was pulling out too much of my hair. My $2 Jilbere shower comb actually does a better job and I use a Denman brush when I need to completely detangle my hair before a braidout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:I use this comb to detangle my hair and it gets the job done. This comb is really heavy compared to my other jilbere detangling comb but I use both to get the best results. It&#x27;s pretty expensive but it&#x27;s durable, so I imagine it will last for several years.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite hair tool i would have a wreck of a head without this lovely product. It is an amazing brush and does its job well and you know it will never break. I understand it is very heavy but i mean its not that bad. Its no reason to give a bad review. Just put it this way your getting a good bicep and tricep workout while you are doing a chore that you have to do anyways.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package I was excited for about 5 seconds until I picked it up - it is clunky, heavy as a brick, and coarse-textured.  When despite my misgivings at its handling I tried it on my wavy hair it RIPPED.  To be honest, I have tried Ouidad products before and not once had them meet expectations.  Now I wish I had not gone against that prior experience, as this thing is a complete dud.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just an ok comb, nothing to write home about.  I have very kinky curly type 4a/b hair, this comb is heavy and very big.  It does the job but it&#x27;s hard for me to handle this monster.  I would rather use my denman or other detangler shower comb.</li>
    <li> If you want to buy my comb from me, make me an offer, and I&#x27;ll sell it on Amazon.    ***********************************************************************************************  I bought this comb ~2 years ago.  I used it 1-2 times, and that&#x27;s it.  It IS heavy; not so much that you&#x27;re lifting weights, but it IS weighted; I don&#x27;t see why this is a good thing.  So if you have delicate curls and tiny knots, you can easily break off your curls instead of combing through them with the extra weight; so you have to use extra care with this comb.  And that&#x27;s just it; this comb isn&#x27;t meant for small curls.  Each tooth of the comb is thick, so if you&#x27;re prone to tiny knots, this comb definitely won&#x27;t work through them...unless destruction equates detangling...if the the hair is gone, then you&#x27;re definitely knot-free!  Also, the teeth are not staggered on each side of the comb; they&#x27;re just copied/paralleled. So whatever hair you just combed gets combed again in the same place.  If the teeth were staggered, it would be more effective.  I would only use this comb if my hair was already tangle-free/knot free, there wouldn&#x27;t be a problem with small knots.  But if you have big curls, then maybe the comb will work well for you.  My curls are 3C with some 3B, ~3/8 of an inch in diameter; they make ringlets or ripples depending on the product (or lack of) in my hair.  Especially with small ringlets/tendrils, I need smaller teeth to comb through them.  I used bakelite/bone combs and a Denman brush; the smaller the knot, the smaller the teeth that I use.  In fact, I don&#x27;t see why anyone would even need a tangle-teezer when a denman brush can achieve the same results if you use lighter pressure...but maybe I should try one, a TT that is?    And then, there&#x27;s the old finger combing when my hair is unbearably knotty...in more ways than one!  ;-    \\&quot;Behave hair, beHAVE!\\&quot;  \\&quot;Tame the mane!\\&quot;    But my routine 1x-2x a week is to...  1)finger comb - tiny knots/or for just QUICK detangling and then SKIPPING steps 2-4!  2)bone comb - regular knots  3)denman brush - brush out loose, dead hair; stimulate scalp.  4)regular sized bone comb (wider space between teeth w/ bigger teeth) - comb all hair in the style/direction that I  want it to dry in.  Not all curly hair is created equal...nor are all knots.  So beware with this one.</li>
    <li> This comb works really well. I would recommend it to black women who have decided to go natural. It is a little heavy but it works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb about a year and a half ago and I absolutely love it!  I have personally recommended the comb to all the curly girls around me.  I used to have chunks of my hair coming out due to not having the right tools to handle my hair; now that I use this comb I probably shed the recommended 50-100 hairs a day.</li>
    <li> This is an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; comb, not anything to jump through hoops about!! I thought I would comb through my hair with ease...and I did not. It&#x27;s just an average wide toothed comb. The only difference is you get \\&quot;two\\&quot; combs instead of one. It&#x27;s not heavy, although it looks heavy. All in all....AN OK COMB</li>
    <li> works great on my long thick wavy hair.  i use it in the shower with the conditioner in and it makes my hair so much easier to brush when i get out</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb several weeks ago (not on Amazon).  The comb is no better than a wide tooth comb!  I have 4b hair and I was looking for a good detangling comb...very disappointed.  The comb is a little difficult to handle ( a little heavy) and it didn&#x27;t comb out my hair any better than my trusted wide tooth comb.  Also, i have the Tangle Teezer and i must say this comb is no match for the Tangle Teezer.  So, save your money and try the TT instead.</li>
    <li> I am African American and I have curly/coily-kinky type, fine textured natural hair. I was looking for a method to cut down on the time I normally spent detangling my hair (using my fingers or either a regular wide-tooth comb) that would not cause breakage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this comb from a African American natural hair care website, and decided that I would give it a try. Boy, do I wish I had tried this comb earlier! It has cut down my detangling time significantly. I should note that I still end up using my fingers a teeny bit when I have a deep tangle--but that is to be expected, esp. if you don&#x27;t want breakage. I would definitely recommend this comb to anyone that has curly or kinky hair.</li>
    <li> If you have thick curly hair. This comb is a must. So happy with it !! The double sides help out a ton</li>
    <li> Wonderful comb for  thick afro America hair when wet.</li>
    <li> It is easier to comb out the tangles, and it takes less time.</li>
    <li> This is a huge and heavy comb. So unless you really have huge unruly hair, you wouldn&#x27;t need this. The comb is really two combs stuck together. Its too big for me.</li>
    <li> The rigidity and size of the teeth on this comb seem to cause more breakage than my Denman brush- which I&#x27;ll be sticking with.</li>
    <li> This was a curious product as it is extremely large and might be suitable for combing your pet lama&#x27;s or any sheep you might have running around your yard. I ended up returning it, but it looked quite sturdy -- it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This comb is great for natural hair.  I love it.  I makes detangling a breeze and it is easy to clean.  It is heavy duty. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this comb. I have VERY curly and long hair which is very difficult to get untangled. This comb seems to do the job in about half the time that a regular comb takes. It has a very thick handle that is still comfortable to hold. The teeth are made from a thick, hard plastic, so I can yank and pull without feeling like the comb might break. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for 15 year old daughter. She is to busy with friends and snap chatting, watching you tube, tweeting and instagramming to give an opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive comb (and makeshift hammer) I will have ever bought! My small hands can handle big combs, but this Ouidad doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable to comb or pass through hair. I bought it about 3-4yrs ago, but I&#x27;ve noticed from recent store displays/testers that it hasn&#x27;t changed in size or weight since I first bought it. The double detangler is a commendable effort that drew my curiosity and interest. The size and weight, however, are demoralizing and physically painful. It feels like I&#x27;m running a multi-forked anvil through my scalp and thick hair -- it doesn&#x27;t detangle, it strains my strands!! Oh, and god help you if you accidentally drop this thing while trying to comb your hair -- trust me, you will drop it and you will curse in pain. If you survive -- err, succeed -- in detangling your hair with this comb, you might also succeed in getting a case of carpal tunnel and/or a headache. I know my hair has thicket-like tendencies, but this comb worsens my hair condition as well as my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about the Ouidad Double Detangler is that it is a great hammer alternative for some household needs when a toolbox is too far from reach. Although I now use it to hammer things in place, it&#x27;s still not worth the $25 + tax I wasted (an actual hammer doesn&#x27;t even cost that much). It&#x27;s not worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way I&#x27;m ever going back to raking my hair with this blunt object. I have a very durable and seamless plastic jumbo comb (I bought it when I couldn&#x27;t take the pain anymore) that suits me just fine. But if you regularly go through plastic combs that break/melt/bend, I highly recommend light but more durable carbon combs! I alternate between the aforementioned jumbo plastic comb (for detangling) and my medium carbon comb (for heat-resistant combing). Both combs cost me less than $10 combined!</li>
    <li> In all fairness, the product is as described. I purchased two of these, one for me and one as a gift. Indeed, as others have indicated it is a bit on the heavy side, which is not my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as honestly, I will say that I did not find it to be any &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than any other wide tooth comb that I had utilized in the past, and I have used many. I even divided my hair in two sections and used this one and an old comb to compare the ease of use, between the two and did not see any difference, I&#x27;m sorry to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product was packaged adequately, did arrive on time.</li>
    <li> Although this item is very pricey for a comb...I must say that it is worth every penny. Detangling is now so much easier.</li>
    <li> On wet hair with conditioner, it detangles my very inconsistently curly/spirally locks like a hot knife through butter.  My hair washing time is probably cut in half now and I am pretty sure, I am experiencing less hair loss during detangling.  It&#x27;s a splurge but if you are really having a lot of issues detangling your natural hair, I suggest you try this comb.</li>
    <li> It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be and I don&#x27;t think it works for my hair type.  May be it would be better for someone else, but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I like wearing my natural shoulder length 4b/4c hair but have been frustrated with the amount of time that it takes to detangle my hair. On average, it takes 2-3 hours to detangle my hair. Yet, with this product my hair was detangled within an hour (not to mention that my hair needed extra detangling since I had just taken down some braids that had been in my hair for about 8 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions on the box and used the comb on my hair as I was rinsing out the conditioner. This was uncomfortable, so I stopped midway through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once out of the shower, I parted my hair into 6 sections and applied kimmaytube leave in to each section. Then, I followed up by detangling each section with the ouidad comb. I detangled my hair from the tips to the root and had less breakage then usual. Typically, I have an issue with detangling a section--only to have new tangles--but this did not occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product once but plan to continue to use it to detangle my hair after it has been cleaned.</li>
    <li> This detangler works great for curly-haired divas, but its also wayyyyy over priced for the function. I could pretty much get similar results using my fingers, but I&#x27;m way to grossed out by the hair that comes off in my hands so I went for this comb. All-in-all not terrible, but definitely not something I&#x27;d buy again. Hopefully this thing lasts!</li>
    <li> does everything it says it will! love this comb and it helps me detangle all these knots! definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My 4 year-old daughter has very thick 11&amp;#34; long 4b/4c hair and detangling has always been a nightmare.  I read a lot of great things about this comb so I took a chance.  This may possibly be the best purchase I have ever made regarding her hair!  The first time I used it was after removing 2 week-old 2-strand twists and spraying her hair with a mixture of water, conditioner, and JBCO.  This comb went through her tangles like cutting through butter!  It cut down the detangling time by half or more and washing her hair 2 days later was a breeze!  I used it to comb through the conditioner (during washing and styling w/leave-in) and her hair has never been so smooth and tangle free.  It might not be for everyone (probably too harsh for thin, straight hair) and it is heavy but I didn&#x27;t notice the weight at all while using it.  There were no tears and styling her hair was the easiest it&#x27;s ever been!  It is completely worth every cent I paid for it.  I highly recommend this for anyone with very thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly-kinky hair and comb it out weekly.  This comb works better than any I&#x27;ve every had.  The double row of teeth detangles more thoroughly and faster than single row combs.  The teeths&#x27; large size and wide separation make the whole process very gentle.  The comb is large and a little heavy and its handle is wide.  I think that all of these features contribute to its being easy to use and maneuver.</li>
    <li> Have to admit, this is about the best de-tangler I have ever used. Constant demands to share it with wildly curly family members.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of websites that recommended this comb but I always thought it was so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to spend the money on it and it is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My life is so much easier when I am combing out my hair in the shower with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I can never go back to a single toothed comb</li>
    <li> I can comb through my hair in a fraction of the time. Very heavy comb, but it works! Pricey, but worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just got this comb and used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. First, this is the only comb we have tried that has not broken trying to get big knots out of her thick, curly hair. Secondly, I was able to remove all of the knotted mats she had accumulated in her hair in about an hour (probably would have been faster if she would have sat still!) We previously spent hours and never got them out. I was desperate enough to pay this much for a solution, and not have to chop her hair off. It was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened for my 3b/c curls.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years, and it&#x27;s as solid as it was on day 1.  It never tears my hair, and it helps my curls to fall into their \\&quot;families\\&quot;.  This comb is quite heavy, so it&#x27;s not the best for little girl&#x27;s hair, but it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve always needed.  My hair has torn the teeth out of many a comb, and I&#x27;ve cracked, bent, and even melted many others. I did have one tooth break off when I dropped my comb on my tile bathroom floor, but it didn&#x27;t change the performance of the comb.  I like the way this comb helps to get excess product out of my hair, too.  My hair is low porosity, so it hangs on to everything without absorbing it.  The comb gathers the excess product on the groove between the teeth, and afterwards the product is easily rinsed off the comb. I find this comb works just as perfectly on my bob as it did on my long hair.</li>
    <li> you have to get used to it&#x3D;BIG...but it does help with my Daughters Curly Hair---does not take as long!! Worth it!!</li>
    <li> I hate the heavy comb it pulls my hair out!!</li>
    <li> Love this comb.  I have fine curly hair and this comb separates and and allows my ringlets to shine.  Works best when combing individual sections at a time. Do not re-comb whole head of hair at once.  If using post shower conditioning, use wide tooth single comb to distribute conditioner.  Use the Ouidad comb after applying your leave in conditioning products.</li>
    <li> This is the only comb I have ever own that detangles my very curly hair with minimal tugging or pulling.  I am not sure why the design works so well- Maybe it is the hefty weight or the double rows- but it glides through wet hair, getting rid of tangles as it goes!</li>
    <li> I really like the weight of this comb. Works as advertised and work the price. I don&#x27;t know what elseTHERE. I reached my word limit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this comb for both myself and others. I absolutely LOVE it! For the women&#x27;s in your life who has everything including a thick headful of hair to detangle this is a must have!. It&#x27;s also great for those who have children with thick long hair, or natural hair braiders. This GEM makes an awesome but unexpected gift she never had.</li>
    <li> Product is as described but just not worth the price.  Bulky and unwieldy to use. Over promises and under delivers.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old girl loves this and she has thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> its a comb. It works as expected. It&#x27;s definitely more tangible but it&#x27;s still just a comb. I like it better than what I had though so this is better and worth the money.</li>
    <li> This comb is sturdy! It works for sure to get through this mass of hair on my head.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I have small hands. It&#x27;s hard for me to hold sometimes &amp; it&#x27;s heavy. But it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower for kinky curly hair, great weight/heft and very easy to use. I&#x27;ve given two as gifts.</li>
    <li> my daughter has 3c hair and i was trying to find something to help with doing her hair.  it does seem to help some, but it is not a miracle worker as some had told me.  still like it though!</li>
    <li> It feels heavy like it&#x27;s made of great quality materials, and works wonderfully. I look forward to washing my hair just to use this.</li>
    <li> This comb worked so well in my daughters hair so much better than a normal comb. Less pulling and breakage.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb over a year ago and I love it. I am tender-headed and a year into transitioning my relaxed hair back to natural.  This comb has been a lifesaver it really helped me with detangling my hair at the six month mark.  I comb my hair and it glides threw tangles and really helps with knots. My hair was past shoulder length and this comb made the washing process much easier.  I am very happy with this purchase and plan to buy another to give to my natural stylist as a gift.</li>
    <li> returned this product because it is not good for my type 3 hair.  i accomplished the same thing with a conair double comb for 3.99</li>
    <li> works great on my curly natural hair. Only use when hair is wet</li>
    <li> Not a great product for thick, kinky, coily hair.  After 6 months of use I noticed I was loosing more hair in my detangling sessions that I used to with my old comb.  I have now gone back to my old methods and my hair is growing back.</li>
    <li> My natural hair is a 3c, 4a and b, texture. At the moment, it is 2 and a half inches from my bottom. I can easily spend up 3 hours detangling with a wide tooth comb. I let my hair sit for a month, partially dreading and detangled my ENTIRE head in about 20 mins. It did not tear or snag my hair-at all. Its design is practically perfect for curly girls. Ouidad is a curly girl&#x27;s secret weapon. Run-don&#x27;t walk-to Sephora or buy it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this comb does a terrific job of detangling without making you wince or grind your teeth. I also use it on my dry hair occasionally to help with knots but it&#x27;s best on combing wet or damp hair. It&#x27;s teeth are in a double row and big/wide enough to keep the wet hair curled.</li>
    <li> This is a very large comb.  Would be good for long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this comb, I&#x27;d have very little (curly) hair left on my head.  &#x27;Nuff said!</li>
    <li> Happy with my order fast shipping</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the other ouidad hair products. Also, it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> So call me crazy, but I bought this for my horse! She has a incredibly thick mane and tail that I want to keep that way. This comb, if used gently, does a wonderful job getting through a thick tail with minimal breakage. The combs sold for horses are so flimsy they break, and do not do a good job on manes/tails. Yes, these are not cheap, but this will be the last comb I will buy for her as it is very well made and sturdy! I recommend this for horses. On a side note..I have super curly hair and it does work well for us thick curly girls as well!</li>
    <li> This comb is AWESOME!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really gets rid of knots!!</li>
    <li> This comb does exactly what it says it will do. I detangled my hair in about 10 minutes. For reference, I have tightly coiled and fine african american hair. It also arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Struggling to find the best comb for my Ethiopian princess with beautiful curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t snag or tear ends, tear free and super high quality. Well worth the money. Built to last forever. It is a heavy comb which may be a down side for some but we love it!</li>
    <li> This comb was worth every penny and more. Cut detangling time in half. I used to dread detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair. When I used this, she didn&#x27;t shed a tear. Magical!</li>
    <li> This comb has a sturdy construction and some substantial weight to it.  I tried it in my &amp;#34;type 4b&amp;#34; African American hair while it was wet.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  It didn&#x27;t pull and was easier to use than a generic wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to people with kinky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used Shea Buttter in your hair, you remember how well it worked compared to a basic oil.  Well in my opinion this comb is just like my first experience with Shea, so glad that I found it and it works so well for me!</li>
    <li> I just love this Detangler comb. Used it right away and it works effortlessly. It&#x27;s a little large to handle but it does a great job on detangling hair. I&#x27;m so happy I finally purchased it. Loving it</li>
