<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Messy. More for a young child starting to usr makeup.</li>
    <li> Although the two pallets had multiple colors was the same. But the colors stands out and last. If needed I will purchase it again</li>
    <li> Terrible quality.  All the Glitter is on the very surface. What lies below is dull powder.  I could have bought this at the Dollar Store.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this product is. I bought it a while ago at the mall and i just wanted to let you all know that it&#x27;s great shadow. You have to use the patting technique with the glitter or it wont stay. The pearl shadows are very pigmented though. I&#x27;m impressed. The only problem is packaging. This packaging is horrible and some of my shadows fall out and rub on the lid.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 17 year old daughter.  She absolutely loved it.  She loved the vibrant colors and especially the glitter.  It came with a nice velvet pouch and made a great gift.</li>
    <li> hey super calida los zapatos 100% responsable lo certifico y los califico muy muy bien gracias y doy fe q son seguro y confiables y la entrega llego la fecha dicha 100%segurosss</li>
    <li> I was so excited when my eye shadow arrived but I was so disappointed after using it. The glittery eye shadow was very sticky. All night it smudges and smeared. It was a mess, I finally had to go to the bathroom and wash it off. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and it was shipped damaged. Several of the colors were crumbled. I was very unhappy. I do not recommend this product beacuse thw quality of the make-up is horrible. The product is not costly but it should come intact.</li>
    <li> I wanted the eyeshadow for the red glitter eyeshadow and other glitter ones it contained- you barely touch it with the eyeshadow applicator and it&#x27;s gone- it was cheap though other colors are good glitter ones are crap.</li>
    <li> i think its good i just got it today .. its good as long as you use primer but i like it .. it was alil broken but its ok</li>
    <li> Remember when you were in like, 4th grade and your mom didn&#x27;t let you wear makeup except for that fake doll makeup and peel-off nail polish? Revent back to those days, dip your foam applicator in some hardcore crumbled up talc and then finish off with what could pass for a pregnant Teletubbies mucus plug for highlight.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and was super excited til I tried to use the glitter and its just glitter on the top and clear crap... please dont buy this even thought its only five dollars instead head to your local asian wig store and buy what they have</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow is really dull. It barely shows up on my eye. I have to add a LOT to get it to show up. The glitter is nice though, because it&#x27;s gluey under the glitter, not cream, so it&#x27;s glitter right until the end, unlike other pallets that just have nasty cream underneath.</li>
    <li> For this product I was very pleased. The colors that are more softer should be applied first so that when you add the glitter shades it helps the glitter give that pop effect so that it just doesnt look like glitter smeared on the eye. A patting techniques should be used so using less can give more better results. I always suggest using the pads of your fingers for application of glitter.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this pallet but it was disappointing.  The colors LOOK beautiful but they are nothing but a Vaseline-type goop that won&#x27;t even blend!  I&#x27;m returning this item!</li>
    <li> I wanted a nice little palette .It did come fast in the mail. But when I tried it the colors were so light and not bold. I don&#x27;t really care for it or use it at all. I let my daughter play with it since its like cheap makeup for kids. At least she puts it to use.</li>
    <li> ladies is another must have these eyeshadows are absolutely gorgeous and wear well, i highly recommend you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> At first, I was really happy when it arrived. I couldnt wait to try out the glitters! But they are like hard liquid, gooey and dont come out very well. I was a little annoyed by that. Also, the brush was weird. But, I thought the colors were gorgeous, they stayed on a little while, but i would deflinetly suggest you have to put a primer on! And this really was only $7, so you cant expect it to be amazing.</li>
    <li> Fun gift for Grand daughter, she loved it!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product, but very unhappy with it. The shadows are fun and pearly, but the glitters are horrible.  The top layer of the glitter shadows are wonderful and beautiful but after you dip your applicator into it its nothing but slimy colorless glitterless goo.  i was very displeased with this product and do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product is poorly made and cheap. The colors do not last and are not really able to be seen. The only colors that I used up were black and brown. The rest are just sitting in my cabinet. Do not buy! Very cheap</li>
    <li> I was very displeased with this product and do not recommend it. I bought because I though  the glitters beautiful but only the color. They are horrible!</li>
    <li> the glitter isnt very sparkly and the colors dont show up as good as i expected them to. also the item should have measurements, because i was very disapointed to know how small it was,</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast only like 1-2 days!! Im very excited about this product!! :)oh and also it\\&quot;s WAYYYY smaller than the picture but it still is really cool and to all the haters of the product just give it to a teenager like meee!!! haha the will seriously ***LOVE*** it!!</li>
    <li> The shadow is smaller than expected but nice. The shimmer colors are pretty &amp; vibrant, they also blend well. The glitter on the other hand kinda sucks. They&#x27;re hard to apply, they dont spread easily, and the gel the glitter is in seems to spread while the glitter does not. It just kinda clumps. Overall though, the price is unbeatable &amp;all glitter aside the shimmer shadow is worth the purchase price. I would buy it again minus the glitter.</li>
    <li> The glitter colors are some greasy gel stuff that doesn&#x27;y last very long, and the other colors aren&#x27;t very good either.  If you love makeup with color and at least a little staying power, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the glitter eyeshadows but some of the glitter eyeshadows were barely even filled! All the regular eyeshadows were filled and they are highly pigmented, but the silver, green, and aqua glitters had barely more than a 1/4 of the product in the tray. Overall, good product and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The colors of the eyeshadow are soooo rich!!! The makeup has a really nice texture. It is completely a high quality shimmer and glitter set, unlike other cheap sets. The shades are very nice and u can definitely see the shine!!!  :)</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what this makeup quality was going to be like.  I got it for my daughters to play with when the are dressing up as princesses! They love it</li>
    <li> My friend LOVES eye shadows and she was suoer excited to get thism she uses it andnlove it very much.</li>
    <li> The product I receivedlooked like it was used which is not what I expected.  I was very disappointed with what I received.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice pallet, The only thing i don&#x27;t like is the glitter part!! They stick to much to the brush and not the eye lid. But would Recommend this to my friends:) I love the bold colors... They are very soft and bright! It&#x27;s a good buy... And the shipping was Fast!!</li>
    <li> This product is okay I guess. I was very excited when I got this because it looked pigmented, but when I tried it on, it was not even worth it! In the picture, it looks bold and big, but I do not recommend this and I would never get this agian!!</li>
    <li> I wish this product would of been bigger. It was much smaller than i expected it to be. But overall i liked it!</li>
    <li> Save your money, this is not worth buying, buy cheap you get cheap, and this one is the cheapest if them all. |Go to your local drugstore and buy a brand name or look on Amazon for good brand names.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of people complaining about the glitter, but I have not had a single issue with it. Only one of my eye shadows broke in the shipping process, luckily it was a color I really don&#x27;t use (metallic brown) and I think they SHOULD put more care into how they package their items, but all in all when I run out I will order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Kind of was expecting more out of this palette, but I guess you get what you pay for. The shadows are TINY. The glitter does what its supposed to but I wish it was more then gel with colored glitter in it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d repurchase this one. Shipping was pretty fat however. Would make a good gift for a kid.</li>
    <li> now really what i expected. there are many vibrant colors, and the glitter ones are nice, but they seemed to wipe away the shimmer i put on before the glitter so watch out for that.</li>
    <li> The normal shadow is great! But the glitter is lacking a bit because all of the sparkle is on top and its just a clear gel below. Otherwise its great</li>
    <li> Its a good selection, but its small.  the kit is only like 3 inches by 8 inches.  I don&#x27;t think its worth the money that I spent on it.</li>
    <li> The quality of the glitter was not first rate. It seems that the gliter resides at the top and once you use a bunch of it and really get into it, you just get glitterless but nicely colored stuff. The first few times I used the glitter it was greeat. The variety of colours is very nice too but I would ask for more quality.</li>
    <li> ok so the glitter is in a gel form,... i dont really care to much for that, however, the eye shadows are very very nice,</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the fact that the glitter barley shows up once applied.  I am a MUA and would have liked this purchase to be practical for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t go to waste, I am planning to give it to my niece as a birthday present.</li>
    <li> It was not good makeup, the glitter got everywhere on my face, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.. I know I should of bought another type of glitter makeup.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow didn&#x27;t hold up to my expectations. The glitter was of very low quality and the colors were dull.</li>
    <li> i just want to save u some money i didnt like it is sticky and dosnt stay !!!! save money and time!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was  excited about ordering glitter eye shadow. It arrived today. It came early than expected, (the only good thing about it). All it seemed to be glitter in Vaseline! Very oily with little glitter on the applicator. I would not recommend this to my worse enemy! I am very disappointed! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS! If you really want to waste your money, you can send it to me.</li>
    <li> This item sould be something you can purchase from a Dollar Tree store. The colors didnt come out well and after using it for a few days, I broke out around my eyes.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it seemed more like kids dress up makeup to me when It came time to use the glitter ones.</li>
    <li> This is my daughters show girl makeup palette if you like to glam it up this is a must have item, the price is excellent and the makeup&lt;br /&gt;is great. She likes to glam it for different things like dances and school events and her pictures so this is the way to go. And you have your glitter &amp; plan in one palette that works.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these eye color pallets for my daughters. They LOVE them all cause they have so many colors to choose from. They are very good quality &amp; beautiful colors. Delivered very quick, packaged very safe in bubble wrap, &amp; a GREAT price!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend ANY of these eye color pallets if you are wanting GREAT quality eye shadow colors :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last at all nor were they bright enough. You had to put on lots of layers in order for it to show. Not satisfied sorry.</li>
    <li> i have this product for five months now and it is good. I love it and i do not regret my purchase. The glitter is perfect and everything else about it. Wonderful colors to choose from and it has a color to match all your outfits. Even those unfortunate colors like turquoise and so on...</li>
    <li> colors are small so you wont get alot of use and the glitter is gooie so it does not stay on your eyes well</li>
    <li> Needless to say, ive used it a few times. Its one of the cheap makeup items i go to when i dont wanna use my good stuff. I am a makeup artist and this is terrible. I do theatrical makeup for a haunted forest and this is what i use for random colors. Otherwise it is horrid. The glitters are cheap and gooey. It is a total waste. I will never buy anything like this again.</li>
    <li> I loved the color selection, the glitter shadow is a gel type base so it feels a little weird on the eyes but great effect.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible and I love make-up!!!! When I received this product it was missing some of the eyeshadow and some of the eyeshadows that where still there where broken I wish I could get my money back I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone to buy it&#x27;s a waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Is okay no big deal bought this for my daughter and she was not impressed.  Would not recommend but price was not bad.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product...great for carrying in your purse..</li>
    <li> cool stuff, doesn&#x27;t cover 100% like I was looking for but I am still happy with the purchase. I would purchase again</li>
    <li> This the WORST product I have ever purchased online. In several of the color spots there was barely more then a drop. Not even enough for one use. A complete waste of money. VERY disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was actualy shocked how well this came out,i recently bought another eye shadow palette and some of them came shattered:( so i was worried this one would be the same, but surprisingly it wasnt, none were crushed or shattered and the colors are very nice and the glitter works wonderful too the design and soft case are very nice, but this is kind of a small thing you would only use ocasionaly not an everyday thing :)</li>
    <li> When i first got the makeup it broke completly. Do not recomend it. Also it says 5 day shipping it comes 2 months later</li>
    <li> Not what my wife expected at all :(</li>
    <li> This was a great choice... I totally recommending it to someone for the price..and then again christmas it would be a great stocking stuffer:)</li>
    <li> the eyeshadow is ok but it tends not to be very pigmented. the glitter is why i bought this and it was horrible because it was a creamy consistency so when you put it on your eye lids its sticky and really does nothing but look like a mess.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really complain because.....well you get what you pay for. It was cheap and there fore you get a cheap amount of product, it almost looks like it&#x27;s been used some. It&#x27;s still very useful for the price because it has some great colors but don&#x27;t expect it to be identical to the photo.</li>
    <li> ok i was really iffy on this just letting everyone know oi read all the review&#x27;s before taking a chance and buying this product it arrive in tact early and very well packaged nothing was broken and customer service and package tracking was amazing</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s way cheaper than it&#x27;s price! it&#x27;s disgusting, and unwearable. do NOT buy this product!   i wouldn&#x27;t even rate it one star if i didn&#x27;t have to! the glitter is a disgusting goo-ey stuff that won&#x27;t even spread, and then when i tried to wash it off, it got all over my face and wouldn&#x27;t come off. it&#x27;s a disgusting thing and you&#x27;ll be VERY disappointed. i promise.</li>
    <li> The quaity of this make up is bad the eye shadow break easy and the powder are bad</li>
    <li> The Case will not Close once it has been opened. the colors are bright but the Product doesn&#x27;t Stay on long even with the eye Shadow Primer. this is only the Second bad product review that I have Written. The sizes are Tiny I have gotten Bigger free Sample Sizes from Mary Kay or AVON or Urban Decay, NYX. this is seriously Very Sad. the Pictures Look bigger then what you really are getting. Sorry But not very Happy. the Quality is Horriable for Make up. this is what you get for your Daughter when she is learning to put on her own make up. very un-impressed by EMORI! Wet and Wild is better then this and that is saying allot!!!</li>
    <li> i thought it was big cuz in the picture it was big but wen i got it, it was 10x smaller than the image</li>
    <li> I received the item 2 days after I ordered it and the makeup is beautiful and goes on great the colors are wonderful thank you so much It looks great on my daughter I needed those colors for her prom I will be buying more stuff from this seller</li>
    <li> The product I twittered want the one in the picture but I do like the product that came in. ...</li>
    <li> I dont recommend this product these eyeshadows look like I got em at the 99cents store...i regret waisting my money on this.</li>
    <li> This product appears a lot bigger then it actually is. It also was a mess by the time it got to me there was makeup all over the case, and there was not a lot of glitter would have been better off if I spent my money at a local hair store. Not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> I mainly got this pallett for the glitter eye shadow. I have been dying to try that exteme glitter look but have been unable to find what i have been looking for at my local stores for a decent price. The plain eyeshadow is a pearl/shimmer kind and is an ok shadow. The glitter on the other hand is very bad. Its pretty much the glitter that your daughter gets in the play/dress up kits. It even smells the same. I am an eye shadow fanatic so i will definantly use the plain eyeshadows. All in all you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I got it with some other things and I like it it has the best color and it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as some of the other things I was looking at I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I was quite excited to order this product, and even more excited when it came in the mail. The palettes were bubble wrapped and safe, and nothing was wrong, until I tried to use the sticky glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have discovered that the glitter makes a great base for the powder eyeshadow, and keeps it on longer. I don&#x27;t really care whether or not the glitter color shows; I just need my eyeshadow to stay on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re not too disturbed by eyes all day, these palettes are the ones for you!</li>
    <li> I have to say if the glitter eyeshadows werent sticky i would have loved this...I wouldve liked em better in powder... The top powder ones were very pretty though ... One color came a bit broken but I wasnt upset</li>
    <li> I was very excited about purchasing this item!! When I received it I was shocked to see the actual size of it!! The shadows are smaller than a dime!! Also the glitter shadows are not that great!! I would recommend the seller to put actual sizes of the item so we the buyers can get a better idea!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with these. The colors are fantastic but the glitter is only right on top and underneath is kind of sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> This make up eyeshadow and glitter kit offers beautiful colors, but be very careful because the eye shadows will fall out of the case.</li>
    <li> I really liked this palette.The glitter had enough for me. Others said the glitter was only on top of the eye color. Mine seemed like it was throughout the entire eyeshadow . Unless you want just glitter, this is a good palette.The other coors had a nice texure and pigments were good also.The pans they come in are small, but it&#x27;s enough to use for a while.Unless you use this everyday, this should last you 3-4 months.I thought this was a very good price. I think I paid $3.95 for it.I would recommend this to anyone who might might a little glitz every now and then. Maybe holiday time!</li>
    <li> the glitter eye shadow is like lip gloss its not the best for eye shadow (unless its supposed to be lip gloss, now that i think about it lol)  and the shimmer on the rest is only shimmery on the top layer then its just regular. but not a bad deal for all the colors</li>
    <li> the glitter is a little too pasty and it mess up the regular shadow when applied on top of each other. where it one way or another and you&#x27;ll be good to go. the colors are pretty. shipped really fast. not bad for the price</li>
    <li> i brought 2 sets, one came with the white shadow broken but i really liked the product! i recommend it!</li>
    <li> This shade has a little problem because they fell down so quickly</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty but it takes a lot for the color to show up on our skin and it has to be reapplied a few times in the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this palate to try out some different eye looks, because there are so many different colors here. I was disappointed when the pots of eyeshadow began to fall apart after using them only once. Also, the colors have almost no actual color to them once you actually put them on your face.</li>
    <li> I have a complaint about this eyeshadow. When it was delivered, one of the eyeshadow boxes had the green shadow that had spilled all over it and all over the brush. This meant I could not use the brush for any of the color because of the green spillage.&lt;br /&gt;In addition the colors that sparkle when applied goes on like vaseline and you can hardly see the sparkle. I am requesting a full refund because I am not pleased with this product at all.</li>
    <li> the colors are nice but it does not last on your eyes I would not buy it again I hate it</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes to use this for cheer make up, for games and all, the glitter doesn&#x27;t even stay on half the time, and when it does, it creases and looks horrible and tacky. I paid too much for it, considering how cheap it was.</li>
    <li> I loooove the colors they are sooo pretty but when i used them there was more gel than glitter and was really hard to put it on, it only last on my eyes for like 4 hours. Also, there isn&#x27;t enough glitter eyeshadow in each little compartment, you can only use it twice :( :(&lt;br /&gt;But this seller ROOOOCKS!!! i will definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> She loved the vibrant colors and especially the glitter. It came with a nice velvet pouch and made a great gift.</li>
    <li> It has glitters, shimmers, and sparkles in every color.  It can dress up or bling up any outfit.  Worth the purchase, especially since its compact enough to carry.</li>
    <li> I love these eyeshadows they are amazing colors are bright glitter works okay love the colors more than the glitter but for the price if buy it again</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this eyeshadow kit. The eyeshadow is goopy instead of like powder. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> The amount of eyeshadow in each little glitter pod is enough for about two (2) applications as that is it, and the glitter pods were my main reason for purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This item arrived late and it was broken. The eye shadow is smashed all over the place. The brush is covered in many different shades of shattered shadow. 1 case is completely fine and the other is a complete waste and unusable. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> just got mine today and yes the glitters are goopyish but would work well to line your eyes with a thin makeup brush...i did have two of them broken but out of 64 total eyeshadows 2 isnt bad (s***happens) and mine were completely wrapped in bubble wrap so the effort was giving by the shipper thank you!!</li>
    <li> I just love the coverage it gives but its just too little in the unit. Best for a young woman</li>
    <li> not bad for the price and I got two pallets but they colors were just jumbled up to make it appear you are getting alot of colors when you are getting the same ones.</li>
    <li> This palette is small. Totally not what i expected. The image looks much bigger online. It does not show up with an intense color.</li>
    <li> They are great colors. What I like the most is that they dont go away with your sweat.  I really do like them.</li>
    <li> i bought it as a gift for my girl friend and she totally loved it. it is a very good product</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing!!! I&#x27;m usually not one for high priced makeup, by which I mean I buy cover girl or dollar store makeup since I have 4 kids to feed lol but I figured I would splurge and got this and I&#x27;m SOOOOO HAPPY!!!!! The glitter ones are a little annoying because they are liquids and they get used up really quickly, like if you use them twice they are gone, I do heavy eye makeup though so some others may not have that problem but the regular shades are AMAZEBALLS!!!!!</li>
    <li> i used this at my cousins wedding and the eye shadow didnt go on properly and it looked horrible i wouldnt purchase it again</li>
    <li> I love the eyeshadow colors and they work well on my dark skin but the glitters are just terrible. They are gooey and  barely any glitter gets transferred to the skin. I wouldn’t recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to get TWO cases of this shadow/glitter instead of one (so 66 colors, 33 per pack... it is the more geometric case of glitter/shadow), but one shadow had cracked and was floating.  I was lucky it didn&#x27;t powderize much and ruin the other colors.  The colors go on well, but I use a pointed cotton swab that is slightly wet and I dab it in the color so as not to waste a bunch as crumbles/lose powder.  It stays on well with the wet method and I use it dry for the lighter base colors or darker crease colors.  I use it lightly in that case and it stays well.  I use the bright colors over a white or pearl or gold liner and even blend them and do rainbows.  They stay well and resist wetness.  DO mix the glitter before you ever use any of them.  I use it very sparingly.  It is quite tacky and works best on cheek bones or brows... it can cake on shadow &amp; mess up the smoothness of the shadow&#x27;s blend.</li>
    <li> The color were broke once they finally arrived to me. Just pretty dust.</li>
    <li> TThe glitter portion was soo disappointing!!! Only the top layer is glitter, and the rest was like a sticky lip gloss. Mascara was all over eyelids because the sticky goop was so... Just sticky. Not cheap Mascara if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re thinking. It just really sucked.</li>
    <li> They look better as the real quality is. The glitter is sticky and oily, very uncomfortable to wear. The other colors do not spread well and don&#x27;t last long on your skin. I don&#x27;t really recomend them.</li>
    <li> The eye shadows came fallen out of their positions and crumbled and dusty.  Not sure I want to give them as a gift.  May just throw them away.</li>
    <li> i was very please with this purchase. now, of course, because it is 9 dollars it is not going to br a high class makeup set. So if you are expecting something like sephora, youll be dissapointed. That said, i love it! It looks great on and i get cdompliments on my mkaeup all the time. You would never know its 9 dollars. The only problem is that sometimes, some of the colors fall out of their socket but it doesnt ruin it at all. It &#x27;s a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I wish I knew the type of eye shadow base it was before buying it. Some of the colors are creamier than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it shipped very fast, and I thoroughly enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this eyeshadow is absolutely fantastic. Its has amazing colors and the packaging is really strong and safe. Great</li>
    <li> This product sucked to say the least. When i got it i was really excited because of the bright colors, i went to put some product on and it was more dusty then it should have been, but if you dont mind that in your eyeshadows i wouldnt worry about that. What annoyed me the most was when i went to put on the &#x27;glitter&#x27; part. Okay heres what it consists of...gel with a few flakes of colored glitter on top. Very hard to get out even if you wanted to put some on. Very un proffesional i would not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;-pros. Eye shadows are OK not the best but OK if your not looking for anything spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;-cons. Glitter part was a complete disaster, terrible and very poor quality.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;cream-like&amp;#34; eye shadow so it needs to dry. The glitter ones ended up all bunched up in the crease of my eye... :(  Not sure i would buy again, even at the great price....</li>
    <li> I gave this to my cousin as a gift since she uses it as part of her costumes as a twirler. She loves it...and me.</li>
    <li> I have this already and I like it very pretty color&#x27;s I do not want to be chared two times any more</li>
    <li> Horrible quality all around! Looks nice in the photo, but it is extremely hard to apply and the glitter might as well be a glitter pen from a childs school box. Very sticky and looks like a 10 year olds dress up play makeup. Dont waste your money! Nothing good at all to say about this product.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy.  I loved the fact that it had both glitter and regular eyeshadow.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for glittery colors for my costume, the glitter shadows were a gel like consistancy that smeared around my eye lids. It didn&#x27;t stay where I wanted.</li>
    <li> so cute &amp; so many colors!</li>
    <li> I liked the colors that were available in the pallet, however, they crumbled easily - I lost more then I was able to use.</li>
    <li> Product had super fast shipping, and was received early. I was excited, and opened the boxes to find that several colors had popped out of their place and powder everywhere. In both boxes. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed, but contacted the store to notify them of the problem before I left a review. They replaced my order and shipped it out just as quickly, and the replacement was perfect. This store went above and beyond to fix the issue and I will definitely place several more orders here because of it. 10/10 for their customer service and 10/10 on the product as well.</li>
    <li> came fast and kids love</li>
    <li> she loves her make up that way she has more colors to choose from for cheerleading and won&#x27;t have to stick with one color</li>
    <li> The make up was just what I wanted and what I expected, it works just fine for me- I love it!</li>
    <li> i just brought this stuff not that long ago because it looked nice &amp;nd i have the colors i need but i just wanna kno if this a cream eyershadow ? [[ASIN:B004CQR9L6 32 Color Design Neon Glitter &amp; Plain Eyeshadow Makeup Kit]]or just regular glitter eyeshadow ?</li>
    <li> I like the colors but wasn&#x27;t really pleased with the glitter part only the top layer has glitter and unless you have a good primer it will crease</li>
    <li> It was ok the glitter was sticky and got clumpy. It gets annoying and doesn&#x27;t hold up. Sometimes I had to peel off the glittery part.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister, was terrible....she didn&#x27;t expect this but it was worth the money though, will not recommend it</li>
    <li> It was mostly fine for the most part other then the fact that when I recieved this item in mail some of the eye shadows were shattered so I am unble to use them</li>
    <li> I gave this to my niece for Christmas, she loves makeup and she said that it was great. She said there was a lot of glitter in the makeup and that is what she liked best.</li>
    <li> i bought this for the glitters &amp; they do not go on well plus they crease really bad.  not very good at all.</li>
    <li> awesome colors and long lasting... neat product</li>
    <li> Pallet looks amazing but of-course the glitter look doesn&#x27;t transfer when putting on.</li>
    <li> its cute since im a cheerleader, but it runs out very quickly, but it does look good on game days! (:</li>
    <li> The colors are subtle unless you just continue to add more layers and I like that. I don&#x27;t like that the eyeshadow starts to fade and sometimes crease.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the beautiful colors and the glitter shadows that I wanted to try. It arrived today. I opened the packaging to find one shadow kit in perfect condition. In the other kit five of the shadows were completely destroyed in the shipping process. I opened it to find shadow everywhere. As far as the glitter shadows go....BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I tried to experiment with it, but when I applied it, glitter clumped in one spot and I got more glitter on the applicator than I did on my lids. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again and will not recommend this product nor the sender.</li>
    <li> this product was amazing very good and the colors were great and came in great timing i really suggest this product</li>
    <li> it came a little messed up :/ didnt really like that about it ! but other than that its pretty good</li>
    <li> excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, the colors expected, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
    <li> They were bought for a teenager who love her makeup and she use&#x27;s this all the time... even when friends come over and they do make overs....this is perfect for that cuase it covers all skin colors....perfect thanks</li>
    <li> Not worth the price the eye shadow itself was decent quality however I was shocked at how small the circles were and their limited use I would buy it again only at a much cheaper price</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong. Fantastic product and price. It was a gift and it was a well received its nice to know someone gets a gift they love.</li>
