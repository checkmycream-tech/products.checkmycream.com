    <li> I&#x27;am in late 60&#x27;s don&#x27;t expect miracles haha but ok product</li>
    <li> The best products, ever!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product to be used as a system with other Neova products in a complete skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s my favorite night cream I&#x27;ve ever had...very gentle and nourishing/moisturizing.  Great for my sensitive skin.  And the price here is great too.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I really like it.  This is my second time ordering it.  Definitely makes a difference in how my face looks and feels especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer for night and all day use.  I have been using this stuff for years now and originally started using it after a recommendation from a dermatologist... I have been using it ever since and have found nothing comprable to it.</li>
    <li> Have used this night cream for a couple years.  Love the way it feels on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face stick to the pillow and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to stop up my head at night.  Tried plenty of other night creams and this one works perfectly for me.  I have so many allergies.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expenseive!</li>
    <li> First time purchasing and I&#x27;m hooked! I absolutely love this stuff, it makes my skin feel so soft and I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times! This is now my &#x27; must have&#x27; cream before bed every night!</li>
    <li> I got a couple of samples of NEOVA Night Therapy with GHK Copper Peptide Complex, and have been using it for 2 weeks.  I have chronic dermatitis on some areas of my face so it has been hard to find the right skin care products.  This works great!  I can tell it&#x27;s working as soon as I put it on.  However, I still feel a little bit dry on my dermatitis area.  So I put Laneige Water Sleeping Pack before I go to bed.  In the morning my skin is soft and smooth without driness or flakes.  If these can work this good on my dermatitis skin, imagine what they can do for you.  I would like to try NEOVA Day Therapy now.  I hope it works as good as their Night Therapy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just wish that the price was a little bit lower.</li>
    <li> As with the the Creme de La Copper, truly awesome Creme. Best feeling, and it works without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I have really liked all the Neova products and use them as a &amp;#34;daily package&amp;#34;.  I use nothing else on my skin unless it&#x27;s special event and then I need a little makeup.  My face has improved considerably.</li>
    <li> Excellent night cream, repairs and smooths damaged skin from sun.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  You can immediately feel the hydration.</li>
    <li> Have used this night cream for years, always a winner in my book. Neova has one of the best skin lines of any company out there.</li>
    <li> Absolutely and unmistakably  the best facial cream. For the day &amp; night!&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what an European esthetician recommended:&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face with lukewarm water with  NEOVA Purifying Cleanser (you can pick a Neova cleanser of your choice)&lt;br /&gt;Rinse /splash cold , cold water about 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;Let face air dry.&lt;br /&gt;When face &#x27;immediately&#x27; dries put a bit of this cream .&lt;br /&gt;It gives a youthful and fresh appearance WITHOUT that oily looks that too many creams nowadays have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this cream.....&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to like the way you look!</li>
    <li> I have been using Neova Night Therapy for over 10 years and doubt that I can be persuaded to change.  I feel it adds moisturize to my skin without feeling greasy.  On several occasions, I&#x27;ve been complimented on my skin and asked what skin care I use so it must look as good as it feels.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over a year, based on recommendation by esthetician at my derm&#x27;s office.  Love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> this is a good product but certainly not worth the money.....the price keeps going up so I have switched to another product.....</li>
    <li> any Neova product is a good product - I am pleased with the night therapy cream</li>
    <li> Not greasy and leaves my face feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> Favorite moisturizing magic ever. I&#x27;m a decades long user and swear by this product.</li>
    <li> The product has changed since I used it last. It will take a week or so until hopefully, I will be able to see a favorable results. It will depend on what ingredients were changed in the making of the product. Texture was the first thing I noticed that was different.&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
    <li> I think my face is softer but more comedone after I used this product. And I wonder about cream texture. Feel sticky</li>
    <li> loved it used daily in conjuction with retin a.  planning to buy more when this pump bottleis done.  make a nice gift also.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very long but my skin feels great so far.</li>
    <li> fast shipment - product as expected- excellent for post face peel- soothing to face and stimulates collagen-</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years.  I have found that the Nova products work very well with my combination skin.  I use the day therapy, night therapy, DNA repair, and the creme de LA copper.  I love the way they make Mt skin feel.  They are not greasy and absorb quickly.  They are worth the price.</li>
    <li> product and delivery was good</li>
    <li> I have been using Neova for 15 years. I love it! When you apply it, it is not the least bit greasy. It is more creamy&lt;br /&gt;and disappears in your skin. I get a lot of compliments on my complexion, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s due to NEOVA!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading what was recommended for my skin type in Beverly Hills Beauty Secrets (http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470294035/ref&#x3D;wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;colid&#x3D;HW3MTJZGW17T&amp;coliid&#x3D;IW9Q8QWBX4S9A). My skin is oily so most products never really absorb into my skin. This is hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Your skin soaks it up, and it makes you look radiant. There&#x27;s no other word for it. It&#x27;s one of the few products where I can tell the difference when I do/don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hands as my face does not like the product. I will see how it does on my hands</li>
    <li> Great product! It takes a few weeks, but definite improvement in skin.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had cheaper products work much better. gave it a 2star bc it was not greasy but otherwise nothing else. returned it 3weeks ego and still no answer from seller. will update if i dont hear from them</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> people are constantly asking about my skin and i&#x27;m an older woman. Even my dermatologist asked which products I&#x27;m using.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using neova night therapy for 10 years. Its all about the copper peptide.  the product goes on beautifully. Its very calming, hydrating and shrinks pores.  I also use vitamin c and retinol alternately. But i use neova night therapy every single night.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating and not greasy</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for sensitive skin and much cheaper than dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I use 3 of their products and love them all.</li>
</ol>
