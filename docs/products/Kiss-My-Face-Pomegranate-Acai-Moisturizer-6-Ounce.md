      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I felt my skin was shiny even after the lotion set in &amp; since I have bangs, I felt that the lotion was aiding in more acne developing on my forehead.</li>

      <li>And let me tell you my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I find that most face lotions stings</li>
      <li>To everyone else, enjoy!</li>
      <li>I am not a scent person and love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like Bert&#x27;s bee&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>I wish this product had worked as well as promised, it felt nice and smooth when I began applying it, but after it was on it just burned a lot.</li>
      <li>I got the Pomegranate Acai moisturizer in the mail and love it.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m sure this works for a lot of people (the reviews were mostly awesome which is why I purchased it), it totally didn&#x27;t work on my face.</li>
      <li>I love Kiss My Face soaps</li>
      <li>love it because it doesn&#x27;t have junk ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>lol when I woke up this morning my face was still very soft</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>A great all-over, general moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I also love that it has super fruits, is pH balanced, is biodegradable, and is made in the United States of America.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs well, isn&#x27;t too heavy and smells delicious (without being overpowering).</li>
      <li>It also goes on smoothly, without being sticky or oily.</li>
      <li>It is light and not sticky at all.  </li>
      <li>My Face Pomegranate Acai Moisturizer is light, non-greasy, and truly hydrates your skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and smells sweet.</li>
      <li>Product absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>They are friendly to my skin and eyes.  </li>
      <li>I am trying to be more conscious of what I put on my body and in my body and this product is a healthy and affordable one.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is not greasy, it gets absorbed into the skin very quickly.</li>
      <li>People always love it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the scent of pomegranate acai is.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!!!!</li>
      <li>Its super mosturizing.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin to most products.  </li>
      <li>I love that their products are all natural.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel right on there.  </li>
      <li>At first I was not sure what I thought of the scent because floral and fruity scents do not always smell good on me, but it was surprisingly fresh, light, and uplifting.</li>
      <li>I love that I put this on and felt just as good as the super expensive moisturisers.</li>
      <li>While most of these oils are low on the comedogenic scale (acne causing), coconut oil rates</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is lightly scented, non-greasy and makes you hands and body feel soft.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this item it is not overwhelming, it rubs in quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I am usually very picky about lotion, and unfortunately do not use moisturizers as much as I should, but will definitely use this one more.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin super soft!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, fruity and natural in feel and scent, not perfumey!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know but it has too much berry-like, fruity smell.</li>
      <li>I have found a product that my whole family loves even my husband.</li>
      <li>I am very picky.  </li>
      <li>Natural subtle scent with great absorption and no greasy residual.</li>
      <li>I have tried various things over the years and have a cupboard full of them.</li>
      <li>I like how this lotion absorbs into my skin quickly as it can get pretty dry.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was super worried because I never had a facial moisturizer that didn&#x27;t cause me to break out in turn, but I decided to try this from reviews on it and by golly</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance when you first put it on (a little goes a long way) and then it dissipates.  </li>
      <li>I read the ingredients and they&#x27;re full of natural oils, which are great ingredients for moisturizing but unfortunately can lead to breakouts if left on the face.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and while it may seem slightly greasy while applying, it goes in fast.</li>
      <li>This new scent from Kiss</li>
      <li>Well, being half-asian, I inherited the sensitive, oily/combination skin from my mother &amp; am really particular about what goes on my face.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my face and the first time I applied it, it burned and turned my face rather red.</li>
      <li>took a few years off my face diminishing some of my fine lines.</li>
      <li>I would go back to my Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream for Dry Skin which is about the same price.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is subtle and leaves a fresh, energizing feeling once the lotion is absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I live in NY where winter wreaks havoc on skin, especially the inside heat!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I almost gave this four stars, but I just love it. The smell is amazing, it makes my face so silky, and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to soak in. After I shower or wash my face and dry off, my face gets itchy from the dryness it experiences. I always run to put a dime sized amount on my hands and rub it all over my face and neck. It smells great and absorbs so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super worried because I never had a facial moisturizer that didn&#x27;t cause me to break out in turn, but I decided to try this from reviews on it and by golly I don&#x27;t break out! I do here and there from my girl hormones and all, but not from the lotion I use daily which is this stuff. Oy vey, I looove it. I just wish I had gotten a smaller size so that I could get it in other scents to try them all. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice! I love that I put this on and felt just as good as the super expensive moisturisers. I find that most face lotions stings so I was very happy when this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> it smells really good</li>
    <li> My skin was really dry after washing every night. I found this on amazon and wanted to give it a try upon reading other reviews. The smell is like berries, its nice! Its super mosturizing. Il wake up in the am on my skin will still feel like it just got mosturized! I use it with philsoderm also bought of amazon. And let me tell you my skin has never looked better. I am acne prone and this and my face wash cleared it and evened out my skin tone! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> A very nice, light smell.  Product absorbs quickly and easily.  Leaves my skin super soft!  I will definitely repurchase this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know but it has too much berry-like, fruity smell. It makes me drool for the sour berry scent.  I like Bert&#x27;s bee&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m sure this works for a lot of people (the reviews were mostly awesome which is why I purchased it), it totally didn&#x27;t work on my face. I have pretty clear skin and hardly ever get pimples, and after using this for a few days my entire face is breaking out. I read the ingredients and they&#x27;re full of natural oils, which are great ingredients for moisturizing but unfortunately can lead to breakouts if left on the face. Oil ingredients include: sunflower seed oil, shea butter, coconut oil, olive fruit oil, grape seed oil, bran oil, and acai fruit oil. While most of these oils are low on the comedogenic scale (acne causing), coconut oil rates a whopping 4 (the scale is from 0-5, 5 being the worst).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to write this as a warning in case you know your skin has problems with any of these oils. To everyone else, enjoy! I&#x27;m using it on my hands and feet now.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and goes on okay.  It burned and made my face breakout. I just use it on my body.</li>
    <li> This is a really good lotion if you want something that can be used both on the face and body. The consistency is not too watery nor too thick. Pomegranate/acai is a great scent as well.</li>
    <li> I love their products and this is another great one. Natural subtle scent with great absorption and no greasy residual.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to most products.  I swear that Kiss My Face products.  They are friendly to my skin and eyes.  They don&#x27;t dry out my skin and they don&#x27;t clog my pores.  I have tried various things over the years and have a cupboard full of them. But the best things I have tried are always on the natural side.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and everyone who comes over uses it and loves it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this item it is not overwhelming, it rubs in quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kiss My Face products for 5 years. They make it easy to try something new when I have never been disappointed! This lotion is no exception. The scent smells great but is not overbearing; and the lotion rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a grease residue. I love that their products are all natural. I always keep extra soaps and lotions on hand for gifts (its the perfect hostess gift). People always love it as much as I do. Kiss My Face makes me feel great! I will be stocking up on this product.</li>
    <li> I like how this lotion absorbs into my skin quickly as it can get pretty dry.  It also smells great and is not too thick or thin.  I have tried using this on my combination skin face and it doesn&#x27;t feel right on there.  I believe it has clogged my pores and caused a pimple here and there.</li>
    <li> I wish this product had worked as well as promised, it felt nice and smooth when I began applying it, but after it was on it just burned a lot. Really disappointed, I thought this one would work on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer tops the bill for someone like me.  I am very picky.  I like this one because it isn&#x27;t oily, greasy or stinky!  It has a nice fragrance when you first put it on (a little goes a long way) and then it dissipates.  Perfect for anyone on the go.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and usually break out try new moisturizers but this one did not make me break out. Not only did it not make me break out but I started noticing that my skin looked clearer and smother and younger.  Also i am a grandmother of alot i wont even mention the number cause you wouldnt believe me if I told you. My close friends and family started telling me that my face looked good and what was I using. So far,I let it be my own little secret took a few years off my face diminishing some of my fine lines.I will soon try to mix this with an oil that is good for my face. Love it! Love it! Love it! My face has never looked better and if your fishing for compliments this is the way to go! I have tried almost everything and nothing has done it&#x27;s job.  I actually just bought this for moisturising my body but tried it on my face and thank God I did!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product! It&#x27;s not too strong and smells sweet. It also goes on smoothly, without being sticky or oily. It&#x27;s also great that it is made in the U.S.A.!</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face Pomegranate Acai Moisturizer is light, non-greasy, and truly hydrates your skin.  The fragrance is subtle and leaves a fresh, energizing feeling once the lotion is absorbed.  Whether your skin is very dry or normal - it would benefit from this moisturizer.  There&#x27;s no \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling left after use and no overwhelming \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; smell.  It is nourishment for skin!</li>
    <li> I almost did not buy this because I saw that some people said it smelled to fruity but for me I liked it and I thought the moisturizer was amazing! I used it as soon as I got and my face feels like a baby butt lol when I woke up this morning my face was still very soft so I would say only use once a day. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my face and the first time I applied it, it burned and turned my face rather red. You&#x27;d think that would get some stars knocked off my rating, but it only burned that one time, so no biggie. It smells fantastic and while it may seem slightly greasy while applying, it goes in fast.</li>
    <li> I just received Kiss My Face&#x27;s Pomegranate Acai Moisturizer and I love it! This moisturizer is lightly scented, non-greasy and makes you hands and body feel soft. I have found a product that my whole family loves even my husband. The scent is not too over powering for a man too use. Thanks so much!!!!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin but this makes my face too oily. I would go back to my Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream for Dry Skin which is about the same price.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works well, and isn&#x27;t overly feminine. My mom likes their lavender flavor as well.  I highly recommend it...</li>
    <li> Ever since I could remember, I&#x27;ve always HATED putting on lotion; I was either too impatient for it to soak in or the lotion was too thick/oily. Well, being half-asian, I inherited the sensitive, oily/combination skin from my mother &amp; am really particular about what goes on my face. I heard great reviews for this &amp; so I took the plunge and bought this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell can kinda put you off; it&#x27;s a strange sweet, not really overbearing, but definitely noticeable. As well as that, it&#x27;s very thick and a little goes a long way, I&#x27;d say maybe a dime-sized amount or less for your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using it a while ago, but for me personally I didn&#x27;t like the results. I felt my skin was shiny even after the lotion set in &amp; since I have bangs, I felt that the lotion was aiding in more acne developing on my forehead. Perhaps this is just a me problem, for so many people have great things to say about this product and brand, but I think I&#x27;ll go lotion-less for now.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It absorbs well, isn&#x27;t too heavy and smells delicious (without being overpowering). A great all-over, general moisturizer. Another great product by Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> I love Kiss My Face soaps, I have been buying them for years, but I actually never try their moisturizer until I was recently sent one to review. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the scent of pomegranate acai is. However, I was even more impressed by the quality of this product. The moisturizer is not greasy, it gets absorbed into the skin very quickly. Most importantly, it keeps my skin moisturized. Although the product costs more than what I would like, I do think it is a great product. It is definitely a splurge that I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending money on.</li>
    <li> I got the Pomegranate Acai moisturizer in the mail and love it. I am usually very picky about lotion, and unfortunately do not use moisturizers as much as I should, but will definitely use this one more. It is very light and after it is rubbed in has a nice finish because it does not feel sticky or greasy. At first I was not sure what I thought of the scent because floral and fruity scents do not always smell good on me, but it was surprisingly fresh, light, and uplifting. Kiss My Face Pomegranate Acai Moisturizer is a wonderful product and I love that it is good for my skin because it does not have parabens or phthalates, was not tested on animals, or contain animal byproducts. I also love that it has super fruits, is pH balanced, is biodegradable, and is made in the United States of America.  I am trying to be more conscious of what I put on my body and in my body and this product is a healthy and affordable one.</li>
    <li> nice moisturizer.  love it because it doesn&#x27;t have junk ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> This new scent from Kiss My Face is wonderful!  It&#x27;s fresh, fruity and natural in feel and scent, not perfumey!  I am not a scent person and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the olive oil lotion for over 20 yrs and swear by it.  I live in NY where winter wreaks havoc on skin, especially the inside heat!  this is the best lotion i&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!!  yum!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It is light and not sticky at all.  Plus, the scent is very pleasant and not overpowering.  My husband even uses it when we travel, and he hates smelly lotions!!  Definitely will be buying this again!</li>
