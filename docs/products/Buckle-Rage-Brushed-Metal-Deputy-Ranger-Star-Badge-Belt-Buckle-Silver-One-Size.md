      <li>but i still am totally in love with it</li>
      <li>Absolutly love it ...</li>
      <li>It will cost me more in shipping to return this garbage and then have to beg for a $9.20 refund, which will not include my return shipping cost.</li>
      <li>love it wear it all the time.</li>
      <li>Purchased this thinking WOW, what a great price...</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and has a strong hook to hook to a belt.</li>
      <li>They are cheap made.</li>
      <li>Great finish with polished star and brushed surround.</li>
      <li>It has fit every belt to which I have fastened it.</li>
      <li>On top of it being rather large for a buckle</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it, because of the cool design,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>The top start point is not pointing straight up, its pointing to about the ONE O&#x27;clock position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The buckle fit my inch and a half wide belt perfectly and seems strong and secure.</li>
      <li>Good quality brushed metal and a overall good solid product.</li>
      <li>I finally had to settle for a belt only version that isn&#x27;t great but will do for now.</li>
      <li>the top of the star is pointing to the left.  </li>
      <li>This is heavy duty and a good size.  </li>
      <li>This is a fine belt buckle, although I was initially looking for the one Dane Cook the standup comedian has.</li>
      <li>The buckle is very shiny in spite of the \\&quot;brushed\\&quot; finish, but I like it that way-</li>
      <li>the star isn&#x27;t straight up like in the picture, it&#x27;s like</li>
      <li>I like the finish,which is one of the reasons why i bought it, but this was assembled very cheaply compared to other buckles.</li>
      <li>Mainly because it is a star within a circle.</li>
      <li>it goes really well with it and makes a nice little western look.  </li>
      <li>I rarely wear it, because it just doesn&#x27;t feel solid.</li>
      <li>I suspect the reason this item has a low price with higher shipping cost is so that you can&#x27;t get much of a refund.  </li>
      <li>The problem is that it was manufactured in such a way that when you attach your belt and buckle it, the star is positioned with a distinctive cant to the right.</li>
      <li>its nice and big and heavy decent quality.........</li>
      <li>Now the friend asks the exact same</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the star being crooked (the point will not point straight up), then this could be the buckle for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My western style cowboy rig really catches the eye with this replacement buckle installed.</li>
      <li>I received this item promptly and it was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how other people are wearing it crooked, it&#x27;s always pointed right for me</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The metal of this belt buckle is great quality.  It is capable of everyday use with less than expected wear.  It has fit every belt to which I have fastened it.</li>
    <li> It looks awesome. The Star and circle is one solid piece.&lt;br /&gt;But the connecting piece that is there to hold the belt leather&lt;br /&gt;can come off if you pulled it hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;This probably won&#x27;t happen with regular use,&lt;br /&gt;but I like my things stronger than they need to be,&lt;br /&gt;so that there&#x27;s no possibility of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it, because of the cool design,&lt;br /&gt;but I rarely wear it, because it just doesn&#x27;t feel solid.</li>
    <li> This is a fine belt buckle, although I was initially looking for the one Dane Cook the standup comedian has. It is sturdy and has a strong hook to hook to a belt. The crazy problem I ran into was finding a belt that would accept another buckle. I finally had to settle for a belt only version that isn&#x27;t great but will do for now. [[ASIN:B0049M1ZUO Famous Star Marshall Law Texas Star Belt Buckle Silver]]</li>
    <li> Received my buckle before due date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the buckle, reminds me of the old western movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought a mossy oak-shot gun shell concho belt to go along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The star is shiny and the ring is brushed, to make the star stand out strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging flimsy, just shoved in an envelope, I think it need some padding to protect the finish of buckle..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, very pleased with the buckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommends seller and product.</li>
    <li> These are to big. They are cheap made. The star is set wrong, won&#x27;t set straight on the belt. I was going to hand them out to little kids. They look so bad and cheap I wouldn&#x27;t give one to anyone. Trashed them all! These are nothing but junk.</li>
    <li> Absolutly love it ...its nice and big and heavy decent quality.........everybody at work loves it too....just had to tighten the belt loop conected to the buckle with a pair of pliers that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> It is sometimes difficult to tell what something is really going to be from an image on a computer screen. I received this item promptly and it was exactly what I expected it to be. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Well built for the price.  Nice and shiny.  Did&#x27;t have any issue with the star not pointing up.  Could be a little sturdier where it attaches to the belt strap.</li>
    <li> bought a belt off of here and needed a buckle for it.  it goes really well with it and makes a nice little western look.  would recommend</li>
    <li> love it wear it all the time. it looks kind of dorky but i still am totally in love with it</li>
    <li> I like the finish,which is one of the reasons why i bought it, but this was assembled very cheaply compared to other buckles. The bracket where the belt loops through doesn&#x27;t stay in place so it&#x27;s always needing to be adjusted.</li>
    <li> This is heavy duty and a good size.  It goes great with my vintage distressed belt and cowboy boots.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> The buckle fit my inch and a half wide belt perfectly and seems strong and secure. Great finish with polished star and brushed surround.</li>
    <li> I like this belt buckle a lot. Mainly because it is a star within a circle. Also because it is metal. And also because it is a belt buckle.</li>
    <li> This buckle is of much higher quality than other buckles I have bought in the past.  It looks great and I get a lot of compliments on it.  I don&#x27;t know how other people are wearing it crooked, it&#x27;s always pointed right for me (I have seen with other buckles and other reviewers that some people don&#x27;t seem to know how to wear belt buckles).  This is a great buckle.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it still hasn&#x27;t had any tarnish on it (worn every day).</li>
    <li> I got this belt buckle for a friend for his birthday and he loves the belt buckle. Good quality brushed metal and a overall good solid product.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the star being crooked (the point will not point straight up), then this could be the buckle for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that is clearly not what the buckle should look like.  I suspect the reason this item has a low price with higher shipping cost is so that you can&#x27;t get much of a refund.  If only the other review had appeared before I ordered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the defective product and the shady pricing, I&#x27;m calling shenanigans on this one.</li>
    <li> Purchased this thinking WOW, what a great price...however, when it arrived, I knew I&#x27;d just been sold defective China made manufacturing junk that should have been melted down and recast. The problem is that it was manufactured in such a way that when you attach your belt and buckle it, the star is positioned with a distinctive cant to the right. Meaning, the star is lopsided. The top start point is not pointing straight up, its pointing to about the ONE O&#x27;clock position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that this was a manufacturing defect and the star belt buckle was not originally designed this way. SO, instead of putting this manufacturing mistake into the garbage at the factory, they decided to send it out to be sold to gullible Americans. It will cost me more in shipping to return this garbage and then have to beg for a $9.20 refund, which will not include my return shipping cost.</li>
    <li> The good thing - it&#x27;s nice to wear. Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use. Now the friend asks the exact same</li>
    <li> When ever I wear this buckle the star isn&#x27;t straight up like in the picture, it&#x27;s like the top of the star is pointing to the left.  On top of it being rather large for a buckle I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the negative reviews.  The buckle I received was NOT crooked- it looks great and feels sturdy.  The size was perfect for a [[ASIN:B008MPV9C8 standard 1.5\\&quot; belt]].  The buckle is very shiny in spite of the \\&quot;brushed\\&quot; finish, but I like it that way- after all, you don&#x27;t wear a buckle like this to be unnoticed.  And, at ~$7.50 as of this writing, it doesn&#x27;t get much less expensive!  I&#x27;ve purchased several belt buckles from Amazon and have yet to be disappointed, so go on and put this one in your shopping cart- worry free!</li>
    <li> My western style cowboy rig really catches the eye with this replacement buckle installed. Don&#x27;t Gunslinger practice but look the part anyway.</li>
