      <li>Plus you couldn&#x27;t use it to warm clothes, socks, underwear, etc.</li>
      <li>the towel is nice and warm (like out of the dryer she says).  </li>
      <li>Also it says it will warm up in 20 minutes and auto shut off in 50.  </li>
      <li>It should not take 25 mins to get the towel warm.</li>
      <li>She was with us and used our towel warmer and liked it a lot</li>
      <li>Also, my wife puts her pajamas in there to warm them up.  </li>
      <li>Plan to have your towel in here for 45 minutes for it to actually warm up.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my husband as a Christmas gift, thinking that it would be a nice luxury to have warm towels when getting out of the shower.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;4. Makes my towel sufficiently warm so that I don&#x27;t have to curl up in a ball and quiver as I exit the shower in the winter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 93-year-old mother for Christmas to warm her clothes, etc.</li>
      <li>It fits our room well and looks nice as well.</li>
      <li>It is nice looking</li>
      <li>It gets warm</li>
      <li>but if you should roll up two towels side by side, they get slightly warm.  </li>
      <li>If u have time to wait for a warm blanket</li>
      <li>There was no bag to transport it or handles that would make it so on its own.  </li>
      <li>Works nicely except for having to turn it off then on again to keep it heating during use.</li>
      <li>it sort of works, takes a lot of planning to get a warm towel though.  </li>
      <li>ran it through two consecutive cycles and my bath towel was barely warm.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a warm towel after you shower then this is not the product.  </li>
      <li>I would hesitate to even call the towel warm after I removed it from the bin.</li>
      <li>The Pollenex towel warmer does not get your towel warm.</li>
      <li>I put her clothes in while she is in the bathroom brushing teeth, etc., and they are nicely warmed.</li>
      <li>Warms my towels so I could feel warm and toasty when I get out of the shower/bath&lt;</li>
      <li>The unit itself is nice looking.  </li>
      <li>and I thought I would surprise him with his own towel warmer.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing like coming out of th shower and wrapping a warm towel around you.  </li>
      <li>I like this towel warmer and it does warm the towels, but it takes a while to warm up,  </li>
      <li>warm all the way thru even in 1/2 hour.  </li>
      <li>My son likes to have his towel all nice and warm</li>
      <li>I can understand why it is done this way, because they do not want to get sued if the towel is hottt because it could burn someone but the towel is nice and warm</li>
      <li>It does take about 20 min to get really nice and toasty but it does stay on for an hour or two.</li>
      <li>I would have liked the towel to come out pipping hot instead of real warm.</li>
      <li>This towel warmer worked adequately, didn&#x27;t get real warm, but did okay.</li>
      <li>It warms them quickly and the auto turnoff is a great feature.</li>
      <li>Many reviews on this product said how it takes a while to warm up</li>
      <li>The construction and quality are also very cheap, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
      <li>Works great, and not too large which makes it convenient.</li>
      <li>but you could get a better experience by tossing your towels in your clothes dryer when you are in the shower.</li>
      <li>okay...</li>
      <li>Just drop the towels in rather than fold or roll them and it works better for more warmth.</li>
      <li>and I find that using 1 towel works better for me.  </li>
      <li>This product has been so enjoyable for my father.  </li>
      <li>Does OK.  </li>
      <li>but it is just OK.</li>
      <li>Better at 50.  </li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t pay more, this is more than sufficient - this is a luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;And if you&#x27;re finding yourself whining about your towel warmer, stop for a second, look around you, and realize that your life is just the best, isn&#x27;t it?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The unit feels cheap, has capacity for about 2-3 towels and warms them pretty good but it is just OK. The lid is plastic so that is a plus and doesn&#x27;t take long to warm. You&#x27;ll feel like royalty with this!</li>
    <li> The unit works after a fashion.  It takes a full thirty minutes to get the towels just &amp;#34;luke-warm&amp;#34;,  We expected warmer towels.</li>
    <li> If u have time to wait for a warm blanket it&#x27;s wonderful takes around twenty minutes to warm up.comes out similar to the ones we use at the hospital</li>
    <li> Does what it does! Takes a while to heat up, which is stated in the instructions, but gets everything nice and toasty! And I don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;weird smell&amp;#34; people are taking about when you run it the first few times, but I guess I got lucky! No weird-smelling towels for me!</li>
    <li> Does OK.  Towel gets warmer than room temperature in the 20 minutes.  Better at 50.  Depends on the towel as well.</li>
    <li> awful, not big enough for a small towel.</li>
    <li> Ivory is pretty ethically questionable as an anniversary present these days, so I just went with a similar color.  The room in this is pretty amazing, though getting two full sized bath sheets in can take some creative rolling.  It does take at least 20min to get everything heated fully through, so you have to start it well before you start your shower if you want maximum warmth.</li>
    <li> It does not get as warm as I expected.  Maybe in the winter months, it will seem a lot warmer.</li>
    <li> This towel warmer worked adequately, didn&#x27;t get real warm, but did okay. Used a dozen times, then it quit working all of a sudden. Of course, just a couple weeks after the return window.</li>
    <li> It takes a really long time to warm up so put your towel in and do something for 15-20 minutes before you get in the shower. Then the towel is warm but not hot and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Great item for price !  Heats up 2 towels. Has auto shut off.  Would buy against  with a great price!</li>
    <li> Just ok nothing great to slow on getting the towels warm. It should not take 25 mins to get the towel warm.</li>
    <li> Use it every day and it has worked flawlessly for over a year.</li>
    <li> Great gift idea, and this was the best price around. FAST shipping too. A little bit on the smaller side than I thought it would be, but it suits the purpose.</li>
    <li> Awesome it really works! I strongly think every one should get one its well worth the money paid for it</li>
    <li> Does not warm towels enough and you have to wait a long time !  Cannot compare to the one we previously had.  I had to return it!</li>
    <li> This is really awesome.  Love having warm towels on a cold day.  It takes a few minutes to warm up the towels so I suggest starting the warmer awhile before starting your shower!!!</li>
    <li> i debated whether to get a heated towel rack or the container.&lt;br /&gt;after reading reviews went with this. i use it for my massage clients.&lt;br /&gt;2 med towels would be ok. but if they were both really lge, you&lt;br /&gt;might want to get a bigger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My clients love it!</li>
    <li> This towel warmer took 50 minutes to heat up.  Who has time for that?  The description says 15 minutes which would be fine but not the case.  It&#x27;s going back!</li>
    <li> I purchased this towel warmer in August, and it&#x27;s already burned out.  At first, I was pleased with it.  However, within the last three days, it has stopped being a towel warmer, and has become a place to store your towel while you shower.  It worked perfectly for exactly a month.  After the month passed, and was no longer able to be returned, it stopped working completely.  It was not dropped, damaged, or abused in any way.  It was used twice a day for one month and is now only usable as a plastic storage box.  Do not purchase this item.</li>
    <li> It warms the towels a little,but not as much as I thought it would. I wanted it to be very warm.</li>
    <li> It does take about 20 min to get really nice and toasty but it does stay on for an hour or two.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it every morning and loves it. She insists warm towels absorb more moisture than cold towels. Our daughter has used it a couple times and now wants the extra warmer I have.</li>
    <li> This warmer works great and does not have any smell associated with it like some of the other warmers I checked into. My only complaint is that it is not big enough to hold two bath sheets,  which is what we use.  I haven&#x27;t tried two standard bath towels.  The warming is very even and the automatic shutoff safety feature works perfectly.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this and loves it.  Before her shower she puts in her towel and clothes and they&#x27;re nice and warm for her when she gets out.  Sometimes I warm her robe before she wakes up in the morning so she can wrap up in it when she gets up.  I would definitely recommend this over a rack warmer.  We had a rack warmer and it only warmed parts of the towel.  Plus you couldn&#x27;t use it to warm clothes, socks, underwear, etc.</li>
    <li> Towel doesn&#x27;t get as warm as I expected.  Also it says it will warm up in 20 minutes and auto shut off in 50.  Not true...warms in 20 turns off in 30 so you have 10 minute window which just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job. I love it. Use sheet sized bath towels. Best for the price. Would recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> This works well on smaller towels - not on bath sheets! It just cannot get the heat through the thicker towels</li>
    <li> Our last towel warmer gave out and we replaced it with this lower priced model. Plan to have your towel in here for 45 minutes for it to actually warm up. We just purchased one of the tall cone shaped ones to replace this one. That&#x27;s the type that we had before and it&#x27;s excellent. Every time I try to save money, it seems I get what I pay for.</li>
    <li> this works great we love it I use it for heating up my towels for facials I would recommend this item</li>
    <li> Towel Warmer was exactly what were were looking for.  Our bathroom is not very big and it fit perfectly!  The only thing is I wish it would get warmer than it already does.  It gets warm but if you should roll up two towels side by side, they get slightly warm.  I use only one towel at a time and don&#x27;t roll it up.  It then gets warmer.  Otherwise, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Was advertised as &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34;.  There was no bag to transport it or handles that would make it so on its own.  Works nicely except for having to turn it off then on again to keep it heating during use.</li>
    <li> it sort of works, takes a lot of planning to get a warm towel though.  Not sure I would buy it again</li>
    <li> it is a small, neat tidy package which does warm bath sheets.  it states that it shuts off after 50 minutes, but i suspect they mean 15.  when i take long showers, i sometimes turn it on twice to have the towels warmer.  the towels do not come out hot, but they are not cold, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all it is a comforting feeling and i am glad i purchased it.</li>
    <li> We were really looking forward to warm towels.  I&#x27;ve always wanted a towel warmer.  When it arrived, I convinced my husband to try it..  To my disappointment it never heated, even if we left it on for 45 minutes  We tried it for a dozen times hoping it just needed to &#x27;break in&#x27; since it was new.  We&#x27;re sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would hold more.  I can barely fit two bath towels in and they don&#x27;t seem to&lt;br /&gt;get warm all the way thru even in 1/2 hour.  I will use it, but I am not delighted with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for Christmas to give to my brothers lady friend who was starting up in the massage industry.  She was really happy to get it and loves it.</li>
    <li> I had a previous warmer that I purchased from Brookstone. Was excellent, my towel was hot in about 6-7 minutes. After about 10 yrs. using it , it died. This Pollenex was terrrible. Took 20 minutes to &amp;#34; barely warm&amp;#34; the  towel. Who takes 20 minute showers and the towel was only slightly warmer than cold! I was &amp;#34;very disappointed&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> 16 months old and kaput.  This has not been used much and I am very angry that it just plain stopped working.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing, that&#x27;s for sure. Many reviews on this product said how it takes a while to warm up, you can only fit 1-2 towels, it doesn&#x27;t get too hot, etc.; but I think of it this way: this product...&lt;br /&gt;1. Warms my towels so I could feel warm and toasty when I get out of the shower/bath&lt;br /&gt;2. Does so without raising my electric bill to a whole new level&lt;br /&gt;3. Warms it in a way that wouldn&#x27;t cause any burns or anything&lt;br /&gt;4. Makes my towel sufficiently warm so that I don&#x27;t have to curl up in a ball and quiver as I exit the shower in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;5. Didn&#x27;t cost me a fortune and a half&lt;br /&gt;6. Doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space in my house&lt;br /&gt;7. Is easy for me to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an absolutely great item. If you&#x27;re looking for something more, and are willing to pay hundreds of dollars — you have plenty other things to choose from. If you can&#x27;t pay more, this is more than sufficient - this is a luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re finding yourself whining about your towel warmer, stop for a second, look around you, and realize that your life is just the best, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> product appears undamaged, however, TWO cardboard boxes which item was contained in have a 3 to 4 inch sort of round&lt;br /&gt;large gaping hole  .  I am hoping item will not be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Believe shipping should be credited to my account because of this damage.&lt;br /&gt;Also inner box was not taped just lying open turned sideways/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would appreciate your response on this damage.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on how this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or takes 20 minutes to heat up.  So I was prepared for that.  Living in a cold place, let me tell you, wrapping yourself in a warm towel after a shower is a little piece of heaven.  I love it.  It&#x27;s not as hot as I would like it but it definitely hits the spot on a cold day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother as a Christmas gift this year. she turned it on once and then it wouldnt turn on again. Amazon was very good with my return and issued a full refund without any problem.</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular brand and style of towel warmers based on the reviews.  It was a Christmas gift for my 97 year old mother in law who lives with us.  She has loved having a nice warm towel after her showers.  This takes awhile to heat up so we start it first thing in the morning.  Once it does reach its peak it will stay there for 50 minutes before it shuts off so we sometimes have to play a guessing game with since my MIL doesn&#x27;t always get up at the same time!!  We like it, tho and would order it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thing that nice to have if you have extra room near the plug can storage it.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up a little bit slow. Normally takes 20 mins. when I place 2 bath towels in there.&lt;br /&gt;Design is clean.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews that this towel warmer takes time to heat the towels and I let the towel heat the full time while I was taking a bath. I would hesitate to even call the towel warm after I removed it from the bin. The warmer feels warm, but it does not produce enough heat to warm the towel, it didn&#x27;t feel much different than a room temperature towel. I tried it twice and then returned it.</li>
    <li> Not so much a towel warmer more a towel not freezing cold.</li>
    <li> This unit actually does a good job of heating towels--it just takes much longer to do than it says it does. When you turn it on, a red light glows for 20 minutes, then the light turns green, indicating that your towels are ready. The green light then stays on for another 30 minutes, after which the unit will shut itself off. Here&#x27;s the problem: The green light comes on way too early. So if you think your towels are ready when the light turns green, you&#x27;ll be disappointed by cold spots and unevenness. But if you know this flaw, and simply give the thing about another ten minutes (i.e., a full 30 minutes of warm-up time), you&#x27;ll be rewarded with nice hot-out-of-the-dryer towels. I hope this review helps you.</li>
    <li> She was with us and used our towel warmer and liked it a lot so we got her one for Christmas and she loves it as the towel is warm when getting out of shower.</li>
    <li> I have had two towel warmers (of a different brand - no longer manufactured) so I do have some expectations of what this should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting as long as 30, and sometimes 45, minutes the towels were room temperature.  The inside walls of this warmer were very warm, but that had not been transferred to the towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this every day for two weeks, and never was satisfied with its performance.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my hard to shop for mom. She opened it immediately to use which is a first! Shortly after her shower, I got an email about how well it worked! Then next morning my dad who thought it was a goofy gift tried it. He also raved about it.</li>
    <li> It works great. A warm towel makes huge difference when drying off on those cold days. \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note for this warmer for me is that it warms better with only one towel inside. if you roll up two full size towels and stuff them in like the picture shows, it may only warm the parts of the towel touching the inside wall of the heater.</li>
    <li> When I leave for work, I drop the kids scarves, hats and gloves in here and switch it on. Then, they are nice and warm for the ride to school!</li>
    <li> I purchased one for me and two as unique gifts. As others have mentioned this warmer gets your towels warm not hot. This is wonderful if your bathroom is a little chilly. I also liked the two suggestions of a timer (set 20 mins before your normal shower time) and putting one towel loosely into the machine (not 2 and not tightly rolled).</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> 1)It takes 30-40 min to get to full heat.  I do not take 30 min showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Full heat in this case means luke warm (at best).  After 40 min, I expected to have an &amp;#34;Out of the Dryer&amp;#34; experience.  Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned after 1 day.</li>
    <li> Cant live without it.</li>
    <li> I live in Illinois and it has been so cold here for the last month.  Every time I step out of the shower, I thank myself for purchasing this for myself.  The towel heats up to a very toasty warm and it stays heated until I am ready to dress.  The cord is a great length so you are able to plug it up high and sit it down low. It fits two large towels, but I mainly heat one at a time.</li>
    <li> It does not work. There is no heat. The red and green lights work, but no heat whatsoever is produced. Unfortunately I waited too long to take it out of the box and try to use it, so I can&#x27;t return it. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This is  a must on the cold days near Lake Ontario. Step out of the bath/shower into a warm embrace (towel wise) !!</li>
    <li> Towel heated to luke warm at best could have been defective....sent back... Still debating if I will reorder or upgrade to a different one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this. Only small towel fits and it takes 20 minutes to warm up and only gets towel luke warm</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 90 year old mother.  She loves having warm fluffy towels when she baths.  I t works great.</li>
    <li> It takes a while  to heat the towels (by this I mean that it takes 2 or 3 heating cycles to warm towels to the point that they&#x27;re warm enough to satisfy me).  That&#x27;s the biggest drawback for me.  I heat two large size bath towels at a time.  The unit itself is nice looking.  I store it in a bathroom closet and bring it out and plug it in for 1 to 1 1/2 hours before I plan to take my bath.  I bathe at night so it&#x27;s no problem to do this but for people taking a quick shower in the morning, it might not heat up quickly enough.&lt;br /&gt;It does feel luxurious when you exit the tub and have a warm towel to encircle you but the towels don&#x27;t retain the heat for very long after being removed from the container.</li>
    <li> this is the greatest thing since sliced bread, hot towel after a hot shower, I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys total comfort</li>
    <li> This did not heat up sufficiently to do the job we wanted it to once we got out of the hot tub.</li>
    <li> The Towel Warmer performed as advertised,  It heats up the towel to a conferrable level.  I would recommend this warmer for house use only.</li>
    <li> I like this towel warmer and it does warm the towels, but it takes a while to warm up,  You need to put the towels in 30-45 minutes before you need them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 towels and I find that using 1 towel works better for me.  Just drop the towels in rather than fold or roll them and it works better for more warmth.</li>
    <li> OMG this is a great thing to have when you live in the North and your hot tub is in the garage. I put the towels in and when we are done they are just the right temp to keep you from freezing before you get back inside. I am going to order a 2nd one of these to have so that everyone gets a nice warm towel to wrap up in. I put 2 of my large bath sheets and they came out nice and toasty. Not hot just perfect.</li>
    <li> I am glad I got this warmer.  It&#x27;s awesome to have a warm towel.  I got one for me and one for my son.</li>
    <li> Really I&#x27;m not thrilled with this item. It takes a very long time to warm a towel. It also only holds one towel at a time so it&#x27;s a one person benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent in regards to materials used. It&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing and fits well on our kitchen counter.</li>
    <li> Product does not work.  Do not recommend this at all.  Extremely dissatisfied.  Since this was a gift, it was just opened and is now outside of the return window.</li>
    <li> A gift for my wife and she really likes it.  I looked on line at all the reviews and chose this model.  Just used it for one month so hope it holds up well.  No smell at all, light weight and easy to move if you dont have a place right by the shower to keep it when not in use.  Easy to use, just place the towel inside, and push the on button. Warms a towel well if left in the container until it is timed out.  needs a little more time than it takes to shower so you need to turn it on a few minutes before you get in the shower.  will only do one towel at a time unless you would stuff two in it.  I would recommend it.  it seems like a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Poor heating and made the towels smell bad. I returned it! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, try something else!</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love the  towel warmer.  There&#x27;s nothing like coming out of th shower and wrapping a warm towel around you.  Also, my wife puts her pajamas in there to warm them up.  I would have liked the towel to come out pipping hot instead of real warm.</li>
    <li> I read reviews, and knew that it took 20 minutes to heat up, so that isn&#x27;t a issue.  Just have to plan shower or bath around it.  I find that two towels do not fit in there very well.  I guess if you were using small towels it would work, but I have thirsty towels.  Not an issue, because I only need to use one towel at a time.  On the whole, it works well, but towels do not get as hot as I would like.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 93-year-old mother for Christmas to warm her clothes, etc. She lives in the East and is always cold especially at night putting on her pajamas. I put her clothes in while she is in the bathroom brushing teeth, etc., and they are nicely warmed. I put her underclothes in for the morning as well to take the chill off. I like the square size as it holds more than the vertical tub variety and it is not too big either; it fits nicely next to her closet. it easily holds a pair of pants, a top, socks and underwear - she is small, only 5&#x27; and wears a petite 12. It heats evenly and the clothes are not wrinkled (she wears primarily knits and no-iron materials). We notice no smell as others have mentioned. I decided on the Pollenex after reading the issues with the Brookstone Towel Warmer with failures and difficulty returning. I have been an Amazon Prime member since 2010 and have always been happy with their return/refund policies. I will update if there are performance/breakage issues as we have only been using in twice a day for 3 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews, it is okay but does not really get the towels hot.  There are only two choices on amazon for something like this, the first one did not last (as the reviews reflect) so we tried this one.  But, it does work but just okay.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it. I&#x27;ve used it several times myself and it is pretty nice having a warm towel after the shower.</li>
    <li> Have had other towel warmers and this one is BAD.  Took 20 minutes to get slightly lukewarm.  Back to searching....</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom for her b-day, it does not get very warm and the second you take it out its cold, you can&#x27;t put very big towels in it either. Going to send it back,</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband as a Christmas gift, thinking that it would be a nice luxury to have warm towels when getting out of the shower. Since using it a few times, we&#x27;ve found it to take longer than expected to get warm (i.e.: if you put the towel in before you get in the shower, it&#x27;s not ready by the time your shower is done).Once the light indicates that the towels are ready, they are only &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; warm, in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there&#x27;s nothing explicitly wrong with the product, it&#x27;s definitely not living up to my expectations of nice warm towels when I get out of the shower and hard to justify the expense.</li>
    <li> This is a must have item, I just love this heater I don&#x27;t know how I live with out this for so long</li>
    <li> It does keep the towels warm but would like it to be a few degrees warmer, would be nice if it had a temperature control too.&lt;br /&gt;Using it for when we get out of the hot tub on cold days, it does feel better than a cold towel but I would rate it higher if they were coming out warmer. The size is nice for two towels so that is good, it is simple to use and looks nice.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this, she says it is the perfect size for her bathroom and keeps the towels warm and toasty</li>
    <li> Takes too long to warm a  towel. Requires remembering at least 30 minutes before showering to put it on otherwise it does not warm the towel sufficiently.</li>
    <li> It is an okay product.  It does take time to heat up and the longer you leave it in the warmer, the hotter the towel is.  I can understand why it is done this way, because they do not want to get sued if the towel is hottt because it could burn someone but the towel is nice and warm it is not the hottest thing in the world but you really do not want something that hot anyway.  It does take time to heat up but it is a good product, I put my socks and under clothes and a shirt on the bottom covered up with a towel, the key is if you want something really warm put it in the bottom of the warmer, it seems to me that the more you pack on the bottom but leave loose the warmer it gets.  Also a key is to have a timer to time to around 35 to 45 minutes to use it. It is bigger than I thought, need a timer but there no smell what so ever by this product you will not smell anything at all.  The outside is warm to the touch but will not burn you at all, and safety reasons unplug the warmer when you leave the house, it is a new appliance to me and not sure what will happen.  Overall it is a good product, a must have no, there are others to look at.</li>
    <li> I tried other warmers first and this one is amazing.  It does take 20 mins to full heat up but even if it is only in for 10 mins it gets my towels warmer than the other ones.  Not much to look at and you can&#x27;t store your towel in it but if you really want a warm towel its the way to go!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my spouse.  At first he balked because &amp;#34;heated towels are for the rich 2%, not for us workers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;He loves it now.  He has a timer on it to begin the heat at a specific time and the towel is ready when he exits the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this for all us never-pampered working stiffs.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a warm towel after you shower then this is not the product.  If you have 20 minutes to wait for the entire cycle then this product does do a good job and it&#x27;s very light.  Inside is plastic with hole in the bottom where the hot air comes through.  I awake at or before 4 a.m. every morning and my showers last about ten minutes . . . the towels were never warm by the time I got out of my shower so I returned it looking for a faster-heating model.  I previously had one with a metal interior which heated the towel/object within 10 minutes so I&#x27;m hoping the product I re-purchased will do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line . . . if you got 20 minutes to wait for a warm towel or other object, this is a good purchase at a good price.  Mon-Fri I do not and therefore, this was not a good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this warmer for my wife for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  She has tried it out for several days and it has failed to deliver any satisfactory performance.  The towel, towels, or anything else that goes in it never achieve any temperature more than slightly above room temperature, regardless of how long they are left in the device.  The construction and quality are also very cheap, in my opinion.  I have completed the return request.  I have a sister who has the Towel Spa by Brookstone and she swears by it.  I am going to try that one.</li>
    <li> I bought this like a present, and then I notice that in order to get the towel really warm, I need to use twice with each towel, that means a lot of time before take a shower or a tub bath. Anyway I&#x27;m still using this, but I certainly do not recommend this particular tower warmer.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to get a towel and underwear straight from the warm dryer in the morning, so I got this for him for his birthday.  I was just hoping that it would work well and be satisfactory.  It turned out to be one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever given him!  It is a very convenient size and shape.  It&#x27;s small enough that it could fit on a long vanity top, but I put his on a tiny table in the bathroom.  It easily holds a large, thick towel and his underwear without crowding.  Note that it does need an electrical plug, so I had to have one put in on that wall .... but it was definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Thiss was smaller than I thought which means it fits under the sink&lt;br /&gt;yet holds a bath sheet and pajamas(and perhaps more)&lt;br /&gt;How nice to wrap up in a warm towel in the winter!!</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I used to have, but is good product. Great service</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do without this on cold nights.  Before I get in the shower,  I put a towel &amp; gown in it so I can dry off with the warm towel &amp; put on the warm gown before I go to bed.  It doesn&#x27;t get very hot but warm is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a towel warmer for years and looked into many different types, even considered just buying a large crockpot, which I have actually seen used in spas before, so I know that must work. But after years of resting my curling/waving iron on my bath towel while showering to have that little section of hot towel, I finally bought this one. It&#x27;s fine, it works okay... but as many other reviewers have complained, it just doesn&#x27;t get the towels that warm. They are warm-ish but certainly not hot, and if you are longing for the spa-hot towels that you get from a spa or even from some nail salons, this is absolutely not the temperature you&#x27;re going to get. It&#x27;s better than nothing, and on cold days, it&#x27;s welcoming to have a nice, warm towel. But be sure that it&#x27;s in there the minimum of 20 minutes, or even better, the full 50 and then start it over and let it run a little longer. The main problem is, the towels don&#x27;t get hot enough to *retain* any heat, so by the time you&#x27;ve wiped your face and go to wrap yourself in the towel, it&#x27;s already lost most of its warmth. If only this item heated the towels just five degrees hotter, that would make such a difference, and I think would make people a lot more satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy on the move and don&#x27;t have time to prepare something like this in advance only to have to use it within a small window before it shuts down.  I will likely purchase a continuous heater...too impatient.</li>
    <li> During the cold, cold winters we seem to be having lately here in Texas, this made sure that I stayed nice and warm.</li>
    <li> it took a long time to warm a towel and when it did it was barely warm. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This product has been so enjoyable for my father.  He hates the cold and this has been invaluable with assisting with his showers.  It&#x27;s helped the whole process and puts him at ease.</li>
    <li> I buy lots of staff on- line, and I can truthfully tell you this is by far the most no-sense product I have purchased so far.  My son likes to have his towel all nice and warm and he gets out out of the bath and I thought I would surprise him with his own towel warmer.  Oh boy I was wrong,...after 30 minutes or so it barely warmed up about one side of the towel.  I was SO disappointed!! Hopefully somebody will come up with a gadget that really works next time.</li>
    <li> While it is elegant in appearance, and produces no noticeable smell, it fails in its main purpose.The Pollenex towel warmer does not get your towel warm. You&#x27;d be better off placing your towel on the heat register or radiator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran it through two consecutive cycles and my bath towel was barely warm. It has a warming cycle that is about 20 minutes. After 40 minutes of heating, the towel was just a little warmer than room temperature. After returning it, I bought the Brookstone towel warmer. The Brookstone truly gets the towel warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy this item. It does not warm towels.</li>
    <li> I bought these as gifts. My children love it!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this item</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for Valentines.  She loves it.  She takes baths (not showers).  She turns it on when she starts the water.  By the time she&#x27;s out of the bath the towel is nice and warm (like out of the dryer she says).  Did not smell, even after first use.  Just worked.</li>
    <li> I almost returned this. It warms towels but it&#x27;s spotty. You take the towels out and they have warm and cool spots plus the warmth disappears very quickly. It&#x27;s okay for a minute of warmth when drying off but you could get a better experience by tossing your towels in your clothes dryer when you are in the shower. Problem would be running naked to the dryer though. &amp;#60;smile&amp;#62; And yes...I have tried loosely tossing them in and rolling them up. Same thing really. What seems to help is to warm them up for 20 minutes When the green light comes on hit the button off and back on, heat for another 20 min. This takes planning though. If I had to do it over again, I&#x27;d pass on this product.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for a while now. We don&#x27;t use it as much anymore, but if you put your items in and let it run it does great. Fluff your heavy towels up and they will heat better, or run it for two cycles if you put in two heavy towels still folded up.</li>
    <li> In the winter, it&#x27;s getting cold after my 5 month old&#x27;s bath.  So we throw in his towel, his onesie, pajamas and sleep sack.  This way, he&#x27;s all warm and cozy for bedtime.  Works great, and not too large which makes it convenient.</li>
    <li> We have always wanted a towel warmer but our bath area just wasn&#x27;t set up to use a wall mounted rail type warmer. I found this unit on Amazon and the reviews were very good. I also looked at the Brookstone unit, but there seemed to be issues with odor and breakage and after purchase support. Not for me. I bought from Amazon, the unit arrived quickly and was packed well. It works great!. Yes you have to plan in advance to get the towels warm, but that&#x27;s no big deal. Just turn it on. It warms them quickly and the auto turnoff is a great feature. It fits our room well and looks nice as well. It isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the info, but the power usage is very reasonable and especially reasonable since it will only be on a short time each day. At our rates it will only cost  2-3 cents a day to use.  Very nice to have on a cold winter morning.</li>
    <li> This warmer is great for warming your towels and clothes on cold winter mornings .  I used to have a warming rack but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this does! I will probably give this as a gift next Christmas.</li>
    <li> This was actually a gift for a friend&#x27;s birthday, however she has done nothing but rave about how wonderful this product is! She uses it every time she or her daughter take a bath! And I, as the one who purchased it, was extremely please at how quickly I received the product after my order was processed, and how it was shipped (double boxed, securely). I will certainly order from Amazon.com again!</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations of a warm towel were to high.  I have used this product a couple times and have been disappointed with the temperature of the towels every time.  I did save the box so some lucky person will be getting a nice gift.  I think I will just put my towel in the dryer and have a very warm towel .  It is nice looking and it was received within a few days of ordering, but a warm towel ? not so much</li>
    <li> Returned this item. Did not get hot enough and the towels seemed damp when i removed them. Would not recommend</li>
</ol>
