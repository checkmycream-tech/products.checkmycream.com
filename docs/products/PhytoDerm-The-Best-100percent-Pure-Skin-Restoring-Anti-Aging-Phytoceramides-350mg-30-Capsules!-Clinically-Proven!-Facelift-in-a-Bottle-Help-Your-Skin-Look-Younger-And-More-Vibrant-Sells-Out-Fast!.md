<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unless  there is a change in the formula,  this is NOT  vege  capsules.  They  were gelatin,  and  it was  returned  to Amazon.</li>
    <li> So far I have not seen much change, but I will take for 3 months before I make a final decision.  I feel that you need to give a product ample time to work.</li>
    <li> See my review on Renuvaderm.  Very concerned about this product and I will not put it in my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 16 capsules in and my skin has never been this dry. I have fair skin and now I&#x27;m extremely ashy. I thought it would be great for an extra boost to my healthy skin ( I&#x27;m in my 20s) but this was actually the worst thing I could have done to my skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too soon tell yet whether its really working, but it has so many valuable vitamins along with the ceramides, that it does seem to be making a slight impact.  I haven&#x27;t completed the 30 day regiment yet, but supposedly by the 60 day mark there should be visible improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been taking for almost a month now I notice my skin seems to have improved. If we feed our body the right kind of food or supplement it will only benefit your skin and you. So people take good care of your inside and it will work for you instead of against you.</li>
    <li> Remarkable results.  This is definitely a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking a phytoceramide supplement for well over a year for dry skin; rotating between the \\&quot;Life Extension \\&quot; and \\&quot;Vitacost\\&quot; brands (depending on price).   I purchased these because of the low price and glowing reviews on Amazon.  However unlike the other brands I have used, this brand uses a dry powder formula in its capsules.  It may be my imagination, but I think I got better results from  phytoceramide supplements which use a \\&quot;liquid/oil filled\\&quot; formula in its capsules.</li>
    <li> Yes, l feel this product works well and I will continue to use – great skin.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these phytoceramides -as Dr. Oz told me to_ and I have also been using serum and moisturizer. My skin feel tighter and looks healthier. I think taking these is the key. They help my skin from the inside, out, while the topicals work from the outside, in.</li>
    <li> Best vitamin combo for great skin. My skin is smooth and soft, and wrinkles have been reduced significantly!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I want more.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe these actually work...amazing! This is a great way to fight dry skin and firm it without having to use tons of products.</li>
    <li> I saw Phytoceramides featured on Dr. Oz as being a facelift in a bottle so I decided to give it a try. I am so very happy with the results! My skin looks brighter and radiant, my friends have definitely noticed. I also really like that it works from the inside out and really has helped with the dry skin on my legs. Phytoderm will be a permanent part of my skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> I noticed improvement in overall skin appearance in just one month. Pores were diminished and I have received compliments from coworkers about looking fresh and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product. Visible results in 3 days. skin looks firmer and more plump with reduction of wrinkles &amp; fine lines. No side effects.</li>
    <li> I could see a difference after just one week! Recommend product and seller!</li>
    <li> I always take care of my skin and have been religiously following proper skin care. I have never tried taking anything orally to keep my skin soft and young looking. It&#x27;s been a week since I started and although, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements on my crow&#x27;s feet yet, I noticed that my skin is clearer and brighter. The sun spots are less noticeable and my skin feels very soft. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product. I am happy with results and will order again.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say thanks, this product is great for my skin. It has helped very much with my dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> These phytoceramides really work. My skin looks younger and feels healthy after using it for about 3 and a half weeks.&lt;br /&gt;A++ Recommended</li>
    <li> These comments all read like they&#x27;ve all been written by the same person.  Usually the comments contain a little history - the purchaser&#x27;s story.  All 27 of these reviews have the exact same tone.  Highly suspect.</li>
    <li> I still have this bottle around. No point in taking. A multivitamin is better &amp; glutathione.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked so amazing!  I&#x27;ve fought lines, wrinkles, acne scars, the list goes on but not any more.  This is like magic in a bottle (NO LIE).</li>
    <li> After 8 days of taking the capsules, 2x a day, my skin is not too dry anymore</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I bought a bottle a month ago and saw results after the third week. The wrinkles on my forehead have started to diminish!! Finally, a product that works!! I quickly ordered another 2 bottles so that I don&#x27;t run out. The shipping also arrived sooner than originally stated. Thank you very much for this great product!!</li>
    <li> Check out the dates, title headers, and all the words are almost exactly the same.  I ALMOST fell for it several times, but I always watch the bad reviews to find out the reality is these ARE FAKE REVIEWS&amp;#62;  they will probably lose a lot of business because of it.  Pretty shady.  Many products are doing this now, so watch for reviews elsewhere before delving in.&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE.</li>
    <li> Someone even mentioned to me yesterday that I look great and much much younger than my 66 years old.  Granted, I was lucky to inherit my Mother&#x27;s genes and her wonderful skin, but I really feel that this product works great, that I am doing the right thing for myself and that I want to continie taking this product.  I highly recomend this product to everyone.  Hurrah Nexgen!  Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz says it does what it does and I trust him a little. I really can&#x27;t tell anything. However, Dr. OZ got busted recently and was called on the carpet for barking about fad diet tricks and products that were found to be questionable. No, No, No, Mr. OZ. That&#x27;s a bad doctor. Go home and clean your act up you naughty boy.&lt;br /&gt;Doctor said a man had 6 months to live. Man said he didn&#x27;t know if he could get his bill paid in that short time. Doctor got the man&#x27;s chart back out and asked how long the dying man thought it would take to pay the doctor bill. Dying man said about a year. Doctor marked 6 months to live out an changed it to 1 year.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about two weeks now. I have seen some improvements. My skin is softer and retains more moisture. I think I need more time to make sure the results aren&#x27;t a fluke but I am definitely optimistic and look forward to using the product to see what it can do for me!</li>
    <li> I keep buying more when my supply runs out because I&#x27;m so pleased with the results! My wrinkles have filled in just as I hoped they would! I look forward to recommending this to my friends!</li>
    <li> This is a skin care product that actually works. I am 73 yrs old and this product has made my skin look more smooth and youthful. It has not gotten rid of the wrinkles yet but I am still hoping maybe they will be less noticeable. I really like this product very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanda</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for close to a month.  Although I don&#x27;t see any changes to wrinkles, etc, I do notice my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> Product worked very well saw a difference after a few weeks.The only problem is that they ask you to give a review and they will send you a free bottle-I am still waiting it has been almost 2 months and I e-mailed them several times.</li>
    <li> In my search to have more youthful skin, I find PhytoDerm to be everything it says it is. I have read a lot about ceramides and how they hydrate the skin, and am very impressed by their fast and powerful action to create a super hydrated look. There are so many anti-aging formulas out there, but this one is truly the real thing.</li>
    <li> I never thought a pill would work to help my skin look younger, but after taking these for a while, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement. My skin is younger and brighter now.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say really , only used 1/2 the bottle with no site able differences. Switched out to gel tabs which seem to be helping my skin restore moisture and gives it a glow, gel tabs are easier to take. Both around the same price.</li>
    <li> My mom has been looking for an anti-aging serum and I bought this for her as a random gift. She absolutely loves it and ive even noticed a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Like this product very much.  Saw some improvement in skin texture and firmness.  I believe it may take more than one bottle to really appreciate the benefits.  No side effects at all.</li>
    <li> Other people may have better results. But at my age, 79, I don&#x27;t expect miracles. But I would like to continue taking it because&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is doing my skin some good.</li>
    <li> In love with Phytoderm. It has greatly reduced the wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. Plus I have sensitive skin and these kinds of products are usually too rough for me but this one worked great and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin a bit.</li>
    <li> I started using PhytoDerm and felt that I was really noticing a difference. My friends started to ask me why my face was glowing! PhytoDerm really does work, my skin feels and looks younger than ever!</li>
    <li> Love this product I have noticed firmer skin one a day and keeps wrinkles at bay!</li>
    <li> After taking regularly, I noticed my skin was less dry and softer! Also tighter and looked younger!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better products I&#x27;ve seen for helping with damaged skin. Give it some time and you will definitely see the difference. I&#x27;ve been telling my friends and family all about it!</li>
    <li> OK, so I carefully read all of the previous testimonials in an effort to select the best brand of phytoceramides.  I had been taking care of my Mom for the past few years as she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  All of the stress of going back and forth to the hospital, the emergency room, and watching her in pain was showing in my skin and hair in a BIG way.  I tried at least 50 products (or more) to help repair the sallowness, the black circles under my eyes and nothing was working. I was desperate, hurting and  I felt as if I was just throwing money away--truly.  The only entity benefiting from all my purchases was amazon.com.  And now-- I have only been taking the phytoceramides for 3 days and I can already see a difference.  I have not changed anything else in my routine.  I have always exercised regularly and have eaten a mostly meat-free diet.  But, the short-term change is just remarkable.  My skin has a vitality that has been missing for the last few years.  My make-up looks better....and my eyes look infinitely more rested and younger.  My husband just said &amp;#34;tell them it&#x27;s working!!&amp;#34;  I said, &amp;#34;I am!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taking this product for about 3 weeks, it has given my skin a more hydrated and healthy look. The firmness of my skin has improved.  This is a good product for anti-aging skin.  It reduces the appearance of fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for ten days.  So far I have noticed that the fine lines (crow&#x27;s feet) are diminishing and my complexion appears more luminous.  I have extremely dry skin on my legs and somewhat on my arms I&#x27;m still hoping with time this will improve while taking this supplement.  Because I am seeing improvement of the fine lines near my eyes, I will purchase another bottle and see what happens.  Shipping was fast and the bottle was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Just purchased one bottle so far but see small improvements and will keep using to improve results!</li>
    <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t give my thought about anti-aging products, but I tried this one based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and loved it! I didn&#x27;t have the deep lines or crow&#x27;s feet, but I did have the laugh lines and noticed that they are not as dramatic which thrills me. If you have lines that bother you for whatever reason, I would highly suggest that you try this product and see what I mean.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding!! I have had wonderful results. I&#x27;ve spent thousands on dermatologists with no luck but with this product alone my skin looks and feels great! I am definitely amazed and astounded!!! Please give a try, you will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> Good Product... Does seem to make a difference  (particularly the first month)</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, and as expected. Since taking skin does seem softer, firmer and more refined. No wrinkle change yet, but I only have a few fine lines around eyes, and have only taken a short time. I have ordered a second bottle, and will look for changes after 12 weeks, which is normal time frame to allow body to address fine lines type issues.  I take one tab a day, and do take care of my skin, but I dont use the other serum etc of the same line, as I want to see if the supplement helps on its own.</li>
    <li> I quickly saw a difference in the moisture of my skin. For the last few years I have been using Aveeno creams and your average drug store creams on my face but those products always made my skin oily.  This product was great! It gives my skin the nice shine I have been longing for!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the noticeable results and will keep buying this product. My skin feels much smoother and looks younger.</li>
    <li> After all the reviews I read I was disappointed in the product failure to produce the outcome that everyone was talking about.</li>
    <li> This is our second order so we are now starting to see the results. Great product, great results. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> You have to take 4 pills a day so it does not last very long. I am just now beginning to see results. I bought a different product this next time because I only have to take one a day.</li>
    <li> My skin feels more moisturized and I like how it&#x27;s in a pill form. No mess. Does it make my skin look better? Yes, though I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to get the full effects, likely.</li>
    <li> I started taking the pills 4 weeks ago. First I was very skeptical, but still decided to try. Surprisingly, on the 3rd week, I noticed improvement in my skin elasticity and moisture retention. Definitely, my skin looks younger and healthier overall. I will continue taking the pills for sure.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from the Dr. Oz show. So I had to try it!  I was very pleased with the results. I&#x27;m 47 and my skin looks fabulous which makes me feel better about myself too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Over the years I have developed wrinkles around my eyes that are downright stubborn, that was until I discovered PhytoDerm. After two short weeks those wrinkles have almost entirely disappeared.</li>
    <li> After experiencing skin issues for years, and using several products along the way, I was skeptic when I first tried PhytoDerm. But just after one week I noticed a huge difference and so did my co-workers. After years of trying to conceal my issues I now no longer have to do thatl. I would recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
    <li> These anti-age capsules are astonishing. The results I got in just a couple of weeks are great and my face is softer, smoother and more even. I honestly didn’t expect these results because I have tried other pills and they really didn’t work. I can really see some wrinkles around my eyes fading away. Great product I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am 61, yet people are convinced that I am only in my early 40s. Why? I&#x27;m convinced that PhytoDerm is among the main reasons. In the year that I have been taking these capsules, everyone has noticed that the few lines I had have smoothed out completely. I have always done well with ceramides, so that is undoubtedly why PhytoDerm works so well for me. I use it with Renuvaderm Anti-Aging Serum, so that&#x27;s what I recommend you do as well. Of course, you need to eat a healthy diet and protect your face and d&amp;eacute;colletage from the sun, but this should be a part of your tool kit.</li>
    <li> As always, an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I am skeptical by nature, but this one proved me wrong! It really does work from the inside out, I noticed improvement fairly shortly after starting to take PhytoDerm. I am not one to do shots in the face or botox or anything, so for me this was the perfect solution, and worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m scared others will find out my secret, can I just say I can&#x27;t live without this stuff now?  I haven&#x27;t seen a single pimple since I started taking it 30days ago.</li>
    <li> I love your product. Everyone has noticed a difference in my skin. Thank you for your product</li>
    <li> it has only been a week but I have notice a plumper fuller face..my crows feet are just about vanished...this will save me hundreds in Botox...thank you</li>
    <li> Unbelievable results.  I&#x27;ve never used creams or lotions and live in the sun hence  my 70 year old skin was dry and scaley.  After seeing this on Oz I bought some and in less than 3 weeks my skin looks and more importantly feels hydrated as if I just slathered myself in lotion.  I&#x27;ll be using this the rest of my days.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for a few weeks, but I am already noticing a reduction of the appearance of any fine lines.</li>
    <li> Great anti aging product</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product, along with HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum and Renuvaderm (all from the same company). I&#x27;ve been taking PhytoDerm once a day, Renuvaderm twice daily and using the serum once daily and I definitely can see the results. My boyfriend has commented on how much my skin has cleared up as well and that my forehead wrinkle is barely noticeable (I have complained to him in the past that due to scrunching my forehead, my wrinkle is beginning to look deeper). I am not entirely sure if this is just due to one of these products, or the mix of the 3, but my skin is definitely firmer and has less breakouts and my hair is looking great! I will continue using all 3 products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t start using it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for close to 6 months.  I noticed my skin all over is more youthful, meaning my veins don&#x27;t seem so close to the surface as they used to be.  I am in my early 60&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t have any age spots on my hands, arms or legs.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After only a few short weeks I am please with my purchase. I feel so much more confident, my skin is glowing and looking so much healthier. I feel and look years younger and I am much happier.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and I needed something to start helping me from the inside out and that is why I decided to try Phytoderm and Renuvaderm. I am happy to have chosen the right products. I have been taking both in an empty stomach for a month and I can already see great results in my skin appearance. I will keep taking them for several months. Good creams and a balanced diet is not enough to improve your skin. I really recommend both products!</li>
    <li> A very good product, does exactly has it says,clears all the wrinkles in very short time.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. This product definitely hydrates the skin resulting in having to use less moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I can totally see a difference in my skin. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin texture after a month.</li>
    <li> This  product is one of my newer additions to my health care regimen. Having troubled skin, I find it difficult to continue with one skin care line on a regular basis. I have learned, (for myself), that my skin does better when I rotate topical products. However, as PhytoDerm is a nutritional product, I have been taking it successfully every day.  Since menopause, my skin has become extremely sensitive, at times prone to eczema and reacting to many products including sunscreens. I was blessed with good skin in my youth, which has made it emotionally more difficult for me in recent years as I could tell people were looking at my skin problems. After a couple of months using PhytoDerm daily my skin is becoming stronger and more resilient as well as feeling and looking better. I realize my skin needs more time to continue the healing process, so I will continue using PhytoDerm daily.</li>
    <li> Affordable, and after one month, my skin looks clear and radiant. I have more confidence in my appearance; feel like I have a youthful glow. I don&#x27;t feel the need to slather on the foundation every day like I used to...my natural skin looks good. Very happy and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes and it&#x27;s been a month that I&#x27;ve been taking them.  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase another bottle especially after not seeing any results after 30 days</li>
    <li> Does the job, and you can SEE the job it does. I might skip certain vitamins and supplements, but never this.</li>
    <li> This is a product that works to replenish lost moisture in your skin. One thing that you need to be aware of is that it&#x27;s not an instant fix. If you need immediate improvement to your skin, than continue to use a moisturizer until the benefits of this product become evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased several bottles of this product and felt that it wasn&#x27;t working. Now, I know the reason why. While some people see results fairly quickly, in others, such as myself it takes more time. I suffer from extremely dry skin, especially during the winter months. Just as I was about to give up on this product, I noticed that my hands were becoming more supple and soft. What astounded me is that it was -14 degrees Fahrenheit this morning, with the heat on at full blast. Ordinarily, this would result in the driest skin that I would ever see. To my surprise, my skin is not only soft, but all of the painful cracks that I&#x27;ve been experiencing have slowly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I especially like about this product is that by using it, it&#x27;s no longer necessary for me to put greasy lotions on my hands. There&#x27;s nothing I hate worse than spreading the grease all over my computer keyboard and other items that I touch throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that since I have the most extreme dry skin imaginable, this product took longer to work than I expected. The good thing is that I stuck it out and am now benefiting from the results. A lot of people who are stating that this product doesn&#x27;t work for them, have simply not given it enough time. If you do so, you&#x27;ll reap the rewards.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say that I notice a difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on my face. I have been using this product now for 4 months. I can say, however, that the difference this product has made in my hair is literally AMAZING. My hair was thin and dry despite taking good vitamins, drinking lots of water, using a good shampoo and conditioner, etc. Within two months, my hair was stronger, shinier, and the natural curl I used to have when I was younger came back. My hairdresser was amazed and commented that the curl indicates the healthy condition of my hair. The only change I have made to my diet is the addition of these vitamins. They are obviously working!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I turned 50 this year and used both this and Renuvaderm, and I have recently been receiving many compliments and comments on how young I look and how the skin on my face is glowing.</li>
    <li> This product is truly a Facelift in a bottle. I use this product to stay looking young – my skin looks amazing and I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days and it already seems to be working. This brand has another product I&#x27;m putting on my face and taking this supplement, my skin seemed to glow on the very first day of this regimen.</li>
    <li> I have used two bottles of this product and have seen know results at all!&lt;br /&gt;I think it was just a wast of money!</li>
    <li> I bought thinking, oh yeah sure ....but now after 4 weeks of steady use, I am a believer. Lines around month, nose and eyes have slowly been minimizing and my skin looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35, and my girlfriend is 10 years older.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest with you, the only issue I had with her was her aging skin. She looks gorgeous, and her character is even the more.&lt;br /&gt;She would spend tens of dollars on facemasks, that wouls only help her partially for a few days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this product. Based on a famous actor looking in her 30s while she&#x27;s actually in her 50s, I bought the $20 product.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 days of taking 1 pill a day, her face looks more fleshy, more full, less wrinkles, and some saggy skin on the cheeks and under the chin have reduced as well!&lt;br /&gt;I was astonished how much better she looked!&lt;br /&gt;She gained more confidence as well, and needless to say, if this product can knock off 10 years off, on the looks, I&#x27;ll be a happy camper for the coming 10-15 years, and hope that by then NG Labs will have invented the life elixir!&lt;br /&gt;She looked 45 before. Now her face looks 39-40 after only 4 days of treatment!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t thank NG Labs enough for this!&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the 5 stars, and the $20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be to take 1 pill every morning for the first week and a half, and then reduce intake to 2 or 3 per week.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long but it did not take long before seeing results. I really like this and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have ordered my 3rd (&amp; 4th) bottle - I was not so sure it was doing anything so I had not re-order. And with all the hubbub about Dr. Oz testifying for congress, I thought I had been taken for a sucker. Then I had 3 (if not 4) people (unsolicited) ask if I had had &amp;#34;work done&amp;#34;. Several people had asked if I was using botox. So to say the least, I have re-ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- I do not work for this company, I am not being paid and I have no ties. I am just a regular, 45 yo working women trying not to look 45. And, according to my friends, this stuff is working.</li>
    <li> For most of my adult life I have taken care of my skin w/diet, exercise &amp; topical treatments. As time goes on, I have found and added supplements that further assist in maintaining &amp; improving my skin. Phytoderm has become one of the supplements in my arsenal for  improving my skin. Great provider/supplier. The product arrived on time &amp; in good condition. Would like to see additional info &amp; studies regarding the effects of ceramides.</li>
    <li> I liked this very much.  At first I didn&#x27;t throw it was working but about three after using I felt I noticed a difference after that I went out with a friend and she kept saying how good my completion looks and my hair looks better last.</li>
    <li> Wow i did&#x27;nt think that supplements could help the skin i was wrong!  My skin is looking fresh i&#x27;m 51 years old im going to continue to use this supplement!!!</li>
    <li> One month in can tell a positive difference in skin&#x27;s smoothness and not as dry, also others noticing i look less tired.</li>
    <li> Fast results i love this ! They dont taste bad at all either . I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months and it has really made a big difference in my skin and complexion.</li>
    <li> I think these are working after only 4 weeks. I am purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using these vitamins a short time but think I can see improvement in my skin.  Would like to continue using them.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that can reduce my wrinkles I found this product and do some research about it. I brought it to see if its working for me. After using it for 3 months now I noticed some change on my face. My skin is beautiful and smooth. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product a short time but I can already see the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This has made changes in the appearance of my skin. My skin now looks moist without being greasy and the lines on my forehead are more shallow than they were before. I have had a small reddish mark on the bridge of my nose for over two years, and after only two weeks the mark was completely gone!</li>
    <li> Not only has it helped with my skin, it helps hair and nails too. Took around 6 weeks to see results. But they are there! Great products and nicely priced.</li>
    <li> The positive results of this product is unbelievable! It&#x27;s definitely top of the line!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok! Not what i expected. Dr Oz loosing credability. This is 4th youthfull recomendation i tryed and did not get as promiss.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertized.  My skin feels and looks better and better the longer I use it !!!</li>
    <li> My friend recommended I try this to bring some life back to my skin. I am impressed. I don’t look tired anymore!</li>
    <li> Still have lines and wrinkles but I like my face better than before . I am happy with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these supplements for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the lines around my mouth and the tone of my skin looks more even. Happy with results, try it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait 2 months before I would review this product although I could see changes taking place within a week. Yesterday I was told I look 10 years younger. I feel and see the skin my body becoming more youthful. I love this product. I do plan on continuing with this product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very strange how one little plll can make your skin look so good. I&#x27;m almost out! Need to re-order! I’m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Not what Dr. Oz claimed on his TV program.  It seemed to have a very slight  effect. I personally am disappointed in it but&lt;br /&gt;will try it for a little while longer to see if some have slower results.</li>
    <li> Saw absolutely no difference.  Don&#x27;t believe everything Dr. Oz tells you.</li>
    <li> Been taking Phytoceramides by a different company for almost 2 months now. Decided to change brands and see what happens. I like that I can take 2 caps twice a day since I am older and probably need it. Will see what happens.</li>
    <li> I am a 57 year old female, and was very concerned about my skin because I was starting to get frown lines, jowl lines around my mouth, saggy facial skin and lines on my forehead. I have spent hundreds of dollars on creams, lotions and products that guarantee results, only to be left with an empty bank account and more wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;I just happend to see your product on-line as I was searching for yet another &#x27;miracle-cure&#x27; and was blown away by the positive reviews...so I tried it and I am so happy that I did. This is the ONLY product that I have tried where I have actually seen results!! I have been taking PhytoDerm for 2 months now. For the first 2 weeks, I took 2 pills a day, then started taking 1 pill a day after that.  My skin is firmer, my jowl lines are much much less defined, the lines in my forehead are diminishing and my skin looks so much smoother and younger. I regret not taking a &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; picture so that I could show the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you PhytoDerm for giving me hope!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I seen results in just a few weeks. My skin looks and feels great. My wrinkles are diminishing. I couldn’t have asked for a better product!</li>
    <li> It truly is a facelift in a bottle as people keep asking me what I&#x27;ve had done to my face. I live what it does to my skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this product faithfully. My skin feels firm and supple . What a great find!</li>
    <li> Incredible, fast, effective. Within less than 2 weeks I felt an increased &#x27;snap&#x27; in my skin. Its amazing how a naturally derived complex can be so effective. I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a new edge on the fight against aging.</li>
    <li> This supplement has helped restore my sub-par mid-thirties skin to it&#x27;s youthful glow. Smoother complexion after a couple weeks. I just feel healthier in general too. Does exactly what it says and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and am very pleased with it.  My skin is much smoother and retains much more moisture.  I will continue to use it.</li>
</ol>
