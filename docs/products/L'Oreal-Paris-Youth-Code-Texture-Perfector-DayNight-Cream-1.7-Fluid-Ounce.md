      <li>I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cream.</li>
      <li>LOVE it</li>
      <li>So far I am so completely happy with this product and will continue using hoping it keeps doing it&#x27;s job.  </li>
      <li>It works very well as a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Although this is my first foray into facial creams, I think this is an awesome product!</li>
      <li>I found the scent pleasant and my skin feels soft.</li>
      <li>This is my second purchase of this cream and it feels wonderful on my skin, i highly recommend .</li>
      <li>My skin is more even toned and soft!;) I am no longer embarrassed to look at people in the eye because i love how my skin looks and feels!</li>
      <li>Overall, product is good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy and thought I&#x27;d try this after reading the reviews...was trying to find a good daily moisturizer without a shiny greasy feel.  </li>
      <li>It hydrates me enough which is good</li>
      <li>To be fair, I gave this another shot again a couple weeks later.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using three of the products from this line: the facial soap, this and the serum and while I can&#x27;t say which one is doing the most good, the trio has definately turned my lackluster, uneven complexion into something much more appealing.</li>
      <li>Now, 6 weeks later, I have seen even better results and would be happy if this is my &amp;#34;plateau&amp;#34; for product performance as long as I can maintain the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin super soft and with a healthy look.  </li>
      <li>cream has a nice scent, absorbs quickly, lasted me a while, and definitely did what it said it would - without breaking me out!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice huge difference in my skin</li>
      <li>I think this is a great everyday moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>The sample gave me 3 days worth</li>
      <li>Love the smell and how soft it leaves my skin.</li>
      <li>Gives my face a nice feel and looks instantly smoother.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment</li>
      <li>Smells so good, like an expensive cologne, and feels so nice on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Good,like it very much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good product that feels good when your in between teen acne and older sagging skin concerns.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to update my review after I finish my first jar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being overwhelmed by the massive amount of wrinkle/aging creams, this one stood out to me on the shelf since it was more about pore size and texture.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>i also notice my blemishes  fade a little more its a great cream to apply in that the day or at nightand does the trick with making your skin look a little healthier</li>
      <li>I even put any leftover product on the backs of my hands since winter is pretty harsh to them - even my hands love this stuff!</li>
      <li>The most amazing thing is that the little clear bumps I get on my jawline and lower cheeks have nearly gone away</li>
      <li>This is a great moisturizer for my dry acne prone starting to wrinkle 30 year old skin.</li>
      <li>I have noticed after about 3 weeks now that some fine lines are starting to fill in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had them my whole life.  </li>
      <li>this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>My face texture is so much softer.  </li>
      <li>Decided to give the whole L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code a try</li>
      <li>It does have a floral smell, I would compare it to the floral-type smell at the beauty counter of a high-end department store not so much old-lady-ish</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this stuff and it instantly made my skin feel extremely smooth.  </li>
      <li>Bumpy, dry patches, and huge pores on my nose</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Not got the product as new.</li>
      <li>After using this cream my face is very soft.  </li>
      <li>More deep knots, one under my other eye, one on my forehead, on my chin, I was so upset.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 29, live in a sunny tropical climate, and have adult acne issues.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think this product is even known for that since I don&#x27;t know what those clear bumps are.  </li>
      <li>I could tell a difference in two weeks how my skin changed and how clear and even my complexion looked.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old</li>
      <li>i recommend it to all women 20-30 years old</li>
      <li>It really does improve skin tone and makes your pores look smaller.</li>
      <li>and it works way better than this product which made my sensitive combo skin break out in white heads because it was too heavy for my pores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great as a night cream</li>
    <li> I actually started using coconut oil instead on my face and it works way better than this product which made my sensitive combo skin break out in white heads because it was too heavy for my pores. I did not see any advantage of pore reduction with this product, as I said, for me it clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> I really like this. it doesn&#x27;t leave me oily and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Boo :/ I was excited about the bargain, but the item arrived damaged.  Asking for a return/refund.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m 29, live in a sunny tropical climate, and have adult acne issues. Its hard to find a product that addresses my blemish (especially blackheads) issues but isn&#x27;t too harsh for sun damaged skin. This stuff is amazing! I apply morning and night to my face, neck, and chest. After two weeks black heads are disappearing before my eyes and my skin is moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t smell half bad either. This is IT for me. I&#x27;m stockpiling jars now. I can&#x27;t say enough! Try it.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I have acne and get nodules under my skin that stay for a long time. I had been using Loreal Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer which is A++ excellent for my acne and complexion, I love that stuff. Then I tried this. It made my skin breakout the next day--I had a really large and sore nodule under my eye on the delicate skin. I went back to the Revitalift. To be fair, I gave this another shot again a couple weeks later. More deep knots, one under my other eye, one on my forehead, on my chin, I was so upset. Then to be fair again, I just tried it on my chest and neck where I mostly get blackheads, another breakout. I have no idea why, even my normal acne I can see coming at least. They haven&#x27;t gone away yet and I&#x27;m in a wedding in a couple weeks! I&#x27;m upset, but not everything works on everyone, so I will use this jar on my hands and places I won&#x27;t break out because as a moisturizer, I like it, I like the scent, I can&#x27;t review its effectiveness on perfecting texture or anything.</li>
    <li> A few months ago when I turned 26, I finally decided that it was time to start preventative maintenance on my face, even though I am still extremely oily (think: blotting every 2hrs even with high-end mattifying foundation on) and acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being overwhelmed by the massive amount of wrinkle/aging creams, this one stood out to me on the shelf since it was more about pore size and texture. I use this strictly as my night cream and am super impressed with it! Although this is my first foray into facial creams, I think this is an awesome product! I could definitely feel and see a difference in the texture of my face after a week. Now, 6 weeks later, I have seen even better results and would be happy if this is my &amp;#34;plateau&amp;#34; for product performance as long as I can maintain the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a nice scent, absorbs quickly, lasted me a while, and definitely did what it said it would - without breaking me out! Even when I go to wash my face in the morning, I can feel the cream coming off, so I know it doesn&#x27;t rub away overnight. I even put any leftover product on the backs of my hands since winter is pretty harsh to them - even my hands love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Had to repurchase, quick shipping and amazing price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely delighted with the L\\&quot;Oreal Youth code Texture Perfector Day/Night cream. At times cleaning your face seems like a chore but with thisproduct, it is something that you look forward to doing..</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, unless it&#x27;s something either worth praising and I want to spread the word, or if it totally sucks and I want to warn people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin and my lower cheeks get kinda bumpy from time to time (not acne, just clear bumps).  The texture of my skin is terrible.  Bumpy, dry patches, and huge pores on my nose that I can never control.  The only time it feels completely smooth is after I&#x27;ve had a facial (too expensive) or using a clear mask that you pull off (thus ripping a lot of crap off).  I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for years.  Anytime I tried to switch to anything, cheap or expensive, I would break out so I gave up on that.  I received a sample of this stuff and it instantly made my skin feel extremely smooth.  The sample gave me 3 days worth and I was still loving it after 3 days so I bought a jar.  After using it for a week, my skin is much less dry (not totally under control yet), the dry patches on my cheeks are so much smoother, and it feels like I just got a facial at a spa.  So far I am so completely happy with this product and will continue using hoping it keeps doing it&#x27;s job.  The most amazing thing is that the little clear bumps I get on my jawline and lower cheeks have nearly gone away and I don&#x27;t think this product is even known for that since I don&#x27;t know what those clear bumps are.  I&#x27;ve had them my whole life.  Not sure what&#x27;s in this stuff but it&#x27;s a miracle product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to update my review after I finish my first jar.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect. I use it along with the youth code foaming cleanser. The skin on my face is usually on the dry side, so this makes my son so soft. I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores are smaller. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My face texture is so much softer.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Good,like it very much.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it helps or not yet but it makes my skin feel good &amp; I have very dry skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and can already tell a difference.</li>
    <li> i was hoping for some great transformation, But the cream is nice and light , good to moisturize before you sleep</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and thought I&#x27;d try this after reading the reviews...was trying to find a good daily moisturizer without a shiny greasy feel.  Found it!  Has a perfume smell but dissapates immediately.  Gives my face a nice feel and looks instantly smoother. Great product and better than their &amp;#34;man creams&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchase of the year. My skin is noticeably softer and the dark spots are fading.  It keeps my skin moist all day. It&#x27;s cheap and it works! LOVE it</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how soft it leaves my skin. I have noticed after about 3 weeks now that some fine lines are starting to fill in. I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Just got this product  almost 2 days ago..  ive used it twice and i have to say that this stuff is amazing i notice  a little pore strinkish but i am using different  products in my daily retouine  i also notice my blemishes  fade a little more its a great cream to apply in that the day or at nightand does the trick with making your skin look a little healthier</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream. I could tell a difference in two weeks how my skin changed and how clear and even my complexion looked. It works very well as a good moisturizer. Excellent excellent excellent.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased my second jar of this and I will definitely continue to keep purchasing this cream. I use it in conjunction with the serum  and eye cream and my face has never looked or felt this great. I&#x27;m 37 years old and I am getting compliments on my skin all the time. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> You get the benefit of buying  a 2 in 1, a Moisturizer for day and night. This is my second purchase of this cream and it feels wonderful on my skin, i highly recommend . Does not leave oily residue!</li>
    <li> I liked this, but I like most L&#x27;Oreal products. I found the scent pleasant and my skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use the foaming gel cleanser and the texture perfector serum and I just love the combo. the results have been fantastic!</li>
    <li> Its good but as they say it doesnt work in 2 weeks but surely its showing some results as my skin is changing its texture definitely I recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!  It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  Leaves your skin super soft and with a healthy look.  Definetly, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I can&#x27;t say much about it as I only use it for the last 2 weeks. I didn&#x27;t really notice huge difference in my skin but my skin is definitely smoother and softer. It hydrates me enough which is good and you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product. Little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but honestly I don&#x27;t like the smell. Overall, product is good.</li>
    <li> My wife was really happy with it</li>
    <li> Buy it while you can everyone! I was heartbroken when I found out this moisturizer has been discontinued. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore and after contacting lorea, I was told they no longer make this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many moisturizers over the years but none of them make my skin feel and look as great as this one does. I have sensitive, dry, and breakout prone skin and I have not if a single pimple pop up, irritation, or oiliness while using this. I&#x27;m in my late 20s so I don&#x27;t have too many issues with aging skin yet but I do notice that my skin looks smoother and brighter since I started using this. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> There are very few skin products a like enough to purchase more than once. This is one of them. I love this stuff. I always had oily breakout prone skin till I turned 30, then it dried up and became a dessert. I tried everything from Clinique, oil of Olay, ponds, and Lancôme. This works the best and doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my sensitive skin. You don&#x27;t need much it covers well with just a little. Get this!</li>
    <li> really notice the difference in a few days.</li>
    <li> After using this cream my face is very soft.  I also notice a difference in the morning.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this years ago. Decided to give the whole L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code a try and my skin appreciates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between dry winter heat and cold and the cold air, at the end of the day drenching skin in moisture is soothing and feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like the pore refine b.b. type cream. This was just ok. Not sure it works or does not. The tu e cream tingle d when I applied it so I know it worked. This one not sure. It might work for some, but not me.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your skin and smells nice.  I think this is a great everyday moisturizer.  I did not see any improvement in texture though.</li>
    <li> It is the best moisturizer i have ever used, it is better than high end brands even Lancome, Estee Lauder. This is cheaper than other anti aging creams.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works. I defiantly saw and felt a difference in my skin in a week. It&#x27;s worth the investment</li>
    <li> Such a good moisturizer makes your face feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom!! Love it i recommend it to all women 20-30 years old</li>
    <li> Smells so good, like an expensive cologne, and feels so nice on the skin.  Will be repurchasing. A little goes a long way. Not greasy either</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for my dry acne prone starting to wrinkle 30 year old skin. It feels great and not greasy and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments that my skin sans makeup is looking nicer from friends. It&#x27;s hard to find a good product that feels good when your in between teen acne and older sagging skin concerns. My little crows feet look better, my dry cheeks are softer and I&#x27;m not breaking out. I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Not got the product as new. It&#x27;s torn and broken</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using three of the products from this line: the facial soap, this and the serum and while I can&#x27;t say which one is doing the most good, the trio has definately turned my lackluster, uneven complexion into something much more appealing. I&#x27;ve had this stuff for about a month and I try to use it twice a day- that doesn&#x27;t always happen, but unlike some products I&#x27;ve used in the past where, if you skip a day or two you can really tell- this stuff seems to have a lasting effect even on the skipped days. It does have a floral smell, I would compare it to the floral-type smell at the beauty counter of a high-end department store not so much old-lady-ish but after a few minutes of the product soaking in, it&#x27;s not noticable. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a skin care system that shows results with proper use in about two to three weeks time.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! My skin is more even toned and soft!;) I am no longer embarrassed to look at people in the eye because i love how my skin looks and feels!</li>
    <li> Great product...works great.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! It really does improve skin tone and makes your pores look smaller. It smells good too! I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken..i tried to save it but there were little sgards of glass throughout the cream :( very dissapointed!</li>
