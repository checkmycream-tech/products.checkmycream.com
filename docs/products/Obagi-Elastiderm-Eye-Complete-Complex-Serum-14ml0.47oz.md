      <li>but this one did more damage than good.</li>
      <li>It is cooling and nice.</li>
      <li>It seems very strong.  </li>
      <li>love the product and love this seller too!</li>
      <li>BUT--it&#x27;s really good at minimizing fine lines, plumping up the skin, and returning elasticity to the skin.</li>
      <li>Awesome job, within 2 weeks completely saw the difference</li>
      <li>Plus plastics are not as safe we think.</li>

      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I do love the packaging and how this applies as a result.  </li>
      <li>I love Obagi products.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Plus plastics are not as safe we think.shorten the shelf life of a formula.</li>
      <li>I would surely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s being sold so cheap, but I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Elasti-derm\\&quot;, to help coax the skin into being more hydrated, refined, and pliant, thus reducing the signs of lines.</li>
      <li>The Elastiderm gel works much better.</li>
      <li>I will use the remaining product but will not purchase any more.</li>
      <li>, this serum does not have blueberry extract (an antioxidant for prevention of wrinkles) and cannot be applied on the top eyelid or brow bone.  </li>
      <li>sure I&#x27;d pay 90.00.That&#x27;s the price elsewhere.</li>
      <li>found them on AMAZON at better PRICE AND WILL NEVER STOP USING</li>
      <li>MORE TRYING AND FAILING, losing money on  Drug store products That DONT DELIVER RESULTS</li>
      <li>love this eye cream.</li>
      <li>It reduces my bags--which I am most concerned about.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to try the product</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more of this brand.</li>
      <li>This literally banished my fine crows feet and makes my under eye area look much more youthful.</li>
      <li>After about 3 months of use the bottle is still very full.</li>
      <li>Good product, reduces the stress and puffiness of &amp;#34;morning eyes.&amp;#34; My eyes are extremely sensitive to most eye care products and I wear contacts, but this seems to work just fine.</li>
      <li>Goes on so easily and works to help remove fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in school going more than full time.</li>
      <li>In 5 weeks, the puffy has been reduced in half and I am very happy.  </li>
      <li>d person who use it say look fine</li>
      <li>After using an entire bottle of this product, i definitely experienced a reduction in the signs of my fine lines.</li>
      <li>I bought this a few weeks ago and am very impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>I saw no benefit from this product but others that I know personally have seen great benefit.</li>
      <li>,  i found safe to use on your own , and they wouldn&#x27;t sell without DR HIGH HIGH  strengths OC if a DR needed to apply, so I felt safe in knowing that from experience.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try this</li>
      <li>Good thing is that it last</li>
      <li>For the price though, not a bad buy.</li>
      <li>As I delve into the world of anti-aging skin products, I realize that most of these type of products are not necessarily going to make an immediate noticeable improvement, but they are more for the long-term slowing process.  </li>
      <li>I love the soft touch that the roller-ball has and it is always cool going on -</li>
      <li>so definitely worth the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As many in the skincare industry know, anything with arginine helps make the active ingredient even more \\&quot;active\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No itching or eyes watering, and it rolls right on.</li>
      <li>and he said this product has a far higher concentration of caffeine and antioxidants than allowed OTC which is why the results are much better.  </li>
      <li>I have very large puffy sections under my eyes and didn&#x27;t want surgery.  </li>
      <li>: The roller ball releases the right amount of product and the cool serum feels really good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wakes my eyes a little but Loreal makes one just as good.</li>
      <li>aha cream bought on skin rx dot com , not expensive AND</li>
      <li>Not all Obagi products are made at the same place -- but i found out that this formula is made by one of the top skincare labs in the US--one that manufactures high-end dermatologist and clinical skincare brands on the market today.</li>
      <li>in love and use All  2x daily,  skin eats it up</li>
      <li>first meeting i asked to guess my age</li>
      <li>haha!</li>
      <li>The potent caffeine in this serum deflated the puffiness under both my eyes in 15 minutes and constricted the purple vein under my left eye</li>
      <li>I first made this purchase from my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>After reading the stellar reviews and researching online I decided to give this product</li>
      <li>They sell it for much higher cost.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I have been an avid OBAGI user for 15 years .</li>
      <li>I tried this in September, 2012 and used consistently for almost 2 years now.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not looking for results that turn back the clock 20 years, only to look good as I age.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Right eye has no wrinkles until i smile as normal</li>
      <li>Further, the controlled amount of serum is easy to apply;</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say is that it lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>Even when I smile, around my eye area my skin looks very young.</li>
      <li>This product certainly firms up around the eye area.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and tries right away.</li>
      <li>very good product but quite expensive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Enough real power to make results noticable</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week.  I am 32 and I have very dark circles under my eyes with a little bit of puffiness - to the point of not leaving my house without concealer on.  You are supposed to apply it twice a day, but some days I have only applied once (busy mom brain).  THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.  In just one week, I have seen about a 70% decrease in the darkness under my eyes, and the puffiness is completely gone.  I really wish I had taken a before picture so I could compare it to a now picture - but I can see the big difference.  I was concerned because typically the Obagi products are only available from an MD and most of them including this product are about $110.  The serum arrived in a sealed box and was not used previously.  I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s being sold so cheap, but I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Have been using for 80 days and have not seen a difference.  I&#x27;ve used the obagi nu-derm system off and on for past 10 years.  Really like the system, but have yet to find any eye care product that diminishes or softens lines for a 57 year old.</li>
    <li> It irrated my skin to the point it made it all puffy, so it did the opposite.  Too lazy to send back just threw it away.</li>
    <li> I have used many Obagi products but this product did not meet my satisfaction. I prefer the Obagi Elastiderm Cream instead.</li>
    <li> I saw no improvement after two weeks use.</li>
    <li> so thrilled to be able to buy at this price!  About 1/2 what I&#x27;ve been paying my dermatologist!</li>
    <li> love the product and love this seller too!</li>
    <li> It seems very strong.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I feel a burning sensation everytime  I use it.  Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Good product, reduces the stress and puffiness of &amp;#34;morning eyes.&amp;#34; My eyes are extremely sensitive to most eye care products and I wear contacts, but this seems to work just fine. No itching or eyes watering, and it rolls right on. I use the La Mer Creme at night for wrinkles, but this is good for daytime</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands as well, but keep coming to this one regardless of its pretty high price. Good thing is that it last</li>
    <li> I love the soft touch that the roller-ball has and it is always cool going on - I don&#x27;t feel like I am causing any undue skin damage with this product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this works with the Obagi Elastiderm Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in school going more than full time. I get on average between 4-7 hours or sleep a night. going without sleep for an extended period of time has caused some bags to form under my eyes. I have been using this for a few months and the bags under my eyes are much smaller than before. I don&#x27;t look as miserable as I feel haha! I use a good amount. I put on three layers in the morning and one at night. EVERY day/night. I have a very strict skin care regimen and I think that has a lot to do with my results. After about 3 months of use the bottle is still very full. I see this lasting a looong time. so definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;oh and just so you know. I&#x27;m a 27 year old female.</li>
    <li> I saw no benefit from this product but others that I know personally have seen great benefit. Oh well, can&#x27;t work great for every one!</li>
    <li> I like it, but I am not totally sure it is doing much.  As I delve into the world of anti-aging skin products, I realize that most of these type of products are not necessarily going to make an immediate noticeable improvement, but they are more for the long-term slowing process.  I have only been using this product for a few weeks, so will continue to use it and will see how it works.  I do love the packaging and how this applies as a result.  It is cooling and nice.</li>
    <li> I have no wrinkles or crows feet around my eye area. Even when I smile, around my eye area my skin looks very young.</li>
    <li> Not to talk bad about the cream. It just did not work on my eye puffinness at all. I thought it was going to work. I have used it for over a month and my eyes are exactly the same, I did a before and after and it has not changed a bit, SORRY Obagi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do you have anything that will really work for eye puffiness?</li>
    <li> Did not really do what I expected.  Lines are still visible and dry area. Very small improvement in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand and so I tried it for six weeks. Like the outcome so far for my dark circles. will purchase again, the roller is awesome!</li>
    <li> It was a gift and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Great product for puffy eyes in the morning.  It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
    <li> it will help somewhat w/puffiness, but frankly any rollerball anti-puff will, a cold ice pack would do the same. the reason I tried OBAGI was for the lightening aspect, as OBAGI products claims to do this very well. sadly I saw no lightening of under eye dark circles</li>
    <li> The fact that Obagi still tests on animals is pathetic and enough of a reason to never purchase this brand unless their cruelty practices are banned.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I am 32 and have a few crows feet starting and tired eyes. This literally banished my fine crows feet and makes my under eye area look much more youthful. I can&#x27;t wait to try more of this brand.</li>
    <li> Product is great for under eye circles</li>
    <li> Worked well.  Under eye bags less pronounced and fine lines less visible while product is in use.  If you skip, bags are back.</li>
    <li> So far I like the feeling of the roller ball on my skin. I can&#x27;t comment on results because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough but it is convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Better than Elastiderm Eye Cream for Puffiness and Dark Circles. I am a 38 yr old male.  I used the cream nightly before I bought this serum. With the cream I saw excellent results in terms of tightening/firming around the eyes and reduction in fine lines. However, I still had some slight puffiness and purplish dark circles until I bought this serum. The potent caffeine in this serum deflated the puffiness under both my eyes in 15 minutes and constricted the purple vein under my left eye so it was less visible. After about 6 weeks (morning and night), I stopped waking up with puffy eyes.  My girlfriend saw her bags flatten too and she was contemplating surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the cream, this serum does not have blueberry extract (an antioxidant for prevention of wrinkles) and cannot be applied on the top eyelid or brow bone.  This is more of a targeted eye serum designed for puffiness caused by fluid and dark circles caused by \\&quot;weak\\&quot; capillaries showing through thinner skin due to loss of fat. The serum is much cleaner and easier to apply than the cream because of the rollerball applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For eye lines, wrinkles, overall firming/tightening ABOVE and below the eyes:  Obagi Elastiderm Cream&lt;br /&gt;For eye puffiness and dark circles under the eye: Obagi Elastiderm Eye Complete Complex Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use both alternatively (morning--serum, night--cream) or layer one right after the other (first serum, then cream, both morning and night).  I only use the serum when I need it.  I have tried layering both for several days and my under eye skin developed tiny milia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For puffiness and dark circles, I have tried origins ginzing, burts bees sensitive puffiness cream, ole henriksen ultimate lift gel, kate somerville dark circle corrector, and elite serum.  Obagi Elastiderm Eye Complete Complex Serum is miles ahead of these competitors and shows results quickly. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY and TIME ON ANYTHING ELSE!  If your eye puffiness or bags are due to fluid retention or lack of circulation, this product will definitely work.  BEFORE TRYING PLASTIC SURGERY, TRY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Obagi Serum from Holiday Skin Care.  They are more expensive but deliver legitimate goods. It&#x27;s easier than going to a derm&#x27;s office. I recommend buying both the Elastiderm Serum and Cream and you may not have to get risky and expensive blepharoplasty surgery.circulation, this product will definitely work.

    <li> Was recommended by the gals at the spa. They sell it for much higher cost. This product reduces puffiness around my eyes. A God-send for me!</li>
    <li> It only took a few days to get to me, I have not seen the results yet because I just stared using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with puffiness and dark circles under my eyes forever so I was excited to try this but unfortunately, the moment this touched my skin, the skin under my eyes puffed up twice the normal size. I won&#x27;t be able to use this obviously, so I&#x27;m going back to my Say Yes to Grapefruit eye cream and the Say Yes to Blueberries eye cream at night.</li>
    <li> Espectacular,you can see a positive change in a week.onne of the best a ever use.</li>
    <li> Not all Obagi products are made at the same place -- but i found out that this formula is made by one of the top skincare labs in the US--one that manufactures high-end dermatologist and clinical skincare brands on the market today. So knowing this, i knew there would be *some* efficacy to this product. I actually LIKE that ingredients are straightforward and not full of fluff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Caffeine, Malonic Acid, Zinc Carbonate, Arginine, Laureth-9, Copper Carbonate Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest--if you&#x27;re looking to reduce eye puffiness and dark circles, this won&#x27;t do much.  If found no visible evidence of that in my use. BUT--it&#x27;s really good at minimizing fine lines, plumping up the skin, and returning elasticity to the skin. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Elasti-derm\\&quot;, to help coax the skin into being more hydrated, refined, and pliant, thus reducing the signs of lines. Obagi&#x27;s main active to do that is malonic acid, and I give a big thumbs up to the addition of arginine-- a powerful delivery vehicle to help drive the malonic acid further into the skin for more efficacy. As many in the skincare industry know, anything with arginine helps make the active ingredient even more \\&quot;active\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel ball is not just a \\&quot;feel good\\&quot; gimmick -- it actually helps to massage this serum into the delicate eye skin, further pushing the ingredients into the dermis. After using an entire bottle of this product, i definitely experienced a reduction in the signs of my fine lines. the skin was plumped up and the lines less visible, plus the texture more refined. Used in conjunction with a good eye cream and alternating with Vitamin C serum, this is a great addition to any anti-aging regimen. I would surely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take off one star because I do not like the plastic packaging, as glass is the safest material for stability, and plastic has a tendency to shorten the shelf life of a formula. Plus plastics are not as safe we think.shorten the shelf life of a formula. Plus plastics are not as safe we think.</li>
    <li> funciona com certeza,meus olhos clarearam mesmo,eu recomendo</li>
    <li> I use the product as directed and it has reduced the puffiness under my eyes. It&#x27;s easy to apply and tries right away.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 1 week no results yet</li>
    <li> This product has diminished the dark circles under my eyes and they appear brighter.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for the wrinkles so I a using another product for that at night.</li>
    <li> Helps somewhat with wrinkles, but doesn&#x27;t reduce them as much as I would have thought.  For the price though, not a bad buy.</li>
    <li> I love Obagi but this was terrible. Dumb, expensive purchase on my part. Will continue to buy their other products. Don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
    <li> seemed like it made my puffiness and under eye wrinkles worse -no happy</li>
    <li> I love this. Goes on so easily and works to help remove fine lines around my eyes. I bought this a few weeks ago and am very impressed with the results.I have sagging bags above and below my eyes. Tried this stuff and it have reduced the bagginess.</li>
    <li> The Obagi eye cream is one of the best products on the market. I noticeably saw a decrease in the wrinkles around my eyes and am very happy with the product.</li>

    <li> Great and the price was good</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I first made this purchase from my dermatologist. I have tried other under eye roll on products and always go back to Obagi - Elastiderm Eye. It is the best.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I am 63.  It feels cool to the touch under your eyes and you can roll your eye-bags to disperse the fluid that accumulates overnight in this area.  Of course, this is not a miracle.  I don&#x27;t think I look younger, but I feel the area under my eyes is firmer than before the use of this product.  I use this with another Obagi eye cream.  Together, I see improvement in my under eye area after nearly two months of use.</li>
    <li> it makes my skin too dry</li>
    <li> Wakes my eyes a little but Loreal makes one just as good. I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love Obagi products.  Time will tell on this one but so far I like it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! !!&lt;br /&gt;Great price too</li>
    <li> CAUTION...The Product Description is written in a crazy imitation of English.  I&#x27;d love to try the product but this is a pretty big red flag. I&#x27;m concerned about the authenticity and the ingredients. If it is a copy, will different ingredients harm my skin?</li>
    <li> d person who use it say look fine</li>
    <li> I expected to see results. Sorry to say, but there were none.</li>
    <li> Noticed no change what so ever</li>
    <li> I decided to get this product because of the reviews. Unfortunately, i was really disappointed with the product.i am 32 yrs with less than an inch eye puffines,but it didn&#x27;t seem to work at all.pls. does anyone know what i can use for eyebag/eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> I liked ii, it is not really what I expected but it works really well, i can see the under eye area more firm.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK AT ALL USED IT TWICE A DAY AS I READ AND I SAW NO RESULTS AT ALL  I WILL NEVER BUT IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> Drying. Wasn&#x27;t a good choice for me</li>
    <li> Been using over a month, small improvement .Not sure I&#x27;d pay 90.00.That&#x27;s the price elsewhere.I probably will try something else or go back to my previous cream.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell if this product made any improvement on my under eyes puffiness.  I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about a month now.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  The packaging seemed a little bit on the cheaper side (plastic feel to it).</li>
    <li> I have used Elastiderm cream with good results for years.  I tried this in September, 2012 and used consistently for almost 2 years now.  The only good thing I can say is that it lasts a long time.  However, as for results, not only did I see no results, it GAVE me dark circles and puffiness where I&#x27;d never really had any before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend as much as I&#x27;d like to.  I like Obagi products but this one did more damage than good.</li>
    <li> Do not notice any difference but have only been using the product for about 3weeks? Will continue to use until gone...</li>
    <li> Save your $$$ I used this for over 6 months it is long lasting but saw 0 results</li>
    <li> This product certainly firms up around the eye area. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this as soon as I get up in the morning for eye puffiness. I can&#x27;t say that I think it works or not, I think I just have fat pads under my eyes that need removal. It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell if it helps with wrinkles, as I don&#x27;t have many.</li>
    <li> After reading the stellar reviews and researching online I decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: The roller ball releases the right amount of product and the cool serum feels really good.&lt;br /&gt;  No under eye tugging with the application.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Expensive (but would have been worth the price if I saw results).&lt;br /&gt;  Did not reduce my under eye puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this product as a last resort, maybe it will work for you. I end up sleeping on my left side and wake with puffiness under my left eye. I used the product exactly as recommended with absolutely no noticeable difference. I will add remarks to my review if I see improvements.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time.  I have to use it every other night, as it burns my skin.  However, that being said, I have used it on one eye and another product on the other eye.  This product stands out.  It reduces my bags--which I am most concerned about.  it also fades the dark circles, though not as quickly apparent.</li>
    <li> Awesome job, within 2 weeks completely saw the difference</li>
    <li> yes it is a great product and I have been using it for 2 years.  What a difference it has made.</li>
    <li> I have used the serum for 1 month. I have seen no reduction in the puffiness under my eyes. I will use the remaining product but will not purchase any more. Disappointed in the results. Will notify my optimologist who recommended it. It was cheaper on amazon than thru her office but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product  Just remember this product can dry out skin - so put on moisturizer after this product</li>
    <li> I like the roller ball effect of the application which means less pressure to the sensitive eye tissue. Further, the controlled amount of serum is easy to apply;</li>
    <li> one of the mostly good product</li>
    <li> This serum did not change my under eye bags at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> very good product but quite expensive. I feel there are other similiar products out there that do the same and are cheaper.</li>
    <li> My fav eye serum ever...........</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 weeks on the advice of my dermotologist.  I have very large puffy sections under my eyes and didn&#x27;t want surgery.  In 5 weeks, the puffy has been reduced in half and I am very happy.  I will be using this product from now on.  I asked the Dr why this product rather than the OTC offerings and he said this product has a far higher concentration of caffeine and antioxidants than allowed OTC which is why the results are much better.  It is not a miracle cure, but it is providing me with good results.  I&#x27;m not looking for results that turn back the clock 20 years, only to look good as I age.</li>
    <li> From spouse of account holder..&lt;br /&gt;I love this eye cream. I have been an avid OBAGI user for 15 years . This is so simple to use. Makes my eyes look brighter and softens the skin underneath my eyes. Lessens the dark circles too!!</li>
    <li> I have used this almost everyday and have noticed no visible results. I am not that impressed. The Elastiderm gel works much better.</li>
