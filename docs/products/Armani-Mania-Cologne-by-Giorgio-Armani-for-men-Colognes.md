    <li> This fragrance will forever be one of my alltime favorites. It&#x27;s long lasting and has a smell for any occasion; because it isn&#x27;t loud. I cant even find it in Dept stores anymore. This gem will soon be discontinued. I recommend grabbing one before it&#x27;s too late.....</li>

After receiving it I was stuck ...can not be returned and I don&#x27;t care for the sent so I will not be wearing it.  This was a waste of my time and money.

    <li> Disclaimer:  I&#x27;ve not purchased this from Amazon, only through local shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first bottle as a gift close to 10 years (yes, a decade) ago.  It&#x27;s the only cologne I&#x27;ve worn since.  As other reviewers have stated, this is not a strong fragrance.  It is, to me, light, slightly spicy with subtle floral and musk undertones.  As others have stated, it does not require much to achieve the desired effect and it absolutely lasts for hours.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it over the years, and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a light, pleasant, long lasting cologne.  That said, I would recommend visiting a local store to sample it to make sure that it is appropriate for your needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Fathers Day.  It is now my new favorite!  Smells fresh, like you just took a shower!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances, but I can wear this and really like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect! This is my husbands favorite Cologne! I am glad to see that these fragrances are genuine. I will be a return customer!</li>
    <li> Well let me say that I trusted the reviews on this product and I was not disappointed at all. It  has this great scent to it and if applied properly is fantastic. I sprayed it on one night, went out, and the scent was still on me the next morning before my shower. It is a great product and I would highly recommend it for a purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband is super fascinated with the product. while going to buy new this year. divine fragrance</li>
    <li> As a single man, your looks, personality, and other flaws do not even matter when you are wearing this cologne. I have had only compliments. I normally don&#x27;t wear the same cologne for years, but I haven&#x27;t worn anything since I wore this for the first time. On the business end, everything went smooth as it was promised. The delivery was prompt and the merchandise was as expected. 5 stars here with 0 complaints.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and quick shipping</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this available on Amazon.com; my son wears this and could no longer find it in stores. It was sold at a great price and it smells wonderful. I just wish this product hadn&#x27;t been discontinued!</li>
