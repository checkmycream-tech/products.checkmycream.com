      <li>I received exactly what I was expecting!</li>

      <li>I ended up rarely using it and gave it away because it just didn&#x27;t work for me personally.</li>
      <li>Hold it longer for tighter curls and hold it quick for loose curls.  </li>
      <li>This Hot Tools  Blue Ice Titanium meets all my expectations.  </li>

    <li> ilike this curling iron but i think its best for non professionals.the tip gets in the way a lot.but other than that it gives a beautiful curl.</li>
    <li> This curler is just alright. It does get super hot and I found it just a little to difficult to maneuver. Not only after use, the metal started to get dark spots all over it and they wouldn&#x27;t come off no matter what I did! I ended up rarely using it and gave it away because it just didn&#x27;t work for me personally. There are much better tools out there to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curl it gives is nice, but not the most user-friendly.</li>
    <li> Pretty easy to use and comes with a glove to protect your hand from getting burned. I plugged it in waited about 20 seconds and tried curling my hair. It worked perfectly. None of my other curling irons heat up that fast. And the best part for me is it has a very generously long cord. I&#x27;m sure that will come in handy when I&#x27;m reaching around to curl the back of my hair. And it is very light weight so your arm won&#x27;t be hurting from holding it up. I recommend getting this iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my new curling iron. It makes perfect ringlet curls that last. Heats up quickly and is lightweight, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hand. Does take a getting used to (type of curling iron), but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> The wand works very good and it heats up really fast. I use it ever morning before work and when I wrap my hair at night the curls come out better the next day. Great choice I made to buy this!</li>
    <li> Came in the mail in perfect condition and works amazing. I love it! I used it on my hair for homecoming too.</li>
    <li> i got it extremely fast and was really excited to use it. im glad i bought it cuz im in love with it. my curls come out perfect every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. It turns her wavy hair into beautiful strands of thick curls. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well, bought it for my 12 yo stepdaughter and she loves it. Picked this brand because it included a glove, but the warning that came with the glove were funny. Do not touch glove to iron, it is just for extra protection, it would melt if you held it on the iron.</li>
    <li> This Hot Tools  Blue Ice Titanium meets all my expectations.  Easy to use and great curls.  The gloves is very useful. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair. Whenever I used a flat iron or traditional curling iron the curls fall out within ten minutes no matter what I try. With this my curl will stay for three days. I love it. If this is your first time using a clipless wand I would recommend using the glove that comes with it. I burned myself when I didn&#x27;t use the glove.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It was worth the price I paid and I got it when I was supposed to. My hair also holds the curl for a long time! Which usually my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl that well. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchase for my granddaughter. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size so I purchased 2 different sizes. She loves them both</li>
    <li> My hair is very hard to keep a curl, but not when using this product.  It is different than a curling iron but once you do your hair twice you will be a pro! I use it every weekend and get a ton of compliments.  My hair is very long and straight and this is the only styler that holds a curl all day and night.  Love this product and any styler that is made by hot tools!</li>
    <li> i didnt know what happened, maybe i didnt read the instructions but when the first time i used it, it burn my hair and also the gloves. i dond recomended.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot so definitely wear the glove.  Hold it longer for tighter curls and hold it quick for loose curls.  Worked great with my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally very straight and rarely holds curl well. This curling iron not only gave me quick, perfect curls but they stayed through the night without falling out! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I was expecting! Works very well. I do recommend using lowest heat setting for fine hair and go up depending on thickness of the hair. I ordered too small of a size but it still does the job! Would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for the beachy wave look.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I know some people gave a bad review just because they got burned from it. But I have been curling my hair with a regular curling iron, except in the same way you use this one, so I was used to it. It heats up super hot, and within just 15 seconds I let out the curl from the iron and it&#x27;s perfect! Beautiful tight spirals. Then I losen them up with my fingertips and they separate but still remain curled. Gives my hair amazing volume! I have super long hair (down to my butt) and this works so great. Love it!</li>
    <li> I think this was exactly what I was looking for! Makes fun spiral curls. Can make lots of small curls or looser curls. Heats up fast, lots of good heat settings. Long cord. The heat mitten it comes with is \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but I found that using a regular glove - like the 99 cent magic stretchy gloves, worked better. Does get very hot though... Burned my forehead...</li>
    <li> this curling iron is the best that i have used, the curls lasts for days, i work faster and my clients are very satisfied. i recomend it with my eyes closed</li>
    <li> I am never going back to a traditional curling iron again. This little tool is great - it does wide flowing curls but it can also do corkscrews if you just use the tip. It heats up really fast and takes about a third of the time as a traditional curler. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is not only reasonably priced, but works great! I curled my hair the night before, slept on it and did not use any hairspray. I had curly hair all day and night the following day! A must have product!</li>
    <li> This is great if you want a tighter beach wave.  It makes your hair really cute and it is very simple to use.</li>
    <li> Works very well, I have hard to curl hair and this curling wand gave me cute curls! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Loved this, but it is hard to use because of the gap at base of handle. It makes it difficult to use quickly because you have to be careful wrapping the sections. I ended up buying a cheaper less professional one at Marshall&#x27;s for $18. It was much easier to use because it had no gap. For newbies like me I recommend buying one without the gap. Also the tapered feature made my hair slide down too much which made the tapered feature a waste.</li>
    <li> I love the curls this gives me. It is easy to use. My only complaint is that the glove is worthless. You can easily feel the heat and burn yourself through it so I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Santa bought her this and she uses it daily, along with my sister and any of my friends who come over.</li>
    <li> This really works well on my wife&#x27;s long hair. She has tried 3 other kinds and they won&#x27;t hold the curl, but this one lasted all day</li>
    <li> Yes, there are more expensive brands of hair tools, but why bother when you can get GREAT products for less the money.  My daughter LOVES this wand!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for our daughter for a Christmas gift 2012.  She used it no more than a dozen times and it stopped heating up.  Contacting Hot Tools for a refund or replacement.</li>
    <li> There is definently a learning curve to using this curling iron but once you figure it out it is awesome!</li>
    <li> This works. I use it on lowest setting because I have fine hair. I am very pleased. I am a novice but every time I use this wand I get a little faster (and dont burn myself as much!).</li>
