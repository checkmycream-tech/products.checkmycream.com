      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend to a friend and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I got this at a Clinique location and I was deciding between this brush vs the Mia which was $20 more.</li>
      <li>I love this sonic system cleansing brush</li>
      <li>My face looks so much more radiant since I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I truly love this product.  </li>
      <li>well a vibrator, and most of the vibration transfers to your hand, not the bristles.  </li>
      <li>I love the light weight, design, and the 2 bristle types on the head for T-zone verses cheeks.  </li>
      <li>My nose was full of blackheads!</li>
      <li>Great daily skincare step.</li>
      <li>It was a great deal and only cost me $99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day and within a weeks time I had 2 different people compliment me on how great my skin looked, that alone sold me on the product.    </li>
      <li>I really enjoyed using the brush at first.</li>
      <li>It cleanses gently, and would be great for sensitive skin.    </li>
      <li>However, I use it almost every night after removing my makeup and I can say that my skin is truly clean after its use.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Clinique Sonic System about a month ago and so far, I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
      <li>It feels much more clean, soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a scrubbing action.</li>
      <li>Pity, I really loved the effect the system had on my skin.</li>
      <li>I love it so ,my face feels so soft after using it.</li>
      <li>It came right away with no problems.</li>
      <li>I got about 4-5 days worth of use off the brush straight out of the box.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this, you could immediately see the difference it made.</li>
      <li>When I got the brush, I charged it for 24 hours as instructed and was able to use it for several weeks without having to re-charge.</li>
      <li>Try so many different products for skin care</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it a 5, but this experience was at least a good laugh at the time... but never again.</li>
      <li>My skin is so much more clear and soft and I have received compliments - when facing the SUN.  </li>
      <li>I am concerned that the brush head might not hold up long, but I love my skin.</li>
      <li>it is lightweight and easy to use especially when traveling.</li>
      <li>Its simple and so easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I already have pretty decent skin, so I can&#x27;t say that it has changed dramatically since using the brush.</li>
      <li>After 10 days of use I can really feel and SEE the difference.</li>
      <li>However, after 7-10 days, I can really see and feel the result.</li>
      <li>I think it really helped the appearance of my skin</li>
      <li>The hype is real.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the charge light is so bright.  </li>
      <li>The sleek design not only makes it stylish, but it&#x27;s also relatively small and easy to travel</li>
      <li>It did not get 5 stars due to the fine spray</li>
      <li>I bought this product directly from the Clinique counter.  </li>
      <li>My skin has completely adopted to the sonic cleansing.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product for someone  looking for a sonic cleaning system for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Each time, I leave it on the charger for about 24 hours until the light turns green.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty humiliating to have the airport TSA going through your bag in front of dozens of impatient stressed people because your bag is vibrating.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s pretty humiliating to have the airport TSA going through your bag in front of dozens of impatient stressed people because your bag is vibrating.  </li>
<li> - I&#x27;ve never owned any other facial cleansing brush, so I have no other to compare it to.</li>
<li> The green brushes are to be used in the zone where blackheads live (the T zone) while the white part of the brush is softer and is used on the rest of the face and neck.  </li>
<li> I am 28 with some sun damaged skin, pretty dry cheeks, large pores on my nose, and get the random pimple on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
<li> so I wanted something that would not be too harsh on my sensitive skin and help rid me of my flakiness.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get this product.</li>
<li> so a total of $120 spent</li>
<li> If you have a dry or sensitive skin (like I do), it will take like a week for your skin to adopt to this brush (a little redness might appear after procedure).</li>
<li> If these bristles actually move at all, it&#x27;s only slightly.</li>
<li> The white bristles on the brush are very soft, while the green bristles are a little sturdier, aiding in the exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Flaky, dry...</li>
<li> I got a few pimples the first few days of using it, but now I have literally no pimples!</li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> Used only a few times are bristles are already frayed.</li>
<li> immaturely giggled at the other commenter stating that a con of the product was that it sprayed her shoulders and chest.</li>
<li> Maybe buying from Amazon has given people bad experiences, but do yourself a huge favor and go to the clinique counter and try this out.</li>
<li> Seriously it lights up the entire room.</li>
<li> I bought system less than 3 months ago.</li>
<li> I was a little concerned because it is pricy, but since I could return it</li>
<li> Because I use it everyday, it of course has been charged now.</li>
<li> She uses it everyday and raves about it.  </li>
<li> (Not sure about Mia</li>
<li> Not nice.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> I cant use exfoliating scrubs of any kind, horrible break outs and it got to the point my skin just looked horrible with make up.</li>
<li> Something seems to be wrong with the battery.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sad.  </li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> I used it on my face anyway and eventually got sick on the vibration rattling my hand so would just switch it off.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent brush! Works as well as clarisonic and easier to handle. Holds its charge for 3 hours! Why buy it here...when it sells at any Clinique retailer for $89.50.</li>
    <li> works, using Clinique scrub and lotion... amazing results in 2 weeks and 1 month..</li>
    <li> Not impressed. If these bristles actually move at all, it&#x27;s only slightly. I was expecting more of a scrubbing action. Used only a few times are bristles are already frayed. Would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Great Product! My nose was full of blackheads! NOT aANYMORE! !! After 10 days of use I can really feel and SEE the difference. The battery lasts a lot and it&#x27;s Waterproof! loving this product.</li>
    <li> I love it so ,my face feels so soft after using it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great and very gentle</li>
    <li> good instructions, gentle on my skin, very pleased with product</li>
    <li> I really liked using the brush but after just 7 months of use it won&#x27;t charge.  It will act like its charging, the light comes on and after a few hours will turn green.  When I take it off the charger it will not turn on.  I&#x27;m so sad.  Its a lot of money for just 7 months of use!</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day and within a weeks time I had 2 different people compliment me on how great my skin looked, that alone sold me on the product.    Pros:  I love the light weight, design, and the 2 bristle types on the head for T-zone verses cheeks.  It cleanses gently, and would be great for sensitive skin.    Cons:  I still think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, just $10 under the Clairsonic&#x27;s Mia.  I did not like how it sprayed a mist of water on my shoulders and chest.  It would be great in the shower, but so-so at the sink.    Would I recommend it....yes. It did not get 5 stars due to the fine spray</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my Clinique Sonic Brush. I love how it makes my face feel after cleaning. Its simple and so easy. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get this product. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. It came right away with no problems.</li>
    <li> I love this sonic system cleansing brush it is lightweight and easy to use especially when traveling. After using with the three step skin care products from Clinique my skin felt cleaner and looked lighter. I would definitely recommend this product for someone  looking for a sonic cleaning system for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey...but it does work. The green brushes are to be used in the zone where blackheads live (the T zone) while the white part of the brush is softer and is used on the rest of the face and neck.  My face looks so much more radiant since I&#x27;ve been using this.  I use both the Clinique cleanser as well as the Basis face soap cleanser and my face looks much younger.</li>
    <li> I got this at a Clinique location and I was deciding between this brush vs the Mia which was $20 more. I am so glad I went with Clinique. This brush is amazing! (Not sure about Mia so I am biased) I got free samples of the sonic facial cleanser and the secret serum that I use after I use this brush. The first time I used this, you could immediately see the difference it made. I have very dry skin so I wanted something that would not be too harsh on my sensitive skin and help rid me of my flakiness. It did! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I went back to complete my cleaning pattern with the 3 step system they recommend with this brush and only spent an extra $30 so a total of $120 spent and now I have flawless skin and no dryness at all. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: everything I mentioned above! And Clinique customer service has been so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Spendy, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this brush and cleansing regularly I feel my skin has gotten so much better and looks more radiant!</li>
    <li> Great daily skincare step. If you have a dry or sensitive skin (like I do), it will take like a week for your skin to adopt to this brush (a little redness might appear after procedure). However, after 7-10 days, I can really see and feel the result. My skin has completely adopted to the sonic cleansing. It feels much more clean, soft and silky. No need for any scrub or additional peel off cleaning. I use it once a day (in the evening) for like a 1-1,5 min.</li>
    <li> This was a faulty product.The vendor had no replacement and told me to contact Clinique.I did this and Clinique claimed they did not cover 3 rd party sales on Amazon.Not nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She uses it everyday and raves about it.  My only complaint is that the charge light is so bright.  I have to put a towel over it at night so it doesn&#x27;t shine in my face while i&#x27;m trying to sleep.  Seriously it lights up the entire room.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clinique Sonic System about a month ago and so far, I&#x27;m loving it. The item was purchased at the Clinique counter in my local Belk, so I cannot comment on shipping and/or customer service from this seller. My Sonic System was purchased over the holidays (Dec 14) and was accompanied by the Liquid Facial Soap Oily Skin Formula, Clarifying Lotion, and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. It was a great deal and only cost me $99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions read to charge the brush before use, but I didn&#x27;t do that. I got about 4-5 days worth of use off the brush straight out of the box. Because I use it everyday, it of course has been charged now. I am on my third week without recharging and the brush is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I&#x27;ve never owned any other facial cleansing brush, so I have no other to compare it to. I did a lot of research before purchasing this item and ultimately decided on it because of its price compared to the others I has been studying. The head doesn&#x27;t  rotate, but rather vibrates in an upward and downward motion. The white bristles on the brush are very soft, while the green bristles are a little sturdier, aiding in the exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have pretty decent skin, so I can&#x27;t say that it has changed dramatically since using the brush. However, I use it almost every night after removing my makeup and I can say that my skin is truly clean after its use. My skin is very smooth and my pimple outbreaks have reduces since I&#x27;ve been using the brush. The sleek design not only makes it stylish, but it&#x27;s also relatively small and easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend to a friend and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product directly from the Clinique counter.  I wish I had kept the receipt.  The brush doesn&#x27;t move.  The handle just vibrates like...well a vibrator, and most of the vibration transfers to your hand, not the bristles.  The brush feels like a pedicure brush for my feet.  I used it on my face anyway and eventually got sick on the vibration rattling my hand so would just switch it off.  No skin miracles were occuring so now it collects dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immaturely giggled at the other commenter stating that a con of the product was that it sprayed her shoulders and chest.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using the brush at first. I think it really helped the appearance of my skin and I have been having fewer acne breakouts. When I got the brush, I charged it for 24 hours as instructed and was able to use it for several weeks without having to re-charge. That was great! The second time I charged it, it only kept the charge for about 10 days. On the third occasion, after 2 days it was out of charge. Each time, I leave it on the charger for about 24 hours until the light turns green. Something seems to be wrong with the battery. Pity, I really loved the effect the system had on my skin. I bought system less than 3 months ago.</li>
    <li> Love the product but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  It&#x27;s pretty humiliating to have the airport TSA going through your bag in front of dozens of impatient stressed people because your bag is vibrating.  Oh the jokes to be made on THAT one.  If there&#x27;s a way to have it shut off for stored away travel I&#x27;ll give it a 5, but this experience was at least a good laugh at the time... but never again. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local Clinique counter and I love it. Try so many different products for skin care and I never want to buy the same thing twice because there is no change in my skin. I am 28 with some sun damaged skin, pretty dry cheeks, large pores on my nose, and get the random pimple on my forehead and cheeks. I cant use exfoliating scrubs of any kind, horrible break outs and it got to the point my skin just looked horrible with make up. Flaky, dry...ugh. I was trying a CC cream at Clinique when the lady working at the counter recommended this. I was a little concerned because it is pricy, but since I could return it I thought I would give it a shot. I am so glad that i did! I got a few pimples the first few days of using it, but now I have literally no pimples! None. My skin &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34;. A statement I thought I would never make. I am concerned that the brush head might not hold up long, but I love my skin. Makeup looks flawless. Maybe buying from Amazon has given people bad experiences, but do yourself a huge favor and go to the clinique counter and try this out. Or any sonic brush. The hype is real. This thing is amazing.</li>
    <li> We recently moved back home in the north from Florida.  What a difference this system has made!  My skin is so much more clear and soft and I have received compliments - when facing the SUN.  I&#x27;ll be using it forever...</li>
