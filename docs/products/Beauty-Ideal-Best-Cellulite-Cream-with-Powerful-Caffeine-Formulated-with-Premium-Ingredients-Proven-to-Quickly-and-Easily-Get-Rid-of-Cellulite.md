<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a month and I have seen a big difference in my skin. It is much firmer!  This is one of the best creams I have used!</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I am 67 and have used many products on the market today.  Even though I am not finished with my first jar, I am very pleased with the results so far.  I have used it on my arms, and my neck.  Yes ladies, my neck!  Those of you who are blessed with still being here at my age know that your neck is one that suffers from sagging skin.  This product has decreased some of the sag and wrinkles and I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after I have used another jar.  My arms, while still showing some of the age lines, have decreased significantly.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  I can definitely tell that my trouble spot is much firmer.  Only used it for about a week.  Then I went out of town for a couple of weeks and I forgot to bring it with me on the trip.  I started using it again just a couple of days ago and I can already see a difference!!!</li>
    <li> works well and will purchase again</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Arrived super fast. It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I will be purchasing many more of this cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now. Put it on my upper thighs, above the knees, buttocks, and upper arms. And I use it about every other day. Well, where I did notice the difference for sure, is area above my knees. Probably, because i can see it easily :) I do like the cream, it smells good, and absorbs in the body very fast not leaving greasy residue even though the cream consists of many different oils. You don&#x27;t need to use much of it, and it lasts. I will seriously consider buying it again!</li>
    <li> Awesome I see results almost right away great product will buy again and again thanks again beauty ideal</li>
    <li> I have tried several cellulite products and I found this one the best.  I like the fragrance which is just a bonus.</li>
    <li> I started using it very slightly and I didn&#x27;t really notice anything. I began workin out and continuing to use the cream more often every morning and night and I can barley notice any cellulite. Great product and it seems to helping.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about four months now, I really cant see changes but when I put it on it feels like its doing something to my legs. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either so thats a plus. I say try it out, it may or may not work for you.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast.  This is my second jar, and I really can see a difference.  I really do!</li>
    <li> i used this cream within one week i started to see results, i have very bad cellulite and tried several creams but this one is by far the best i cant wait to get my second bottle to continue seeing results i had so much so its going to take one more to get me where i want to be so ill be ready for my bikini this summer thank you so much Beauty Ideal&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the cream yet i Just received it today. i hope this really does work for me like it worked for the others on the reviews that i had read. Received it before the expected date. I rate this product 3 stars for fast delivery. I&#x27;ll rate this product later for a 5 star if it really does work.</li>
    <li> I have tried about every cellulite cream out there and this one is by far the best! At first I was a little hesitant because it is a little more expensive then the others but it is defiantly worth it! I noticed results in just one week I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I just finished using this cream and it worked pretty well.  I did notice a change after a couple weeks.  I would love to see this product with a little bit of a toning color added to it.</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;I am in 40s and thin,But I do have cellulite and loose skin on my up arm looks terrible in tank top no matter what kind of exercise I do still no way to get rid off.So find this BUAUTY IDEAL CELLULITE CREAM :-) I been us this about two weeks,I were it every day after shower like body lotion the results it&#x27;s really impressed I&#x27;m going to keeping buying and using it for sure!</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle of beauty ideal. It leaves my skin a little sticky. It is a rather thin cream and goes on well. I will up my review if it works in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the first time ever i write a review. But There&#x27;s always time for anything,especially when is a product so good like this,with great results. I really like it,i been using for a week already and i like it so far,i also use it on my stomach area wen i work out and i love the sensation. Pleasant odor too. Great product.👍</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail. I have used other cellulite-reducing products in the past and I haven&#x27;t been able to obtain good results. This product seems promising as I have been using it for about a week now and can see a slight difference. The reason I give it a 3 star is because once you stop using this product the cellulite will most likely come back.</li>
    <li> This product is working very good so far. It seems to be doing the job. I have noticed tighter skin and less appearance of cellulite. Am very excited to see continued working results of the product with first jar.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it for 2 weeks and she likes it a lot. She can see a difference, especially in the stomach and thigh area. They seem to be more toned and firm. I will have to buy another one for her soon.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference and I&#x27;m almost done with the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin soft though</li>
    <li> This product really works my cellulite disappear right be for my eye..thanks beauty ideal...Linda</li>
    <li> great product. It helps with the cellulite.</li>
    <li> This cream definately works and I would recommend it for others.</li>
    <li> Im starting to see a great result now. I will keep using this product !!</li>
    <li> I do notice a difference, I have been using it for a month. It does go along way, using it on my upper arms and upper thighs.  I do notice a difference, I have been using it for a month. It does go along way, using it on my upper arms and</li>
    <li> Being using this for 2 weeks, really has helped firm my legs.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Best Cellulite Cream Ever!&lt;br /&gt;Received my Beauty Ideal Cellulite Cream in only a few days after placing the order.  It has a light refreshing fragrance that is very pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on my skin and immediately is absorbed and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.  I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s and have begun using this great creme on my thighs and upper arms where my current cellulite prevents me from wearing sleeveless tops or shorts.  This cream has all the right ingredients to help be get rid of that awful cellulite and get back to wearing the kind of clothes I really like to wear!</li>
    <li> After seeing the other reviews I had to try this product.  Item arrived super fast as others have stated.  Goes on very smooth and light.  I already feel like it&#x27;s working and it&#x27;s only been a few days.  Looking forward to great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been embarrassed and upset about the cellulite on my butt, hips and back of my thighs for years now, and recently I decided to try and do something about it. I found BeautyIdeal cellulite cream and ordered a bottle, and since starting, I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference! It really works (which truly shocked me because I had it in my mind that most of these creams were gimmicks). I&#x27;m really glad I started using this cream, and I&#x27;ll definitely continue to do so!</li>
    <li> As promised, this product delivers. My wife appreciated the nice and smooth application. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No changes! Very sticky this is not working for me. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. Please send me a refund</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for approximately 2 weeks.  I can tell a bit of a difference in my skin but not as much as some of the other buyers.  It has only been a few weeks so I will give it a bit longer to form a &amp;#34;final&amp;#34; opinion.  It does appear to work better if you buy an applicator.  I had one from a previous purpose from another product and have been it along with the cream and the results have improved.</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping!  I received it yesterday and tried it for the first time this morning - went on super smooth.  Rubbed in easily.  Feels like it will work - I&#x27;ll update my review after a couple weeks with results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a while now and it really seems to have done a good job reducing the ugly cellulite on the back of my legs.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but after seeing these results, I am very satisfied with the cream and will be ordering it again if this ever runs out.  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I was surprised with how quickly my order arrived in the mail! I was skeptical if this would really work...I have never tried any type of cellulite cream. I am pleasantly surprised by the smell...I thought it would have an odor but it has a nice light fragrance. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. You can feel it working but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  Simple, easy, visible results equals a repeat customer! I will be ordering again! Thank you Beauty Ideal!</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream for a couple weeks now.  Love smell not strong, smells clean. I am seeing results after a couple weeks. Improvement in skin texture. Love that you only have to use it once a day other similar products had to use twice a day with little results. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> The produce works great, helps with the cellulite removal and was shipped very timely.  It continues to provide the necessary coverage and is breaking down the adipose appearance.</li>
    <li> I really liked the way this went on -- wasn&#x27;t greasy or tacky feeling. And the smell was nice. Not overwhelming, either, so it won&#x27;t clash with my perfume. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results ... so far really like this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife&#x27;s 65th birthday (she hinted that she wanted to try it along with another product for yet another purpose). She feels it is the best anti-cellulite cream she has ever tried. She says that her skin remained moist and smooth after just two tries of it. She normally brushes her skin in areas of cellulite with a natural fiber bathing brush before going into the shower  and then used this product afterwards for almost 3 days. She says that is excellent - only wishes it came in larger containers :) - but she says she still evaluates it as 5 stars to anyone curious about trying it.</li>
    <li> Great! A light &amp; smooth cream. It arrived in a timely fashion and packaged well. Would recommend to others. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This cream is a VERY good Product! I&#x27;ve been only using it for a couple days and I can see how my abdomen area is more changing, redefining and firm!! . I was needed something to help me lose the fat &amp; tone the abdomen area and this cream is doing it very well. After I applied the cream, the scent simply go away and it is absorbed by the skin very fast. As I said, It is a great product, everyone, anyone who just wants to tone, lose fat on abdomen area, give this a try!!!</li>
    <li> I watch the TV show Dr. Oz and saw your product. At first I was a bit skeptical, because most cellulite creams claim to help remove that cellulite that we just hate, but your product really has been working for me. I was so Surprised of the results I am getting from your product. I love the smell and how easy it goes on my legs. My skin definitely feels firmer and smoother. I will be a returning buyer of this product. I am so happy I found this wonderful cream! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Smell OK. I saw some improvement on my thigh as I used the cream in conjunction with my Zumba class. It soften and smooth my skin. Not too pricy for a cream that works for less than $50.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - arrived prior to estimated delivery date.  Began using very next day and was impressed with the pleasantly fresh fragrance and ease of application.  I have read many positive articles about the ingredients in this product. Consequently I was excited to find this product  at such an affordable price. I am looking forward to the benefits of using Beauty Ideal Cellulite Cream - will post an update in a few weeks. I anticipate use of this product will become a permanent part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> Thanks to the Cellulite Secret Ebook that comes with the Beauty Ideal Cellulite Cream I know how to rid the rest of the old size 16 dimples.&lt;br /&gt;Now size 9, I exercise regular and eat healthy, with Beauty Ideal Cellulite Cream the dimples are gone and I love my smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Used for 3 weeks... Skin feels tighter and firmer, but there is no visible difference.  Smells fine... Consistency is fine...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars quite yet, just due to the time that has passed, but so far, so good!  I will return and update my review when the jar is out.  Delivery was fast.  Easy to rub in very thoroughly, which is a plus. I used another cream and getting it to absorb was a hassle. No lingering smell. And with the caffeine and retinol, I feel like SOMETHING is in the works on my thighs :)  Will report back but so far, nothing bad to note at all. I like.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! I&#x27;ve been only using it for 10 days, but my abdomen area is redefining, firm, smooth!! I was a fitness enthusiast during 90s, worked out 2-3 hours, 4 times a day before I got into series of MVA (Motor Vehicle Accident)s &amp; a work injury that led to having 4 low back surgeries that included replacing the ruptured disk with titanium hardware. So, I am a bionic woman, literally, LOL. My last back surgery was in January of 2000, had another surgery of knee in 2004. All these surgeries made my body incapable of doing the exercises I was able to do before so, I started walking with my American Eskimo who loved to walk as much as I did. When walking started to bother my back &amp; knee, I gained a bit of weight. I was skinny until I turned 30, weighed around 120-125 &amp; I am 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; tall, so I managed to be slender most of my life until recently. All I wanted was something to help me lose the fat &amp; tone the abdomen area &amp; I found this cream. I just wanted to give it a try without any expectations. After I received the cream, I open the jar &amp; the scent was was bit medicinal(?) at first, for I have very keen sense of smell which prevents me from wearing any kind of perfume; however, after I applied the cream, the scent simply disappeared &amp; I started to notice the change almost right away. My skin was firm &amp; smooth. As days passed I began to see the area where I needed to concentrate on!!! It is a great product, everyone, anyone who just wants to tone, lose fat on abdomen area, give this a try. It is an awesome product &amp; I highly recommend it!!! Best of Luck, Lucia</li>
    <li> This cream worked well and is truly ideal. I noticed an improvement within a week and was very pleased with my results.</li>
    <li> I have been using cream for about 1 week.  It has a clean smell but is a little sticky feeling.  I am using it on my thighs and buttocks area.  So far I have not noticed any improvement, but, I will continue to use and hopefully within a few weeks will be able to see some results.</li>
    <li> My wife and I are going on a cruise in 4 weeks, and despite being thin she has some cellulite on her upper legs which she hates.  We bought this as we have heard good things about it from some friends.  So we took a chance and placed the order and it came SUPER fast a week or so ago and she started using it immediately (she loves how smooth and firm her skin feels after application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well even after just over a week my wife say&#x27;s it is working and she can see a visible reduction in her cellulite.  So for that, THANK YOU Beauty Ideal, now she will be more comfortable on our cruise and we both will have more fun!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and so far I&#x27;m loving this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it straight out of the shower on my problem areas..tummy, bum, thighs and I think I&#x27;m seeing some improvement.  It goes on smooth and smells fresh.  I thought it may be sticky, but it hasn&#x27;t been a bother.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was complaining about about this one spot of cellulite that she hated on her legs. I knew it bothered her and hear about some creams helping resolve this. I did a ton of research online for her trying to find a cream that really worked. I gave this a try after reading some reviews. It totally works!!! I found that this cream went on super smooth and was easy rub in. Plus, this cream has little to no smell. I would have never bought this for her but am so glad I did as she is in love with it. It totally works, takes about a week, but the results are amazing.I am a believer in this product and she is already recommending it to her friends and others.</li>
    <li> This is my first review although I&#x27;m a prime member and have been purchasing (lots) from Amazon for years. I purchased this product before going on a winter vacation.  I am thin but with some cellulite on my legs that I hate!! This product has done a very good job at diminishing the cellulite. It rubs on smooth with a warming sensation. I use it in the morning and sometimes at night too. I am very happy with the results and will continue to use this product. I felt much better on my vacation thanks to it!!</li>
    <li> I have used most of the jar, have not seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from an episode on Dr. Oz and where a dermatologist explained how retinol and caffeine can reduce and sometimes even eliminate cellulite.  What&#x27;s great is that this cream had both in one cream.  I don&#x27;t have that much, but I did have enough where I am self conscious of it when in a bathing suit.  I&#x27;ve been using this and it works much better than I thought it would, my cellulite has greatly diminished.  So thanks!</li>
    <li> Week 1 and skin is looking smoother and more toned than usual :0)</li>
    <li> I received the Beauty Ideal Firming Cellulite Cream very fast after placing the order with no shippling/handling charges.&lt;br /&gt;It has a good fragrance and it goes on skin smoothy.  After hearing about the combination of retinol and caffeine I am excited and cannot wait for good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N. Santiago</li>
    <li> I used this faithfully after every shower. Applied as directed but I haven&#x27;t received any results. Disappointed!  Only gave it 2 stars cuz I liked the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this cellulite cream after searching for a week reading over 100 reviews on other cellulite products. I choose this one because of all the feedback it has received. I absolutely love it after using it for a week I already see small changes in my skin, I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using in the cream for longer. This was a great investment and you should give it a try. It beats lipo for sure.</li>
    <li> This cellulite cream worked effectively when I used it. It reduced the amounts of cellulite on the back and front of my thighs in a matter of weeks. This product is more effective when compared to Nivea Skin Firming Cellulite Gel Cream. I would recommend Beauty Ideal to others. When using it, you must be patient for results to show. Overall, this was a decent product that I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Considerably smoother and firmer skin and visibly reduced bumps in one week. Absorbs fast. Great product.</li>
    <li> It has been one week since I started using product. Don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my troubled areas but it may still be too early to say. Product smells fine. Item was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using the cream, haven&#x27;t see a result yet but I&#x27;ll keep using it for a few months to see if I can see a result.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream . I have cellulite on the back of my thighs and my butt . I never show off my legs until now . Since using this cream the appearance of my cellulite looks alot better than before . There a huge difference . I now show off my legs . I will forever be a customer :)</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product after having read the other reviews and I have to say that I will definitely purchase this again. This product, unlike many, doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor, but it mildly scented, which I personally like. It is not a lotion, more like a serum, which doesn&#x27;t weigh down the skin or make you feel greasy. It absorbs quickly and leaves little to no smell after completely absorbed. I haven&#x27;t had the product long so I will write another review after I see the results. Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;m needing a product like this to supplement my, anti- cellulite, regimen.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!!!!! Love the consistency of it. I have only used for a couple of days and have used it along with the cellulite mitt and it seems to be working already. nice smell as well. Will definately order again.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! No only does it have the cellulite reducing properties, but I love the skin firming effect it has for those areas that didn&#x27;t rebound as well after pregnancy. I definitely recommend this cream to anyone looking to smooth AND firm skin!</li>
    <li> I had been choosing a cream for so long. I&#x27;ve made my choice. It was Beauty Ideal. So far so good. No regrets. I like how it looks, smells and works. But I always combine cream with a gym workout.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that delivery was quick and on time.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a product with these ingredients and was happy to find one with so many good reviews.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and will definitely get another jar to give the product a fair chance to work on all my problem areas.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product smells wonderful in comparism to some I&#x27;ve used in the past. I can feel it working when I put it on and have already noticed the back of my thighs look better. I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED  A PROMO FOR $1.00, TRY IT AS FAST AND I SEE IT...never work...don&#x27;t give your email at beauty ideal it&#x27;s fraud....</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I am looking forward to seeing how well it works.  So far I can tell you that it has a good smell&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t like scented lotions, for reference) and it feels likes it&#x27;s trying to do something when applied.  I will see in the coming weeks.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a week and do not see any difference yet.  Hopefully there will be some improvement.  It does smell kind of odd, but I have gotten used to that.  It absorbs nicely into the skin with no greasy feel.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product.  I&#x27;m hoping to see some good results! I&#x27;m excited about it because I have some stubborn fat I&#x27;m trying to tone up with exercise and this product!</li>
    <li> shipped right on time, 2 days with prime as promised. I&#x27;ve used one bottle and i just received my second one. I can see a difference already even though I just started using it. It works for me and it&#x27;ll probably work for you!</li>
    <li> Just started to use that I&#x27;m hopeful and it actually has a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> My girlfriend recommended this to me and told me I had to try it..  Now, I normally wouldn&#x27;t have bought something like this as I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work and I have never tried any sort of cellulite cream.  But I have to say, after seeing the results with my own eyes, I am now a believer in this product and can definitely recommend it to others - in fact, I am telling all my friends.</li>
    <li> The cream arrived very quickly after ordering! I have used this for a few weeks now on the back of my thighs and the product goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling at all, so you can get dressed quickly. It hardly has a scent so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it blending with your perfume. I like the product very much and have noticed some areas on my thighs look firmer. Definitely recommend, great product.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a little over a week so not sure if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;too early to tell&amp;#34; but so far am pleased. Seeing slight improvement in the appearance so we&#x27;ll see what happens after continued use over the next couple of weeks. It is sticky but easily washes off hands.</li>
    <li> A really nice product! Nice fragrance and nice feeling when its being rubbed. Was a little bit unsure of how to use it but Im definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I love the product it works very well. I start noticing right when I use it. My husband and family notice my difference of using the product as will. I have my sister asking me what I had done and I told them about the product and now they are using the product as will. Currently on my third bottle and will continue to buy the product.</li>
    <li> While this cream has some good ingredients (caffeine, l-carnitine), retinol, which is heavily advertised, is one of the last ingredients on the ingredients list which means it is at very low concentration. In addition, SD alcohol is 4th ingredient (after water, butylene glycol, and glycerin) which makes this cream drying for the skin (and why would you want SD alcohol in your cosmetics?).</li>
    <li> GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, RECEIVED FAST. NO RESULTS SEEN YET BUT i JUST STARTED USING IT, I WILL UPDATE WITH ANY RESULTS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very excited to receive my Beauty Ideal shipment.  I saw information about using this combination of products on the Dr. Oz show and can&#x27;t wait to give it a try!  I&#x27;ll update my review in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Came quick! Love caffeine based creams as they really seem to perk up the skin nicely. This one has some other cool stuff in it like green tea extract, carnitine (love carnitine!), rose hip and peppermint extracts. No wonder it smells good. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 7 different creams, this is actually the best!! Visible difference in a week!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I bought it for my wife (her request) and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I had no idea they had anything on the market for cellulite, unless you had surgery for it. I saw this cream on Amazon and the reviews were high&lt;br /&gt;so I decided to try it. Boy why didn&#x27;t I check this out long ago. I saw improvement after the 4th application and it still is getting better. Thank&lt;br /&gt;goodness I decided to give it a try, since they have many creams that says it give the same if not better results. Happy!</li>
    <li> Got my package way quicker than estimated time which was awesome, applied it for the first time today smells pretty good almost hasa chocolate/cocobutter smell to it, takes a little bit to absorb into your skin so apply when you dont have anywhere to be soon lol, I will be writing another review after I start seeing results, I have confidence that It will work!</li>
    <li> starting using it under my chin-the uplift  lasts most of the day!</li>
    <li> Beauty Ideal Celluilte Cream is effective at reducing thigh dimples. As well as smoothing and improving skin tone.</li>
    <li> Good Product. I have been using it for a while now and it is working pretty good. it smells really good and it makes the skin super soft. I apply it at night after I shower. Like I said, it works pretty good. I recommend that you try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it two days-once in the morning after a workout and shower, and then again before bed. Already, my skin is feeling more firm and plump, so I will continue using this product in addition to my yoga and interval training. *NOTE: I have also changed my eating habits to a healthier lifestyle of eating more small meals during the day, i.e. instead of 3 regular meals a day, I have 6 small ones, sometimes substituting a smoothie for a meal....</li>
    <li> i have had it for a few days ,but it does seem to have a firming, effect ,the skin does feel tighter,the only complaint i have is that it has a sligth medicine smell to it ,which does fade after about 20 mins ,seems to work great,just not big on the smell</li>
    <li> Does not work, even after 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and already I see difference in my cellulite especially underneath my buttocks. My skin smoother too!! I will continue to buy more of this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a short whole, and I&#x27;m shocked because I am already getting results. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it works so well that I don&#x27;t even care. Definitely will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I used this cream for 2 weeks and already I can see great results.  Thank u so much!</li>
    <li> smells awesome!!  cant wait to try it out.  I have been waiting for something like this to come on the market.  Thank you so much Now a few weeks later,I have not noticed any change in my cellulite.  Very dissappointed I guess</li>
    <li> Great protect! Deconstructed the job done</li>
