### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful texture, not runny, not greasy, and quiets the eczema.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for my face.</li>
      <li>the best thing is this cream treats the itchiness.  </li>
      <li>It just took a couple applications to figure out what amount worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a deal breaker though because it is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Again, I do not have eczema, but I am very glad I bought this product!</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion.  </li>
      <li>Good product at a good price point!</li>
      <li>I have dermatitis and this works perfectly and even better than what my dermatologist gave me.</li>
      <li>Good value, fragrance-free.</li>
      <li>Really good product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s about as honest as I can be.</li>
      <li>Really the best of the Moisturizing Creams we have tried.</li>
      <li>My face has never felt so smooth and nice!</li>
      <li>I liked the cream - did the job but wasn&#x27;t as effective as Aquaphor, although it has a much better after-application feel than Aquaphor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing, though, relief comes quickly after I apply the cream on him, and after two treatments all the visibile inflammation is gone.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be very good, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>and I tried many cream (even prescribed by dermatologist and allergists) over period of some years, but all in-vain.</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>It moisturized it, sure, but I hoped for more.</li>
      <li>The Aveeno make my skin feel so much better.  </li>
      <li>Really works and does a great job.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>When my daughter is 4 weeks old her perfect flawless skin starts to breakout, I called her pediatrician of what I can do to help it clear, they told me do nothing as it is normal because my baby still have all the hormones she got from me, they call it \\&quot;baby</li>
      <li>I am so glad this is available.</li>
      <li>This lotion is light and calming.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Lesson learned sometimes you need to follow your mother instinct, because sometimes you are right!</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for quick bouts of moisture throughout the day since it&#x27;s not as greasy as Eucerin.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m back to the best relief I&#x27;ve found so far for flareups: pure petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>However, this is easily solved by not using too much.</li>
      <li>So far, this product has left a great impression on me.</li>
      <li>I started buying it because I have a kid with atopic dermatitis and it´s not so easy to find lotions that relieve itching without causing more irritation in the long run.</li>
      <li>I applied it on the area right after bath.</li>
      <li>Only problem is making sure that I have it</li>
      <li>This helped at first</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t very strong and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much, the results are very worth the few seconds of smelling the lotion.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of its low rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website (low rating &#x3D; good).</li>
      <li>Despite the high price, I consider this worthy of 5 stars because it really works.</li>
      <li>I had never expected such an effective cream until I applied this to my eczema area on my chest.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so amazed, I wished my daughter&#x27;s peds let me use this the very first time I ask for help about her face and want something to help it clear</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>If I use too much, it doesn&#x27;t really soak in, it seems to stay on my skin</li>
      <li>The daily antihistamine pill will calm the internal causes of many forms of Eczema, (which is now thought to be caused by allergy)</li>
      <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
      <li>This cream really works in relieving his eczema each and every time.</li>
      <li>I wish Aveeno had a similar shampoo (i.e. fragrance free and moisturizing) for scalp eczema, too.</li>
      <li>I end up turning to home remedies based on some friend recommendation and internet research and that really worked for me.</li>
      <li>am always hopeful that some miracle will come along, and free me from the pain, the redness, and above all else - The itching.</li>
      <li>i like it really helped my eczema on my foot.</li>
      <li>Really helps soften, soothe, and reduce the redness.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found nothing about this product to really do much of anything for my eczema.</li>
      <li>This lotion really works in moisturizing my skin.</li>
      <li>If it were cheaper I would have used it on him more, but alas you easily use up the 5 oz.</li>
      <li>in this tube quickly, so I end up always just treating him after eczema comes back.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I Highly recommend this to everybody who is suffering from eczema.</li>
      <li>but after a few days started to irritate my skin even more.</li>
      <li>and because you stand behind your products with a good return policy.</li>
      <li>Most moisturizers I have tried for dry or sensitive skin burn on application and cause irritation that can last for hours.</li>
      <li>but it will definitely be my winter moisturizer from now on.... and its low rating on the EWG site makes me feel good about using something that is not full of toxins.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this moisturizer did not burn my skin but soothed it!</li>
      <li>Two and a half days later I saw visible improvement, the patch is still there but is much more flesh toned and</li>
      <li>For this lotion, I really have to be careful with how much I use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I really have to be careful of how much I use on my face.</li>
      <li>her face is so soft and</li>
      <li>I use the cream for myself and my 2-and-half month old.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I will need something this strong in the summer,</li>
      <li>I have also tried it when my hands get too dry, and it really soothes.</li>
      <li>If you have spots of eczema, try using this lotion regularly, but also, get on an over-the-counter non-drowsy antihistamine such as Claritin (or its cheaper generic drugstore equivalent, like Walgreen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Walatin&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>all the red spot rashes is gone completely.</li>
      <li>I wish it could get rid of the whole dark spot of eczema though</li>
      <li>I do not have eczema, but I do have fairly dry, sensitive skin on my face.</li>
      <li>I had a small patch of red, dry, itchy skin on my right leg (near my ankle) that would not go away.</li>
      <li>I tossed it into the trash and went on the hunt for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try this because it is specifically marketed for eczema, afraid that it would only cause more problems for my skin.</li>
      <li>My eczema is very inflamed, and while this cream isn&#x27;t making it go away, it does soothe my skin for a little while when I put it on.</li>
      <li>Works very well on my little girl&#x27;s hands that suffer from over washing.</li>

<li> and I have had very dry skin that my $60 moisturizer was not taking care of.</li>
<li> Not really as a eczema cream.</li>
<li> a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how it is for other people</li>
<li> It has a slight smell to it</li>
<li> It is a little greasy, but my skin absorbs it within a few minutes.  </li>
<li> I have been using this daily on my face &amp; the redness has decreased as well as the itching....</li>
<li> But we will be using this Cream year round.  </li>
<li> At night I usually put a thick layer of Eucerin Moisturizing Cream on, as I feel this lotion isn&#x27;t intense enough for really bad eczema.</li>
<li> I have a few small patches of eczema, and if you&#x27;re reading this chances are you do too.</li>
<li> I have some eczema on my eyelids, and bought this since I usually like Aveeno products.</li>
<li> I had a small rash in my hand</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had a small patch of red, dry, itchy skin on my right leg (near my ankle) that would not go away. After several weeks of trying several oils, lotions, and creams and cortizone without any improvement I started googling my symptoms. This lead me to the possibility that this stubborn patch of skin was actually eczema. I ran to the store to replace my existing Aveeno moisturizing cream, and found this Eczema Therapy Cream instead. I took it home and lathered my body in it, but specifically the patch of skin twice a day. Two and a half days later I saw visible improvement, the patch is still there but is much more flesh toned and the best thing is this cream treats the itchiness.  It has been such a relief to see immediate improvement in my skin, I now swear by this cream!</li>
    <li> I had never expected such an effective cream until I applied this to my eczema area on my chest. I always apply it after I take a shower and never have seen the symptoms again. I Highly recommend this to everybody who is suffering from eczema. I wish Aveeno had a similar shampoo (i.e. fragrance free and moisturizing) for scalp eczema, too.</li>
    <li> This cream works for me. It healed up a very mean rash (don&#x27;t know if was eczema, but my mother always had it).  This is a life saver... no more pain and very irritated red skin.  Thank goodness for Amazon and your reviews.  That&#x27;s why I keep coming back here...and because you stand behind your products with a good return policy.</li>
    <li> I started buying it because I have a kid with atopic dermatitis and it´s not so easy to find lotions that relieve itching without causing more irritation in the long run. My kid likes using it. I have also tried it when my hands get too dry, and it really soothes.</li>
    <li> i like it really helped my eczema on my foot. It also stopped my itching on the eczema. I wish it could get rid of the whole dark spot of eczema though</li>
    <li> My daughter gets red and itchy hand skin in the winter and this cream does the trick! We love it.</li>
    <li> ...this product is not up to par. I have some eczema on my eyelids, and bought this since I usually like Aveeno products. But this gave me no relief at all. I looked at the indredients, and saw that the cream contains *alcohol*! Who puts alcohol in a product for severely dry skin? I&#x27;m no chemist, but that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. So I&#x27;m back to the best relief I&#x27;ve found so far for flareups: pure petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> I have a few small patches of eczema, and if you&#x27;re reading this chances are you do too. Naturally, because of how annoying eczema is to deal with I am always hopeful that some miracle will come along, and free me from the pain, the redness, and above all else - The itching. Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t the answer. Nothing seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno cream is quite oily. That&#x27;s the only thing on appearance, application, or results that differentiates it from any run of the mill lotion. It&#x27;s thinner than a traditional lotion, but the results, when applied to your eczema are even with the results you&#x27;d get from a $3 bottle of over the counter lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found nothing about this product to really do much of anything for my eczema. It moisturized it, sure, but I hoped for more. It did not relieve the itching, if anything it may have increased it for the 1/2 hour, or so, after application. I applied it faithfully per the instructions. It just.. Well... Doesn&#x27;t do anything. That&#x27;s about as honest as I can be.</li>
    <li> my husband has eczema, he says this cream helps.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be very good, but I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s a wonderful texture, not runny, not greasy, and quiets the eczema. Really good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of its low rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website (low rating &#x3D; good). I do not have eczema, but it is winter and I have had very dry skin that my $60 moisturizer was not taking care of. After using it, I no longer have dry skin! I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have to be careful of how much I use on my face. With my previous moisturizer, if I wanted extra moisturizing, I could add extra product and let it soak in. For this lotion, I really have to be careful with how much I use. If I use too much, it doesn&#x27;t really soak in, it seems to stay on my skin and I don&#x27;t like the way it feels when that happens. However, this is easily solved by not using too much. It just took a couple applications to figure out what amount worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I will need something this strong in the summer, but it will definitely be my winter moisturizer from now on.... and its low rating on the EWG site makes me feel good about using something that is not full of toxins.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my little girl&#x27;s hands that suffer from over washing. Really helps soften, soothe, and reduce the redness.</li>
    <li> I had eczema on my chest for several years. I decided to buy this after reading the reviews. I applied it on the area right after bath. Believe it or not: after two weeks, the eczema on that area was gone. Highly recommended. I wish Aveeno had a shampoo with the same ingredients for scalp eczema.</li>
    <li> The Aveeno make my skin feel so much better.  My eczema is a bit annoying and this product calms it down.  It is a little greasy, but my skin absorbs it within a few minutes.  I am so glad this is available.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is for other people but it heal eczema on my arm and feet overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this does wonders on me. The only problem is that it has no smell. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker though because it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Cortizone Eczema lotion personally. This helped at first but after a few days started to irritate my skin even more.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my bf who has suffered eczema.&lt;br /&gt;He likes the cream a lot since it&#x27;s not sticky and helps calmer his skin well.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used on daily basis because it doesn&#x27;t contain steroid.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the cream as a moisturizing cream. Not really as a eczema cream. I had a small rash in my hand and I tried many cream (even prescribed by dermatologist and allergists) over period of some years, but all in-vain. This one also failed to cure that. I end up turning to home remedies based on some friend recommendation and internet research and that really worked for me. I applied Honey + Cinnamon powder paste multiple times on my rash and that cured the rash in a week&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily on my face &amp; the redness has decreased as well as the itching....a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This lotion is light and calming. It leaves a bit of a waxy residue behind. My eczema is very inflamed, and while this cream isn&#x27;t making it go away, it does soothe my skin for a little while when I put it on. At night I usually put a thick layer of Eucerin Moisturizing Cream on, as I feel this lotion isn&#x27;t intense enough for really bad eczema. I would recommend it for quick bouts of moisture throughout the day since it&#x27;s not as greasy as Eucerin.</li>
    <li> I liked the cream - did the job but wasn&#x27;t as effective as Aquaphor, although it has a much better after-application feel than Aquaphor. I use the cream for myself and my 2-and-half month old. Good value, fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion.  It hydrates without feeling greasy.  If you have spots of eczema, try using this lotion regularly, but also, get on an over-the-counter non-drowsy antihistamine such as Claritin (or its cheaper generic drugstore equivalent, like Walgreen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Walatin&amp;#34;).  The daily antihistamine pill will calm the internal causes of many forms of Eczema, (which is now thought to be caused by allergy) while this lotion helps to heal the dry skin on the outside.  I did this for several weeks... and the small patches of Eczema on my hands... which I had for close to a year... disappeared completely, and have not returned in several months.</li>
    <li> works well. doesnt have any smell at all which is what i wanted. will buy again and again and again</li>
    <li> My little boy has eczema year round, and every time it re-surfaces he scratches himself like crazy. This cream really works in relieving his eczema each and every time. If it were cheaper I would have used it on him more, but alas you easily use up the 5 oz. in this tube quickly, so I end up always just treating him after eczema comes back. It&#x27;s a good thing, though, relief comes quickly after I apply the cream on him, and after two treatments all the visibile inflammation is gone. Despite the high price, I consider this worthy of 5 stars because it really works.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price point!</li>
    <li> Searched for years for a product like this.  Not greasy at all and controls whatever skin condition it is on my face that makes it look dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I have eczema on my right hand and one of the horrible things about it is how dry your skin gets ALL the time. This lotion really works in moisturizing my skin. It has a slight smell to it but it isn&#x27;t very strong and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much, the results are very worth the few seconds of smelling the lotion.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my face. My face has never felt so smooth and nice! I have dermatitis and this works perfectly and even better than what my dermatologist gave me.</li>
    <li> I do not have eczema, but I do have fairly dry, sensitive skin on my face. At worst, I have very dry patches that are painful and easily irritated, even by &#x27;sensitive/soothing/gentle&#x27; cleansers and moisturizers. Most moisturizers I have tried for dry or sensitive skin burn on application and cause irritation that can last for hours. I got to a point with my last moisturizer where I couldn&#x27;t stand the burning and irritation it was causing. I tossed it into the trash and went on the hunt for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try this because it is specifically marketed for eczema, afraid that it would only cause more problems for my skin. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this moisturizer did not burn my skin but soothed it! So far, this product has left a great impression on me. Again, I do not have eczema, but I am very glad I bought this product!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use this on areas that were dry and itchy. Really works and does a great job. Only problem is making sure that I have it and my wife does not use it all. Recommend a subscription - at least for the winter.  But we will be using this Cream year round.  Really the best of the Moisturizing Creams we have tried.</li>
    <li> When my daughter is 4 weeks old her perfect flawless skin starts to breakout, I called her pediatrician of what I can do to help it clear, they told me do nothing as it is normal because my baby still have all the hormones she got from me, they call it \\&quot;baby acne\\&quot;. So I did not do anything because they told me if I use cream it will clog my baby&#x27;s pores in her face. On her 2 months appointment the pediatrician finally notice how dry her face was and causing it to break out like a rashes. Finally she told me I could use aquapor or aveeno. I bought aveeno eczema therapy and use it that night,its Wednesday night by Friday her face is so soft and all the red spot rashes is gone completely. I&#x27;m so amazed, I wished my daughter&#x27;s peds let me use this the very first time I ask for help about her face and want something to help it clear, my husband has been asking me for long time when our baby&#x27;s face going to get better because he kinda felt bad to see her with those red rashes, I told him that the nurse at her peds office said it will go away eventually and do nothing. Lesson learned sometimes you need to follow your mother instinct, because sometimes you are right! I end up buying it in CVS coz i can&#x27;t wait to try it .  It really works.</li>
