      <li>After using this 3 days/week for a month, I bought three more</li>
      <li>To sum up my review I think this a too aggressive for facial skin (mine anyways) but perfect for the body.</li>
      <li>I have given many for gifts.  </li>
      <li>so I guess I am used to something more immediate.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just make sure to moisturize your face afterward.</li>

      <li>I really do love this item....</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I should use it maybe 3 times a week to keep ahead of the flaky skin vs more vigorous scrubbing to see if that</li>
      <li>and I hope that I will always be able to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:4/19/2012</li>
      <li>: ) I will def.</li>
      <li>Amazing how smooth it leaves your face.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still in tip top shape.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I should use it maybe 3 times a week to keep ahead of the flaky skin vs more vigorous scrubbing to see if that</li>
      <li>Lotion goes on noticeably easier and seems to soak in better.  </li>

      <li>and I hope that I will always be able to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:4/19/2012</li>
      <li>I use a light peel (also purchased on Amazon) and the cloth does a great job without much effort.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t get it, although I have read many good reviews.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I used this cloth - I wondered if it would be effective.  </li>
      <li>Super fabulous!</li>
      <li>Love these cloths so much!!</li>
      <li>These have made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
      <li>and they are inevitably huge.  </li>
      <li>It feels deceptively smooth and gritless.</li>
      <li>I decided to be safe and use as a washcloth for the body and to be honest, my skin doesnt feel any more smooth than it would using a regular sponge.</li>
      <li>It did not exfoliate or smooth the complexion.</li>
      <li>This thing is fabulous.</li>
      <li>cloth felt really smooth on my skin</li>
      <li>It literally made my skin baby smooth after one use.  </li>
      <li>Use a light touch with this towel.  </li>
      <li>Once dampened, the user applies cleanser and lightly moves the cloth about the face.  </li>
      <li>Took about a week for my skin texture and tone to even out, but now I&#x27;ve even felt comfortable going without makeup to run errands (which I would have never done before).  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin felt as I applied my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I would recommend using a light moisturizer after to protect your skin.</li>
      <li>The operative word is light.  </li>
      <li>I get compliments on my smooth skin all the time</li>
      <li>it actually is really working!!!</li>
      <li>This cloth will make your face feel smooth and clean like nothing else.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These would probably be good if you have super sensitive skin that cannot tolerate microderm or peels, etc.</li>
      <li>This is a super effective exfoliator, so give it a try, but use it gently and sparingly.</li>
      <li>This has helped fade my acne scars and eliminate breakouts significantly.</li>
      <li>Still totally worth the price tag though!</li>
      <li>I love trying these fun cosmetic products and was looking forward to a more environmentally friendly exfoliator, but I really could tell no difference.  </li>
      <li>I also switched spots on the cloth so that I used a clean section of the cloth on each section on my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have difficulty feeling like I can get my skin really clean.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the appearance of this cloth fool you, it is potent and powerful &amp;  so worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is also quick dry so great for storing and traveling with.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! I usually cut in into 4 pieces, which makes it work much longer. Just make sure to moisturize your face afterward.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second order of Exfolia and this is such a great beauty item if you want to keep your skin smooth and really clean. Takes care of the dead cells, helps with skin rejuvenation and can be used with any cleanser.I have really large pores on my nose and a really oily t-zone. Helps your skin soak up any other beauty product you apply. Any type of skin can handle this as it is gentle and really really gets down and cleans better then any other microdermabrasion product. Don&#x27;t let the appearance of this cloth fool you, it is potent and powerful &amp;  so worth the money. Give them as gifts to your girlfriends. I think this is just as powerful as a professional microdermabrasion and much cheaper. I bought a large cloth to scrub down the whole bod.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe this little cloth can do so much to assist in cell turnover.  Now that I&#x27;m in my 40s, I need a little more help with exfoliation to keep my skin looking new(ish!) and to keep my adult acne under control.  I have sensitive skin, so finding the right combination of products has always been difficult.  I use salicylic acid products twice a day in combination with this cloth and I get really good results.  Because I use the cloth twice a day, I&#x27;m very careful not to put much pressure at all behind the cloth--just gentle, circular strokes.  When I did use a little more force, I could feel my skin being irritated.  So, please heed the warnings of other reviewers regarding the frequent and/or overly vigorous use of this product! :)  After a few uses, I noticed the redness from past blemishes were disappearing MUCH faster than they would otherwise.  When I use this at night, I slather on an oil-free moisturizer afterward.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, exactly...but this product does what it says and I will definitely keep it in my skin-cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> The towel very, very small&lt;br /&gt;I expect not like it&lt;br /&gt;Damaged disappointing&lt;br /&gt;I will not repeat its request once again to their small size</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE! What a waste of money. Cloth felt like something I could buy at the dollar store for packaging... NOT for my face! Such a disappointment especially after reading all the good reviews. Not sure if the highly rated reviews are actually real!</li>
    <li> I gave this a 2 because I feel scammed.  The packaging reads that 20 clothes come in a box for $14 and are not to be sold separately!  I just purchased one for $14.  I thought the quality would be amazing for that price, but they are not because they are meant to be disposable, to be used 60 times and then tossed.</li>
    <li> I got one of these on a lark, to see what all the fuss was.  Wow! It looks like a flimsy little wash cloth!  BUT after using it once in the shower I could definitely feel the smoothness again on my face!  And this is from someone who has tried the little white scrubbies, cleansers with beads/shells/seeds/goodness-knows-what little abrasive things in it.  When I used those more abrasive cleansers or scrubbies, the warm water would hurt and I would look all pink.  Exfoliated, yes; felt good, no.  The Exfolia cloth is very gentle--no feeling scalded after using it--and my skin feels soft and smooth.  Lotion goes on noticeably easier and seems to soak in better.  I have no idea how it works, but it is nothing like using a regular terry washcloth!  I use it on face, arms, back, and legs.  Skin feels smoother and less pimpley or prone to breakouts.  I am a BIG fan.  I bought a second when the first one--after a few months (probably longer than I should have used it, but it still felt nice!)--wore down.  I will not go back to regular wash cloths now since this one has spoiled me!</li>
    <li> I love this cloth and keep coming back and buying it from amazon.com.I will keep using it as I like what it does.</li>
    <li> I received this wondercloth a few days ago, and it definitely works. Almost too well. Being a die hard beauty junkie with a degree in Cosmetology, I have a large assortment of gadgets that I use in my daily quest to kick Father Time square in the nuts. I have the Facemaster Platinum and the original Facemaster, the NuFace, the Softlaser, the DPL, the Facial Flex, the Neckline Slimmer, and many other products. I decided the Exfolia cloth would be a good addition to my anti aging arsenal. All I can say is BE CAREFUL. It feels deceptively smooth and gritless. I used it twice the first day because of that fact. The second time I had a go, I used it in the bathtub, lathering it up with Dove soap and scrubbing merrily away as one does when they polish tarnished silver. This was a mistake. The cloth feels like sueded chamois. But if you scrub too enthusiastically, the effects are akin to a body shop sandblasting. Once my face dried, it was as red as a boiled lobster. I managed to remove my entire stratum corneum, I think. I spent the rest of the day in not an insignificant amount of pain. It may be because I use retin-a. Not sure. But the next day, after applying lots of aloe and hyaluronic acid, the pain and most of the beetlike discoloration were gone. So I&#x27;m giving this five stars because it definitely works. But I will only use it once or twice a week, and next time, with far less vigor!</li>
    <li> This is just a soft cloth.  It did not exfoliate or smooth the complexion.</li>
    <li> This helps remove the dead skin cells from my face.  I use a light peel (also purchased on Amazon) and the cloth does a great job without much effort.</li>
    <li> I have had a few other exfoliating clothes, but this one is the gentlest as well as the most effective!  Took about a week for my skin texture and tone to even out, but now I&#x27;ve even felt comfortable going without makeup to run errands (which I would have never done before).  Will be purchasing again and again!</li>
    <li> This washcloth is perfect for my daughter with lamellar ichthyosis. We replace it about once a month because we use it so often on her rough/flakey skin and it eventually loses it&#x27;s exfoliating strength. Still totally worth the price tag though!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this cloth as some of the reviewers who had bad experiences-had really bad experiences, but now I am glad that I did.  I have used this cloth twice and I am now both hooked and amazed.  I don&#x27;t have issues with acne.  My skin tends to be dry and I have some hyperpigmentation issues along my chin. I also flake and peel a lot. I have difficulty feeling like I can get my skin really clean.  Many products I am allergic to and some mechanical cleansers are too harsh as my skin tends to be dry. I tried the Dove cleansing cloths prior to this and the cleanser they contained was to rich for my skin.  I didn&#x27;t break out, but my skin felt kind of oily and smoothered afterward. I also felt like the cloths weren&#x27;t removing enough dead skin- as I would still get flakey patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this cloth - I wondered if it would be effective.  I took it out of the package and it is a very smooth textured and supple cloth.  It doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive at all.  I followed the directions: wet the cloth, added my cleanser, and used the cloth all over my face moving in circular motions going over each section i.e. left cheek, right cheek, forehead, and chin.  I was careful to avoid the eye area and I counted to ten each time to make sure that each section received no more than 10 passes with the cloth.  I also switched spots on the cloth so that I used a clean section of the cloth on each section on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloth felt really smooth on my skin - like nothing was happening as I cleansed.  When I went to rinse the cloth there was nothing but gummy dead skin all over it. After cleansing I did have a raw feeling patch on my left cheek, but that went away.  After the first cleanse I noticed that a small patch of rash like bumps on one side of my chin had greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I used the cloth for the second time and again the cloth was covered in dead skin and dirt.  The bumps on my chin are now completely gone.  The hyperpigmentation looks like it is improving and my skin looks brighter all over my face.  I like this product a lot and I hope that I will always be able to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:4/19/2012&lt;br /&gt;You Must Be Careful With This Cloth!&lt;br /&gt;I mistakenly thought that since my skin flakes so much I could use more a intensive scrubbing time. I was wrong.  I am nursing a very raw, irritated, burning skin.  Perhaps I should use it maybe 3 times a week to keep ahead of the flaky skin vs more vigorous scrubbing to see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side - the hyperpigmentation on the sides of my face have faded nicely.  My skin is clearer and more even.entation looks like it is improving and my skin looks brighter all over my face.

    <li> About 4 years ago I was at a hair salon and one of the stylists had just come from some sort of beauty expo.  She had sample sizes of these cloths and gave me one.  I used that thing forever until it just didn&#x27;t work any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never thought I&#x27;d find them again because I didn&#x27;t know the name of the product but I figured how many bright green exfoliating face cloths can there be.  Did a search on Amazon and here they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mine every day with an extra gentle cleanser and my face is so soft and smooth.  No irritation experienced whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a super easy thing to put into your daily beauty regime.  Mine stays in the shower and I use it every morning.  Nothing could be simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> With so many different exfoliating and microdermabrasion cloths to choose from, I took a chance on ordering this cloth based on the positive reviews I&#x27;ve read on multiple sites, and I have to say that I&#x27;m extremely happy with my choice! This little cloth may not look like much, when you get it; it&#x27;s not much thicker than a paper towel, it&#x27;s a bit stiff and unlike a typical washcloth, nor does it feel like it would be effective at exfoliating. However, upon my dubious first use I was surprised to find that it was indeed a mighty exfoliator. You REALLY DO need to go easy with this cloth, as it&#x27;s incredibly easy to go overboard with it since it doesn&#x27;t FEEL like your typical exfoliant while washing your face. I ended up going a bit overboard with my first use because of how smooth it feels on the skin as you use it. After cleansing, rinsing and patting my face dry, my nose and chin felt a bit raw and was tender and a little red. I immediately applied my moisturizer which relieved this quickly. I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin felt as I applied my moisturizer. My skin immediately looked brighter, cleaner, and rejuvenated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cloth once every three days (every day use is not recommended and after using you&#x27;ll see why) and my pores are no longer clogged with blackheads, my skin is brighter, more radiant, less dry and flaky, and I can FEEL my moisturizer and skin care products actually absorbing and functioning as they should. My makeup is easier to apply, performs better and looks better in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cloth for about a month and it&#x27;s still in tip top shape. These cloths are supposed to last about 6 months, I believe. The fibers are extremely fine and tightly woven together in every possible direction in order to effectively scoop out and remove impurities and dead skin. As the cloth gets older, the fibers are supposed to loosen and expand, rendering the cloth less effective at exfoliation. When the fibers become misshapen and loose, that is when it&#x27;s time to toss it and replace it. I rather like the concept of a temporary reusable cloth, it seems more sanitary somehow. I change out my body poofs, toothbrush, and pumice stones, so why not a washcloth? Seems completely logical to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend giving this cloth a shot if your in the market for an effective exfoliator. I highly recommend reading the instructions and information included in the box with the cloth before your first use and using with a decent amount of cleanser to help protect from over exfoliation.ome misshapen and loose, that is when it&#x27;s time to toss it and replace it.

    <li> I was super excited about these. I got a few of these for me and my daughter. I used it for about a week and then lost interest. I didnt see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews that said that you have to be careful not to rub to much, or you will end up with a raw face, but honestly I never had that happen. I didnt feel that this did anything.&lt;br /&gt;Its possible that my face is tougher than other reviewers, lol. I do my own peels at home so I guess I am used to something more immediate.&lt;br /&gt;These would probably be good if you have super sensitive skin that cannot tolerate microderm or peels, etc.</li>
    <li> Wow everyone was not kidding - these are great - I am stocking up on several  more so I don&#x27;t run out!&lt;br /&gt;The first few times you use it use a lot of cleanser and don&#x27;t rub too much.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found an ingredient list before purchasing.  It contains toxic ingredients not the least of which is Propylene Glycol.  Anti-freeze.</li>
    <li> This buffs away makeup and eye makeup with water and gentle pressure.  Also leaves skin feeling smoother, and buffs away dead skin.  Use caution to not scrub too vigorously, or for too long.  This is a perfect convenient alternative to expensive creams, scrubs, or something to get you by in between professional facials.  Product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I stopped using an expensive 3 peice micro dermabraision kit in favor of this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I got the same results in a fraction of  the time without any clean up:) &amp; for considerably less $$$$.</li>
    <li> It is worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I really do love this item....when I first opened the package, I was skeptical because the cloth is very lightweight and not &#x27;rough&#x27; as you might expect an exfoliating cloth to be - it&#x27;s soft.  But boy does it work....the nice thing about this one is that you CAN use it with cleansers (just not the kind with man-made microbeads), where a lot of other exfoliating cloths have to be used with just water, making for an extra step in your routine...not good if you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would advise is that you not overdo it - because it doesn&#x27;t feel rough it&#x27;s tempting to wash aggressively, but you don&#x27;t need to....be gentle because it really does exfoliate well.  When I first started I used it 2 or 3 times a week, now I only use it once a week to keep my skin looking great. I just bought a second one and some of the disposable ones (same brand) to throw in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> As someone who constantly exfoliates their face, this cloth is a clear must have. This has helped fade my acne scars and eliminate breakouts significantly. It also makes your skin unbelievably soft and has replaced all my facial exfoliant products.</li>
    <li> This is just not for me. It did smooth my skin, however my skin is so sensitive that I think it caused my face to be irritated. It worked for my arms and thighs however quite nicely. I had a lot of little bumps that have gone away because I have used this. However, I just don&#x27;t think this is for me. It is a pain to have to rinse out and dry every day.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliating cloth/crystals I&#x27;ve used.  It feels soft and smooth when you&#x27;re using it but it&#x27;s really rubbing a layer off! It never tears my skin like the face washes do and never causes me to break out. I love it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this outstanding product that I discovered at a very fancy local salon.  It exfoliates extremely well with very little effort, and lasts for over 60 days with normal use.  It actually works so well that you have to be very careful not to rub your skin raw with it!  Seriously, ten buffs with light pressure is more than enough to do the job!  I use it once a day prior to makeup and my skin has never looked better!  I get compliments on my smooth skin all the time and I am 44 years old!  Do yourself a favor and pick one of these up...you won&#x27;t regret it.  And if you have mild acne as I do, you will see a marked reduction especially if you apply an anti-acne cleanser with the cloth, such as Murad&#x27;s line of anti-acne cleanser, or Proactiv.  Exfoliating reduces bacteria and dead cell buildup on the skin, both of which cause and worsen acne.</li>
    <li> I cut the cloth into four pieces to make it last longer. These have made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> When you get the package, you may be a little perturbed at the size of the cloth.  It is not big and does not appear to have any amazing qualities when just examined with the eye.  Once dampened, the user applies cleanser and lightly moves the cloth about the face.  The operative word is light.  Use a light touch with this towel.  The towel can really make your face raw if you spend any more than four or five seconds on one particular area.  I also suggest reapplying water in the middle of the cleaning process because the towel dries out quickly and you do not want to be running it across your face without it being damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face looked a touch brighter and felt smother after use.  I also developed some pimples immediately after use.  This has happened to me when I have utilized other processes that strip dead cells.  In response, I am reducing the number of times I use the towel each week from three to one.  While my skin has felt smoother, I have not noticed any minimization of facial lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my skin feels smoother, I am not crazy about the pimples because a pimple lasts at least three weeks when I get one and they are inevitably huge.  I&#x27;ll likely use the towel until it needs to be replaced (the box says this could be 60 to 80 uses) and then decide if another merits being purchased.  Someone suggested using a [[ASIN:B004USIW0I Shamwow Pack - 4 Large &amp; 4 Mini Shamwows]], so I may look into that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the United States from fabrics imported from France.</li>
    <li> I love this cloth! I read a review where the person cut it in squares to help get more use out of it and it&#x27;s more effective that way. I prefer to use this cloth without cleanser first to really get the dead skin off. The first time I used this, I was too rough on my skin but I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it now. Definetly worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything while you&#x27;re using it.  The rosy look of exfoliation on your face after use tells you otherwise.  Don&#x27;t linger too long in one spot.  You&#x27;ll take off more than you intend to!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was a skeptic, but now I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I am a cosmetics and beauty products junkie! I read about it on line, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This thing is fabulous. I can&#x27;t believe that anyone could have tried it and says it doesn&#x27;t work, because it does, and magnificently so! At first examination, you could imagine that it was just an ordinary, smooth microfiber cloth and could never effect the texture of your skin. You actually have to be careful while using it, because if you use it too enthusiastically, you can actually hurt the top layer of your skin. With care, you will look like you&#x27;ve been to a spa for a facial, and one use will prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. You can actually improve the texture and appearance of your skin, certainly worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliator I have ever had for my face.  It&#x27;s so gentle while you are using it that you don&#x27;t think it is doing anything.  But each day you feel your skin getting smoother and softer, and you can tell it&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin has never looked this good. I have tried many different ways to prevent blackheads from popping up on my chin and spent a fortune on products that worked somewhat; but this actually keeps my skin clear and fresh looking and removed existing blackheads. I WILL be reordering.</li>
    <li> Love this. Will order again. Amazing how smooth it leaves your face. Very noticeable difference on how it leaves the appearance of your skin!</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth reorder of this.  It arrived promptly.  This cloth will make your face feel smooth and clean like nothing else.  I do not have sensitive skin but some other products made my skin break out.  The thing is to not over do it - I only wipe one area no more than 6 times gently otherwise you can irritate your skin.  I am in my seventies.  This renews your skin.  I rinse it thoroughly and wet it with hydrogen peroxide between uses.  I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> I dont  see why I spent some much money on this product. I am not satisfied with it. Dont waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Read the reviews before I bought the cloth. Waste of money still waiting to see what it is really supposed to do. I would not recommend it at all</li>
    <li> Love these cloths so much!! I cut them in 4 squares. You only need a little one to do the trick! : ) I will def. buy these again!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it. It arrived in good condition, but I can&#x27;t say it made a huge impact on my skin.</li>
    <li> The cosmetic surgeon who did my reconstruction recommended this product.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost two years and WOW my 60+ skin feels fresh and so much younger.  I noticed after only a couple of uses that the tiny little wrinkles on my cheeks were definitely minimized.  I have, as suggested by one of the reviewers, given these as gifts to my girlfriends.  They love them too!  I especially like the fact that you can use them with any facial cleanser and don&#x27;t have to invest in any special products.  You&#x27;ve gotta try them for yourself!!</li>
    <li> It seems like a simple nylon cloth but it actually does a nice job of exfoliating dry skin on my face. It&#x27;s really gentle too, especially if you don&#x27;t press hard. More gentle than a regular wash cloth. I use it often, even on my acne.</li>
    <li> I simply can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this product, how simple it is, and how easily portable for travel it is. Wears like iron and leaves your skin feeling so smooth, looking so fresh, that you&#x27;ll never want to be without one again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never left a review on amazon before but after using this product for only 2 days I have seen dramatic results in the appearance of my acne scars.  I am an African American woman who suffered for years with dark spots left from acne.  I use this product in conjunction with Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle Anti Blemish cleanser. At first the product felt like a normal wash cloth and didn&#x27;t appear to be working, until i looked in the mirror the next day.  What a difference.  I hope the scars will be completely gone in a couple of weeks.  I will be buying these cloths as stocking stuffers this Christmas.  Like other reviewers have warned, be gentle as you could rub too hard without realizing it.</li>
    <li> I have always had very challenging skin, but have had good luck in the past using a combination of AHAs, retinols, lactic acids and other aggressive skin treatments. However, since you&#x27;re supposed to steer clear of most of these while pregnant, I assumed I was in for nine months of disgusting breakouts. But when I went off all the powerful topicals (except lactic gel, which is safe during pregnancy), I started using this cloth a few times a week to try and mimic some of the exfoliation power, and it has totally worked. My skin looks awesome, and now my only problem is that I want to use it every day but the directions say to use it only a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this does anything.  I love trying these fun cosmetic products and was looking forward to a more environmentally friendly exfoliator, but I really could tell no difference.  On the other hand, my husband tried it once and felt like it rubbed his face off.  He had to use deep moisturizers for days to heal the burn.  I don&#x27;t understand how I could use it multiple times and scrub so hard, and he could use it once and be in pain.  I switched to Earth Konjac Facial Sponges, and like these better.  They don&#x27;t exfoliate too roughly, but I can at least feel something.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for my daughter since whose first Exfolia had done its time. She loves the effectiveness, yet gentleness this exfoliating facial cloth offers!</li>
    <li> The cloth does a wonderful job of removing makeup, even when I do not put anything on it  but water. It is also quick dry so great for storing and traveling with. I am a fan</li>
    <li> I did as the reviews said the first time and used it very gently. The following night, I applied more pressure. Clearly a big mistake as I was left with pimple like bumps which are just subsiding about a week later. I decided to be safe and use as a washcloth for the body and to be honest, my skin doesnt feel any more smooth than it would using a regular sponge. Perhaps I am related to a rhinoceros, at least body skin wise.</li>
    <li> works great to smooth and clean skin</li>
    <li> These wash clothes are made of flexible rubber which I find uncomfortable washing with. The only positive is that they dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found they didn&#x27;t work well anyway. I bought both versions, the ultrafine and regular.</li>
    <li> Face is so soft and clean! Lasts a long time! Love this!</li>
    <li> After using this 3 days/week for a month, I bought three more so I won&#x27;t run out for a while. The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working because it felt so gentle but it made my skin so smooth! I get acne on my chin that I have prescription medication for but I&#x27;ve noticed it has gotten a lot better over the past month and I think it&#x27;s from using this. It definitely helps minimize blackheads/acne scars and my skin feels so fresh after using it. I would recommend using a light moisturizer after to protect your skin.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to operate a washcloth, but there are microfiber cloths that work so much better for me. I really don&#x27;t get it, although I have read many good reviews. I am disappointed in this product, and certainly wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I would love to know microscopically how this amazing cloth works. Wash half of your face with this cloth then pat dry and compare to the half you washed normally - you won&#x27;t believe how smooth it is!  Use on your neck and chest too!  You will only need to use this about twice a week. The results are remarkable. Have given this as a gift to delighted friends.</li>
    <li> This cloth works great, HOWEVER, be carefull!! It is deceptive in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at the time of use! I&#x27;ve purchased these twice, and recently I scrubbed my forehead between my eyebrows a bit too excessively. I had ingrown hairs (pimples between my brows!) for over a month. This is a super effective exfoliator, so give it a try, but use it gently and sparingly.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this, I came out of the bathroom and my 8 yo daughter said, &amp;#34;Wow! What did you just do to your face?  It looks amazing!&amp;#34;  And I&#x27;ve been using them for 5 yrs since.  I can tell on photos if I&#x27;ve been using one or if I&#x27;m between cloths.  I love this thing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Yes, you can scrub your face right off if you are not careful, but I use it with a little soap every day and it is wonderful.  I actually cut it into quarters and make a little slit in the corner so I can hang it on a little suction cup hook I have in my shower.  I just change the cloth every three months and get great use out of it instead of just using the middle of the larger one.  The more soap you use, the less it will take off.  Use it with water only and you are going to do some real deep exfoliation, so be careful.  I am on a strict budget and this item will be one of the last things I&#x27;d give up.</li>
    <li> A regular washcloth will suffice.  I think it is probably best with some moisturizers or putting those into the pores with this cloth.  I was looking for something to exfoliate...</li>
    <li> Really does exfoliate.  I take it traveling where I might have more time for treatment.  Watch out for rubbing too hard as it is effective.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that can scar easily from blemishes. I&#x27;ve had microdermabrasion and tried peels before with varying results and was searching for something to help with minimizing the appearance of both acne scars and those left from chickenpox as a child. I read about these cloths on a forum for people looking for solutions for scars and all the comments on them were very positive. I was skeptical since I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things that did nothing at all and know that frustration well, but I&#x27;ve already seen a difference after 10 uses with Exfolia. Discoloration was the first thing to improve for me. The overall appearance of my skin has improved noticeably after a few uses. Very shallow scars are no longer there and the deeper ones are less noticeable. I&#x27;ve bought some for my mother and recommended them to friends. My mom said she loves them! It&#x27;s worth trying if you have scars or discoloration. They are cheap and IMO work very well. I feel I&#x27;ve seen more results using Exfolia than I had from multiple microderm sessions, and they cost so much less.</li>
    <li> I bought the towel after reading reviews, so I was careful to not over scrub. I have always had pretty dry skin, which usually becomes pretty obvious once I&#x27;ve put my makeup on, but since I&#x27;ve started using the towel I don&#x27;t seem to have that problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using the waffle-textured SkinVac cloth for years and wanted to see what else was out there. I love this green \\&quot;shammy\\&quot; and although it really doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything (with my skinvac I could SEE the dead skin) it actually is really working!!! I like it, it&#x27;s quite gentle as long as I don&#x27;t over do it. Would definitely recommend, especially if you do peels as often as I do. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I received this cloth as a gift for Christmas and thought..ok..where did you get this?? However, I tried it 2 times so far. The first was at the sink with my cleanser..didn&#x27;t feel any different. However, while cleaning my face in the shower, using the circular motion like you&#x27;re supposed to, I could fee the cloth &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;. By this I mean it felt like it was taking the dead skin off. I made sure not to press hard or wash too long. My face feels really soft. Going to  use this more for sure.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use any soap with this in order to get any measurable exfoliation, but it does improve a little with time.  Not a complete waste of money, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the top three biggest waste of money there is. Do not buy this. Shame on whomever wrote a good review they must be family members of the people that made this product</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m being to cautious with my use since many of the reviews advised to only use 8-10 strokes in each area since it&#x27;s so powerful.. but so far I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s doing anything? Back to my loofah.</li>
    <li> This simply didn&#x27;t work for me.  I bought a couple.  One&#x27;s still in the package, which I&#x27;ll give away as a stocking stuffer or something.  Perhaps they work better on different skin types.</li>
    <li> I received the Exfolia Microexfoliation Beauty Cloth a few days ago and I am writing to highly recommend it. After the first use, I saw a difference. This is my third day using it and, so far, it has significantly improved my complexion.</li>
    <li> No noticeable results ... I don&#x27;t get the polished look and feel I was expecting. Surprised that it wears out after so few uses.</li>
    <li> Super fabulous! I use a prescription retinoid and this really helps with controlling the flaking skin associated with it. I have purchased for my daughters as well! Just use with common sense and don&#x27;t rub too hard until you know how your skin reacts. Another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to cut the cloth into quarters was a great tip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really surprising how well this little cloth works to clear dead skin, and help reopen clogged pores.</li>
    <li> Really great product, but BEWARE you can rub a hole in your face if you scrub too hard.  My husband loves his but uses a little too much pressure.  Washes clean and seems to last forever.  I have given many for gifts.  Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> It did not help with my ingrown scars on the bottom of my chin I wanted to shed&lt;br /&gt;it exfoliates but not extremely&lt;br /&gt;Ive scrubbed at area and there is little smooth difference&lt;br /&gt;Im a male so im not sure if my skin didnt become red and sore lik the other reviewers&lt;br /&gt;but i even lik rubbed my junk with it for awhile 2 see if I would feel the power of this lik everyones said&lt;br /&gt;in the most sensitive area&lt;br /&gt;AAAAaaaaand nothing...&lt;br /&gt;I am looking at bentonite clay now for a stronger solution, if that doesnt work I might try a chemical peel as a last solution&lt;br /&gt;but natural solutions are always be better</li>
    <li> This comes in only 1 tiny square, and it is basically a ShamWow towelette. Save yourself the money and buy a ShamWow, cut it into several pieces so you can have one for every day of the week. Don&#x27;t buy this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I realized that not everyone knows what a ShamWow is...perhaps because not everyone watches TV. It&#x27;s like cardboard when dry, but once you wet it, it becomes an amazing absorbent sponge/towel thing. The Exfolia Microexfoliation Beauty Cloth is VERY similar in texture, hence, I suggest anyone who is considering purchasing this cloth, to reconsider and purchase a ShamWow. ShamWow is cheaper, and larger, therefore you can cut them into more quantities of these cloths rather than purchasing just one of these cloths.</li>
    <li> I have used this cloth since I received it and I do not know what the hype is about. Did not feel much of anything on my face.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  It literally made my skin baby smooth after one use.  I don&#x27;t see it being too harsh as other reviews have mentioned.  You can feel your skin as you are using it so I can&#x27;t understand why someone would scrub their skin raw.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it works exactly as decribed but be careful. I read reviews all of the time so I was aware that you need to be careful with this and I still rubbed my nose raw. I had sores on both sides of my nose for over a week. I used very little pressure and very few rotations and it still over exfoliated. So what I use it for now is to exfoliate the rest of my body. I live in Utah so my skin gets very dry and flakey in the winter. It makes my legs and collar bone area feel very smooth and soft so at least I still have a use for it. To sum up my review I think this a too aggressive for facial skin (mine anyways) but perfect for the body.</li>
    <li> Good, reusable exfoliating cloth.&lt;br /&gt;This cloth is really great at smoothing and softening the skin with the very 1st use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to rinse out &amp; dries quickly to be used again &amp; again.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it were a tad more nubby to remove dry flakes &amp; black heads in one swoop, but if it were it might make the skin red. I&#x27;ve used micro dermabration like pads that were good but very expensive &amp; did not deliver so called &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; results. Plus those pads were very hard on my skin. Exfolia does as good a job as those pricy pads with no irritation. I recommend this product.</li>
</ol>
