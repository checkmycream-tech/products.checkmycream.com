### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Amazing for prevent the lice!!!!</li>
      <li>The best in Lice Prevention.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
      <li>Hold isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>Works great and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
      <li>It is great in summer to keep mosquitoes away as the gel keeps</li>
      <li>This product is excellent the best I can use for my child and it is natural.</li>
      <li>And it smells good too! :)</li>
      <li>Love it !</li>
      <li>The gel is just as effective as any store bought gel brands.  </li>
      <li>Nice scent to me and kids don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>Smells nice.</li>
      <li>But, adding the conditioner and then leave-in spray (or gel) brings it to about 100% by (admittedly) their own research.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Fairy Tales products (shampoo/conditioner) before on my 4 children, but the gel is the best - smells great (the rosemary isn&#x27;t too pungent), provides a light amount of hold, and washes well.  </li>
      <li>I love all products of this brand.</li>
      <li>We love all the Fairy Tales Products.  </li>
      <li>I mostly use this when there are lice outbreaks at school.  </li>
      <li>I cannot say if it for sure detracts the lice.</li>
      <li>so lice is much more ramped now.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;no nits&amp;#34; policy is no longer in effect in most states</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair always looks lovely.</li>
      <li>Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect.</li>
      <li>Love it, great product, great smell and texture besides de plus side of keeping those little things away from my kids!</li>
      <li>It works and it easy to use every morning.</li>
      <li>So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better!</li>
      <li>we use it for our daughter&#x27;s fly aways, especially when she has to perform during ballet performances.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The best thing is that it&#x27;s chemical free so your not exposing your child( ren) to harsh chemicals</li>
      <li>The scent is a bit strong at first, but we love the scempnts of rosemary and tea tree oils.  </li>
      <li>And all natural makes it even better!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have any on my daughter luckily, but wanted to use this as a preventative.</li>
      <li>This is a great product we use it everyday</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
      <li>For younger children, especially boys, it&#x27;s particularly great because they don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;coiffed.&amp;#34; God knows the nursery set loves to hug one another and knock on wood, we&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to avoid the lice thus far thanks to this great line.</li>
      <li>I received the item very fast.</li>
      <li>I use it just to add another layer on top of the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand.  </li>
      <li>I love their entire line of products!</li>
      <li>Our grandson has extremely fine hair, and his parents have chosen to leave it long for now - it gets in his eyes and is distracting to him.  </li>
      <li>have gave his thick wavy hair a nice hold.  </li>
      <li>My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too!</li>
      <li>Gel clear consistency.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.     </li>
      <li>Not so natural, it has fragrance.</li>
      <li>Leave the kids hair soft and clean not like other gels that leave you the hair white.</li>
      <li>I got this gel to keep his hair back, but it barely does anything at all.  </li>
      <li>The gel is nice because it not only helps repel with the scent, but gives just a little bit of hold to keep her little fly-away hairs down.  </li>

<li> It is not a strong hold gel or styling gel, really.  </li>
<li> I love that there are no harsh chemicals or bad ingredients.</li>
<li> I like using the Repel Leave in conditioning spray as a detangler in my daughters long curly hair, then use this gel.</li>
<li> As for a previous review, lice eggs can take two weeks to hatch, so it&#x27;s possible they were already in the child&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> While other kids in my daughter&#x27;s class have caught lice, my daughter never has.</li>
<li> The gel does not dry hard, btw.  </li>
<li> like I see other products that other parents use does to their kids!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, there is head lice going around our kids school, so I&#x27;ve gotten really paranoid.</li>
<li> Had leaked out and over half of it was gone.  </li>
<li> I was a little concerned about all the oil mentioned in the product, but I needn&#x27;t have.</li>
<li> And it does not leave my daughter&#x27;s hair greasy or stiff</li>
<li> We have ticks pretty bad here too and haven&#x27;t found one on her yet.</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s luck or the product</li>
<li> My daughter does tell me she hasn&#x27;t noticed the gnats flying around her face lately.</li>
<li> Not happy with it.</li>
<li> Not sure abt its repellent properties as I ended up returning</li>
<li> It will save you alot of grief.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed and won&#x27;t be ordering this from Amazon anymore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My son uses this in addition to the shampoo.  His hair has been lice-free for 2 years. I attribute it to his daily use of these Fairy Tale products.</li>
    <li> Not so natural, it has fragrance. Not sure abt its repellent properties as I ended up returning it.&lt;br /&gt;Light hold. Gel clear consistency.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Hold isn&#x27;t great. I like the conditioner spray a lot so tried this out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my kids for years. I like the texture and smell. I cannot say if it for sure detracts the lice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, conditioner and detangling spray on my daughter every day. (Well, we shampoo/condition about twice a week.) I use the shampoo and gel on my son&#x27;s hair in the same way. The gel does not dry hard, btw.  He has very short hair, so I just rub it in until it dries.  I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s styling ability.  We have not had issues with lice yet. I would give the products 5 stars, but until they are around children with lice (we fought it for 6 months in the classroom last year!) I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works. For me, I figure we&#x27;ve got to buy shampoo etc. anyway, might as well use a preventative one. My daughter does tell me she hasn&#x27;t noticed the gnats flying around her face lately. I was a little concerned about all the oil mentioned in the product, but I needn&#x27;t have. My daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair always looks lovely. So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better! Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.     As for a previous review, lice eggs can take two weeks to hatch, so it&#x27;s possible they were already in the child&#x27;s hair. Using the preventative products after the fact isn&#x27;t going to help. Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect. The shampoo alone only has about a 70% rate of working. But, adding the conditioner and then leave-in spray (or gel) brings it to about 100% by (admittedly) their own research.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son to prevent any lice - I am paranoid about him getting even though there has not been any reported outbreak at his school.  I used it on him this morning (he is 6) and it worked well have gave his thick wavy hair a nice hold.  The scent is pleasant and light.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter who is in kindergarten and has had 2 outbreaks in her classroom since the start of school.  The gel is nice because it not only helps repel with the scent, but gives just a little bit of hold to keep her little fly-away hairs down.  The scent is a bit strong at first, but we love the scempnts of rosemary and tea tree oils.  The best thing is that it&#x27;s chemical free so your not exposing your child( ren) to harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this brand for over 2 yrs now. While other kids in my daughter&#x27;s class have caught lice, my daughter never has. Not sure if it&#x27;s luck or the product but we&#x27;re not taking any chances! My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too! And it does not leave my daughter&#x27;s hair greasy or stiff like I see other products that other parents use does to their kids!</li>
    <li> Amazing for prevent the lice!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the item very fast. This product is excellent the best I can use for my child and it is natural.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! It works and it easy to use every morning. And all natural makes it even better! I love their entire line of products! And use them all!</li>
    <li> When I received it the cap was sealed so the gel was everywhere.  Had leaked out and over half of it was gone.  Very disappointed and won&#x27;t be ordering this from Amazon anymore.</li>
    <li> Love it, great product, great smell and texture besides de plus side of keeping those little things away from my kids!</li>
    <li> Our grandson has extremely fine hair, and his parents have chosen to leave it long for now - it gets in his eyes and is distracting to him.  I got this gel to keep his hair back, but it barely does anything at all.  Not happy with it.</li>
    <li> I mostly use this when there are lice outbreaks at school.  I apply the gel to my son and daughter&#x27;s hair after styling.  It is not a strong hold gel or styling gel, really.  I use it just to add another layer on top of the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand.  No lice here yet!!</li>
    <li> I like using the Repel Leave in conditioning spray as a detangler in my daughters long curly hair, then use this gel. It is great in summer to keep mosquitoes away as the gel keeps it&#x27;s scent longer. We have ticks pretty bad here too and haven&#x27;t found one on her yet. So may work in repelling them as well. I initially got these products after one of the kids in daycare had lice. Didn&#x27;t have any on my daughter luckily, but wanted to use this as a preventative. Nice scent to me and kids don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> The best in Lice Prevention. Love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic. We love all the Fairy Tales Products.  The gel is just as effective as any store bought gel brands.  It holds...we use it for our daughter&#x27;s fly aways, especially when she has to perform during ballet performances. Her up do&#x27;s do not move!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Unfortunately, there is head lice going around our kids school, so I&#x27;ve gotten really paranoid. We started using the fairytale products, and our kids have not gotten lice. I&#x27;d say it works!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product we use it everyday</li>
    <li> Love it ! Leave the kids hair soft and clean not like other gels that leave you the hair white. I love all products of this brand.</li>
    <li> Works great and isn&#x27;t sticky. I love that there are no harsh chemicals or bad ingredients. And it smells good too! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Fairy Tales products (shampoo/conditioner) before on my 4 children, but the gel is the best - smells great (the rosemary isn&#x27;t too pungent), provides a light amount of hold, and washes well.  For younger children, especially boys, it&#x27;s particularly great because they don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;coiffed.&amp;#34; God knows the nursery set loves to hug one another and knock on wood, we&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to avoid the lice thus far thanks to this great line.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I use it along with the hairspray shield every morning and my kids have never had lice again! The &amp;#34;no nits&amp;#34; policy is no longer in effect in most states so lice is much more ramped now.</li>
    <li> Works! Use this along with the shampoo before sending your kids off to school land.  It will save you alot of grief.  Used on the advice of a school nurse!</li>
    <li> I bought it because my daughter had lice. I combed out the lice and eggs, then began using this product. While using the product, my daughter was infested again. Didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
