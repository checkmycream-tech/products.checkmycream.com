      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bye Bye products before and loved it</li>
      <li>I love this concealer!</li>
      <li>kind of gave me a janduce sicky look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am not too thrilled with this as it seems to not cover as well as I had hoped plus it shows the lines if you have any.  </li>
      <li>I rarely use my Mac Prolong Wear concealer now because this works great on its own.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the consistency of the this jar style under eye cream.</li>
      <li>Sincerely, Norma Heagy</li>

      <li>I feel there are better ones out there.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t love this.......  </li>
      <li>so far, so good!  </li>
      <li>have very fair skin, with red undertones</li>
      <li>It under eye corrector corrector works well; hides circles, doesn&#x27;t cake under eye in fine lines</li>
      <li>so send me the original plss&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;</li>
      <li>so I was excited to hear about this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, stays put &amp; covers really well without looking like you&#x27;ve got on a ton of goo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the dark circles for most of my life and these are not the kind you get from lack of sleep</li>
      <li>At my age, I certainly want to look as good as I can, as I deal with the public as a volunteer at Los Robles Hospital.  </li>
      <li>Does a really good job of covering my really dark under eye circles.  </li>
      <li>It was soft and easy to apply with either your finger tip or a brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>any help I can get at this point is very appreciated.  </li>
      <li>I Iike that it is very moisturizing and goes on smoothly unlike many other correctors out there.</li>
      <li>At first I really did like this eye concealer.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, but this color just didn&#x27;t do me justice.</li>
      <li>like it in the tub and not the tube because I don&#x27;t seem to need much to cover the eye area.</li>
      <li>It covers the best and stays the longest and a little tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>The coverage isn&#x27;t as opaque as I&#x27;d hoped and it seems to settle into fine lines more than the Estee Lauder Double Wear Concealer I&#x27;d previously been using.</li>
      <li>I have always looked older than my age and the eye corrector</li>
      <li>I usually use it under a concealer and the combo seems to work well most days.</li>
      <li>It was very creamy and faded quickly didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
      <li>sun damage high on my cheeks, looks like a big spot near my under-eye - can&#x27;t see it anymore!  </li>
      <li>It covers dark circles while providing full coverage and does not dry out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a second round mom with a first time baby that doesn&#x27;t sleep ;)</li>
      <li>For convenience, I simply brush the corrector under my eyes and near my cheekbones.  </li>
      <li>A bit expensive but a nice splurge for myself when I care for others all day.</li>

    <li> Love, love, love it.  I&#x27;ve had the dark circles for most of my life and these are not the kind you get from lack of sleep but rather the hereditary ones.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products and this one works the best.  It covers the best and stays the longest and a little tiny bit goes a long way.  I expect this jar to last for a year.</li>
    <li> Best of the  best.  Once you try  IT. Thafz it</li>
    <li> I Iike that it is very moisturizing and goes on smoothly unlike many other correctors out there. I have bad under eye dark circles so this alone doesn&#x27;t do the trick. I usually use it under a concealer and the combo seems to work well most days. I am yet to find one product that provides total coverage for under eye bags, dark circles, redness and that is nourishing as well. I think this would work well for people who only have s little discoloration under their eyes but nothing severe or try mixing with other concealers for a amplified effect.</li>
    <li> Covers well. Lightened my undereye area. Did not settle in lines.</li>
    <li> Does a really good job of covering my really dark under eye circles.  Brightens the area without a &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; appearance.  Use it daily.  No irritation.  Works as advertised!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bye Bye products before and loved it but this one was not one of my favorites.  It was very creamy and faded quickly didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> I have really bad veins under my eyes so I was excited to hear about this product. Turns out its nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;It looks creamy from the photo but it was actually hard and slightly difficult to apply because it ended up caking a little under my eye. I tried applying with a sponge, brush &amp; fingertip but the end results were all the same.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love this.......  I feel there are better ones out there.  I do love love IT eyeliner though.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer! I put it on with a brush under foundation and it is great! I use it as concealer all over my face!</li>
    <li> This seller did a great job in that the Item was delivered on time and as described. I&#x27;m  a big fan of the It Cosmetics line. I love the consistency of the this jar style under eye cream. It covers dark circles while providing full coverage and does not dry out.</li>
    <li> i got not this item I got an small Tube black it cosmetic Bye Bye under eyes 0.28fl.oz&lt;br /&gt;So not the one what is on the picture so send me the original plss&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;E P de Vuijst</li>
    <li> Smooths out wrinkles. Covers well.  Only need a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes &amp; this stuff is a life saver. It&#x27;s easy to apply, stays put &amp; covers really well without looking like you&#x27;ve got on a ton of goo.</li>
    <li> At first I really did like this eye concealer. It stayed put for a long time (even in humidity, without powder) It was soft and easy to apply with either your finger tip or a brush.&lt;br /&gt; A few days later when I was outside in the sun I noticed that the tint was really yellow and kind of gave me a janduce sicky look.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin, with red undertones so finding a good under eye concealer has always been a struggle for me. I really wanted to like this product, but this color just didn&#x27;t do me justice.</li>
    <li> Made my concealer crease.</li>
    <li> The coverage isn&#x27;t as opaque as I&#x27;d hoped and it seems to settle into fine lines more than the Estee Lauder Double Wear Concealer I&#x27;d previously been using.</li>
    <li> It under eye corrector corrector works well; hides circles, doesn&#x27;t cake under eye in fine lines</li>
    <li> Thank you for a good product. I&#x27;m a second round mom with a first time baby that doesn&#x27;t sleep ;) This product helps me look like I&#x27;m not dying haha.&lt;br /&gt;I like it in the tub and not the tube because I don&#x27;t seem to need much to cover the eye area. A bit expensive but a nice splurge for myself when I care for others all day.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased a few It Cosmetics to try them out.  I have horrible dark circles and this product works well without creasing.</li>
    <li> It covers dark circles and brightens the under eye area! I rarely use my Mac Prolong Wear concealer now because this works great on its own.</li>
    <li> I like both the Under Eye corrector in the jar and the tube.  For convenience, I simply brush the corrector under my eyes and near my cheekbones.  At my age, I certainly want to look as good as I can, as I deal with the public as a volunteer at Los Robles Hospital.  I have always looked older than my age and the eye corrector is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used makeup (I wish I had learned how to), but at least this is an improvement.  I have just turned 80 so any help I can get at this point is very appreciated.  Sincerely, Norma Heagy</li>

    <li> I am not too thrilled with this as it seems to not cover as well as I had hoped plus it shows the lines if you have any.  Just a so-so product</li>
