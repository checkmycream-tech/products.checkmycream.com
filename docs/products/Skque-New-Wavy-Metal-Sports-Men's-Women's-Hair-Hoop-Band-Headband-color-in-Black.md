      <li>It came in the shape of a &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; instead of a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34;, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to be a perfect &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; again.</li>

      <li>Easy to use, for someone who has never used one before.  </li>
      <li>Strongly recommend</li>
      <li>The quality is good although the paint on the inside of the band seems to have gone pretty quick, not that anyone would see it.</li>
      <li>nothing a light bend won&#x27;t fix.</li>

      <li>They are metal so you can bend them to fit your head.</li>
      <li>this is very good price,and I use it everyday ,very useful !</li>
      <li>Love these I&#x27;m wearing one right now.</li>
      <li>Very useful thank you.</li>
      <li>it is good as i expected, perfectly fit my head and hair.</li>
      <li>It is large enough, looks good, really comfortable</li>
      <li>I have a very full head of hair and this band holds up very well.  </li>
      <li>It does hold my hair back and looks pretty good while it does so.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t even worth $1.</li>
      <li>I am thinking the paint just isn&#x27;t the right one that should be used for this application</li>
      <li>I have to take it off right away.</li>
      <li>Great for anyone with short hair that cannot pull it back into a ponytail.</li>
      <li>, Is it to the very slow ,but it is very good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap, but I&#x27;ll have to try to find a new purpose for it, since I&#x27;m not putting it back on my head.</li>
      <li>I picked up this headband in the hopes that it would be more secure as I played sports, was active in the yard etc.</li>
      <li>Would buy more if necessary.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Paint is all gone within the first month.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back to order a couple more after leaving one on the bin at airport security.</li>
      <li>It is very convenient and practical hairpin , thank you !</li>
      <li>Very practical hairpin , every day practical it is convenient!</li>
      <li>They are more comfortable than the ones with little &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for what I paid, but it was definitely worth the buy if you want it.  </li>
      <li>The positive:</li>
      <li>I have always liked the headband hairstyle, but most headbands (if plastic or metal) put too much pressure behind my ears and eventually cause headaches, or (if fabric) don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this headband for almost a year and have pretty much abandoned (haha, see what I did there)</li>
      <li>Kind of dug into the scalp a little at the ends.  </li>
      <li>I really like these bands!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it till one day</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>This headband does not have either of those problems, even though my hair is much thinner than it used to be.</li>
      <li>It ships amazingly fast and holds hair in place well without snagging it.  </li>
      <li>And it has some shape edges at the end, that really hurts.</li>
      <li>Not what I expected, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
      <li>It is not too small and I have a large head compared to most people (I am 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>i couldnt find the first, however the coating does wear off rather quick and you cant wear this with wet hair</li>
      <li>You can see the \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; part in my hair right after I put it on, sort of a cool effect, but after an hour or so my hair pulls up a little and the headband sort of just disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of them was fine while the other had a problem with it.</li>
      <li>comfortable, doesn&#x27;t hurt and looks great with the little curves on top because it looks like you twisted your hair back in little ridges.</li>
      <li>A little tight on the edges but a good head band.</li>
      <li>These head bands are metal so at the very end of each side is where the metal had been cut and bent back.</li>
      <li>In fact the look with the headband on is so good I have been wearing it to work (business casual) and have gotten compliments.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m at that lovely not-quite-long-enough for a ponytail but too long for letting it hang down in my face stage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to adjust if it&#x27;s pressing too tightly on your head (or too loosely) --</li>
      <li>its pretty nice and not as bad as i thought</li>
      <li>I have had better luck with the BONO thin plastic drugstore  products</li>
      <li>this hair band is not really tight enough.</li>
      <li>Other than tyat, really liking the hairband, its cleari g up my face so well now that my hair isnt in the way.</li>

    <li> A little tight on the edges but a good head band.</li>
    <li> comfortable, doesn&#x27;t hurt and looks great with the little curves on top because it looks like you twisted your hair back in little ridges.</li>
    <li> it is good as i expected, perfectly fit my head and hair. and the price is also very cheap. Strongly recommend</li>
    <li> Average product. You can&#x27;t use it over 1 or 2 months. Built quality is poor. Color fades out sooner. And it has some shape edges at the end, that really hurts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool but can be a little bit uncomfortable at times.</li>
    <li> I really love this headband. I bought it quite a long time ago, and I still have it (: Personally I like wearing this when my hair is curly. It is metal, so it did put a little too much pressure on my head, but I could actually open it and force it to give a little.</li>
    <li> Love these I&#x27;m wearing one right now. I&#x27;m a dude as well so these aren&#x27;t just for chicks.</li>
    <li> Finally! I had been looking for a man band.  Easy to use, for someone who has never used one before.  It just goes on your head.  Metal is malleable and fits like a charm.  Get a few, just in case you lose them, because it ships from China and takes several weeks.</li>
    <li> It is very loose once you put it on.</li>
    <li> the same as the picture shows</li>
    <li> Tried numerous head bands.  This is the best one because it does not warp or expand.  Looks OK for man.</li>
    <li> Its painful to use on head.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot, i even got a 2nd one for times i couldnt find the first, however the coating does wear off rather quick and you cant wear this with wet hair otherwise it will get rusty.</li>
    <li> for casual local wear, nothing to heavy, doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very well</li>
    <li> Keeps hair out of my face while at the gym. Great for anyone with short hair that cannot pull it back into a ponytail.</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone with long hair.  Not easy to find something like this in stores.  I recommend this product.  Go for it!!!</li>
    <li> So I decided to grow my hair out and I&#x27;m at that lovely not-quite-long-enough for a ponytail but too long for letting it hang down in my face stage. I picked up this headband in the hopes that it would be more secure as I played sports, was active in the yard etc. It does hold my hair back and looks pretty good while it does so. I have moderately curly hair (big loose curls) and this pulls the front back securely enough that it goes straight without being so tight that it rips hairs out of my scalp or anything. You can bend the hairband out so that it doesn&#x27;t grip the sides of your head so tightly - I had to do this, and I usually wear a large size hat. In fact the look with the headband on is so good I have been wearing it to work (business casual) and have gotten compliments. You can see the \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; part in my hair right after I put it on, sort of a cool effect, but after an hour or so my hair pulls up a little and the headband sort of just disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jan, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back to order a couple more after leaving one on the bin at airport security. I really like these bands!&lt;br /&gt;- Yes the black paint eventually wears thin/off where the band sits on your head. It does not flake, does not catch hair, just wears off. No one sees this but me so, I don&#x27;t care really.&lt;br /&gt;- If you buy this band, don&#x27;t forget to bend it to shape to your head. I am amazed to read that people never realize that since it is metal you can reshape it. This point alone makes me prefer metal to plastic or wood.&lt;br /&gt;- If you travel, take one in your luggage so you have a backup.&lt;br /&gt;- I can see where people with really thin hair would not enjoy this band. I have a lot of very thick hair and the waves of the band are awesome at dealing with the bulk without putting extra pressure on my skull.</li>
    <li> Metal (never breaks or looses shape) does not dig into head causing pain.  I bought two.  Would buy more if necessary.  Best hair band I own.  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> good i like it,  just, Is it to the very slow ,but it is very good. i use it now</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t even worth $1. It came in the shape of a &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; instead of a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34;, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to be a perfect &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; again. The ends hurt your head, and it doesn&#x27;t conform to your head correctly.</li>
    <li> Poor product that forever to arrive.</li>
    <li> It was okay.  Kind of dug into the scalp a little at the ends.  I have had better luck with the BONO thin plastic drugstore  products</li>
    <li> Very useful thank you. Although its a little bit tight and press your head, it fix the front hair well</li>
    <li> I would say my head is average size and my hair is rather thick.&lt;br /&gt;Yet this headband still pinched ever so slightly on my head.&lt;br /&gt;BUT that isn&#x27;t even the biggest problem... the biggest problem is the black coating.&lt;br /&gt;The coating wears away very very easily, only to reveal the silver metal underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> It is large enough, looks good, really comfortable</li>
    <li> for casual local wear, it works ok.</li>
    <li> I do not like it. I have to be very careful to prevent my hair caught by the metal curl. After using it for a couple of times, it left some mark in the area behind my ears.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  I bought one for me and now I keep buying more for friends.  They are more comfortable than the ones with little &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i wear this thing like everyday, it goes qith everything and it makes my hair look like awesome waves .</li>
    <li> Metal is heavy and it does put pressure on scalp, but it does the work.  It is hurt on the hand if I brush my hand against it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. When you use it, it is so hard and so you have pain in your head.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Adjustable and works efficiently. Phenomenal price.</li>
    <li> This headband fits well and is cute. It is not too small and I have a large head compared to most people (I am 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;). I love the design and is great to wear casually or more dressy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good.... But be careful. I ordered two of these just in case I lost or misplaced one. One of them was fine while the other had a problem with it. These head bands are metal so at the very end of each side is where the metal had been cut and bent back. Unfortunaly one of my headbands had a piece sticking out and it hadn&#x27;t been bent back. I didn&#x27;t think much of it till one day I went to scratch my head and yup blood came gushing out everywhere. That one bit of metal sticking out sliced my knuckle pretty bad. Took about a week and a half to heal.&lt;br /&gt;So, just to let you buyers know. Be careful and if you recieve a head band with a piece of metal sticking out just use some pliers and bend it in. That metal is sharp! I attached a photo of the metal that stuck me for those of you that are curious what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A review about the headband itself. I like them ( other than the fact stated above ). The positive: They are metal so you can bend them to fit your head. They don&#x27;t break. If it falls out of your hair they make a ting noise when they hit the ground and you&#x27;ll know you dropped it.&lt;br /&gt;The negative: after awhile they began to rust. The paint on them does began to chip off. So you&#x27;ll notice little pieces of black flakes on your hands or bed or whatever they come in contact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for 3 days, I&#x27;m a little disappointed the black paint had already started to chip off.</li>
    <li> Really awesome hair band, however someone in my home took.. so I&#x27;m without one at the moment.</li>
    <li> A great hair product. I love this hair band. It works perfectly. I will buy another to back up. Is it the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> its pretty nice and not as bad as i thought</li>
    <li> It took a while for it to get here. Sure it came way faster than the delivery expectancy but for just 1 hairband to take a week is weird. Other than tyat, really liking the hairband, its cleari g up my face so well now that my hair isnt in the way. There are parts of the hairband whose metallic coatting got rubbed off and sure I had to bend the band to my comfort level but overall great buy</li>
    <li> this hair band is not really tight enough. did not meet the expectations.</li>
    <li> Works well to keep hair out of face; good hold.</li>
    <li> Love it. Quality is extremely nice. Paint does chip but it doesn&#x27;t rub off and not very much comes off. But still paint seems of good quality but doesn&#x27;t seem to stick well to metal. I am thinking the paint just isn&#x27;t the right one that should be used for this application but the material seems like something I would pay $15-20 bucks. Everyone says its very very nice.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
    <li> Works great, easily bendable to fit the shape of your head, much more durable than the plastic type.</li>
    <li> This is the more uncomfortable band. The metal bites into your head when you try to put it on. I have to take it off right away. I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap, but I&#x27;ll have to try to find a new purpose for it, since I&#x27;m not putting it back on my head.</li>
    <li> It is very convenient and practical hairpin , thank you !</li>
    <li> This product is junk. Very disappointed with Amazon</li>
    <li> I grew my hair long and needed something like this. It&#x27;s perfect. It sometimes is a bit difficult to get off your head as the hair gets tangled, but it&#x27;s no biggy. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this headband for almost a year and have pretty much abandoned (haha, see what I did there) all my others. I have a very full head of hair and this band holds up very well.  It is very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t get caught or pull my hair.  Even though it holds firm to my head, it usually doesn&#x27;t pinch or feel too tight.  I&#x27;m tempted to order a couple more in case I lose this one because I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I want to save my hair for longer. I don&#x27;t want my hair to block my eyes when I&#x27;m using the computer at home. A headband is a good aid for that purpose. This does the job but is a bit too tight. It hurts after wearing it for a few hours.</li>
    <li> Best. Amazon. Purchase. Ever.</li>
    <li> Works well but too expensive.</li>
    <li> Fits small,but stays firm.&lt;br /&gt;Serves the purpose for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line is irrelevant to the review and is written to fill in required number of words to submit the review.</li>
    <li> They are well constructed and comfortable.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for what I paid, but it was definitely worth the buy if you want it.  It did take more than two weeks for delivery though, so just keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice metal construction and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Holds hair in place firmly.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Paint is all gone within the first month.</li>
    <li> This hair band works well for what it is, but it does get painful pressing against the head behind the ears.  The metal ends press a little too much.</li>
    <li> While this headband is not necessarily attractive, it is comfortable and keeps the hair in place well.  I have always liked the headband hairstyle, but most headbands (if plastic or metal) put too much pressure behind my ears and eventually cause headaches, or (if fabric) don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  This headband does not have either of those problems, even though my hair is much thinner than it used to be.</li>
    <li> Great for guys with longer hair without being to feminine. If you have a bigger head you may need to stretch the ends a little bit apart so it doesn&#x27;t start to irritate after a while.</li>
    <li> It ships amazingly fast and holds hair in place well without snagging it.  It&#x27;s also easy to adjust if it&#x27;s pressing too tightly on your head (or too loosely) -- nothing a light bend won&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> i have a larger-size head (i can only wear sunglasses that are 6&amp;#34; wide, for example) and this did not work for me. It didn&#x27;t reach down quite far enough. gonna give it to my daughter i guess.</li>
    <li> okay. it does its job.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that it would hold my hair back stronger, i guess this wasn&#x27;t made for my style of hair.</li>
    <li> It works, but I wish it were more comfortable.</li>
    <li> it hurts to have this on for too long. The wavy metal presses against your scalp. Difficult to have it on for too long.</li>
    <li> I am an Asian with thick long straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It holds my hair well, and doesn&#x27;t slide like many others.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The ends of the wire are cut sharply and bent inward, so they don&#x27;t touch to skin. However, they catch my hair, and that is really annoying and hurts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I think it was a good try for that price. But I won&#x27;t re-purchase it again. I think it may work for short hair.</li>
    <li> This hairband is sturdy and stylish. The quality is good although the paint on the inside of the band seems to have gone pretty quick, not that anyone would see it. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.and this is very good price,and I use it everyday ,very useful !Love it so much!!!</li>
    <li> Very practical hairpin , every day practical it is convenient!</li>
    <li> Sharp ends, didt hold hair at all , put straigt away in place where belongs too- garbage bin !</li>
    <li> Great value for your money. Despite It took around 2 weeks to deliver I would buy this product again.</li>
