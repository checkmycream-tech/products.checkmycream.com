<li> I&#x27;ve used California Baby with Tea Tree and Lavender and Calendula for the past four years.  </li>
<li> - maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (thin).</li>
<li> Balancing the oil removes the excess sebum and annoying dandruff from my head, and this also causes follicles not to be clogged and my roots not to die.  </li>

    <li> I love this conditioner!! It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to go through my thick, long hair! It does a great job of conditioning and detangling. My hair has NEVER been in this good of health before with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 oz / Liquid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp Therap&amp;eacute; Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;For All Hair Types &amp; Sensitive Scalps&lt;br /&gt;Paraben Free • Sulfate Free • Gluten Free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp Therap&amp;eacute;&lt;br /&gt;Neem, Lemon &amp; Peppermint&lt;br /&gt;Neem is respected by Ayurvedic practitioners for its ability to support healthy skin and scalps.

    <li> have not seen any results</li>
    <li> Boy this stuff works good....I have menopause hair and that isn&#x27;t pretty but thanks to this my hair is starting to look alive again instead of &amp;#34;dead on my head&amp;#34; hair...I was going to have to cut it real short but instead I can keep it at shoulder length...it looks better there. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Conditions: Sebhorreic dermatitis (excess sebum and dandruff), oily scalp, dry hair, hair loss, hair breakage, tangly hair...so of course, thinner hair.  I&#x27;ve used California Baby with Tea Tree and Lavender and Calendula for the past four years.  And it did AMAZING things for my scalp.  Removed the itch and took care of about 80% of my dandruff. However, the excess sebum and 20% of the dandruff, the oily scalp (causing areas of my hair to look greasy and unwashed...when I wash my hair and scalp EVERY DAY), and tangly hair remained as well as continual hair loss.  I had good results from adding John Master&#x27;s Organics Detangler (See other review) to my regimen, but it didn&#x27;t help during washing hair (horrible tangles).  I discovered this product (TheraNeem) six days ago.  And I bought it four days ago.  It balanced my pH (as advertised) that causes my oily scalp to not be so oily.  It also causes my hair shaft to not be so dry.  Balancing the oil removes the excess sebum and annoying dandruff from my head, and this also causes follicles not to be clogged and my roots not to die.  This reduces hair loss back to a more normal daily amount.  (It went from large clumps daily to the more usual little clump.)  The hair shaft not being dry causes less breakage and far less tangles.  And I&#x27;ve only used this product THREE TIMES thus far.  My optimism in this product remains reserved as I&#x27;ve been disappointed in the past, but the results thus far are amazing and very promising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this great hair product for several years now and I love the fact that it completely solved my dry scalp problem.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to using this with the shampoo when it arrives.</li>
    <li> This is a concentrated,superior product that does what it says it does.  I have discoid lupus, so i get intensely itchy, irritated patches.  My scalp in general is sensitive to just about anything, but this stuff...it&#x27;s like medicine for my scalp.  I apply this after shampooing and massage a generous amount into my scalp for a minute and then let it sit for 5-10 minutes, and AAAAHHHHHH!  It is so soothing and tingly.  It has antiinflammatory properties too.  The effect lasts until the next shampoo.  I will always have a bottle of this stuff in my shower.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This has worked wonders.for.my hair !</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels and smell. My hair is soft to the touch and the conditioner give a tingling feeling to the scrap. What I did was.... I wash my hair with the TheraNeem Gentle Thera Shampoo by Organix and then conditioned my hair.  I placed the conditioner in my hair and let it stayed in my hair about 5 minutes or if you want to longer the wait or when the tingling feeling comes, then wash out. Donot forget to massage your scalp while the conditioner is in hair. After that, Wash it out and dry your hair then style it.  I am using color and perm in my hair so if you wondering if you could use this conditioner. Check for your information and then go from there.  I loved  the way the conditioner feels on my head!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat buyer.  Worked better than anything I&#x27;ve bought in stores.  Price is reasonable, as it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Cannot stand the smell</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product - I mix about 3 parts conditioner with 1 part baking soda water and a slew of essential oils and use it to cleanse my hair twice a week.  This conditioner is the best one I have found to have the largest quantity for the best price and the ingredients are awesome.  There are no silicone ingredients to coat your hair shafts with plastic and it leaves my hair feeling soft and managable.  It has a lot of essential oils in it also that your hair just loves and is the perfect smell and consistency.  I reccomend all theraneem conditioners - especially for those who have gone poo free and love essential oils and natural healthy ingredients.  I will be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  I have enjoyed this tremendously.  I was completely impressed with the timing of getting my item.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Vero good Conditioner, I use it with THE same brand of shampoo...</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me, I was bombed out I really thought it would be the best since is organic and free of some of the bad stuff for your hair and scalp. I don&#x27;t know maybe I need to keep using it and see if it works later on? I wonder if it takes a couple of months of using it before you can tell is working or not.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, it took a couple days for my hair to adjust to the new product. My hair is normally very dry, I dont have dandruff, but I do tend to have a VERY itchy scalp especially if I dont wash daily, but because I dont want to use sulfates I dont wash my hair often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this for the first time I clarified my hair using a strong clarifying shampoo to remove the build up of the coconut oil etc. and followed it with the TheraNeem conditioner for scalp therapy. My hair felt so dry that first day even doing that. So next day i washed and conditioned again, etc by the third day my hair had adjusted its not super soft and I found i didnt need to use any oil in my hair. My scalp feels great too, still a little itchy, but not anything like it was!</li>
    <li> feels great on my scalp and it made my hair very soft and this was only after one use</li>
    <li> I would like to have my hair smell like that the whole day!!! Fresh. Ist a natural product where you don&#x27;t have to suspect some damaging properties. Will last long because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It was okay, I did not notice anything different. Can&#x27;t say I would or would not recommend this product - maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (thin).</li>
    <li> This conditioner and shampoo by the same company are the best I&#x27;ve used. No junk or chemicals and my head isn&#x27;t dry or itchy anymore. There&#x27;s no buildup or residue left either. Conditioner is a nice, thick consistency....shampoo is a bit runny, but works great.</li>
    <li> Not sure whether it really works for me because extreme itching and &#x27;bumps&#x27; persist.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and all conditioners I&#x27;ve tried have given me eczema on my scalp except this one! And it conditions as well and sometimes better than all the salon quality products I have used before. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!! After 26 years of trying salon, medicated, hypoallergenic, etc..... products I have finally found something that works.</li>
    <li> I have been using these Theraneem products for a while to keep my dandruff at bay.  I use the shampoo also, but the conditioner is the most helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great natural product.</li>
    <li> A very good buy  i love it..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this myself but my husband has been using it for a couple of years now. He has had a problem with dandruff and uses both the Scalp Therape shampoo and conditioner and his dandruff is gone. He loves the stuff.</li>
