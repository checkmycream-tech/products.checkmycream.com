      <li>Otherwise, love this kit!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to use &amp; there are some good designs to choose from.</li>
      <li>and they turned out cute.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>This stamping kit is so cute.</li>
      <li>If u love to do your nails</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more nail stamps for things like pro sports, movies, etc.  </li>
      <li>So when I saw this kit I was excited because I love the movie Coraline and it included everything I needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>Overall I was pleased with this product and now want to buy many more plates!</li>
      <li>My daughter is a huge \\&quot;Coraline\\&quot; fan, and this set was a huge hit at Christmas.</li>
      <li>If you liked the movie you will most likely like these plates.</li>
      <li>This stamp has a nice, soft surface that molds to the nail and picks up polish well.  </li>
      <li>designs are cute, and if you are a fan of the movie, you will really like them.</li>
      <li>This is a good set overall, and worth the money.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping and just what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Love the stamp that came with this kit, and wish I&#x27;d gone for the 4 plate bundle, and I wish there were more designs in this one that were more Coraline &amp;#34;themed&amp;#34; and less Coraline&#x27;s face.  </li>
      <li>The blue in this set is really nice and stamps well.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used the Konad knock-offs with varying degrees of success, but this was much easier to get a clean design transfer.</li>
      <li>The yellow and blue polish show up great</li>
      <li>The scraper is not as good as using a gift card, so that piece is kind of useless.  </li>
      <li>Because it was my first time using a stamping kit</li>
      <li>My daughter thinks it&#x27;s amazing that she can have all these little designs on her nails.</li>
      <li>the colors it came with dont show up very well.</li>
      <li>but it was fun and tried out several of the images.</li>
      <li>I had to use regular nail polish to get it to work right.</li>
      <li>other than that the kit is pretty decent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see me using the yellow and pink special nail polish though, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt having them around.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I had a hard time getting it to stamp properly with the polish provided.</li>
      <li>It only took a few tries and my daughter (12yrs) was able to master using the designs.  </li>
      <li>The plates are thick, smooth, and take on the polish well.  </li>
      <li>are not as vibrant as expected.  </li>
      <li>The yellow is not very dark</li>
      <li>This was the first time I tried stamping polish that was neither black nor white.</li>
      <li>Pressing the stamp down straight onto the nail is the key.</li>

<li> I like this set a lot; it comes with a stamper, scraper, 3 small bottles of stamping polish, and two Coraline plates.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> so it is hard to see if you use this color.</li>
<li> All of the designs have something to do with Coraline &amp; have that dark yet whimsical charm to it.</li>

<li> it was not perfect on my nails</li>

    <li> This set is wonderful.  However, the pink polish is wayyyy lighter in person then it shows up in pictures.  I stamped onto a black background and you can barely see the design at all. The yellow and blue polish show up great, however the pink is pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> I was a little iffie on purchasing nail products for $20.00 but i can tell u i do my nails almost 3 times a week with konad, it beats the trip to the salon and best of all the desisgns actually look like airbrush designs. it takes a litle time getting use to but once u get the hang of it u r good to go. If u love to do your nails Konad products r a must i am a konad addict. I LOVE IT! and so do my girlz we have nail parties every sunday to switch up the designs for the school and work week.</li>
    <li> love this stuff seller was great</li>
    <li> Love the stamp that came with this kit, and wish I&#x27;d gone for the 4 plate bundle, and I wish there were more designs in this one that were more Coraline &amp;#34;themed&amp;#34; and less Coraline&#x27;s face.  Started with a Salon Express stamper and thought I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of stamping.  Turns out, it wasn&#x27;t me, it was the tools!  This stamp has a nice, soft surface that molds to the nail and picks up polish well.  The plates are thick, smooth, and take on the polish well.  I haven&#x27;t used all the polishes that came with the kit yet, but the blue works well enough.  The scraper is not as good as using a gift card, so that piece is kind of useless.  Otherwise, love this kit!</li>
    <li> This package some with everything a beginner needs!! And these are the cutest image plates in the world! I don&#x27;t see me using the yellow and pink special nail polish though, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt having them around.</li>
    <li> So I have wanted to try the nail stamping for some time but had none of the tools needed. So when I saw this kit I was excited because I love the movie Coraline and it included everything I needed. As soon as I received it in the mail I opened it and used it. Because it was my first time using a stamping kit it was not perfect on my nails but it was fun and tried out several of the images. I was unsure of the ordering at first because it is hard to see what the images on the plates are by the image. The two plates come with several images of Coraline, a cat, buttons, wispy design, Coraline&#x27;s mother after she is \\&quot;possessed\\&quot;, and a few other small little images. If you liked the movie you will most likely like these plates. The nail polish that came with this kit work very well but not really colors that I would want to use all the time with a base nail color. The yellow is not very dark so it is hard to see if you use this color. Overall I was pleased with this product and now want to buy many more plates!</li>
    <li> It worked alright. Most of the time I had a hard time getting it to stamp properly with the polish provided. I had to use regular nail polish to get it to work right.</li>
    <li> the pink nail polish was definitely lighter than shown on the web page. I primarily ordered the set for the pink polish to end up in utter disappointment. the stamper is only one sided and it showed to to 2. other than that the kit is pretty decent. I wish the pink polish was the color it \\&quot;showed\\&quot; to be.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my niece for her birthday. She was intrigued with the idea of the nail stamps/designs. To my knowledge she loved it. This is a great gift for a girl ages 9-12 if I had to guess.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and just what I was looking for.  I would recommend Konad products to everyone who loves nail art. This was a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> i cant get these nail stamper things to work so i dont like it. the colors it came with dont show up very well. they look dark but they are not</li>
    <li> these stamps are brilliant.  i don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more nail stamps for things like pro sports, movies, etc.  Awesome tie-in to the movie!</li>
    <li> My daughter is a huge \\&quot;Coraline\\&quot; fan, and this set was a huge hit at Christmas. We&#x27;ve used the Konad knock-offs with varying degrees of success, but this was much easier to get a clean design transfer. We love it and won&#x27;t hesitate to buy Konad products again!</li>

    <li> Great kit.  I love it.  Works really good.  I even did my niece&#x27;s nails for her and they turned out cute.  She loved it too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like this set a lot; it comes with a stamper, scraper, 3 small bottles of stamping polish, and two Coraline plates.&lt;br /&gt;The designs are cute, and if you are a fan of the movie, you will really like them. This was the first time I tried stamping polish that was neither black nor white. The blue in this set is really nice and stamps well. However, the yellow and pink do not show that well on dark or light base colors. This is a good set overall, and worth the money. You have to try the blue polish!</li>
    <li> It only took a few tries and my daughter (12yrs) was able to master using the designs.  She loves Coraline so it was a good match.</li>
