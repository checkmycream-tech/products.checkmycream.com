<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looooove this cream. Feels great on my sensitive skin and the redness and dry patches are completely gone now.</li>
    <li> Divine! The rose scent is so pure and the cream is very rich but not greasy at all. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel so soft. I thought it was a little thick at first, but after I put on it applied very well. Definitely buying again. Very hydrating!</li>
    <li> This works better than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried. It absorbs beautifully and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on the skin.  The scent is soft and natural, not that fake, chemical, perfume smell.  I saved about $10 at Amazon, compared to the price at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> So soothing &amp; calming to my sensitive, acne prone, broken capillaries, large pore, oily face!</li>
    <li> Was not a fan. did not go well with my skin type.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from Jennifer Lopez during an interview. It really has helped my skin. I went to visit my sister and she was amazed at my skin!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic face cream. Very smooth and creamy, puts a protective, moisturizing layer on my face. Smells wonderful too! The layer lasts and it feels substantive, unlike most face creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Superior product for moisturizingj and calming.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps my skin from getting irritated and dry, and it&#x27;s about the only thing that can nurse my skin back to health if I have rashes (due to dryness). It smells amazing, makes my skin feel moist and supple (velvety, really) ALL DAY LONG. I can barely afford it but I can&#x27;t live without it; it&#x27;s that good.  All natural from a company with a really great philosophy behind their skin care.  AMAZING.  Been using it for years, and won&#x27;t put anything else on my face!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. Makes my skin feel silky soft. My only regret is that when it&#x27;s hot and humid in the summer, it&#x27;s a bit too heavy (though I used it year round when living out west in a desert climate). It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this long lasting nourishing cream, I used the subscribe and save option and look forward to getting more of it when I run out. I use it at night, as well as the daytime. It&#x27;s not too greasy and can use it under my makeup.</li>
    <li> This is my third tube and I can&#x27;t stop using it. Perfect to my dry skin in cold weather. Might be a little heavier during the summer but then I use it as a night cream.</li>
    <li> This was nearly frozen when it arrived at my door. It still smelled like roses at the moment that I opened it. When it became room temperature again, all the smell was gone. Now it&#x27;s just unscented cream that defeats the point why I got it. Hope it still works cause it smell like nothing :(</li>
    <li> I discovered this a couple of months ago and decided to give it a try, though I was pretty happy with the [[ASIN:B002JDUMFO L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Day/Night Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]] I&#x27;d been using (and note that it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the Dr. Hauschka cream is richer and lasts slightly better, though both products are pretty good.  Maybe if my skin were younger, the difference wouldn&#x27;t matter, but at 69, this is definitely the better choice for me.  My skin has never looked or felt so good.  After a few months of use, the fine lines I was starting to see at the corners of my eyes and down my cheeks have disappeared.  What I really need is a product that would make me 30 years younger, but lacking that, this cream does a pretty good job of making me look a lot less than my age, and I love the scent of old roses - faint but very pleasant in the tubes I&#x27;ve used, so I&#x27;m not sure where the complaints come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I do hate to wear make-up, and have discovered a way to add the bit of color my face needs to keep from looking a bit sallow (since this day cream is a thick white cream that adds no color at all).  A small dab of [[ASIN:B003OD0LAO Logona Naturkosmetik Tinted Day Cream - Golden Bronze]] applied over my Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s rose cream gives me a healthy, natural-looking glow - a perfect combination!</li>
    <li> I probably shouldn&#x27;t buy things because Jen Anistin does but I fell for it.  This cream smells great and is very moisturizing.  It&#x27;s just a little to heavy for my skin type/age (late 20s) and it doesn&#x27;t glide on smoothly.  I feel as though I&#x27;m pulling at my face too much when applying it.  I will def keep it around for the beginning of winter time or after a rough day on the ski slopes</li>
    <li> This cream is great for dry skin. I learned about this Product when watching watch happens live and Jennifer Lopez was the guest . She claimed this is the secret to her glowing skin, so I of course needed to try this! I must say I use this differently then most and only at night. It is very rich and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly that is why I use it as a night cream, the next day I wake up with very smoothe skin and fine lines are non existent. People say to use only a dime size, and it goes a long way, I use much more the directed. My reason I use much more is the patt and roll method doesn&#x27;t work well and for the best distribution you need more so it can smear and distribute better over the face. A little dose not go a long way, be generous with how much you use on your face or little results will be achieved.</li>
    <li> I used to have to stay inside for days at a time my face was so bad. I was a skeptic, but this product fixed it. Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long version: I have combination/ dry skin that is really sensitive with Rosacea and Eczema. Every face cream I tried burned, gave me a rash, etc. Nothing moisturized enough, especially in winter when I would get red scaley patches all over my face. My skin was red and splotchy year round. I tried so many face creams - from the drugstore, beauty stores, spas, dermatologists, and all natural 3 ingredient oil hippie concoctions. I tried 5 prescription lotions and 3 prescription pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I went to the health food store and saw Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Rose Day Cream. Thought: expensive. I loved the true smell of rose petals. But it contains lanolin to which I am allergic so I initially dismissed it. The girl working there gave me a little sample, and I put some on my hand (which is drier than my face), and I drove home. 4 hours later my hand was so soft and smelled nice. I had never experienced moisturizing retention like that in any lotion, and it didn&#x27;t itch- a miracle in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later I use it almost every day and night on my face. I don&#x27;t react to the lanolin in this product. This and Dermalogica Barrier Repair are the only two products that do not irritate my face. The Rose Day Cream never stings when I put it on and I don&#x27;t get rashes or dry patches anymore. I still have red cheeks, but my skin is so much better than I ever thought possible. This cream is a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it&#x27;s not for everyone. It&#x27;s a little greasy when you apply it (I need that, it protects your skin). Some may call it a night cream because it&#x27;s thick or heavy. The tube is like a small toothpaste tube, I never have a problem with it. It&#x27;s easy to control how much comes out and you really only need a little. It says day cream, but it has no sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could use it as a hand cream too, but it is cost prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased 3 times from this seller and it always arrives early and in good condition, and at a lower price than Whole Foods, which is the only place to buy locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Amazon has taken over management and increased the price. It&#x27;s not a $ deal anymore.bitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased 3 times from this seller and it always arrives early and in good condition, and at a lower price than Whole Foods, which is the only place to buy locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Amazon has taken over management and increased the price. It&#x27;s not a $ deal anymore.</li>
    <li> Cream has very unpleasant smell, worse than a dead/faded/ rose. It&#x27;s very greasy and gave my face bad red rush; even so I do not have any allergies. I had read about the cream in a Star magazine, I love roses and decided to try. Amazon&#x27;s policy states I cannot return the cream if had opened it, but how would I know if cream is good if never used it before?&lt;br /&gt;Amazon suggests selling it to other people......really?! The worst product I ever bought&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001V9LUZS Dr. Hauschka Day Cream, Rose, 1.0-Ounce Box]]</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and before buying this product I read the reviews. When I first tried the cream I was scared that it was too oily and it might clog my pores. This cream is light, the scent is a light rose scent, dehydrates my face and skin, and feels great. Sometimes I only wear the cream and skip on the make up. I love, love, love, Dr. Hauschka Day Rose Cream!</li>
    <li> Love it! Good for winter. Make your skin stay hydrated and smooth in harsh winter.</li>
    <li> This cream is like a &amp;#34;spa in a tube.&amp;#34; It is super rich, but does not clog pores, and smells AMAZING!!  I do sometimes add a little water to make it more spreadable, too. A little goes a LONG way. Super duper cream!!</li>
    <li> I like the cream. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many time purchased from whole foods.  The product I received was separated (oil dripping out first) leading me to believe it was out of date.  I looked for an expiration date but couldn&#x27;t find one.  I am not convinced it upholds the same quality standard and will not be purchasing this online again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Hauschka Rose Day Cream for a number of years and absolutely love it.  I am almost 58 years old but my skin is very smooth and soft.  I get compliments quite frequently.  It feels heavenly on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for my highly  sensitive skin. I have tried almost every brand and nothing helps keep my skin hydrated like Rose Day Cream.</li>
    <li> I love all Dr. H products but I especially like this gentle and soothing moisturizer. I have sensitive skin so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Hello, Dr. Hauschka and Weleda are the absolute best cosmetic brands world wide. They are made out of 100 percent plant based and natural mineral ingredients. The plant essences go through a very special rhythmic treatment developed by Dr. Rudolf Steiner and Dr. Ita Wegman in the early 1900s. The rhythmic treatment is a completely natural and holistic method which perpetuates the essences&#x27; freshness. Therefore no synthetic preservatives are used. Both brands, now owned by Weleda AG, started out with the production of pure plant medicines around 1900. They have many of the herbs growing in their own biodynamic gardens, some are wild harvested and some flowers come from fair trade, organic and biodynamic orchards in Turkey. Dr. Hauschka and Weleda have videos on YouTube in which they show how the products are made. All of their products are made with no animal ingredients, no use of test animals, and no subcontracting laboratories. The Rose Cream is my favorite of all. It is very rich, does not leave a greasy residue on the skin, is highly nourishing for the skin and smells better than any perfume I have ever smelled.</li>
    <li> This is my go to day cream in the winter. It is thick, and protects my skin from the harsh wind when I am outside. It leaves my skin feeling silky and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> My skin is dry, and nothing works as good as this!  Discovered this line 20yrs ago and although I venture out and try other lines ( Weleda, Devita, ect.) I always come back.  It&#x27;s heavy but just give it time to absorb and you&#x27;ll love the results.  You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose but those flakes and lines!! Enjoy</li>
    <li> This cream will do wonders for your tired skin. After a few days of using it people will ask &amp;#34; did you just get a facial?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will glow!</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this product . It has the right amount of moisture for me and the smell is glorious. My skin looks great with it on.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice on the skin. Keeps me hydrated all day. I love the rose scent and how it gets absorbed by my skin. Great facial cream! Will be definitely buying it again.</li>
    <li> I use this day and night. It is emollient enough to use at night, but it absorbs well if you use it in the morning as well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, substantial cream but it made my face break out and it&#x27;s too thick for a face cream In my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this day cream for years and never get tired of its soothing effects and wonderful rose smell</li>
    <li> This is a thick emollient creme , which I did like , having dry skin, and also living at high altitude. On the down side , the price point is high, there is no sun protection , and include St. John&#x27;s wort , which is known for photo sensitivity . Please be aware and make sure you use protection with it .</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing and smells great. Some days it seems greasy; however, within the hour it sinks in, letting me know just how moisture deprived my skin was. It leave the skin feeling smooth after it absorbs..</li>
    <li> Too greasy for my face. Used it up as hand cream. Will not repurchase. Too expensive for a mediocre product</li>
    <li> Did not work any differently than any other cream , did not help rosacia at all!should send back! Should have known better</li>
    <li> Smells like a rose garden and made my parched winter skin feel great! Highly recommend for all skin types as it absorbs perfectly!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin so while this still works for me, it&#x27;s on the heavier side. Definitely better for those winter months. A little too heavy for summer skin.</li>
    <li> allergic reaction, returned product</li>
    <li> I have hyper sensitive skin and find that this cream is wonderfully moisturizing and my skin does not react to it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I am devoted to Rose Day Cream.  I love the smell... I love the way it feels when I put it on my face...  I have been using it for almost a decade and I will never not use it.  My skin cells soak it up so happily!  I feel like my skin is singing with joy when I put it on!  I know that must sound strange.  lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I first considered using it.  I wasn&#x27;t making much money, but I felt really drawn to it after using a sample.  It felt like my skin was destined to use this cream.  So, I bit the bullet, and started buying it.  At times, I would try something else because it was cheaper, but I always pined for the Rose Cream and went to back to asap.  I don&#x27;t regret the cost at all.  Using a nice product like this is one of the small things you can do that really impacts on your quality of life.  Every time I put it on, I appreciate it deeply.  Try it out!  See if it&#x27;s for you.</li>
    <li> how do i get across what an incredible CREAM this is?  so many products label themselves as a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; when i would barely call them a thickened thin lotion.  not this one.  it is SO rich &amp; creamy that my old skin still feels moist 12 hours later.  i&#x27;m thrilled.  hope they have a night cream as well.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for face, neck and chest. Gives your skin a glow</li>
    <li> a new favorite. thick and moisturizing with a light scent. it&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
    <li> After only one week my face looks better</li>
    <li> not worth the money no better than over the counter products</li>
    <li> I am an early 40s runner, hiker and skier and my face and skin in general gets beat up a lot.  Using facial lotions and potions are a problem as they make me break out like crazy (all that yucky stuff like mineral oil, waxy components and glycerin), but not Dr, Hauschka&#x27;s Day Cream.  I love this product.  It heals my dry skin and brings a healthy glow to my face.  I have been using it for 3 years and while I try new products I always come back to it. Finally, one tube of the Day Cream lasts a long time.  Try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> This cream works great for my dry, and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I know it is more expensive then others you can buy, but it&#x27;s totally worth the price.  The tube will last you a long time because you only need a little bit each use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this for several years from Amazon (by Dr. Hauschka) and love it.  However, over the summer I ordered this and the light.  I used the light until this weekend, when it was time to switch to the regular Rose Cream for winter.  It gushed out in an oily watery mess that drained the whole tube as soon as I opened it.  It also had nasty yellow chunks like cottage cheese.  Needless to say this is defective and I wasted my money since I am outside of the return window.  I leery to order from this same seller in the event I get another bad batch. If you are ordering this for the first time, you are looking for a white very thick cream, almost like toothpaste that you squeeze out a small, pencil eraser sized amount, rub it between your fingers and press into your skin.  It usually works and feels great.  A normal batch I would give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> and thick texture, not easy to spread, pricey and not sure if it really works after reading on Paula&#x27;s Choice about this German brand</li>
    <li> I like it but its a little heavy</li>
    <li> I have used these products for years.  I have always been pleased with the quality of them.  They can be a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought it with concern because my skin can be combination type, a little oily, with the wrong product and the Rose cream did not say it was appropriate for combination skin. It only said, \\&quot;Normal/Dry/Sensitive\\&quot;. However, I fell in love with its scent in the store and I didn&#x27;t really want to buy a different cream. I was trying out their rhymthic night treatment and so I wanted to use Hauschka products before and after for maximum effect. I swear by it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed by the texture and scent of this cream. I wish I could eat it! It smells and feels that good. I wish they made their hand cream just like the Rose day cream. This cream feels so rich, so supportive, so soothing. I use a little \\&quot;normalizing day oil\\&quot; beforehand just in case and it seems to stretch the cream, even though you only need a little dab anyway. I find my skin way more balanced and soothed, and radiant and youthful looking. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from others. Rose has antiaging properties and even though Hauschka does not say so in regard to this product, I believe it is helping my fine lines. Anyhow, I think this cream is good enough to eat and I believe my skin is grateful for it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product line for many years and it shows. My skin is radiant and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other!</li>
    <li> This is great for really DRY skin. A little goes a long way. If you like the smell of roses, you&#x27;ll love this cream.</li>
    <li> now, there is nothing better for your face day and night. d. hauschka super conscious cream is a classic wow.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that can be flakey with some wrinkles and fine lines.  This really made a difference in my skin.  I thought a cream would be too greasy for me, but it actually blends well with no greasy feeling.  The smell is so fabulous...roses!!!  I received the order immediately, the service was great!</li>
    <li> the product is actually really good but i have found it way too expensive for the amount that is present in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week &amp; my skin is softer but so far I don&#x27;t see any change in the slight wrinkles I have.</li>
    <li> Love this cream in the winter.  It&#x27;s a little thick but does a good job of moisturizing my face in the winter.  Plus it smells great.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this did nothing for me as far as hydration. It broke my face out and made me sneeze!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and I have been looking for a product to use under my foundation. Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Rose Day Cream has done wonders for my face.  It is very smooth, even and my skin looks and feels younger. I love this product and now that I  have tried it, I can never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily (and nightly) for about a year now and there is a remarkable diference to how clear and plump my skin looks&lt;br /&gt;People often ask me what type of skin care regime I have and this is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;A fantastic smell, a very moisturizing feeling, absorbs nicely (not too quickly). Great under foundation.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Saved about 25% by purchasing through Amazon vs. Whole Foods.  I was a little nervous the lotion would be spoiled (mostly natural so that can happen).  Turns out product awesome and saved $ by purchasing online.</li>
    <li> As mentioned by others the cream separates from the oil.  It&#x27;s fine but I prefer the moisturizing creams and lotions from Evan Healy.</li>
    <li> My wife suffers from rosasea and this cream has really noticeably improved her skin, especially during dry winter days. She alternates with another cream at night</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Hauschka Daytime Rose Cream for years. I Love this product. Once the word got out, the Rose cream was flying off the shelf. I had to start ordering 2 at a time from Amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t run out. This smooth dense creaminess is so hydrating for my face and neck. My skin looks so soft and dewey that I&#x27;m actually asked if i&#x27;ve just come from my Facialist.</li>
    <li> Yep. Like it. Not heavy. Smells good. Well - reminds me of rose-scented hair removal creams a little, but that&#x27;s not a big issue. The issue is the price, which IMHO is too much for the cream. I have now switched to Alba and other cheaper items.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for three or four years and rarely feel the need to use makeup foundation.  My skin feels soft and looks healthy with an even skin tone.  Great for older skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks, and I absolutely love it. I used Avalon Organics for years, but they recently changed their formula for the worse. I had been wanting to try Dr. Hauschka, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I use a very small amount (pea size) &amp; dot on my forehead, cheeks, chin &amp; around eyes before smoothing in. A little goes a long way, so you get your money&#x27;s worth. It leaves my face soft &amp; very moisturized without getting oily.  My skin tends to be sensitive with occasional breakouts, but this product has not caused any issues. If you use too much, it will be greasy - so go light!</li>
    <li> I love this cream especially in the winter months as its very hydrating.  Its also great when traveling as it packs easily.</li>
    <li> This is as much a treatment as it is a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it costs so much more than anything else I put on my face, I primarily use it when there&#x27;s something else going on in addition to dryness: windburn, heat on my face, irritation of some kind, itching, or soothing the occasional kitty-kiss-that-became-a-love-bite. Nothing feels more soothing than this very rich, albeit expensive, cream. Most of my moisturizers are freebie samples or basic drugstore creams that I use daily; this costs too much to use every day. If it were more practical, I&#x27;d use it every day! Sadly, many stores exclude Dr. Hauschka products from other discounts they may be offering on other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin or are prone to sunburn or wind, and want a feel-good cream that smells strongly of fresh roses, and you don&#x27;t mind the price, go for it! I know some people say it&#x27;s too rich but I have dry skin so it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m in my 40s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of trivia: when asked, this is the moisturizer Madonna says she uses. Of course she&#x27;s also had a mini facelift or more, but she still looks pretty good in her mid-50s and can afford any cream she wants.</li>
    <li> i love this cream. So hyrating and the smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> Not actually for daytime use: I read that it contains St Johns Wort extract which oxidizes so it&#x27;s not good for skin in sunlight without an SPF. It&#x27;s also way too thick to use during the day in my opinion- almost like a balm. Difficult to spread and feels like it just sits on top my of skin. Giving it three stars because I still manage to make use of it on nights when my skin is really really dry. Better if you think of it as a hydrating night time mask that you don&#x27;t wash off. Unless you get a good price through Amazon, this isn&#x27;t worth your money.</li>
    <li> In my late 60s and while this cream is expensive, you get what you pay for, right? I still have oily rather than dry skin..hydrate like crazy and use omega 3&#x27;s...but at night this cream is so lovely to apply after bathing for bed, it has a true rose scent, and in the morning my face is Happy! I am a believer in sun daily..outside hours of 10-4 but this cream keeps my face looking much younger than my age...always a good thing! The rose scent makes for a relaxing end of the day..and I am not a synthetic scent lover..smells like I have a dozen beauty roses next to my bed..there are nice things to do for myself and this is one of them! I have used this for 20 years..in winter a must....AHHHHHHHHHHHH!</li>
    <li> I bought both Dr. Hauschka kits and tested nearly every product they make. Unfortunately I fell in love with all of them. Every last one. This one is no exception. It gives my skin the loveliest glow to it and the rose gives a velvety feel (I know it&#x27;s the rose because I spray myself with rosewater and it gives the same texture). It improves my skin in a way no other cream has. My cheeks are so dry and this is the only one other than Nivea that has been able to quench that. Unlike Nivea though, this one does not leave a lot of grease on my face. Unlike the Nivea as well, this one calms the redness in my cheeks quite nicely. I use other products with it specifically targeting redness (my favorite is the Skinceuticals redness neutralizer), but this one really helps it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason that this product is a true winner though, is that when I get ready for bed I always come to bed covered in grease and smelling like lotions. My partner won&#x27;t come near my face. He&#x27;s very sensitive to smells and hates EVERYTHING. But with this he came over and aggressively smelled my face and went \\&quot;You smell like Turkish Delight candy!!!\\&quot; and kissed me all over. That&#x27;s a winner right there! This one is was a definite repurchase.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful hydrating cream. In the winter I use it day and night. In the summer I use it nightly. It is a rich cream with a light rose scent. The scent is lovely- not overwhelming. This is a must have moisturizer for women with dry skin. Try the rose day cream light version if your skin is oily. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> It smells great, fells great and makes my cheeks and forehead glow...but I had to send it back due to my peri-oral dermatitis. I had a bad reaction after using it, so beware if you have VERY sensitive skin (I&#x27;m talking tried it all and still have red bumps on the chin and mouth area). If not, enjoy this product!</li>
    <li> Not only is it a great moisturizer but it protects my skin from the cold and wind without being heavy or oily.  It smells wonderful too -a natural rose scent.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if it was bad product, but this stuff is pretty impossible to use. It comes in a tin or metal type tube (to help preserve it, I guess) Even though I shake it up, the first thing that comes out of the tube each time is oil or water, some kind of liquid, almost likes its melted or separated? I&#x27;m not unhappy with the results, but it is incredibly oily, probably better for those with dry skin or usage in dry winter months. For the cost and lack of ease with usage, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> It is little too thick for the summer time but would be nice on winter.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite face creams ever! I love the fact that my skin will stay sooo moist with it and it doesn&#x27;t disappear into the skin.</li>
    <li> this cream IS THE BEST, I truly love it and so far it&#x27;s the only thing that calms my EXTREMELY DRY FACE ( due to hormonal pre-menopausal factors ),  I will definitely make it one of my HOLY GRIALS FOR MY FACE&#x27;S SKIN.</li>
    <li> On my 3rd or 4th tube of this now.  My eyes love this cream...I cannot say enough good things about this product...so I&#x27;ll only say this; Try It!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference, but it does smell really nice.  Seems to make my face greasy.</li>
    <li> Watching bravo live with andy cohen and his guest is jennifer lopez and she said she uses this as here moisturizer. ;) must work between all the good reveiws.</li>
    <li> I heard a celebrity mention using this cream and said that it was available at Whole Foods. I went online to look it up and found amazing customer reviews. People praise it not just on Amazon. My skin tends to run dry and I use this morning and night. My complexion seems smoother after using it for a little over a week and my makeup definitely seems to go on better.</li>
    <li> I  addicted to this product!! Highly recommended, I can&#x27;t go a day without it!! Extremely rich and creamy!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. This is a wonderful cream. My skin feels always very relaxed after I put it on. I have this same cream already for 20 years, if not longer. I love it, I cannot start the day without it.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful! I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go without it again! I can already tell a difference in my skin and it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Great face lotion. A little thick, but absorbs quickly. Leaves skin shining, but with powder foundation it cuts down shine and skin feels great.</li>
    <li> great product.  it&#x27;s expensive but you only need a little each time.  has not caused breakouts and my skin does not feel oily.</li>
    <li> This rose cream is awesome!  I would put it at night and then wake up with lovely dewy skin in the morning!!  I really hate the packaging I really had to squeeze and bottle was so little!</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of a friend, I purchased this after my favorite face cream (by another manufacturer) was discontinued.  I liked the smell, but the cream left my combination skin feeling oily all over.  I don&#x27;t remember reading the ingredients before I bought it, which makes it my mistake, but just a warning to people who know others with peanut allergies--this does contain peanut oil.  I have never run across any beauty products with peanut oil in them, although I&#x27;d heard that it&#x27;s a possibility.  But the chances for contamination increase immensely when it&#x27;s an oil, so please be careful!  It could spread to anything you touch with your hands or face (like laying sideways on a couch pillow or something).</li>
    <li> Smells like roses, thicker cream. Very nourishing.</li>
    <li> I love this day cream for the winter because I have very dry skin.  I use it on my face, neck, elbows, and knees and get great results.  I will try the light cream in the summer only because the regular is a little thick which is fine fro me.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market. Natural, smells great. No chemicals. Absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer!  It keeps my skin supple all day long! One of the best products on the market. Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells and moisturizes great.  I got it at the recommendation of the YouTube makeup artist Kandee Johnson and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  My neck is really sensitive to makeup, self-tanner, and other moisturizers, and this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck.  In fact, I use it as a salve when my neck is scratchy and red from other products.</li>
    <li> am very pleased with the results</li>
    <li> ok product. won&#x27;t re-order,  not enough product for the money.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency and moisture if this product.  The only downfall is the price for the amount you get.  If I used it as much as I normally use moisturizer on my face, it probably would have lasted a little more than a week!  I have been mixing it with my usual moisturizer and I love it, but won&#x27;t buy it again because of the amount for the price.  Much too expensive for me!</li>
