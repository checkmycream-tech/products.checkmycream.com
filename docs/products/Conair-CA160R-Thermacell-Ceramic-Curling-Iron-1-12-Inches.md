      <li>It heats up quickly,  </li>
      <li>The Thermacells run out fairly quickly too.</li>
      <li>, some reviews mentioned it getting too hot, but it was just right for my hair - which is super fine and super straight.&lt;br /&gt;... might actually work better than my counter top version ...</li>

      <li>I so pleasantly surprised that I&#x27;ve order two more in different colors for Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>It heated up quickly and cooled down quickly.</li>
      <li>Luckily I had an extra one from another iron.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for everyone who needs the convenience of mobile curling iron.</li>
      <li>For the price I didn&#x27;t have my expectations set too high, but</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>

      <li>I could live with that if I knew it would work.</li>
      <li>This curling iron never got hot enough to have any effect on my hair.  </li>
      <li>- maybe it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough?</li>
      <li>This curling iron never got hot enough to curl my thicker hair...</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s not great, but good enough to get rid of frizzies.  </li>

      <li>I got this for my mom, she&#x27;s getting older and the weight of a regular curling iron was a pain for her.  </li>
      <li>It barely worked once.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised Conair would make such an inferior product as I&#x27;ve used their products for years.  </li>
      <li>Apparently it was turned on or something during packing.</li>
      <li>I have short to medium long hair and in normal conditions it takes me 5 minutes to curl my hair.</li>

<li> WOW!</li>

<li> Apparently it was turned on or something during packing.</li>
<li> I have short to medium long hair and in normal conditions it takes me 5 minutes to curl my hair.</li>
<li> and I would not recommend (not even sure if it will work on very thin or short hair).</li>
<li> However, that being said I have only used it at 10,000 ft and with the lower oxygen level there might be an impact on how long it takes to heat up and to heat up sufficiently.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s only so much real estate in the suitcase after all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, could be a little hotter as some other reviewers had mentioned.</li>
<li> and I hope that this one lasts as long too.</li>
<li> Not returnable to Amazon due to the flammable nature of the thermacells; why I can&#x27;t ship it back w/o one/empty</li>
<li> I have very long, thick hair and this barely heat up enough to curl it at all.</li>
<li> Sent back for refund, received half.</li>
<li> They stay hot and curl difficult hard to curl straight</li>
<li> Even though it did heat up the iron it was not very hot.</li>
<li> It took awhile to find the larger barrel and it was worth it as it is nearly impossible to find in a local store or at least in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
<li> The larger barrel is hard to find.</li>
<li> This is a huge bummer because now I have something I absolutely DO NOT want!  :(</li>
<li> I think it should heat up a little hotter since I could not get the ends of my hair to curl under well.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money I spent!!!!</li>
<li> The barrel is not smooth, so hair gets tangled.</li>
<li> If you have never used a thermacell before you are missing out!&lt;br</li>
<li> Was not able to take with me to travel on airplane and to&lt;br /&gt;Cruise.  </li>
<li> The barrel is wider than i usually use, would like a 1&amp;#34</li>
<li> Disappointing - wife bought for a camping trip, went to use it and the cartridge was empty.</li>
<li> It works to curl and also give the base of the hair volume, which a smaller barrel doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
<li> and this was by far the worst</li>
<li> but then I&#x27;d be going through the thermaCELLs like crazy...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just like my plug in model, but I can take it on the go.  Great for a quick defrizz once I get to work when we have 200% humidity!</li>
    <li> I really like my wand can do my hair any where! Would recommend it to anyone especially for on the go women</li>
    <li> These headphones are awesome! For the price I didn&#x27;t have my expectations set too high, but WOW! I so pleasantly surprised that I&#x27;ve order two more in different colors for Christmas gifts. I recommend these for anyone. Sound quality is great!</li>
    <li> I have used Conair Thermacell Curling irons for years.  Either I got a clunker or this model just does not work.  It gets warm but just does not get warm enough to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy!  I accidentally purchased this and then found out you cannot return it because of the butane in it.  This is a huge bummer because now I have something I absolutely DO NOT want!  :(</li>
    <li> The cell that came with the iron did not work. Luckily I had an extra one from another iron. Even though it did heat up the iron it was not very hot. After having it on for about five minutes I could still put my hand directly on the iron ......very disappointed. It was overpriced and I was underwhelmed.</li>
    <li> I used to live by these cordless curling irons when I was in high school and was mega excited when I found out they were still being produced. Ceramic, 1 1/2 inch barrel, and portable! FAILLLLLLLLLLLLL. I have very long, thick hair and this barely heat up enough to curl it at all. The Thermacells run out fairly quickly too. I used 1/3 of it just trying to get this darn thing to heat up! Also, I have yet to find one brick and mortar store that still sells Thermacells :(</li>
    <li> works well, I was so glad to get this for camping and no electricity available--works like i expected. The barrel is wider than i usually use, would like a 1&amp;#34; choice.</li>
    <li> Does not retain heat very well so curl or wave does not stay at all</li>
    <li> It worked for one time and then quit. I was so dissappointed in this item. I&#x27;ve had butane curling irons for years and this was by far the worst</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully and not purchased this item.  It barely worked once.  I&#x27;m surprised Conair would make such an inferior product as I&#x27;ve used their products for years.  Amazon was very nice about giving me a refund.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom, she&#x27;s getting older and the weight of a regular curling iron was a pain for her.  This has been a great alternative, it&#x27;s lightweight and still gets her hair the way she like it.</li>
    <li> I think it should heat up a little hotter since I could not get the ends of my hair to curl under well.  I love the thermacell irons for overseas travel.  I wish you made a 1 1/4\\&quot; also because that is the size I use at home.  The 1 1/2\\&quot; size is good for smoothing and straightening hair.  I have straight hair and need more heat to curl.</li>
    <li> It totally does what it says.  I keep it in my desk at work for when I have bad hair days.  It gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a cordless, portable curling iron.  This fits that description perfectly.  It heats up quickly,  I have very fine straight hair.  I use the curling iron immediately after shampooing and drying my hair.  It gives my hair added body.  Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl real well - maybe it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough?</li>
    <li> Disappointing - wife bought for a camping trip, went to use it and the cartridge was empty. Apparently it was turned on or something during packing. It should have a switch and indicator to help prevent this.</li>
    <li> I love this on the go curling iron.  If you have never used a thermacell before you are missing out!&lt;br /&gt;They are easy and the cells heat up Fast! They stay hot and curl difficult hard to curl straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Compact and easy to carry in a purse for travel.  No cords, No fuss.</li>
    <li> Worth the over priced amount of $30. I take places Im not sure where I would be able to plug in the plug in the regular kind of curling iron. One Can throw this is your purse for quick touch ups. Love this excellent purchase..I bought extra cartridges as well. Gave 4 stars because its over priced. Its basically a huge butane lighter wrapped in metal for havens sake!</li>
    <li> I like the size but it took a long time to heat up and never did get sufficiently hot to form a good curl.  However, that being said I have only used it at 10,000 ft and with the lower oxygen level there might be an impact on how long it takes to heat up and to heat up sufficiently.</li>
    <li> I love how this works.  Taking a trip in June and know I will get lots of use from this.</li>
    <li> Conair did it again! This cordless curling iron is hot and curls great. Gets hot in seconds, quicker than the ones with the cord and the curl stays .Wish they would make one with STEAM.  Great for large curls and body.  All the CONAIR CORDLESS CURLING IRONS are great . Wish it had a cover.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to find the larger barrel and it was worth it as it is nearly impossible to find in a local store or at least in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it heated up a little bit more but then I&#x27;d be going through the thermaCELLs like crazy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great prodct...</li>
    <li> This will be a great item to travel with. It seems to heat up nicely. It would get a full 5 stars but you cant adjust the temp. I guess with butane it can only be on or off.[[ASIN:B007E34TJE Conair CA160R Thermacell Ceramic Curling Iron, 1 1/2 Inches]]</li>
    <li> I bought this to take a European vacation. I was worried it would get confiscated at the airport because although TSA approves it, Air Canada seemed to have an issue with it according to their website. It went through multiple airports just fine. It heated up quickly and cooled down quickly. I used it every day for 13 days with no issue.</li>
    <li> Works great. My wife loves it</li>
    <li> Bought this to give my hair some extra body.  It really works.  Have used the ones with 3/4 barrels for years.  No cord.  No mess.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought to carry in my purse for those bad hair days. Does the job, is easy to use and convenient. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love my butane curling iron.  I can take it anywhere.  No need for a plug.  I have had one for years.  This one is just a bit bigger than my big curls one, but still does what I need it to.  Was pleased to find it as the bigger size butane curling irons are not easily found.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  Didn&#x27;t work.  Sent back for refund, received half.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought?!&lt;br /&gt;It works so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some reviews mentioned it getting too hot, but it was just right for my hair - which is super fine and super straight.&lt;br /&gt;... might actually work better than my counter top version ... hmmmm....</li>
    <li> This curling iron never got hot enough to curl my thicker hair... disappointing purchase and I would not recommend (not even sure if it will work on very thin or short hair).</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  Great for traveling and very handy. Thanks for the speedy delivery.  Highly recommend for everyone who needs the convenience of mobile curling iron.</li>
    <li> The Conair CA60R Thermacell Ceramic Curling Iron did not heat up to a temperature that works with my hair.  The barrel is not smooth, so hair gets tangled.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not great, but good enough to get rid of frizzies.  Doesn&#x27;t really curl well.  Takes longer to heat up than they say.</li>
    <li> This is a great new tool.  I like have a larger barrel sometimes so this is nice. I&#x27;ve had another Conair for 10+ years and I hope that this one lasts as long too.</li>
    <li> This heats quickly and works really well. The larger barrel is hard to find. It works to curl and also give the base of the hair volume, which a smaller barrel doesn&#x27;t do. I use it even when not travelling.</li>
    <li> It was fine until about a month after purchasing it started not always turning on when needed!  I travel for a living &amp; loved this bcs it was light in my suitcase &amp;I didn&#x27;t have to worry about convertors or adapters when going overseas, but if you can&#x27;t rely on it to work when you need it to then why bother! There&#x27;s only so much real estate in the suitcase after all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, could be a little hotter as some other reviewers had mentioned. I could live with that if I knew it would work. Not returnable to Amazon due to the flammable nature of the thermacells; why I can&#x27;t ship it back w/o one/empty is beyond me! I WILL be contacting Conair customer service about this and I hope to get some resolution.</li>
    <li> Was not able to take with me to travel on airplane and to&lt;br /&gt;Cruise.  Not worth the money I spent!!!!</li>
    <li> This curling iron never got hot enough to have any effect on my hair.  Very disappointing, as I was hoping to use it while traveling overseas. Also, this item CANNOT be returned to Amazon because of the flammable nature of the liquid that it uses to heat up.</li>
    <li> Large size makes beautiful curl &amp; no adapter required. Excellent heat element for quick use &amp; highly recommend for international travel.</li>
    <li> Used this on recent Italy trip.  Didn&#x27;t have any problem carrying on or packing the Thermacell cartridges.  Flew Delta, AirItalia and Air France.  One Cartridge does not last two to three months.  I went thru three cartridges in two weeks.  I have short to medium long hair and in normal conditions it takes me 5 minutes to curl my hair.</li>
