      <li>love most mascaras from Maybelline and this one performs their standards as it was described.</li>
      <li>Dior Show is my all time favorite mascara, with a not so favorite price tag.</li>
      <li>With this mascara I find the more you comb the wand through your lashes, the more separation you&#x27;ll get.</li>
      <li>I love makeup</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>While the mascara works ok (not knocking my socks off), I am having issues with the stopper coming out with the brush.  </li>
      <li>but this defines and lengthens them even more.</li>
      <li>results(the more you put on,</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands in order to find one that does not do that.</li>
      <li>This one is not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have to say, I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the brush and the bottle.</li>

      <li>I tried to find one that I liked better and so far, have not come across anything that can hold a light to my One by One!</li>
      <li>The mascara formula itself is fine, but I can&#x27;t get around the faulty tube design.</li>
      <li>I opted for coconut oil instead and that did the trick just fine.</li>
      <li>This mascara is great, a nice black that is waterproof.</li>
      <li>The wand really is great, the little spikes are nicely spaced and the fact that it&#x27;s plastic means no gobs of gunk on your wand or your eyes.</li>
      <li>This is a huge annoyance.</li>
      <li>They are probably about 90-95% clump free though, and the \\&quot;clumps\\&quot; are just two lashes that are stuck together</li>
      <li>great with multiple</li>
      <li>Each time you brush on another light coat your lashes seem to get longer.</li>

      <li>AS BOLD AS I LIKE</li>
      <li>Only nice clump free length and volume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras that claim to give your lashes volume, and this is my favorite.</li>

      <li>For that, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>Useful for rainy weathers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express takes me a little time to put on, because I slowly roll the brush upward from the eyelash base to the end of the lash in order to prevent clumping.  I repeat the process several times to get the length and thickness I like.  I am happy that I can depend on Maybelline New York Volumn&#x27; Express to produce a pleasing effect everytime.&lt;br /&gt;I was only able to use my last order only a few times because the top of the mascara reservoir was pulled out by the brush baton.  I was unable to push it into place so I couldn&#x27;t use the brush or prevent the mascara from eposure to air.  It&#x27;s never happened before, and I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> Great mascara for people with eye allergies. No itchy eyes for me so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this because during allergy season my eyes water quite a lot which makes my mascara run and it irritates my eyes incessantly. This product is perfect, it does not smudge or run, it is easy to remove at the end of the day when i wash my face, and the type of brush that it utilizes is really perfect for getting clump-less long lashes!</li>
    <li> Very cheap mascara and for this price is ok. I love makeup and I am always trying different things and brands.&lt;br /&gt;Being waterproof it is a great feature.</li>
    <li> This is a AMAZING mascara, I love it. But they stopped selling it at my local Walgreens and Walmart and everywhere. I don&#x27;t know if they disconnected it or what. But this is one of the best drugstore mascara and I really think every one looking for a cheaper mascara to get this</li>
    <li> not crazy about quality, bottle dried out fast too</li>
    <li> One of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;m a huge mascara junkie, and I&#x27;ve tried out MANY products over the years, and this is one of my all-time favorites. It stayed looking the same all day. The brush helps to separate, volumize, as well as lengthen lashes.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have ever used.  Lengthens lashes, no clumping, no smudging, lashes stay soft, it goes on perfectly every time.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this as I had purchased Maybeline&#x27;s Falsies Mascara a few months prior and found the only thing false about it was it&#x27;s advertising. This one piqued my interest though because definition is one of the big things I look for in mascara. It wasn&#x27;t super expensive and I needed new mascara because of an eye infection that contaminated my last one, so I went ahead and bought it.     Do my eyelashes look like the girls in the commercial? No. But I really didn&#x27;t think they would. Are my lashes 100% clump free? No, but again I didn&#x27;t expect them to be. They are probably about 90-95% clump free though, and the \\&quot;clumps\\&quot; are just two lashes that are stuck together so nothing super noticeable. All in all it&#x27;s a pretty good mascara.    One bad thing that I&#x27;ve noticed though is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very well. It seems sticky for hours after and if you touch your eyelashes, such as rubbing your eyes, it&#x27;s still sticky enough that the lashes will clump.    Note: The \\&quot;brush\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really brush-like it&#x27;s more of a stiff plastic. Not in a bad way, just not what I am used to.</li>
    <li> No clumps and does what it says</li>
    <li> I bought this at the same time that I picked up \\&quot;The Falsies\\&quot; and I have to say I was quite pleased with both. I knew I wanted the waterproof formulas because they are known to hold a curl better than the regular formulas and I need all the help I can get with curling and keeping that curl on my eye lashes. My lashes are fairly long, but pretty straight and dont have many so I look for a mascara that will not only keep my lashes curled but give them a little definition instead of the wirey look. I do use a metal eye lash curler (from revlon) before applying and I recently learned to wiggle the mascara wand a bit at the base and then sweep through till ends. With this mascara I find the more you comb the wand through your lashes, the more separation you&#x27;ll get. The wand really is great, the little spikes are nicely spaced and the fact that it&#x27;s plastic means no gobs of gunk on your wand or your eyes. One coat seems fine to me, though I have used more and gotten good results(the more you put on, the darker and thicker your lashes will be. If your going to let coats dry between use a metal eye lash comb to seperate before adding more. I did not have a problem with drying time, about 3 minutes give or take for one coat, pretty normal for mascaras. If your looking for a good thickening/lengthing mascara, try \\&quot;The Falsies\\&quot;. Although it does not really give you the look of falsies, it does make eye lashes look very glam and thick. It takes a little while to get used to the spoon shaped brush with the comb part on only part, but once mastered it only takes one coat of this mascara to give you the lush lashes you&#x27;ve always wanted (any more messes up the look, i think). While this formula is a little thicker in consistancy( can gob up if your not careful, i use a toothpick to clean just a little of the mascara off the wand before swiping ) it sticks to your lashes and then builds out to give the illusion of more lashes and holds a curl like no other. Sometimes I like to use the \\&quot;One by One\\&quot; let dry, comb thru, curl, fluff with eye brow brush and then a coat of \\&quot;The Falsies\\&quot; for a little extra oomph.</li>
    <li> The mascara is very good quality, The Maybelline one by one waterproof mascara is very good. I first curl and coat 4 times, Haven&#x27;t got a clump so far. Only nice clump free length and volume. And i the price is just right</li>
    <li> Useful for rainy weathers. I usually pair it up with another mascara to make it look voluminous! Overall, it&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does not clump at all, not even a couple of lashes sticking together. Typically I apply one coat, wait 30 seconds, and apply a second coat. It always looks perfect!&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof truly does mean waterproof. This mascara stood up through massive amounts of crying and wiping my eyes at a funeral, with no running or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;- It seems to dry quickly. I&#x27;ve tried many brands that seem to take forever to dry, so that if I blinked too soon after applying I&#x27;d end up with little black marks underneath my eyes. I&#x27;ve not experienced that with this product.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t bother my contact lenses. (I put the lenses in first, then apply the mascara.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this conversation one morning with my husband, which may illustrate how great the mascara is. Typically, he finds makeup to be a little ridiculous and doesn&#x27;t understand why I go through this daily ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIM: [Enters while I&#x27;m opening mascara] So what is that stuff?&lt;br /&gt;ME: Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;HIM: What do you use it for?&lt;br /&gt;ME: To make lashes look thicker so your eyes stand out more.&lt;br /&gt;HIM: But your eyes already stand out. You don&#x27;t need that.&lt;br /&gt;ME: Here, let me show you. [I apply the mascara to lashes on right eye but not the left, then turn around to show him.]&lt;br /&gt;HIM: Oh, wow. Yeah, you should keep using that. [Wanders off, to do whatever it is husbands do in the morning, which does not include anything useful such as feeding the dogs or taking out the trash.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for a drugstore-brand cosmetic, this stuff is awesome. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This mascara does what it says it will, separates your lashes and creates wonderful lash volume BUT once it dries it starts to flake off - meaning throughout the day you will not only be getting flecks of mascara in your eye but freckles of black all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pass on this one until its New and Improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras that claim to give your lashes volume, and this is my favorite. I have long lashes but not many of them. So I&#x27;m not interested in adding length, but creating volume. This mascara does the job well, and the brush actually seperates the lashes so they don&#x27;t get that ugly clumpy look.</li>
    <li> This one is not my favorite. It takes a lot of work to get the mascara off the brush and now when I take the brush out of the bottle, the black part of the tube is coming off with it and is not taking off the excess product. Trying another. However, it doesn&#x27;t stay on and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge off. A little hard to remove...</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I had originally bought this mascara at Target, but they stopped selling it for some reason so I had to search the web for this amazing product.  I use it as the last of three mascaras to separate my other lashes, and it really works!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and it is great!</li>
    <li> this product did not volumize like it said it was to do.. it comes out thin. And it barely makes a difference from nude lashes to coated lashes...</li>
    <li> I love this brand. This mascara is great, a nice black that is waterproof. Basically it is exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> love most mascaras from Maybelline and this one performs their standards as it was described.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to recommend this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I got this item within 3days. Shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;But the mascara doesn&#x27;t have any effect without black painting on my eyelash. I don&#x27;t understand why other costomers gave over one star with this item. It&#x27;s useless</li>
    <li> I just didn&#x27;t like how the mascara clumped on the brush and on my eyelashes. I ended up going back to Maybelline Full N Soft and discarded this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara because my old Maybelline rocket mascara ran out. This one was cheaper and seemed similar so I just went for it. It&#x27;s hard to tell specifically what about this one isn&#x27;t is as good at the rocket but it&#x27;s just not. Sometimes the rubber tube on the inside pops out and gets stuck on the brush which sucks when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready in the morning. Also when it goes on, some of my eyelashes stick together and it&#x27;s hard to separate them with a toothpick so I don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Every mascara sold should consider using this type of applicator in their product. The mascara applies smoothly on each lash without clumps left by the brush type applicators. If you want to extend your lashes put on 2 or 3 light coats rather than one heavy coat. Each time you brush on another light coat your lashes seem to get longer. Your lashes look much more natural without the gobs and clumps left by the brush applicators. This mascara also seems to come off easy with makeup remover. I don&#x27;t have any trouble with it flaking or smearing during the day.</li>
    <li> My fav mascara out of all the ones Ive tried.</li>
    <li> Love the brush , easy to apply</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes more defined without clumps</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was old, but it comes out really dry like it&#x27;s old.</li>
    <li> This product is great. The only thing that I would warn about is that it takes a little extra time to remove with a make up remover wipe. I opted for coconut oil instead and that did the trick just fine. Otherwise this mascara is perfect. I already have relatively long eye lashes but this defines and lengthens them even more. I&#x27;ve switched from using eyeliner and mascara to make my eyes pop to just using this mascara.</li>
    <li> I have problems with mascara smudging under my eyes, making my dark circles even worse. I have tried many brands in order to find one that does not do that. This one has been the worst. After a few minutes, it had left a huge dark smudge under my eyes. I went to get the mascara, and promptly threw it away.</li>
    <li> For a waterproof mascara I think this is wonderful. When you first put it on, it does clump a bit and makes my lashes stick together when I first put it on. I usually take my finger after applying and run it across the lashes to separate them and remove the clumps. It dries very well and once it is dry, it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. I wear contacts and have dry eyes and need to use eye drops a few times a day and this mascara doesn&#x27;t smear or run.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it doesnt feel heavy on my eyelashes. It got delivered really fast. Will be buying again😊</li>
    <li> Okay, this is the best mascara ever. I&#x27;ve repurchased twice and can&#x27;t live without it. I tried to find one that I liked better and so far, have not come across anything that can hold a light to my One by One! It&#x27;s definitely waterproof to a T ---thank goodness because I cry a lot. And it lengthens and gives great volume! With two coats, I&#x27;m good to fly.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t do 1 star reviews for stuff like this, but the flange comes out with the wand on every tube I have purchased. The mascara formula itself is fine, but I can&#x27;t get around the faulty tube design.</li>
    <li> Works nicely and is vary waterproof just wish it could be blacker</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, it does not give you volume. It only gives you a clumpy lash, its not a good product</li>
    <li> I like the formula as well as the brush itself. It does a good job at separating lashes and making them appear longer BUT the brush wand is constantly coming off the top. This is a huge annoyance. I think I&#x27;ll go back to Covergirl Lashblast which has the same kind of brush but it stays in one piece (slightly more expensive but worth it).</li>
    <li> Pros: Seperates lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Lengthes and Volumizes.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;Looks great with multiple coats.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a curl well.&lt;br /&gt;Does not cump whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Has a faint smell to it, but you can&#x27;t smell it once you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to take off, because it is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommand this mascara to anyone(:</li>
    <li> I really like full lashes and this gives me what I want</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product, I recommened it to all, very happy with my order and would definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush applies it evenly and well and keeps the lashes separate. The distribution is mostly even. It can clump slightly at the tips even when you bring the brush completely off, but a second sweep with the brush removes the clumps.It lengthens and thickens well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the depth of the black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No flaking for me, and it&#x27;s very waterproof and needs to be properly removed.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it did not have that much mascara inside. Did not last me as long as other mascaras have. I truly wanted to love it but for this reason I don&#x27;t. After just a few times the black band that wipes the brush clean so it does not come out clumpy came off -_- Leaves eyelashes nice, but honestly will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Not enough mascara comes out on the brush to even highlight my lashes. Disappointed it does not separate and volumize your lashes.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara because the reviews seems good and it was a good price.  However, it&#x27;s very clumpy and doesn&#x27;t seem to extend my lashes at all.  Instead of individually extending each lash like my last mascara, it clumped them all together and just made a mess.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this mascara again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this mascara. Not only did the product arrive TWO days after I ordered it (I ordered it the late afternoon of the 20th, it arrive on the 22nd in the morning), but I have found my new go-to mascara. I have always hated the crappy brushes that older/cheaper mascaras have and have spent too much time picking off the clumps with my fingers, which makes me irritated and is messy. This brush is AMAZING for my lashes. The mascara goes on smooth and clump-free! I cannot recommend this enough! I got the blackest-black and I have long, black eyelashes, so I like the color and the thickness of the product (not too cakey/frosting-like, more like thick ink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I LOVE the brush, because the mascara does not clump anywhere on my lashes. If you&#x27;re looking for giant, thick black sticks for lashes, don&#x27;t buy this because it separates your lashes. But if you&#x27;re looking to add a little extra length and darkness to your lashes, this product is sleek and subtle.</li>
    <li> Stays on longer and does not clump.  I have tried so many different mascaras and they all seem to smudge and look bad.  This formula stays on for a long time and resists smudging.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Lovely and beautiful when I put it on...great mascara..&amp;lt;3 perfect for any where. To the beach or a night out. .for a sweet price.</li>
    <li> Im so happy that i purchased this one,it took me a while to decide which one is the best.I used it the first time and its amazing!</li>
    <li> While the mascara works ok (not knocking my socks off), I am having issues with the stopper coming out with the brush.  I repeatedly put the cap back on as tight as I can to ensure that the stopper is in place, but it still comes out occasionally.</li>
    <li> This mascara is O.K. I&#x27;ve purchased better maybelline mascara for myself.Everybodies lashes are different so i&#x27;m not really going to say anything negative about it.I purchased it for a good price with free shipping.Who would not like that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waterproof but it&#x27;s easy to remove. Great brush and my eyelashes look amazing. Do not crumble and doesn&#x27;t leave any traces even after 12 hours. Really I love it !!!</li>
    <li> The title says it all. Dior Show is my all time favorite mascara, with a not so favorite price tag. I&#x27;m a firm believer of the One By One, both in washable and waterproof. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this product less than two weeks when the seal broke that goes around the top of the bottle that wipes off the brush as it&#x27;s coming out of the bottle. So now that seal around the opening of the bottle now comes off with the brush every time, leaving a mess on the brush. I tried to pull down the seal with my fingers, getting mascara everywhere, and tried to re-lock the seal back into place, but it came out with the next application. Horrible product!</li>
    <li> This mascara works really great and it&#x27;s waterproof too. It gets every lash with one coat.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have read the reviews before I bought it!! It is definitely water-proof!! Meaning impossible to remove with regular make-up wipes and/or water. I had to use baby oil to get all the mascara off my eyelashes. So if you like rock hard lashes, be my guest and purchase this mascara..</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m almost through with my first bottle and am ordering another. It really does mean \\&quot;one by one\\&quot; - your lashes don&#x27;t clump at all, and really stand out individually as both long and full. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments wearing this. I also really like it for my bottom lashes. It doesn&#x27;t flake throughout the day or smudge beneath my eye - once it&#x27;s on it will STAY on until you want it off - and you will need makeup remover, by the way - it really is waterproof! I love the brush and the bottle. I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras and somehow always go back to this one. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> wish they still made this product</li>
    <li> I have to say, I love it. It lasts all day like I just put it on, separates and lengthens my lashes, and to top it off isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> I LIKE NATURAL EYELASHES THAT HAVE CURVES TO THEM &amp; ARE BOLD IN TEXTURE, YET NON CLUMPY.  THIS PRODUCT DOES SHOW TO ATTACH TO EACH LASH INDIVIDUALLY, BUT IT DOES NOT PRESENT ITSELF AS BOLD AS I LIKE IT TO BE!  I RECCOMMEND THE PRODUCT FOR A TEEN AGER WHO IS BEGINNING IN MAKE UP.  I GAVE THE PRODUCT TO MY DAUGHTER.</li>
    <li> I am Asian and my eyelashes is relatively short and straight. Maybelline mascara works very well with my eyelashes. It makes my eyelashes look dramatically longer and add more volume. Not like many Mascara brands, including many counter brands such as Estee, Clinique, or Lancome, Maybelline mascara keeps my eyelashes still stay curly after I curl my eyelashes and apply this mascara on.&lt;br /&gt;With the price and its effectiveness, I think Maybelline Mascara is the best Mascara.</li>
    <li> love this mascara. lasts forever</li>
    <li> Love the brush on this mascara...haven&#x27;t found another like it.  It really separates lashes.  It is a great bargain for the money.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Waterproof and best of all smudge proof.&lt;br /&gt;cons:  You need a minimum of two coats for it to really make your lashes look fuller and longer.  I&#x27;m blessed with long lashes so it&#x27;s not bad, but if I was depending on it to really make my lashes pop, I&#x27;d be disappointed.  However, I was looking for smudge proof (get tired of having to fix my make up so I don&#x27;t look like a racoon), and it definitely did that.  For that, it&#x27;s worth it and I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thought;  If they changed the brush, it might help.</li>
    <li> Defiantly water proof, but will wash of.  I like it because I separated every lash.  It was too much at first for my taste, but after I had used a little it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Despite the odd football shaped brush, it applies really evenly and goes on smoothly. So far very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This mascara works really good. I hardly have lashes and with this product they look incredibly long. The best part is that is waterproof.</li>
