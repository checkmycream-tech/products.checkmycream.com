      <li>Bought it after researching &amp;#34;The best straighteners for African American hair&amp;#34; and it definitely works amazing.  </li>

      <li>Ii had to return this because it didn&#x27;t stay hot or get the job done!</li>
      <li>I love this thing makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
      <li>I rarely use a straightening iron</li>
      <li>This iron is a good iron however be careful because I think you can burn your hair if your not.  </li>
      <li>, it goes to 450 temp, very good better than other straighteners i have used in the past.</li>

      <li>That pretty much made up my mind to try it</li>
      <li>But overall, a good flat iron.</li>
      <li>My hair is really frizzy and this works as well as my hairdressers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really like 375</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for something I wouldn&#x27;t be using much.</li>
      <li>(well really close) to the scalp without a burn.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It did arrive on time and was very well packaged.</li>
      <li>My hair is very shiny when using.</li>
      <li>-- 400 is too hot and 350 doesn&#x27;t always do it in New Orleans&#x27; humidity.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this flat iron by my hair stylist when she lightly ran through my hair and it was so straight.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy one of the over priced irons at the sally&#x27;s beauty or thriftys as I&#x27;ve done in the past because those cost a lot more for lesser quality.</li>
      <li>but I have not had it long enough to tell if I will be as happy with its performance as I have been with my Chi Flat Iron.</li>
      <li>Brand new!</li>
      <li>Many different settings especially for bangs.</li>
      <li>Flat iron heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>has it gets hot enough to seal the product into the hair</li>
      <li>These other flat irons were a lot more pricey and didn&#x27;t deliver the results that I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many other flat irons</li>
      <li>This is my first flat iron purchase.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only received this Flat Iron this week so I have only used it a few times. So far I think that it was a good buy. I like the fact that it has digital heat settings and has a locking feature to keep from accidentaly changing the heat setting while in use. It also comes with a travel pouch, which opens flat to protect counter surfaces. I  gave it 4 stars because I love the features mentioned but I have not had it long enough to tell if I will be as happy with its performance as I have been with my Chi Flat Iron.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron! I bought it upon the recommendation of Essence Magazine (they had it priced at almost $100 though). In my opinion, Brazilian Heat Titanium After Dark supersedes the Chi! First of all you can customize the heat setting. Secondly it is comfortable to hold and is just very smooth. It&#x27;s light weight, but its power is tremendous.  I used this in combination with another product-Blow Your Kinks Out....DYNAMIC duo! I have NEVER gotten so many compliments on my hair! I found it very easy to manage...It got right down (well really close) to the scalp without a burn. I also liked that within the box, there is a complimentary case for the iron. It made my hair feel light, but gave it body too. For me, it was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Before buying this flat iron, I read the reviews on Amazon and other sites.  That pretty much made up my mind to try it but I was still a little skeptical because I had tried other flat irons that had high reviews.  These other flat irons were a lot more pricey and didn&#x27;t deliver the results that I was looking for.  The Belson flat iron FAR exceeded my expectations! Finally a flat iron that does what it says and for about half the cost of the more well known irons.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I have very thick course hair and it straightened my hair with one swipe and made it very shiny as well!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this wand at first.  It works well, heats up quickly but as time went on it made her hair consistency oily and did not straighten as well as it could. She then went back to ceramic plates and loves it much more</li>
    <li> I just purchased this Flat iron today and I&#x27;m hoping to give it \\&quot;5 Stars\\&quot;- I have natural hair and I&#x27;ve been looking for a safe and effective flat iron that won&#x27;t ruin my hair but can give me excellent results. I&#x27;ve read the reviews on Amazon and on other sites and they have all been positive. I hope it&#x27;s the same for me. I will make sure to come back and update my review once I start to use it. I am so excited!!! 08/31/12-I received this flat iron, used it and am in love with it!I love Brazilian Heat product line in general. A nice, smooth, frizz-free finish at a 400 degree setting works for me. I have 3b-3c hair. I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve had bought it a while ago and still love it!</li>
    <li> this is the best iron i have purchsed ever. I love this thing makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
    <li> This replaced my Chi, which I&#x27;d had for over 5 years. It&#x27;s a good flat iron, does the job, but I wish it had more temperature control. It goes from 450 (yikes!) to 400 to 350....and on down. I&#x27;d really like 375 -- 400 is too hot and 350 doesn&#x27;t always do it in New Orleans&#x27; humidity. But overall, a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. The plates are very smooth and the edges don&#x27;t leave any kinks or force any curls. I love the temperature control... it gets waaaaaay hotter than I would need but you can set it higher for wet hair with a lot of product in it, and lower for touch ups for day-after hair.</li>
    <li> Flat iron heats up quickly. Creates smooth straight hair easily without burning. Disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t really make soft curls if I wanted. W</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron. I am a busy stylist and it lasted a little over 2 years. My ONLY complaint is that at the end of its life, the casing started getting hot and I could barely hold it on my hand to use. Great value, though! It slides through the hair like butter</li>
    <li> My flat iron burned out twice after sending it back. But they will allow you to return it for another pair of flat irons.</li>
    <li> Best flat Iron I have ever own goes up to 450 degrees for Keratin treated hair love love love it</li>
    <li> This flat iron was amazing while it worked but totally crapped out on me out of nowhere after a little less than a year of having it. Just completely stopped working. There was no damage of any kind to cause this.</li>
    <li> love my new straightener.  Bought it after researching &amp;#34;The best straighteners for African American hair&amp;#34; and it definitely works amazing.  Im even thinking about going natural again knowing that I have such a good straightener now! recommended !</li>
    <li> Brand new! Come with a carrying case, awesome, great on hair. Many different settings especially for bangs. For those who burn their bangs.</li>
    <li> Although I ordered this from Amazon, I found one a it cheaper; so I sent the one from Amazon back.&lt;br /&gt;The iron does heat up quickly, very easy to use and it does get very hot for my hair. (which happen to be thin) so watch the heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;It did arrive on time and was very well packaged.</li>
    <li> I love it. My hair is really frizzy and this works as well as my hairdressers. My hair is very shiny when using.</li>
    <li> I have used all types of flat irons in all price ranges.  This one is OK .  Definitely not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I rarely use a straightening iron but I wanted to try the Brazilian keratin treatment so I needed a 450 degree good quality iron. I paid $47 for my iron in August and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for something I wouldn&#x27;t be using much. The packaging is bright shiny red inside and it comes with a wrap to store the iron in. Which was a nice treat. I found it very easy to use and the control to keep it turned on is really good since my curling wand is constantly being accidentally turned off . This iron made doing the Brazilian keratin treatment for myself and my friend a breeze. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy one of the over priced irons at the sally&#x27;s beauty or thriftys as I&#x27;ve done in the past because those cost a lot more for lesser quality. This is a sturdy yet comfortable weighted iron and it lights up the word brazilian to let you know it is plugged in and a control for the temperature.</li>
    <li> Great easy to manage flat iron.  I can make curls from it.  It does a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> leaves the hair soft and shiny. , it goes to 450 temp, very good better than other straighteners i have used in the past. Titanium plates gets hot very fast but always change the temp from 450-320</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron purchase.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect; however, I knew what I wanted as the end result.  These flat irons deliver!</li>
    <li> One of very few irons that will hold up to keratine. Recomended</li>
    <li> Great product, great price (cheaper than Sally&#x27;s). Just what I needed. I&#x27;ve done my research and Titanium Keratin flat irons are pretty mcuh the best out right now. I love them I made a great choice. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Hands down the BEST straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and it only ever takes one pass to straighten each piece completely. I can straighten my wild curls in less than 20 minutes INCLUDING preheat time.</li>
    <li> I want to like this but it shuts off the minute I pick it up...I don&#x27;t know if it is an error on my part but it is very frustrating...it heats up and then when I pick it up (and be sure to not touch the buttoms) it just shuts off.  Please let me know how I can avoid this...because I want to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve owned. Heats up quickly, salon quality. My old one lasted for years and was so happy to find one just like it at a great price.</li>
    <li> The flat iron it&#x27;s problem</li>
    <li> Bought for wife for Christmas. She loves it! Best flat iron she has ever used. Heats quickly and works evenly across hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is waaay better than the Chi.  I only used to buy Chis unti my hair dresser recommnded this one.  It is so smooth and works great on my hair.  I have very wavy/curly thick hair and this works to give me stick straight hair every time I use it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up fast. Love this iron</li>
    <li> It definitely met my expectations. I am a natural and not all hair straighteners can do the job. My hair type is 4a and thin so there is flexibility. But my niece is 4c thick hair &amp; the flat iron delivers! I first tried it at a friends house &amp; enjoyed the results. At that point I knew I needed to purchase one of my own!</li>
    <li> Ii had to return this because it didn&#x27;t stay hot or get the job done! Maybe mine was just defective but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> I really like my flat iron. It does what I want it to do.  I have had a few flat irons and this one is the first to both straighten and curl the way I like. I would recommend this product to those whose hair does not hold a curl well.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews about this product and I was anxious to try it out. I&#x27;ve used it once so far because the results didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it does straighten your hair, but I have thick coarse hair and I expected it to give me a silky non frizzy finish. I&#x27;m natural and I know women that I work with that are natural that use a less expensive flat iron and their hair looks permed when they finish. This product left my hair looking like that in between stage from a perm and natural it looked really unfinished and frizzy. Again I&#x27;ve only used it once but I plan to try it out again. I used it with heat protectant and the Brazilian flat iron spray, no bueno.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many other flat irons but this is the best one yet..after reading the reviews i decided to give it a try and im glad i did...</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this flat iron!  I was looking for a flat iron that would provide shine, luster, and defined straightness to my hair; and this flat iron does all of the above.  I was introduced to this flat iron by my hair stylist when she lightly ran through my hair and it was so straight.  She didn&#x27;t even use the highest temp.  From then, I was sold.  It&#x27;s a great price for a such an amazing tool.  The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because nothing is perfect ;).</li>
    <li> Flats hair much faster than the regular flat irons you buy at the retailer. Comes in a very slick package, with a very nice traveling bag.</li>
    <li> It is excellent. Deniz Rivas Plata (Stylist)</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t a good quality</li>
    <li> This iron is a good iron however be careful because I think you can burn your hair if your not.  I sometimes get a burnt smell even on the mid 300 heat range.  It is good for doing keratin treatments has it gets hot enough to seal the product into the hair and you can get close to the scalp without burning someone if you know what your doing.  Does not tug at my hair or pull out hair that I can tell.  You just have to use smaller sections when you are flat ironing your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought it so I could do a Brazilian blowout. It did the job. I&#x27;m not in love with it, but I worked. I have somewhat thick curly hair. My hair was straight, but I felt that it was a little frizzy. Hardly noticed the frizz, but it was there.</li>
