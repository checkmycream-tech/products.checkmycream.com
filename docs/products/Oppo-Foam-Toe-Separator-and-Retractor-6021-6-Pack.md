<li> This pack contained 3 pairs of separators, Large, Medium and Small.</li>
<li> They stay in place - but for me they need to be harder and wider.</li>
<li> Like it, but unfortunately it takes up extra space and I get swelling between my 2nd and 3rd toes</li>
<li> I had looked in local stores for this item and have been unable to find it for several months.</li>
<li> Too thick to be of use.  </li>

    <li> The separators hold up well and maintain their shape. However, it would be good to have more of the smallest size.</li>
    <li> Like it, but unfortunately it takes up extra space and I get swelling between my 2nd and 3rd toes, I know there is some issue there, so I&#x27;m trying to relieve pressure - I think I&#x27;ll just put a spacer in that area from now on. Helps with pressure points too.</li>
    <li> good product Recommended</li>
    <li> I had looked in local stores for this item and have been unable to find it for several months. Nice to find exactly what I needed on line! Received very promptly!</li>
    <li> These are wonderfull separators for toes that get pushed by bunion big toes.  Provider sent them on time.</li>
    <li> I like them. They are soft and comfortable! This is the kind my foot doctor gave me after my surgery. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Keep my toes from rubbing together.  They are comfortable and not necessary to trim.  Ordering is easy and fast.  Thank you for your excellent product!</li>
    <li> Very good and durable.</li>
    <li> Really like them. works for me . Would order again.</li>
    <li> Too thick to be of use.  I couldn&#x27;t tell from  description that this would be the case.  This may  be perfect for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> If you have a sore toe or have toes that are moving too close together (as in bunions) these little foam pads are great at taking the pressure off.  I now wear them all the time, even to sleep (under socks).  My podiatrist orginally gave me some samples and since they helped, I bought these.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> For me, they work very well and stay in place all day -- which some days can be @ 20 hours long.  Will definitely buy more when I need more.</li>
    <li> When I got these out of the box I thought they were pretty sturdy - until I put them in. They stay in place - but for me they need to be harder and wider. They don&#x27;t say on the box what size they are.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my 96 year old mother whose toes are very tender. This pack contained 3 pairs of separators, Large, Medium and Small. They were reasonably priced, compared to local brick and mortar drug stores, and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I am interested in re-ordering this product, but I need additional information.  I placed an order for 3 or 4 different packages of Foam toe separators.  I have tried them all and would like to re-order one of them but I can&#x27;t determine which was the only one that worked for me.  I believe it may have been the Oppo Foam ToeSeparator and Retractor Model 6021 6 pack.  But I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event I would like to purchase foam Toe Separators that are no thicker then 3/16&#x27;s of an inch. The larger ones would not work for me.  Can you tell me if the model No 6021 6 pack contained the ones that are no thicker then 3/16&#x27;s of an inch.  If so I would like to purchase 3 packages of them.
