      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I love the variety of colors as well.</li>
      <li>Also, looks cute if they want to take it out of their hair and keep in on their wrists.</li>
      <li>I came on Amazon to read some more reviews and found that everyone is using them as pony tail holders.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love them</li>
      <li>Some are slightly more stretchy than others.  </li>
      <li>.. love them</li>
      <li>I loved it right away.  </li>
      <li>These work wonderful for my long curly hair...</li>
      <li>After a week I found the ones that are most comfortable on my wrist and rolled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love how doesn&#x27;t strangle my hair but still holds securely.</li>
      <li>Good size and texture and reasonable patterns</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t get too stretched out which is amazing!!</li>
      <li>Loved them, would definitely buy more!</li>
      <li>it’s easy to keep track of which ones you have/have lost.</li>
      <li>The bands themselves are fine.</li>
      <li>These are the best, they don&#x27;t leave creases in my super fine hair that usually creases VERY easily.</li>
      <li>Some of them are too small for the amount of hair I have, but work good and colors are very nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: these are a fantastic product at a fantastic price.</li>
      <li>Since I used a gift card and they were cheap, I am not too bothered by it.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t bind or pull and they stay securely in place</li>
      <li>These are cute and colorful, but don&#x27;t buy them for the no crease factor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are great for all sorts of different style, ponies, braids, buns, you name it.  </li>
      <li>Love the colors and they are just the right size and just what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair so being able to comfortably wrap my hair band 3 times and have it stay secure is great.</li>
      <li>I got 2 each of ten colors and they are not the bright colors pictured.</li>
      <li>far as a hair tie, these work amazing well.</li>
      <li>only 5 were brightly colored as the picture would suggest.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got 2 each of ten colors and they are not the bright colors pictured, see attached pic for yourself.  </li>
      <li>It would be a good deal if they actually gave you all the colors in the picture.</li>
      <li>They still leave a crease but overall they are good</li>
      <li>They are cute and so much better for your hair than regular ties.</li>
      <li>At first I was a little worried about the many bright colors but in reality they are fun to wear, easy to find and because of the colors</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The colors shown are not what I received.  I got 2 each of ten colors and they are not the bright colors pictured, see attached pic for yourself.  The one I received are all ugly, boring colors.  I had ordered these hair ties previously, then they were shipped from South Carolina.  This time it took over six (6)! weeks to get those and they came from China.  Ridiculous, I am requesting a return.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, I would order again. I have never used this kind of band before. I have very long thick hair. It looks like they will stretch large enough to fit doubled in my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to use them today. I received a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> i love them!! they are  way cheaper than the ones they sell in stores and they work great i have had them for about 3 months now and i still find them  working good</li>
    <li> My girls love them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really great hair ties last you a long time, and do not crease your hair. But the first time you tie your hair the hair ties becomes smaller because of the first pull. So if you do get this product make sure you pull it first and then cut the extra material off.</li>
    <li> wished i got more for the price</li>
    <li> pretty cheap ties, not really what I thought they were, and they took a long time to arrive from China.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste time buying these uncomfortable ties that don&#x27;t work or you will regret it.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair ties! They don&#x27;t get too stretched out which is amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have bought these hair ties, and once I lose them all again, I will buy them again! They can wrap 3 times in my medium  to thick hair for a nice ponytail or bun that will hold! The loop length is consistent which I like. I&#x27;ve bought other knotted hair ties before, and some of them are huge and others are too tight to even put around your wrist. These ones are very consistent. They do leave a slight crease, but seriously, that is to be expected if you&#x27;re going to put a band around your hair. Its less of a crease than a store brand hair tie though. I loved the color variety. The hair ties start to stretch out after a lot of use, but I figure that just happens with elastic.</li>
    <li> Kids love the colors they got and I loved the price!</li>
    <li> These hairbands were great. Vibrantly colored, cheaper than competitors, etc. However (This is probably just me), they were a little tight fitting around my wrist, where I keep at least one hair band at any given moment, but they stretch out. When fitting around my normal ponytail, they were either too loose or too tight, if that makes any sense.</li>
    <li> all the colors are awesome. the quality of these hair ties are top notch! these ties are great for the price</li>
    <li> These were very well priced and look just as in the picture. They are cute and functional hair ties. They don&#x27;t hold the hair really tight, so if your looking for that you might stick to the traditional ties.</li>
    <li> These were amazing. I loved them. Unfortunately I already lost them all, but they were wonderful while they lasted. Will definitely be ordering 5 packs next time.</li>
    <li> I Love them. They work so good.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and love the way they hold my hair.  They don&#x27;t bind or pull and they stay securely in place and they look far classier than elastic bands.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating is because they are held together with a knot.  That&#x27;s not a terrible thing, but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to hide.  But I still love them!</li>
    <li> I ordered these almost a year ago and they never came in. There was no tracking option so I am unsure what happened to them. Since I used a gift card and they were cheap, I am not too bothered by it. Just curious as to what happened to them.</li>
    <li> Loved them, would definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> The hair ties hold their shape very well and do not stretch out.  The shipping process was also very efficient.</li>
    <li> A fair price for hair-ties that aren&#x27;t going to lose elasticity after a while, like some of the ones I&#x27;ve tried of this style.</li>
    <li> I bought these to workout in and not leave a crease in my hair. Well I found out AFTER ordering these that they DO leave a crease. If you dont care about the crease or not then go ahead and buy it, but it is definitely false advertisment.</li>
    <li> No crease? I beg to differ! These are cute and colorful, but don&#x27;t buy them for the no crease factor. These actually made me have the ponytail ring worse than ever! I do have very thick hair though, so maybe that&#x27;s why. But regular ponytail holders don&#x27;t give me the ring as much as these do.</li>
    <li> I love these rubberbands.  I want more of them.  When. I got these in the mail, I took my regular rubberband ouf of my hair and put this one in.  I loved it right away.  I leaned up againist the chair and I couldn&#x27;t feel it in my hair.  I always sleep with my hair in a ponytail and now I no longer feel the rubberband when I lay down.  These are great!  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Good ties with a great color selection. So much better on my hair than the rubber bands. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, I would order again. I have never used this kind of band before. I have very long thick hair. It looks like they will stretch large enough to fit doubled in my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to use them today. I received a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Love them! I have a 7 mo old with lots of hair and needed something to help keep it off her face, especially now that we have hit the hot summer months. She&#x27;s got the cutest lil &#x27;Pebbles&#x27; ponytail. And they work for me too!! Best baby accessory bought so far!</li>
    <li> As good as those sold in salons but these were a fraction of the cost.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are of a very low quality. They are too thin and cheaply made. Not worth the price...</li>
    <li> Every single one was a different color. I got a mix of bright colors, medium shades, and dark colors. 20 total. I have extremely thick hair, and I can wrap the hair tie around twice. Good for people with thick hair, and I would say thin hair as well. Not too tight on the wrists if you want to wear them on your wrists. Holds my hair up tightly. The shipping kind of took long, but I mean for the price and quality, good stuff.</li>
    <li> OK when I ordered these I read the description carefully. I was a bit skeptical because there were no photos of these on models, or someone who purchased them. I was looking for hair ties that would go around my HEAD...like a band.&lt;br /&gt;So when my package got here, I was really surprise and in fact thought to myself - &amp;#34;What did I order that is this tiny?&amp;#34;. They came in a very small 4x6 plastic zip bag and they didn&#x27;t even fill half the bag.&lt;br /&gt;When I took one out and pulled on it, it didn&#x27;t stretch enough for me to put on my head, for sure. I came on Amazon to read some more reviews and found that everyone is using them as pony tail holders.&lt;br /&gt;As far the the &amp;#34;crease less&amp;#34; claim that is made to these ties - NO WAY!! I put my hair in a ponytail for 1 hour and took it out - and my hair stayed exactly as it was in the ponytail. It not only left deep creases in my hair, but my hair didn&#x27;t move!! I&#x27;ve NEVER had that happen before with any of my other pony holders.&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair is extremely long, super thick, and curly. I just happened to straighten it yesterday so it&#x27;s nowhere as thick as if I had left it curly. My hair is down to my waist, so the weight might have something to do with it, I&#x27;m not sure. But when you state something is &amp;#34;Crease Less&amp;#34; - that should mean to all hair types. This is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy them again? Maybe - they are really pretty colors, are very easy to put on, and my hair did not snag much when taking it out and there was only a few strands of hair in it as compared to the many left in other holders I use.&lt;br /&gt;So, I might purchase more. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how long these last before I make that decision for sure.</li>
    <li> These hair ties arrived exactly as pictured and on time. They hold your hair a bit looser than traditional ties, which is why I feel they don&#x27;t dent and break your hair as much, but they are just as effective. I found myself searching for these ones amongst my many other traditional ties so I decided to order a second set from Just Knotted b/c they were reliable and prompt the first time around.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I love these with the heat of a 1000 suns. At first I was a little worried about the many bright colors but in reality they are fun to wear, easy to find and because of the colors it’s easy to keep track of which ones you have/have lost.</li>
    <li> These are the best, they don&#x27;t leave creases in my super fine hair that usually creases VERY easily. I love the variety of colors as well.</li>
    <li> Was not what I thought they were.  Daughter still uses them.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The picture shows such a wide variety of colors and black alike.  The site does say these may not be the exact ones, but I was not happy with the color choices that were provided.</li>
    <li> I like these! But I have long, fine hair and they can get stuck from time to time so I need to be careful. However I love the fact you can add a bit of color to your style with just a hair tie. They look so pretty and they are made very well.</li>
    <li> These are great and exactly the same as the expensive ones you find in the boutiques!  great, great value</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t my favorite because I can&#x27;t seem to get it tight on my head. But overall, they do the job. Not so great for running/yoga/activity,</li>
    <li> hold up well, good price. Still leave a crease, but I wasn&#x27;t fooled into thinking they were really crease-less. I have very thin hair and they work well.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this from pepper lonely LLC.  Be warned, they do NOT send the colors seen in the above pictures.  Those colors are fresh and timely, the colors they sent were from the &#x27;90 s very dated: peach, forest green, maroon, light blue, etc.  they are also shiny, not what I expected or wanted.  Returned it right away, and I am not usually a returner...</li>
    <li> They are constantly slipping our of my hair.  I&#x27;m giving these away to my nieces ASAP.</li>
    <li> The colors are not as vibrant or the same as shown here.</li>
    <li> Did not receive product unfortunately. Reordered and I love them.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors that came in this pack (yes all the ones shown in the pic) as well as the quality of the knots (not slipping out) and their elasticity seems to be holding up well too. I have thick hair so being able to comfortably wrap my hair band 3 times and have it stay secure is great. There is a seam in the middle of each band that tends to fold onto itself, but takes 1/2 a second to open up and stay laying flat again. The ends of the knots are sealed up so no fraying on the ends either. A lot of comment on a hair tie, but they are awesome so far</li>
    <li> They hold my daughters hair which is fine and hard to hold.  And they are great colors.  Also, looks cute if they want to take it out of their hair and keep in on their wrists.</li>
    <li> 20 ties for a low price and assortment of colors!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and curly and although these bands did not break, they were no where near wide or stretchy enough for ponytails or buns. Additionally the colors in the picture were NOT the colors I received. The picture shows a nice rainbow, and I was looking forward to getting the greens and blues, but I didn&#x27;t get any. I received 3 yellows, 2 grays, and 2 black in one pack, so that was disappointing. It would be a good deal if they actually gave you all the colors in the picture.</li>
    <li> These are cute, durable, and soft. Great value for the product. They sell elsewhere for double and triple the price.</li>
    <li> I guess not everyone gets the colors shown in the picture.  I received all sorts of muted unflattering pale colors like burgundy, bad greens and yellows, etc.  They are of cheap quality, reminding me of a glorified control-top pantyhose material that would definitely stretch out very quickly.  I promptly returned them and will continue my search for the perfect ponytail holders.</li>
    <li> THE COLORS ARE NOT THE ONES SHOWN - I received an assortment of mostly drab colors - not the pretty assortment shown - very unhappy - no neon yellow or neon green or orange - instead tan, grey blue and baby blue</li>
    <li> These are my favorite and great! Stretch out over time but still usable</li>
    <li> I was expecting an array of colors like the ones in the picture however, I received several that were doubled and some colors in the picture not included.  They should specify that they colors may be random and even duplicated.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are just right. Love the colors and they are just the right size and just what I was looking for. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These work really well! I am ordering some for my nieces!</li>
    <li> The colors are not as shown in the photo.  They are just boring and old fashioned. So I returned the package.</li>
    <li> These hair ties do leave crease&#x27;s in your hair. Ad was not truthful.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware! The colors shown are not what you receive. I got 2 each of ten colors and they are not the bright colors pictured. In small print the seller says colors may vary. I thought that meant they may not be exactly as shown as sometimes internet photo colors are not accurate, but this photo is quite a deception.</li>
    <li> Was sent the best variety of colors it was like she read my mind.  Love how doesn&#x27;t strangle my hair but still holds securely.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these.  Very easy to use and a big variety of colors.  I haven&#x27;t had one break or stretch out yet!</li>
    <li> These are at a steal of a price!  I purchased this and have found them to be right on par with the ones I can buy at target for 3x the price.  I have discovered some colors will hold my hair differently.  Some are slightly more stretchy than others.  (They are all still comfortable, but there is one color, mustard, that I can&#x27;t use during my work out without it sagging a little bit) After a week I found the ones that are most comfortable on my wrist and rolled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for all sorts of different style, ponies, braids, buns, you name it.  I find myself less likely to get these stuck in a knot top than the ouchless kind.  There is a slight amount of fraying that happens after a couple months, but unless someone is inspecting my hair tie no one would even notice.  I have baby fine hair and these will hold my hair (as long as it&#x27;s tight) and will slide out easy-peazy when pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these are a fantastic product at a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> Love these little ties. They are cute and so much better for your hair than regular ties. I will by more when needed.</li>
    <li> The colors weren&#x27;t as pretty as pictured. I know it says the colors may very from the photo but I got five black ones and a couple nude-pink colored ones. only 5 were brightly colored as the picture would suggest.&lt;br /&gt;As far as a hair tie, these work amazing well.</li>
    <li> They still leave a crease but overall they are good</li>
    <li> Love these. I have thin hair and it creases and breaks so easily.  I think my hair will always crease, but these help with it breaking off as much.</li>
    <li> I like the colors in this assortment. Know that they are slightly long so you will need to pull the knot tight and snip off the ends. Great for workouts.</li>
    <li> I returned these immediately. They have absolutely no give to them whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I got these hair ties for my sisters for Christmas and she was ELATED! I also kept a few for myself; they are a great generic fit and don&#x27;t dull like some others I have bought and made in the past.</li>
    <li> these work soo nice keep you hair in place and dont pull any hair out when removed.. love them</li>
    <li> These are so easy to work with and can be used to create many different hair styles.  And they don&#x27;t leave you with a headache.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors and good quality. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I received multiple bands of several colors, and did not receive many of the colors pictured. The bands themselves are fine. If you don&#x27;t care about the color this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Like the variety of colors</li>
    <li> These work wonderful for my long curly hair...They also fit my wrist in case I need to pull my hair back while I&#x27;m on the go...</li>
    <li> These hair ties have superlative qualities.  They honestly hold the hair tight, do not break off strands, and do not give one headaches.  My hair is longer and thicker than it has been in some time due to lack of splitting.  The band is even cuter than a pony tail holder on your wrist acting as stand bye.  This seems a whole lot like exaggeration, but I assure you this a truly great product.</li>
    <li> All the colors are exactly as pictured. I have fine hair but a lot of it ad it holds my hair perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave a crease/bump in it when I take it out. Would defiantly recommend picking these up.</li>
    <li> Thought they were going to be more like headbands so didn&#x27;t serve the original purpose :( but great hair ties!</li>
    <li> Great hairties and I love the assorted colors that are avaliable. They are exactly what I thought I was getting</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these hair ties. The colors definitely weren&#x27;t the colors in the picture but they inform you of that in the notes.</li>
    <li> I love these! So happy and the price couldn&#x27;t be better! Yoga studios sell for like $10, for three of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!</li>
    <li> Some of them are too small for the amount of hair I have, but work good and colors are very nice.</li>
    <li> the colors are not the same as the picture</li>
    <li> Stretched out after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Terrible rubber smell that made my hair smell like moth balls. But, the colors are pretty and the hair elastics were durable.</li>
    <li> They arrived early and they are exactly what I wanted! I&#x27;m in volley ball and they hold tight through the whole day, they do leave a slight crease, but it&#x27;s barely noticable! Love them</li>
    <li> Colors are a bit off but overall they do the trick! Great price!</li>
    <li> These were so tight. I ordered the pack of them because I like the knotted hair ties, but they are just too tight. I could get them around two times and then they would fall out but if I did it three times then it felt like my scalp was being pulled. My hair is pretty thin, so maybe if you had thicker hair and only needed it to go around twice it would work, but I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of them.</li>
    <li> This are great for thick, curly manes!</li>
    <li> These are only good for small pony tails. I thought I was getting head bands. These will be getting returned.</li>
    <li> great quality.  just as expected!</li>
    <li> Good size and texture and reasonable patterns</li>
    <li> not all of the colors posted in the picture was given to me.</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself and hoped they would keep my long hair back. I have very thick hair that I like to be pulled tightly so that none of the hair can come out of the tie. These elastics would have been perfect if they wouldn&#x27;t loosening themselves. They aren&#x27;t tied tight at all and loosen to create it so that they&#x27;re a little too big and don&#x27;t work properly.</li>
