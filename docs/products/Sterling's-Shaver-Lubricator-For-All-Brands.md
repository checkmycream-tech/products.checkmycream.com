      <li>The mild citrus smell makes shaving more pleasant.</li>
      <li>Translation: I&#x27;ll be buying more.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it works.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for years and this time it lubricated and made my electric shave better as it always has.</li>
      <li>My father got me using this product many years ago.  </li>
      <li>but I like Phillips better.</li>
      <li>This is an outstanding product for electric shavers.</li>
      <li>It is okay</li>
      <li>Great product - makes the shave much smoother.</li>
      <li>I use a light odorless pre- shave and between the two, my shaver glides really smoothly across my face; to be honest, I don&#x27;t know which product to credit more</li>

      <li>I have used Serling for many years and keep coming back for more.  </li>

      <li>It smells nice and does not come off on your face if you use it prior to shaving.</li>
      <li>It gives me a very smooth shave and is much better than the powder products I have used in the past.  </li>
      <li>The oil works very well, keeping my shaver running fast and smooth and as an added bonus the spray has a very pleasing odor.  </li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by a razor repair service to prolong the life of my razors &amp; it certainly lives up to its reputation.</li>
      <li>Price on Amazon is competitive but only if free shipping is provided.</li>
      <li>This reasonably priced product does everything it says.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>Simple and quick to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always highly reluctant to use a brush on a shavers&#x27; moving bits.</li>
      <li>Wish it had a little more pleasing scent.</li>
      <li>I use a Braun shaver, rather old but working very well.</li>
      <li>One of the things it&#x27;s supposed to do is speed up the rpms on your shaver, but that&#x27;s not going to happen when your shaver is brand new like mine and operating at 100%.  </li>
      <li>Next to that Sterling&#x27;s is a clear winner--light, fragrant and feels oil-free.</li>
      <li>One can&#x27;t go wrong with this product if you want a fast and clean shave that does not sting afterwards.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s benefits are largely long-term and can&#x27;t be measured by a few weeks&#x27; use.</li>

<li> A product like this is difficult to review, quite frankly, because you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing.</li>
<li> This product is very difficult to find at retail stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great lubricator for my electric shaver. I use it after shaving and cleaning the razor EVERY night. Seems to make the razor run better and makes it smell nice too. I would highly recommend this product, I wish it was more readily available.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest preshave product.  It gives me a very smooth shave and is much better than the powder products I have used in the past.  I have had difficulty finding the product locally and ordering on line has been convenient.</li>
    <li> The oil works very well, keeping my shaver running fast and smooth and as an added bonus the spray has a very pleasing odor.  Easy to use and lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I use a Braun shaver, rather old but working very well. I used before other cleaning shaver sprays. Sterling seems to be better in that the cutting blades do not heat up and shave closer that without it. The mild citrus smell makes shaving more pleasant.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does seem to make the shave a little closer.  I use a variety of things like liquid pre-shaves, powder sticks and now this.  This is the quickest of the three to use.  Wish it had a little more pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> Anyone who uses an electric razor must buy this product.  It is that good.  It will transform your shaver into a superior product and enable much closer shaves.  As soon as you spray the blades, you can hear the difference as the blades start spinning faster. Try one can - use daily before each shave - and you will never shave again without it.</li>
    <li> A product like this is difficult to review, quite frankly, because you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing. It&#x27;s benefits are largely long-term and can&#x27;t be measured by a few weeks&#x27; use. One of the things it&#x27;s supposed to do is speed up the rpms on your shaver, but that&#x27;s not going to happen when your shaver is brand new like mine and operating at 100%.  Lubricating the blades well is something you have to accept on faith to see the long-term effects as well, but here you can detect a slight improvement in drag while you&#x27;re shaving. Plus, the citrus smell is delightful. But, make no mistake, this product is not a pre- shave. You spray it on your razor and let it do its work on the inside of the head, not on your face. I use a light odorless pre- shave and between the two, my shaver glides really smoothly across my face; to be honest, I don&#x27;t know which product to credit more but I&#x27;m pretty sure the Sterling&#x27;s, which I began using later, improved the smoothness to a worthwhile degree. Translation: I&#x27;ll be buying more.  Prior to being introduced to Sterling&#x27;s, I was using a silicon-based product that felt like putting WD-40 on my shaver head. Next to that Sterling&#x27;s is a clear winner--light, fragrant and feels oil-free.</li>
    <li> This reasonably priced product does everything it says. My shaver runs cooler and faster. Great citrus scent too. I still use a facial pre-shave lotion on my skin...this is primarily for the shaver itself. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Been using it fro years. Great product - makes the shave much smoother.</li>
    <li> It is okay but I like Phillips better.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product for electric shavers. Simple and quick to use. Great smell, I used to use a silicon spray but it left an after aroma on face. This product is very difficult to find at retail stores. Price on Amazon is competitive but only if free shipping is provided. I have found it at electric shaver or appliance repair stores at $6.00. One can&#x27;t go wrong with this product if you want a fast and clean shave that does not sting afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have been using this electric shaver lubricator for years. It works great on extending the life of your razor and helping you get a smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always highly reluctant to use a brush on a shavers&#x27; moving bits. Might dislodge &#x27;em?...&#x27;ave &#x27;em fall into my lap? S-o-o-o, this stuff, which works masterfully(to clean &amp; lube), is highly prized , as is its&#x27; pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. It is the best lubricatorI have found. It smells nice and does not come off on your face if you use it prior to shaving.</li>
    <li> There is not much to say about this product.  I have been using it for years and this time it lubricated and made my electric shave better as it always has.</li>
    <li> My father got me using this product many years ago.  I love the way it works.  I also enjoy the smell.  I would recommend this for those electric shaver users.</li>
    <li> I have used Serling for many years and keep coming back for more.  It is a great lubricant which prolongs the life of the electric shaver head by reducing friction.  It is good for the face too.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep your razor in fine working order longer. Won&#x27;t use anything else! It keeps the razor heads from dragging across your skin &amp; has a pleasant lemony scent. It was recommended to me by a razor repair service to prolong the life of my razors &amp; it certainly lives up to its reputation.</li>
    <li> Extends the life of the cutter and foil.  Extends the life of the blades on the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;You know it is working when you start up your device, squirt on some Sterlings and hear the RPMs increase.  My entire family has been using this product for over 20 years.</li>
