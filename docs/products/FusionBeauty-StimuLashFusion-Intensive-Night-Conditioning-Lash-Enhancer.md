      <li>Anyway, this got great reviews</li>
      <li>I must admit my lashes looked great</li>
      <li>A year ago I purchased Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer from Sephora and it worked great -</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and won&#x27;t miss this product any more.</li>
      <li>The condition is called blepharitis and it&#x27;s not at all pleasant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m skittish to return to using it.</li>
      <li>Love Love StimuLash!!</li>
      <li>I would say it takes about a month to start seeing results and for me, it added about 50% more length from what I started off with!</li>
      <li>love this product!</li>
      <li>Amazing, Amazing, Amazing.  </li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the results.</li>
      <li>It took about 6 weeks to see any results but after that I was so thrilled with the product.</li>
      <li>Saw great results right away.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t cause any problems at all and after 4 to 5 weeks&#x27; treatment the lashes doubled - I fell I have twice as many as before</li>
      <li>All the others offering this product want 10-12 dollars more for a tube.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>Works MUCH better than I could even expect it.</li>
      <li>The fat in my eyelids and under my eyes has shrunk, making my eyelid creases deeper and more like</li>
      <li>Love Love Love it.</li>
      <li>Love it:-)</li>
      <li>So many of my family members and friends said &amp;#34;wow</li>
      <li>For 80 dollars, surely this should be sealed?</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m searching for a better product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I could get this stuff</li>
      <li>get it in store, to know its not fake!!!</li>
      <li>However, when I went to the eye doctor today, he said it&#x27;s not at all uncommon for this kind of inflammation to show up around this time when using an eyelash enhancer product such as this one.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line, when I&#x27;m consistent with it, I can see great results and to me this is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Not a bad problem to have!</li>
      <li>its easily covered up.  </li>
      <li>When I first started using this product, I was really happy with the results - gorgeous long lashes.</li>
      <li>price and quick delivery :)</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
      <li>If you want cheap, then just use water.</li>
      <li>I know some people have experienced various issues; but I can&#x27;t report any.</li>
      <li>It really works !!!</li>
      <li>it really, really works!!!  </li>
      <li>and I did not have significant growth when compared to Latishe or Revialash</li>
      <li>I am excited to use the product, but I am always nervous when the package has been opened.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m trying to be more consistent with it</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m not as consistent with applying it, I can tell that my lashes get shorter and more sparse.</li>
      <li>I originally got from another site.  </li>
      <li>How am I meant to know that this product is original and full?</li>
      <li>Will look into getting eyelash extensions for special events, since mascara is still problem for me.</li>
      <li>I returned the supply I bought through Amazom.com and received a full refund according to Amazon.com&#x27;s policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this product is truly amazing ( as do my many friends who have noticed and commented on how long my eyelashes have become !!! ).</li>
      <li>At my first try it was absolutely great: my lashes grew so long, they touched my sunglasses.</li>
      <li>Its easy to use, not irritating in any way, and my lashes are longer and thicker.</li>
      <li>After using it a short while, again many of my lashes and brows have fallen out!</li>
      <li>I used it faithfully every night and in about 6 weeks I saw some real results!!</li>
      <li>So far I have had no irritation or darkening of my eyes, just longer lashes &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>But &#x27;s worth it compared to things like Latisse...</li>
      <li>Recently, I saw Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer was again available on Amazon and bought more of it.</li>
      <li>I still love Fusion Beauty, however I feel like this was an old product</li>
      <li>My boss just asked me last week if my lashes were all natural and I could happily say yes.</li>
      <li>But, it might be worth it because I can never wear mascara and this stuff makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing mascara.</li>
      <li>They also rarely fell out.</li>
      <li>I bought this product after seeing how amazing and long  my friend&#x27;s lashes had become as a result of using it.</li>
      <li>It was a slow process, but after 8 weeks my lashes are beautiful.</li>
      <li>So the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t do proper research before I started, which I regret, but the excitement for beautiful long lashes and all these positive reviews took over.</li>
      <li>It starts working the first night I used it.</li>
      <li>I ordered ( I kept the first packaging and tube, and compered ingredients).</li>
      <li>This product really works!  </li>
      <li>My first tube lasted almost a year.</li>
      <li>Since the original plastic wrapping has been removed from around the package, I don&#x27;t know if the product has been tampered with, if the container is full or partially used or even if it contains the original product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and have been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will have people asking you about your lashes, so be ready!</li>
      <li>I only give it a 4 because i wish we got more product for our buck.</li>
      <li>I encourage you to research prostaglandin first before you buy and make an educated decision for yourself.</li>
      <li>And it really works!</li>
      <li>This is because it depletes the fat around your eye area and causes a deep wrinkling on the top eyelids.</li>
      <li>After using it a short time - to my horror - many of my eyelashes and eyebrow hairs fell out.</li>
      <li>Read all reviews and also seen many friends with positive results; not to mention long lushes lashes.  </li>
      <li>I was kind of hoping for the dark staining on the lash line that I had heard mentioned by some others, but it never happened.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past and I thought this would be a good substitute</li>
      <li>It remains to be seen if regrowth becomes as full as my original lashes and brows and it takes a long time.</li>
      <li>It remains to be seen if regrowth becomes as full as my original lashes and brows and it takes a long time.</li>
      <li>This product worked even better for my daughter - her lashes are incredibly long!</li>
      <li>However, I found it to be less effective the longer</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy this product again.  </li>
      <li>It makes your lashes grow and it&#x27;s really easy and safe to use ( or at least i have not had any side affects).</li>
      <li>My eyes have filled out and the deep crease below my eyebrows is no longer there.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and have not had any problems.  I know some people have experienced various issues; but I can&#x27;t report any.</li>
    <li> Not only does StimulashFusion markedly increase lash length, it also makes them darker.  I also applied it to one brow to increase fullness....and it increased noticable hair growth. I LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this actually worked. When I use it nightly, I can usually notice longer, fuller lashes within 2 weeks. When I&#x27;m not as consistent with applying it, I can tell that my lashes get shorter and more sparse. So I&#x27;m trying to be more consistent with it, I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing longer lashes again.  I have fairly sensitive eyes and I wear contacts frequently, so I was worried about this product irritating them. I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all. However, I notice a very slight, barely noticeable purple line that appears where I apply it at my lash line when I use it often. This doesn&#x27;t bother me, as I usually line my upper lash line with black/brown eyeliner anyway, and the faint purple line goes away if I stop using it so it&#x27;s not permanent.   Bottom line, when I&#x27;m consistent with it, I can see great results and to me this is well worth the price. It lasts quite a while, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. I have used it for several (five?) months and it works. I originally had purchased this to help my poor over-plucked eyebrows grow back in. They did. Then I figured I might as well give it a go for my eyelashes to see what happened. They are so long now. Ridiculously so. I had fairly long ones to begin with but now they&#x27;ve reached the point where people are asking if they are real and then not believing me when I say they are. If I had to give an estimate of the added length, I&#x27;d say about a half-inch. Seriously. My lashes (and brows) are also darker and a little denser. This is an bonus, since I am a redhead and had light red lashes. They still have no curl to them, but I&#x27;ll take what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of annoying, but not unbearable or permanent, side-effects. It sometimes itched very mildly, and I have noticed a slight darkening of my skin right along my lash line. As a side note, my skin is on the sensitive side, and I had no problems with this. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Expensive, but it actually works.</li>
    <li> It took at least a month before I noticed anything, and now three months later, I look like I have false eyelashes on. I did get some irritation of my lids and darkening. But, it might be worth it because I can never wear mascara and this stuff makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing mascara. There are occasional lashes that are stick straight and grow at a weird angle, but for the most part, they&#x27;ve grown in with a slight curl, which is great because my natural lashes are stick straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I backed off to every other day because of the eyelid darkening, and my lashes did get less long and thick. I&#x27;m going back to every night though. I miss my uber long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely an awesome product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 6 months later.&lt;br /&gt;So...I figured out (duh) that his contains the same active ingredient, more or less, as Latisse. It&#x27;s a prostaglandin or something. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been getting all the side effects--irritated eyelids, ezcema in the inner corners of my eyes, darkening of my eyelids above and below (I look tired and underslept all the time now) and the worst? The fat in my eyelids and under my eyes has shrunk, making my eyelid creases deeper and more like an old lady&#x27;s. It&#x27;s like I have these skeleton hollows under my eyebrows.  It&#x27;s aging my eyes. So I&#x27;m quitting. The long lashes were awesome, but not worth all this other junk. Plus, who wants to be putting this stuff on every, single night for the rest of their lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, off Lashfusion for one month:&lt;br /&gt;Well, I think I&#x27;ve recovered from the side effects. The dark circles and reddish coloring at the base of my lashes is gone. My eyes have filled out and the deep crease below my eyebrows is no longer there. My eyes look young again. Thank god! I was afraid it was going to be permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are little shorter, but not back to baseline. I&#x27;m just glad I could get this stuff our of my system. Will look into getting eyelash extensions for special events, since mascara is still problem for me.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product anywhere else in Las Vegas.  Found it on-line and for less money.  Not sure why Sephora or Ulta stopped stocking this item but I love it.</li>
    <li> It takes a few weeks of faithful application, however I am now looking for mascara that doesn&#x27;t bulk up and lengthen my lashes.  They look so long and full, &amp;#34;guilding the lily&amp;#34; would make them look fake.  I use a very conservative brown mascara.  Even so, my lashes reach almost to my eyebrows.  I have cut back on the nightly use and only use three or four nights per week.  I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, however the little tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I think this product is truly amazing ( as do my many friends who have noticed and commented on how long my eyelashes have become !!! ). I have recommended it to all who have asked me about the length of my lashes .</li>
    <li> Love Love StimuLash!! Saw great results right away.Gentle on the eyes , and lots of comments of &amp;#34;are those your real lashes?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am excited to use the product, but I am always nervous when the package has been opened.</li>
    <li> This is the sixth time I buy this product. It&#x27;s great!  And it really works! Your lashes will be longer in just 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Carla- Norway</li>
    <li> Mye bedre enn den norske. Nå fikk jeg virkelig lange vipper!</li>
    <li> It starts working the first night I used it. I have loved this product and used it for the last 2 years and it has never let me down!</li>
    <li> It has to be the best product in the world! THis is the second time I purcahse this. After 6 weeks mye lashes were doble so long and they even curl! Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Good price and quick delivery :)</li>
    <li> [ASIN:B002F34UQ0 FusionBeauty StimuLashFusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer] A year ago I purchased Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer from Sephora and it worked great - my eyelashes and eyebrows grew thick and long as never before. It was expensive though, so after about six months using it, I tried another lash enhancing product that was less expensive but less satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went back to Sephora last winter, they no longer sold Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer. I then purchased it on Amazon.com. After using it a short time - to my horror - many of my eyelashes and eyebrow hairs fell out. This never happened to me before in my life. I thought it may have been a \\&quot;bad batch\\&quot; and threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer was sold out and not available on all website I found. I had no choice but to try another lash product. This was also less satisfactory - after several months my lashes and brows grew back somewhat, but not as thick and long as originally before first using Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Recently, I saw Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer was again available on Amazon and bought more of it. After using it a short while, again many of my lashes and brows have fallen out! I returned the supply I bought through Amazom.com and received a full refund according to Amazon.com&#x27;s policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If FusionBeauty changed the formula for this product from a year ago when Sephora sold it, consumers should be informed. If the problem I am experiencing is due to an interaction with the other lash products I used, then there should be a warning about that in the Stimulashfusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer packaging, which there is not. The packaging comes in an open box, so there is no way to know if the product is actually new or may have been contaminated. A sealed plastic wrap should be added. Also, there is no expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am seriously concerned about this damage to my lashes and brows. It remains to be seen if regrowth becomes as full as my original lashes and brows and it takes a long time. FusionBeauty customer service has not responded to my inquiry about any known or likely cause, outcome and remedy.n contaminated. A sealed plastic wrap should be added.

    <li> Love Love Love it. Works MUCH better than I could even expect it. Tried other brands, result is not even close.</li>
    <li> I have never had very long lashes and had pretty much just accepted the fact that I was not blessed in this area. I bought this product without much hope that it would work, but I decided to give it a try. It was a slow process, but after 8 weeks my lashes are beautiful. Friends ask me if I am wearing false eyelashes! I am thrilled with the results. It&#x27;s expensive, but you use such a tiny amount that the product lasts a very long time. It does make my eyelids itch a little bit when I put it on, but I do it right before falling asleep, so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. If you can afford it, I truly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately 2.5 years.  It has made my eyelashes much longer and thicker.  My doctor thought I was using Latisse.  W/ this product there is no prescription and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the possibility of my irises turning brown.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it.  And the pricing is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 2 months into using this product and yes I did get some longer lashes but this product does have some harsh side effects. The Prostagladin hormone in this product, which is the active ingredient that causes the lashes to grow, has caused my eyes to look sunken and wrinkled. This is because it depletes the fat around your eye area and causes a deep wrinkling on the top eyelids. It&#x27;s a common side effect for people who use Prostagladin for glucoma treatments. It took about 6 weeks to notice this effect on me but I now see it and my eyes look droopy and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;A second side effect for me was increased acne breakouts and the number of pimples I was getting from breakouts increased a lot from having the prostaglandin hormone in my system. I am stopping immediately. They talk about how all the other ingredients are so beneficial for you, like conditioning the lashes and adding vitamins to your eyelashes, sure these fillers are great, but the actual ingredient that grow your lashes is the prostaglandin and it has very harsh side effects that need to be considered and respected.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect the product marketers to tell you about the negative side effects, it is in our hands to research ourselves because money comes before health with the cosmetic industry. I didn&#x27;t do proper research before I started, which I regret, but the excitement for beautiful long lashes and all these positive reviews took over. Lesson learned. I encourage you to research prostaglandin first before you buy and make an educated decision for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using my husband&#x27;s account to write this review. I ordered this product twice for myself. In between I used Lattisse. At my first try it was absolutely great: my lashes grew so long, they touched my sunglasses. I looked like I wore mascara. They also rarely fell out. The reason I tried Lattisse was that with StimuLashFusion I did develop red eye lids, so I hoped Lattisse would eliminate this. It helped with the redness, but my lashes thinned out and started to fall out. Since it was so expensive, I finished the bottle and ordered my second bottle of the Stimulash. This time it was very disappointing. My lids are red again and the lashes are half of what I had comparing to using the product first time around, hence my rating. I&#x27;m searching for a better product. So far I didn&#x27;t find anything worth trying. I&#x27;m really reluctant to order the third bottle. 50/50 is not a good record. I did read that this brand is often falsified, so I wonder if and how Amazon checks the authenticity. As other reviewers said, the tube is not sealed, nor is the packaging when it comes... All looked the same twice I ordered ( I kept the first packaging and tube, and compered ingredients). I will keep reading and searching. Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> This product really works!  My lashes have never been longer and healthier.  I never have to wear false eyelashes and don&#x27;t need to consider extensions.  Give it a couple of months to start working and you will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I never believe reviews, because I just feel like someone from the company or something writes them. Anyway, this got great reviews and I have tiny eyelashes so I was kinda desperate to try something. Bought it, and after a few months of use, my eyelashes were SO LONG! So many of my family members and friends said &amp;#34;wow you have such long eyelashes I never realised&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;are you wearing fake eyelashes&amp;#34;. Even though my sister who lives with me knows I use this, she still occassionally asks &amp;#34;are you wearing fake eyelashes?&amp;#34;!!! However, its been about 5 months use and I seem to be getting immune to it. My eyelashes arent as long as they were a month or two ago.</li>
    <li> Works and supposedly has the best ingredients</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing how amazing and long  my friend&#x27;s lashes had become as a result of using it. I used it for two and a half weeks and thankfully was able to get my full money back today due to the severe inflammation it caused in my eyelids.  My eyes started getting red and it hurt to blink or move. There was no obvious reaction on my skin so I didn&#x27;t think this product was causing the problem I was having. However, when I went to the eye doctor today, he said it&#x27;s not at all uncommon for this kind of inflammation to show up around this time when using an eyelash enhancer product such as this one.  The condition is called blepharitis and it&#x27;s not at all pleasant. I can&#x27;t wear my contacts or makeup until it&#x27;s resolved. Wish they were much clearer on the warning re: what can go wrong and what to look for to suggest medical attention is warranted. Never again!!</li>
    <li> Worked for me. Made my lashes very long...</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I had to say something about this awesome product! I started applying it two months ago every single night. I did not experience any irritation or redness, even though I have sensitive skin. After about six weeks, I suddenly noticed my eyelashes were longer. I had tried lash extensions in the past and loved how long they made my lashes look. After they fell out, I was left with stubby, short lashes. So not attractive! This product has made my lashes grow past the normal length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have people asking you about your lashes, so be ready! I have also had to look for a mascara that ISN&#x27;T lengthening and thickening because they look too dramatic now! Not a bad problem to have! I will continue to use this until they either stop making it or I am broke!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works! Everybody comments on my eyelashes. The only problem is that they are so long they hit my glasses. I only use it every couple of days and that helps. It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes darker but crazy long!</li>
    <li> This product gave me blepharitis! Don&#x27;t get it. In case it wasn&#x27;t the cause, I gave it a second chance, and it happened again. My opthalmologist said do not use it. I tried to return it, but the company will not refund my money! They said it needs to be unopened, but of course you wouldn&#x27;t know that it hurts your eyes unless you opened it! I&#x27;m so disappointed, since it was an expensive product. And I will warn people I know not to buy from this company!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product from this seller because it was nearly 10 dollars cheaper than Sephora and some other beauty shops. I am still in the process of using the product (you have to give it a few weeks) but when I received the item, it was open. It was in the packaging, but this wasn&#x27;t properly sealed and neither was the actual Lash Enhancer. For 80 dollars, surely this should be sealed? How am I meant to know that this product is original and full? You cannot see how much is in it, and it doesn&#x27;t come out when you turn it upside down... it could be empty, there is no way to know.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my lashes were thinning last winter. The cold winters here in Chicago probably contributed to their decline. I found this stuff and it definitely works! My boss just asked me last week if my lashes were all natural and I could happily say yes. I&#x27;m ecstatic and will keep buying!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing.  it looks like i have false eyelashes!!!  it really, really works!!!  you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! This is the only lash enhancer I have tried that actually works. So far I have had no irritation or darkening of my eyes, just longer lashes &#x3D;] I would say it takes about a month to start seeing results and for me, it added about 50% more length from what I started off with!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Don&#x27;t stop using it!! You&#x27;ll see the results in two months but you really need to be constant and applying it each night before to go to the bed, so don&#x27;t give up and you&#x27;ll see the results!!</li>
    <li> It made my eyes itchy and pink and I did not have significant growth when compared to Latishe or Revialash</li>
    <li> It def works,but I did get severe irritation in one eye after starting.I&#x27;m skittish to return to using it.</li>
    <li> love this product! please do not ever ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands, but nothing showed any results except this one. The cheaper brands don&#x27;t work at all, and I can&#x27;t afford the other ones. This makes a difference in just a week or two. Along with a lash builder and a couple of coats of mascara when I really want to impress, people constantly comment about how long my lashes are. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 18 months and my lashes are longer and much fuller....it works!  No eye irritation (I wear contacts) but  once you start using, you need to keep using. I saw results in about 70 days...not instant long, lush lashes.</li>
    <li> I still love Fusion Beauty, however I feel like this was an old product and I&#x27;m not getting results I had hoped for. I think it might the supplier and not the product, possibly expired?</li>
    <li> I originally got from another site.  They stopped carrying it so bought it from here.  You have to use every day as directed.  It will seem like nothing is happening and then after a few weeks all the sudden you really start seeing results.  The only complaint I have is that it does irritate my eyes.  They are blood shot in the morning.  I think I am going to try and apply it earlier in the evening to see if that helps instead of right before I lay down at night.</li>
    <li> It has been 4 weeks and my lashes are fuller.  I also seems to be working on my eyebrows.  I can see new little hairs sprouting.  I agree that it is irritating around the eyes and have gone to every other day use, but plan on continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> After using this for about 5-6 weeks straight my lashes are noticeably longer. People ask me is they are fake or if I had extensions. The tube lasts for ages because you don&#x27;t need to use a lot for each application. I&#x27;m on my second tube. It works on eyebrow hair too so be careful where you slop it around! 4 friends and co-workers have bought this after seeing my results. I wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or discolor my skin or eyes. I wish I could afford to rub it on my scalp! I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> Product came as ordered and as expected.  Read all reviews and also seen many friends with positive results; not to mention long lushes lashes.  I have been using product for only a month and have seen longer lashes already.  NO darkening as of yet on lid.  I must admit I am not as faithful to remember to apply each night, but I use at least 4-5 times a week.  The hardest part is waiting for lashes to dry to apply after I wash my face each night.  No irritation but I am not sensitive to changes to my face either. Took before and after photos and will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and have been pleased with the results. The tube lasts for about 6-7 months and the lashes do get longer. Not fuller, but longer. The last tube I&#x27;ve purchased did absolutely nothing even though my routine did not change. Very disappointing experience.</li>
    <li> I have probably been using this product for about a year. It works, my lashes are longer. I have noticed that my eyes do get dry and tired faster, but I am not sure that isn&#x27;t just aging. After your lashes are longer you can probably use this every other night or even just a couple of times a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I can definately say that the products fulfills all of its claims. Its easy to use, not irritating in any way, and my lashes are longer and thicker. Those who don&#x27;t know me ask where did I get such natural looking extensions, and when I tell them that the lashes are mine are amazed. I have been and will continue to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using fusion stimulash for over a year now.  It took about 4 months for me to see results and my lashes are longer, thicker, and easier to curl.  This product worked even better for my daughter - her lashes are incredibly long!</li>
    <li> Be patient, as this product takes about 4 weeks to do its job, but then you will ave the long luscious lashes that it promises to deliver!</li>
    <li> Results showed very quickly and with limited effort.  I would certainly buy this product again.  It is relatively inexpensive compared to other similar lash enhancers and for the price - totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Amazing, Amazing, Amazing.  Best product for lash length of all.  Lasts  a long time too.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyelash/brow inhancer I will ever use!  It is absolutely the only one that works - I have tried a lot of them. It is expensive for a good reason.  If you want cheap, then just use water.</li>
    <li> This works for me!  Came quickly, this is my second purchase of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Came as stated.  I have stubby lashes and this has helped mine grow.</li>
    <li> It makes your lashes grow and it&#x27;s really easy and safe to use ( or at least i have not had any side affects). I only give it a 4 because i wish we got more product for our buck. But &#x27;s worth it compared to things like Latisse...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. It took about 6 weeks to see any results but after that I was so thrilled with the product. I&#x27;ve used other similar products and nothing compares! I looked to rebuy this product for about 6 months before but it was sold out everywhere- even online!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous. I noticed a great difference in my lashes after 2 weeks.  After 8 weeks I had people asking me why&lt;br /&gt;I was wearing false eye lashes! Remembering to put it on before bed isn&#x27;t as hard as you think. I noticed a little discoloration of my upper lid, but because I wear eye liner and other shadows its easily covered up.  I notice a little itching, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with. To me that means its working. I ran out of this product for 8 months and my lashes went back to normal. I won&#x27;t be without this product ever again.  Try it, you&#x27;ll be amazed. Amazon.com has the best price. All the others offering this product want 10-12 dollars more for a tube. Amazon rocks!! My first tube lasted almost a year. So the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! The product holds what it promises. Very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t cause any problems at all and after 4 to 5 weeks&#x27; treatment the lashes doubled - I fell I have twice as many as before and they are really long. I&#x27;m very happy and won&#x27;t miss this product any more.</li>
    <li> My whole life I have had short stubby sparse eyelashes that even generous applications of expensive mascara could not bring to life (and I tried them all...believe me):-(  I started using this product 2 years ago with much skepticism, but I was desperate to have some eyelashes. I used it faithfully every night and in about 6 weeks I saw some real results!! It really DOES work. I have never experienced any side effects from this product period. I was kind of hoping for the dark staining on the lash line that I had heard mentioned by some others, but it never happened. There have been times when I have been tired and sloppy in my application, sometimes even getting a wee bit of excess in my eye, but experienced no irritation at all. My eyelashes still aren&#x27;t as \\&quot;long and sweeping\\&quot; as I had hoped they would be, but they are definetly a huge improvement over what they were...you can actually see them!! and I am no longer a prisoner to all those layers of mascara and don&#x27;t feel like a freak when I have to run out the door without it. One thing to note is that it doesn&#x27;t take long if you stop using the product for your eyelashes to shrink back into obscurity. I have tried cheaper products trying to save a few pennies and have always been dissapointed. They are rubbish compared to this. This is the only one that works for me.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for 6 weeks now, no change. My friend bought this in the store, and it worked soooo good(and after only 3 weeks)! So online is probably fake. Dont waste ur money here. get it in store, to know its not fake!!!</li>
    <li> Box was opened was not good I returned it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past and I thought this would be a good substitute but it&#x27;s a scam it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet. I will continue to use for at least six-eight weeks total before deciding what I really think.</li>
    <li> The item was not securely packaged and I was worried it may have been used.  Returned the product without trying it.</li>
    <li> Excellent. It really works !!!</li>
    <li> Since the original plastic wrapping has been removed from around the package, I don&#x27;t know if the product has been tampered with, if the container is full or partially used or even if it contains the original product.  Given all of that, I feel hesitant to use the product and won&#x27;t order something like this from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> it does give you some red and irritated eyes</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product, I was really happy with the results - gorgeous long lashes. However, I found it to be less effective the longer I used it. I also experienced staining of my eyelids. One tube lasts a long time, but I wonder about shelf life once it has been opened.</li>
    <li> I am a previously healthy 27 y/o who was diagnosed with posterior uveitis (a serious eye infection) and macula edemas a few weeks ago. Due to that I have blurry vision on my right eye. I wen to the specialists and found no underlying sickness or cause. It is very likely that the lash enhancer serum might have caused it, the ophtamologist has had a similar case recently. I must admit my lashes looked great but it is not worth it if my eyesight is permanently reduced! WARNING!</li>
    <li> You will have beautiful eyelashes in no time even if you start out with stumpy ones like mine. They are towns ling and feminine!! Love it:-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am going to provide to be explicit in English as if to giving my impressions. Well...&lt;br /&gt;I had already used this article and found simply: great!&lt;br /&gt;That is why I took two.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to find it again......</li>
