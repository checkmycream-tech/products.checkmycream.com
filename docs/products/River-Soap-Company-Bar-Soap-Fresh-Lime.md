    <li> I love hearing that they use no glue on their natural paper packaging.  I grew up on a horse farm and there is so much horse brutality!  It is sooooooooooo sad that horses are commonly sold at horse sales to buyers from GLUE factories, made into gelatin, and sold for meat, commonly, all the time, for dog food and cat food!  There is a huge amount of pounds of LIVE  horse FLESH sold to be butchered and rendered for glue, dog food, and gelatin!!!!! They use the hooves for glue and gelatin!  Horses that sell cheaply at horse sales are bought up by these companies!!!!!! Horse sales happen all the time.  Old horses are said to go to the &amp;#34;glue factory,&amp;#34; but it is not a saying.  They can be bought, daily, at horse sales for cheap!!!!!!!!!  What happens to horses is unbelievable in this day and age!  If you care about this kind of stuff, save the horses.  Look up stuff on the Internet!!!! I have bad memories and it makes me really sad.:(  Also,  a number of horses died in the making of The Hobbit.  Also, Willie Nelson&#x27;s daughter is a horse rights advocate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> It has just the right amount of patchouli, warm, clean, not overbearing! I love it...my Hubby does too, on me!!!</li>
    <li> I will most certainly buy this product again. I love it as did my sister as I bought 2 of each of these products to share with my sister. Smells really good and leave skin very soft after use. I have really dry skin, I needed very little lotion after showering with this soap. This is an A+ item</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS product...smells great and last forever! Will continue to buy as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> damn good soap. smells amazing and lasted alot longer than other patchouli soaps I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best smelling patchouli that I have ever smelled, and it lathers really well. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing ,and unlike other soaps this on is soft on the skin .</li>
    <li> This soap has a very great smell and makes you smell very good but it drys out your skin horribly. With only two uses my skin was ashy. I would recommend for hand soap only.</li>
    <li> i have always liked the smell of patchouli. this soap is good. makes your skin soft. i would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> all vegetable scented with pure essentail oils !!  if you love patchouli - you&#x27;ll love this one! as always Amazon make ordering a snap - quick, and easy !</li>
    <li> Might be chea[er to order direct from River Soap Companys website.  They usually did not charge Amazon California customers sales tax, now they do.  It&#x27;s totally worth every penny, not perfumed like the \\&quot;Bath and Bodyworks\\&quot; stuff in the mall.  I like the woodland better, this is my second favorite.  They do combine shipping if you want to order a couple of different scents.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Would reorder fom this company again.</li>
    <li> Would have given it a 5 star rating except the larger pieces in the bar are just a bit too big for my preference.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, I wsh my body with it sometimes, have other soaps but this is my fav.  Packaged very nicely, each soap came wrapped separately, and Im very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with most soaps.  I have to change soaps about every month because of reactions.  This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I have had no reactions.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Yummy! Enough said :)</li>
    <li> Good selection. Not too heavy in the scent but enough to last.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! It smells heavenly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like a lot of bar soaps. Even recommended it to a friend who never uses bar soap.</li>
    <li> Good soap but smells nothing like patchouli. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it somehow got labelled wrong cuz there is no way they think this scent is patchouli... More lemongrass than anything. Still quality soap though</li>
    <li> dry flaky skin no more! been using this for years. river soap rocks, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong with any product from them, but this is my favorite. so lush!</li>
    <li> I really like it. Great soap and I love the scent</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I am allergic to fragrances.  This soap is very mild on the skin, is not drying and although it has fragrance it does not bother my allergies at all.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive but smells great, feels good, and brings back the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This soap smells terrific, will purchase again.  Suds up great too!</li>
    <li> Your soap is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the soap.  Smells wonderful. Love the texture. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great soap! The bar has been in use for almost 30 days and should last me another week! A great aroma and a great value!&lt;br /&gt;Have yet to try the other soap purchases, Woodland with Hemp Oil or the Sandalwood Soap</li>
