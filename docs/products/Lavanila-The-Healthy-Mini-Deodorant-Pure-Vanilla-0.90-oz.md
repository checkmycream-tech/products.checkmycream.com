      <li>Love the travel size!</li>
      <li>Will be buying more scents!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice smell.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice, smells nice, but it doesn&#x27;t help with BO at all.</li>
      <li>On the good side, it applies easily, and hasn&#x27;t caused any skin discomfort or irritation.</li>
      <li>It has very strong scent, which could be overwhelming at times.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>And It does work, even better than I thought it was going to.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like the scent even though I love vanilla.</li>
      <li>Smells mostly lavender with hint of vanilla</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also didn&#x27;t give off a pleasant smell; more like intense chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ADORE the scent of this deodorant, and I love how silky and fresh it feels when I apply it.</li>
      <li>This is a really good product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is nice and soft, and it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>It works great all day long, I love the vanilla scent and is so soft.</li>
      <li>My favorite by far!</li>
      <li>I also love that the ingredients are natural.</li>
      <li>but I think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>It goes on like a light body butter- but smoother- and has a light natural fragrance smell.</li>
      <li>When I know I&#x27;m going to sweat, I have a more powerful (and not so natural) deodorant that I use - Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials, which has triclosan in it.</li>
      <li>I found the use of this natural deodorant to be much better than Toms of Maine.  </li>
      <li>Wearing this to the gym, out on a run, or out on a hot day does not prevent body odor.</li>
      <li>This is definitely my favorite natural deodorant so far.</li>
      <li>I tried Pure Vanilla version.</li>
      <li>It does smell nice, doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on clothes LIKE other white deoderants.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s probably not in the spirit of the rproduct, but I put a little bit of it on top of my unscented Arm and Hammer antipersperant.  </li>
      <li>Product is so tiny it would not be worth the price even if it did work.</li>
      <li>They are too little for adult hands and crumbled to easily.  </li>
      <li>and it last the whole day,</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a natural deodorant that totally works.</li>
      <li>Lavanila deodorant has worked Ok for me, but not great.</li>
      <li>but will aid in reducing everyday sweating, neutralizes sweat Oder and leaves u smelling fresh.</li>

<li> It is a small container and a little more expensive than store bought deodorants</li>
<li> It was sold as a package with other product.</li>
<li> It was extremely embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was skeptical about this deodorant, but I found out it works real well.</li>
<li> Not sure if I will be purchased or not.</li>
<li> kinda regret getting the small size</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> works as well if not better then Secret or Degree.</li>
<li> Not a good value, in my opinion.</li>
<li> But this stuff made my pits stink something awful after only about an hour!</li>
<li> I gave it a 3 rating because when I attempted to re-order I was unable to.</li>
<li> I have never had a deodorant that was so terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this deodorant. It works great all day long, I love the vanilla scent and is so soft. It&#x27;s like a powder with cream. Doesn&#x27;t stain the clothes. My favorite by far!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t keep me from smelling</li>
    <li> It does smell nice, doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on clothes LIKE other white deoderants.  And It does work, even better than I thought it was going to.  Yay!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me- at all!  It does not smell like vanilla and does not help you not smell like BO!  Not a good value, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this deodorant, but I found out it works real well. It is a small container and a little more expensive than store bought deodorants but I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this. works as well if not better then Secret or Degree. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> It goes on nice, smells nice, but it doesn&#x27;t help with BO at all.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for those with sensitive skin. I gave it a 3 rating because when I attempted to re-order I was unable to. It was sold as a package with other product.</li>
    <li> I found the use of this natural deodorant to be much better than Toms of Maine.  However, the minis I bought by mistake.  They are too little for adult hands and crumbled to easily.  I prefer the larger size of this deodorant to the minis.</li>
    <li> I ADORE the scent of this deodorant, and I love how silky and fresh it feels when I apply it. I also love that the ingredients are natural. However, this only works for me when I&#x27;m having an &amp;#34;easy day&amp;#34;. Wearing this to the gym, out on a run, or out on a hot day does not prevent body odor. When I know I&#x27;m going to sweat, I have a more powerful (and not so natural) deodorant that I use - Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials, which has triclosan in it. :/ Ugh. I have yet to find a natural deodorant that totally works.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent even though I love vanilla. Felt sticky when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Smells amazzzing and it last the whole day, kinda regret getting the small size</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s probably not in the spirit of the rproduct, but I put a little bit of it on top of my unscented Arm and Hammer antipersperant.  It smells amazing. Bonus points for not giving me a headache like chemical perfumes.</li>
    <li> The one that I purchased does not have quite the same consistency or scent as the one I got from Sephora. Not sure if I will be purchased or not.</li>
    <li> Love the travel size!</li>
    <li> Great. Very Happy with product and service.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is absolutely amazing! It goes on like a light body butter- but smoother- and has a light natural fragrance smell. It isn&#x27;t like traditions deodorant- it doesn&#x27;t have a tacky or sticky texture. It is not an antiperspirant- but will aid in reducing everyday sweating, neutralizes sweat Oder and leaves u smelling fresh. Will be buying more scents!</li>
    <li> Lavanila deodorant has worked Ok for me, but not great. I tried Pure Vanilla version. It has very strong scent, which could be overwhelming at times. Also, it doesn&#x27;t prevent odor as well as desired - oftentimes at the end of the day I sense some odor coming through vanilla scent. On the good side, it applies easily, and hasn&#x27;t caused any skin discomfort or irritation.</li>
    <li> Defenitly travel size... Smells mostly lavender with hint of vanilla</li>
    <li> I have never had a deodorant that was so terrible. I am not a smelly girl, even when I work out and even when I don&#x27;t use deodorant. But this stuff made my pits stink something awful after only about an hour! It was extremely embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t give off a pleasant smell; more like intense chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this product was a no-go for me.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite natural deodorant so far. I&#x27;ve tried a couple other brands and with natural, deodorant, you almost always have to re-apply at least once through out the day. However, with this one, as long as I&#x27;m not working my butt off or out in the heat for too long, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to re-apply. I also don&#x27;t think it smells overly of vanilla, nor does the fragrance linger so I can use whatever lotions or perfumes I want.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my go to every day deodorant</li>
    <li> I simply like it ! I&#x27;ll buy again.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and soft, and it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You should try.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful for about 2 hours and then you can&#x27;t smell it at all. Did nothing to stop the BO. Product is so tiny it would not be worth the price even if it did work.</li>
