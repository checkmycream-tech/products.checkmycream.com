<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used this great product for years; it is cheaper on Amazon than at the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before. It really deep cleans your face. I would recommend it if you have blackheads, whiteheads, or acne. I use it for whiteheads and oil in the t-zone area.</li>
    <li> Excellent toner to use with the foaming face wash.</li>
    <li> My kids have battled with acne for quite some time. My boys would not do all three or four steps for ProActive, but used the cleansing gel and toner and the afterr a week and a half, there was a clear difference. Skin is smooth and the pores have been reduced. It does dry out your skin, so getting them to use a moisturizer is the next step! Their anti-aging line has been recommended, so I may try that. I&#x27;ve been using this line while they&#x27;ve been home from school this Christmas and my skin is so clear! Love it.</li>
    <li> My three teens use this as recommended by the dermatologist, what an amazing product. I wish it had been around when I was a teen!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed at how long it was going to take to get to me, but it was shorter then expected.  I have been using it for the past few days and the results are good.  I look forward to seeing how it is in a month.</li>
    <li> I have used many other toners for decades. I thought I would give glytone a shot. It has met my expectation and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am 33 and still find myself having occasional break-outs that drive me crazy. I have used this for over a month now and am really happy with it. It does sting - and using too much at first will really make your face dry out,. Used in moderation, it has kept my skin clear and happy.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner.  I use it every night after removing all my make up.  It keeps my skin clear, does not dry it out, and does not bleach my towels.  I am definitely keeping this as part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> It smells very harsh - the main ingredient is acetone.  It does the job and is very strong and drying.  I have oily skin but after using this, I skin was very tight and dry.  Make sure you follow with a good moisturizer.  My skin is slowly clearing up after three weeks.</li>
    <li> FYI: 2nd (?) ingredient is ACETONE (as in nail polish remover).  I&#x27;d love to return this because I purchased based on the good reviews. Opened the bottle and one whiff was enough to take a another look at the ingredients. I must have overlooked it when I ordered it. Also I think the way correct to list ingredients on cosmetic products is by order of amount contained in the product. This is listed as Active Ingredient: Salicylic Acid.  Inactive Ingredients: Acetone, Benzalkonium Chloride, etc. PLEASE do yourself a favor and skip this toner. Or just purchase nail polish remover.  It is not returnable per Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.

    <li> My son uses this regularly for his acne.  It helps to keep his skin clear.  We use this in conjunction with other Glytone products.</li>
    <li> After years of fighting off acne, I finally found a very simple skin care regimen that works. Clean (using Neutrogena oil-free cleanser), tone (using this Glytone toner), and treat (using my dermatologist&#x27;s in-house 0.05% tretinoin cream) at night. In the morning, I replace the tretinoin with Celeteque&#x27;s water-based moisturizer. If Glytone&#x27;s othe rproducts aren&#x27;t that expensive, I would have bought entire lines.</li>
    <li> Whew, this has quite a bit of acid in it -- which I need -- but I didn&#x27;t like the accompanying cleanser. It&#x27;s now my backup in case I run out of my preferred products (Skinceuticals). I&#x27;ll use it in a pinch for sure.</li>
    <li> This burns at first, but after using this for awhile, it no longer occurs.  This works best with the Glytone Exfoliating Gel Wash.</li>
    <li> I love this toner! I use along with the exfoliating gel wash and it is the only thing works. My skin has never been this clear!</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great product. I use the entire line and I love that fact that I can get it MUCH cheaper here.</li>
    <li> This product worked well to help clean the extra dirt off after washing with the gel cleanser.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this for the past 5 - 6 years and loves it.  It prevents acne break outs.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 2 days and I can already see a difference in my skin!!!! I used this product previously and I remember stopping it because I decided to see a dermatologist thinking I can find something better, well I was sadly mistaken. My skin took a turn for the worst with the medication he gave me so I stopped. I then remembered how well this product helped my skin before and decided to re-order, it has not let me down. I just ordered the wash so I cant wait to see the results with both the products. This product really cleans your skin and shrinks acne fast. It can be a bit drying so make sure you have a good moisturizer. I am so happy with the results in such a short amount of time I cant wait to see the results once it takes full effect.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.  Works very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product as advertised.  Works very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product as advertised.  Works very well for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and I find that it really works for me.  Though it can dry your skin out depending on your skin-type, it is effective in keeping my skin clear, oil-free and acne-free.</li>
    <li> I love this toner! I have oily skin and this is the best toner I have ever tried. I am on my second bottle and my skin feels better than ever.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for about 30 yrs.  This is by far the best product I have found for keeping it under control. I have tried EVERYTHING, including Accutane and Laser skin treatments!  This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would be similar to the Fading Pads from Proactiv because they made my skin look ridiculously good.  I was only able try a 5 day sample of them and was not about to buy a whole system to get one product.  Come on.  So, I searched for a similar salisylic acid composition and found it in this.  I don&#x27;t love the acetone as an ingredient, and only found it to be slightly drying in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my skin clean and clear.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, when used in conjunction with the oily face wash. Skin is smooth and acne is gone. I have battled adult acne since pregnancy 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me after about a month. It bleached my pillow cases so that was pleasant. Overall decent but didn&#x27;t do much for me. Unless someone can tell me if there&#x27;s a certain way to use it. But if not I&#x27;m done with glytone.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel!!!</li>
    <li> After opening this toner, it has started to smell a bit like it&#x27;s exceeded it&#x27;s shelf life. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I currently use a prescription type gel for my acne but was still suffering breakouts near my headline area between my eyes and forehead. After about two weeks and using this in combination with my prescription gel, what a difference. The forehead area has cleared up big time. Night and day difference and I am extremely please and satisfied at the results so far. The item has a pleasant smell, almost fresh smelling. This product line has other products I might be willing to try in the future.</li>
