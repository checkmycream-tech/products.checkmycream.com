      <li>I apply it to my itching, burning bites, and within minutes I am absolutely fine.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the honest nipple balm.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>which to me is good knowing its pretty pure ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Having used and loved many other Motherlove products I decided to give this a shot.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product, it really alleviated my daughter&#x27;s diaper rush</li>

      <li>The bites seem to go away quickly when I use the salve.</li>

      <li>You can easily use a much cheaper alternative such as olive oil or coconut oil and get the same results.</li>

      <li>Worth buying several in order to help with the discomfort of eczema.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>

      <li>I have used it to take the sting out of all manner of bug bites, to heal cracked skin, and clear up several kinds of rashes.</li>

<li> I have used it to take the sting out of all manner of bug bites, to heal cracked skin, and clear up several kinds of rashes.</li>
<li> It cuts healing time by several days and works better than many other products I&#x27;ve used, especially on nasty diaper rash.</li>
<li> He cried and complained how much it hurt.</li>
<li> (ie: Desitin, Vaseline, Balmex, Bag-Balm, antibiotics, and other similar products)  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I did because a week later my older son got a horrible carpet rash from dragging himself all over it.</li>
<li> It was red, raw, and bleeding.  </li>
<li> little goes a long way, as well.</li>
<li> This little jar lasts so long.  </li>
<li> A little does go a long way, however, with severe eczema</li>
<li> but you use very little of it... should easily last a couple of years.</li>
<li> I use it on mosquito bites and other itches instead of steroid cream.</li>
<li> A little goes along way.</li>
<li> this works wonders on bights, a little layer and itching goes a way.</li>
<li> just a little dab with every diaper and the baby never had diaper rash again.</li>
<li> It was red and inflamed and the skin was broken.</li>
<li> It lowered the rash bumps after a few hours.  </li>
<li> Salves typically do a poor job of moisturizing dry skin because of their tendency to sit on the skin and not absorb well.</li>
<li> Too bad they are charging so much.</li>
<li> Hooray for Motherlove, the rash cleared up in a few days!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s small...</li>
<li> I have also used this to sooth burns, on fire ant bites, bee stings, and mosquito bites, to name a few!  </li>
<li> This is really thick and had to apply</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a very small jar , I just received minds so I&#x27;ll write a update on how it&#x27;s working .</li>
<li> His rash cleared up in less than 2 days!!!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, $10 for a single ounce is insulting.</li>
<li> I have terrible reactions to mosquito bites, and for years no topical remedy has helped.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for kids or adults.  </li>
<li> Still, way too expensive for what you get.</li>
<li> I found this product containing comfrey and decided to fork over the money; after already spending so much on useless remedies, just hoping and praying this one would work.  </li>
<li> I added this on to an order for insect repellent with little hope of any remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> , they bight like crazy...</li>
<li> My baby boy had a terrible diaper rash.  </li>
<li> I react to their bites and they itch terribly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ran out of Motherlove diaper &amp; thrush balm and I couldn&#x27;t find a vendor that sold it so I decided to try this instead. It worked well as a butt balm for my baby. I also used it on some &#x27;ouchies&#x27; my toddler had, didn&#x27;t sting him either. Overall I would purchase this again:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice salve, but not quite what I was looking for to treat Pityriasis Rosea&#x27;s (PR) itchy rash. It seemed to help some, but it&#x27;s such a small jar, it would cost a fortune to treat the amount of skin covered by the rash, and I don&#x27;t know if it would be effective for PR. PR is a very hard rash to treat effectively and normally lasts 6-10 weeks, but often lasts for months.</li>

    <li> My baby boy had a terrible diaper rash.  It was red, raw, and bleeding.  I tried \\&quot;everything\\&quot;. (ie: Desitin, Vaseline, Balmex, Bag-Balm, antibiotics, and other similar products)  Someone told me about Comfrey being a great cure for diaper rash.  I found this product containing comfrey and decided to fork over the money; after already spending so much on useless remedies, just hoping and praying this one would work.  His rash cleared up in less than 2 days!!! AMAZING!  I use this as soon as I see any redness, and he hasn&#x27;t had another rash since! I have also used this to sooth burns, on fire ant bites, bee stings, and mosquito bites, to name a few!  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It clears so many types of rashes.  It even took the itching out of a poison ivy rash and healed quickly healed an infected belly button.  AMAZING!!!  This little jar lasts so long.  So Wonderful.  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for making it.  i will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for anyone with a baby!  It&#x27;s great for baby acne and little scratches.  We use it for any skin dilemma and it works great</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I use it on mosquito bites and other itches instead of steroid cream. It doesn&#x27;t work instantaneously, but if you can hold off for a minute it will kick in. I love that it gets a great EWG rating and doesn&#x27;t have a smell!</li>
    <li> It really works.  I am allergic to insect bites and this stops the itch and heals at the same time.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a rash that would not go away no matter what we tried.  Her Dr even gave her a prescription steroid cream, but nothing helped.  Having used and loved many other Motherlove products I decided to give this a shot.  Hooray for Motherlove, the rash cleared up in a few days!</li>
    <li> I use this for any and everything on my daughter. I use this and coconut oil for her diaper rashes and they are gone within hours. It truly is amazing</li>
    <li> Sent this great healing salve to my daughter. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I much prefer the honest nipple balm. This is really thick and had to apply</li>
    <li> I do not feel any effect of this product on mosquito bites at all. I do not recommend it. I am still looking for other products which maybe effective.</li>
    <li> Very nice soothing salve.  Bought 1 oz for $10.  Now it is $15.  Pretty small jar for $15. I really liked product but probably won&#x27;t purchase again at such a high price.  Also, I would like a 4oz jar.  Too bad they are charging so much.</li>
    <li> This is great for insect bites. In South Florida we have no-see-um&#x27;s. I react to their bites and they itch terribly.  My daughter recommended this salve. It does help take the itch out and helps protect the skin from me rubbing it. The bites seem to go away quickly when I use the salve. A little goes along way. Glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Great on eczema. Was useful for the dry/itchiness of the condition. Also worked wonders with in moments of child receiving welt from bug bite. Glad we found it and hopeful in the future a larger quantity is available for purchase. A little does go a long way, however, with severe eczema one could go through 1oz quickly. Worth buying several in order to help with the discomfort of eczema.</li>
    <li> Its as good as any other brands, marginal at best.</li>
    <li> Works great on mosquito bites and rashes!</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this thinking it was the nipple cream. I&#x27;m glad I did because a week later my older son got a horrible carpet rash from dragging himself all over it. It was red and inflamed and the skin was broken. He cried and complained how much it hurt. I tried cortisone, coconut oil, and Neosporin buy nothing helped his stinging pain. Finally I saw this in the corner and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt. Within three minutes he said he felt all better! I&#x27;m sold. All natural with wonderful ingredients I actually feel good about!</li>
    <li> This salve is the best product I have ever found for itchy skin. Whether insect bites or any skin irritation, this slave is soothing and helps the healing of any skin break.  When I travel, I always bring a 1 oz jar with me. I have given jars away to relatives too.  Once they try it, they want mine.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for kids or adults.  Thank you MotherLove for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> I love that the ingredients are all things that I knew of before a chemistry degree. The smell is not offensive, and I do feel that any itchiness is pretty well remedied with this salve. I liked that I could use it on myself or my son without worrying about getting it in our eyes or mouths.</li>
    <li> Great to undo itches from mosquito bites, good healer, great name. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It did help the itching from a mosquito bite, but only briefly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, $10 for a single ounce is insulting. You can easily use a much cheaper alternative such as olive oil or coconut oil and get the same results. Salves typically do a poor job of moisturizing dry skin because of their tendency to sit on the skin and not absorb well. The one thing I did find this product useful for is mixing with mineral sunblock to minimize the kabuki white effect. Still, way too expensive for what you get. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product! We live in Houston, and the mosquitoes love the humidity here, they bight like crazy... this works wonders on bights, a little layer and itching goes a way. It&#x27;s small... but you use very little of it... should easily last a couple of years. We also use it on our 1 year old, and no bad reaction to it, which is an additional plus!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Never mind its healing powers... just a little dab with every diaper and the baby never had diaper rash again.</li>
    <li> When you open this product you smell the olive oil  which to me is good knowing its pretty pure ingredients.  Rubbed it on a rash after I got out of a over chlorinated  pool. It lowered the rash bumps after a few hours.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it really alleviated my daughter&#x27;s diaper rush and I love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> I love using this as a natural alternative for neosporin. I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results when I use it on cuts, burns, etc. And I love the ingredients list! I&#x27;m happy that I can use it on my little one without worries about toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have terrible reactions to mosquito bites, and for years no topical remedy has helped. I added this on to an order for insect repellent with little hope of any remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salve, however, is a miracle! I apply it to my itching, burning bites, and within minutes I am absolutely fine. I use it on my employees&#x27; burns in the bakery where I work, as well, and it speeds healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff. I now have five jars in my purse and around the house for my family, and it&#x27;s worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, as well. Thanks, Motherlove!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I have used it to take the sting out of all manner of bug bites, to heal cracked skin, and clear up several kinds of rashes. It cuts healing time by several days and works better than many other products I&#x27;ve used, especially on nasty diaper rash. My two year old loves it too and whenever she gets a boo boo she asks for her &amp;#34;medicine.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It works on everything! I just wish it came in a bigger container.</li>
