      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years</li>

      <li>I, Love my mink hair spray.</li>
      <li>I have used Mink Hairspray for many years and now find I can not purchase it in any drug store.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and it is not too sticky, but does hold the fine hairs in place.  </li>
      <li>I hope it stays available for many years to come.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to find that Mink hair spray is still available as I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It holds my hairstyle and easily combs out without any build-up or sticky residue.</li>

      <li>Thank you for a great item,  a simple solution for me to always have some hair spray on hand, being able to purchase a few cans on a regular basis and good customer services that gets my order out to me quickly.</li>
      <li>The hold is a little stiffer than I would find ideal, but the ability to use it without sneezing and red eyes more than makes up for any defect.</li>
      <li>The next day you don&#x27;t have to pull your hair out trying to brush or comb, and it still looks nice.</li>
      <li>Have used Mink for a long time and find it perfect, no drying of my hair, no stiffness, application lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Bruses right out but holds hair in place.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad to have this quality item back.  </li>
      <li>Mink has been a favorite hair spray of mine for several years, but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands</li>
      <li>Has good hold without being stiff.</li>
      <li>First of all I much prefer this hair spray.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that it is no longer available in stores anywhere.</li>
      <li>I have used several others when this wasn&#x27;t available, and they don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>can instead which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone that wants hold but not sticky.</li>
      <li>Holds very well without being sticky.</li>
      <li>i have thick hair with a fair amount of curl, this hairspray doesn&#x27;t even hold my bangs in place or any part of my hair...</li>
      <li>and this doesn&#x27;t work for my particular hair.  </li>
      <li>Their CS department went the extra mile in answering my e-mail question quickly.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>never heavy d&lt;br /&gt;on hair.</li>
      <li>build-up if the hair isn&#x27;t frequently</li>
      <li>It keeps my straight hair in place and looking good usually for at least 3 days.</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
      <li>Sometimes hard to find, especially in the more eco-friendly hand pump.</li>
      <li>I  probably won&#x27;t live long enough to use them</li>

    <li> I have been a long time user of Mink hairspray and was very disappointed when it was no longer available in stores&lt;br /&gt;in my city.  Was thrilled to learn I could get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have used Mink for a long time and find it perfect, no drying of my hair, no stiffness, application lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect hold. Not sticky. Best hair spray I have EVER used.</li>
    <li> I, Love my mink hair spray. It smells wonderful, the hold is great and I don&#x27;t think I would ever use another hair spray. Mink Hair Spray does not dry your hair or make it looked stiff. The next day you don&#x27;t have to pull your hair out trying to brush or comb, and it still looks nice.</li>
    <li> My sisters and I have been using Mink for years.  We love it.  It holds but you can still brush through your hair when needed!  Holds your hair without the crunch!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.....holds but is not as sticky as other hairspays</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I had used it 20 yrs ago, and was quite upset when I could never find it in the stores.  (Michigan) It is the best and I wish the powers that be would put it back in stores.  I never thought of look on Amazon for it. Thank goodness Amazon carries it.  I am so glad to have this quality item back.  No stickey hair, it  holds and is touchable, the fragrance is light so it will not announce your arrival. Love to have it in a pump.</li>
    <li> I have used this hairspray for years.  Until recently it was carried by Walgreens. After they dropped it for reasons no one at the store level understood,  I was delighted to be able to order it through Amazon.  I have tried many different brands but this is the only one that did not irritate my scalp.  I found it holds well without caking up my hair.  Good Stuff.  I hope it stays available for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t work for my particular hair.  It is a good product - just not for me.</li>
    <li> Used this hairspray for years and since I can no longer find it in stores, I have been buying it online.  It holds my hairstyle and easily combs out without any build-up or sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I have used Mink hairspray for years and really liked it. However, I have always managed to find the pump bottle which was what I thought I had ordered. Come to find out, I received the aerosol can instead which I don&#x27;t really like. The product itself is great as it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy,sticky feel to the hair. Walgreen&#x27;s in Keene, was the only store that carried this product for years and no longer can get it that&#x27;s why I ordered it on line. If I can return 2 cans for the pump spray,please let me know. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find a retail outlet that sells Mink hair spray.  It is nice to know that Amazon is always there for me!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my Wife. She swears by it.The only problem is that it is no longer available in stores anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to find that Mink hair spray is still available as I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair spray does work well but it also accumulated a &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; build-up if the hair isn&#x27;t frequently washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular Amazon purchase of three cans costs roughly the same as did three canns as-bought from my previous retailer (Wahlgreens).</li>
    <li> I miss this product being on the shelf at the store so I decided to go on line to find it. The problem is that the product info on this said pump(as I prefer) but when I received it I got the aerosol. Still a great product but prefer pump style. Just can&#x27;t  find it. Why do they always get rid of the great products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was really sorry that so many stores stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone that wants hold but not sticky.</li>
    <li> Great hold without build-up.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it is not too sticky, but does hold the fine hairs in place.  Great product and I recommend  it</li>
    <li> I cannot find this spray locally anymore but it is the only spray I have ever found which does not make my hair look plastered down, does not flake off and hair still moves naturally but stays in place all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair spray for years and can not believe that i can&#x27;t get it in any of our stores.  I will continue to order it on line as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years so I knew it was good.  The company through it was ordered did a great job.  The order arrived when promised &amp; was just what it was supposed to be.  Their CS department went the extra mile in answering my e-mail question quickly.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray for years!</li>
    <li> been buying this brand for years and love it.</li>

    <li> I have been using Mink for years and it is no longer available in my area.  I LOVE MINK hairspray</li>
    <li> My Dad is in his 60&#x27;s. He&#x27;s still a very stylish, well groomed, good looking man. He has been using Mink for as long as I can remember 20+ years. I hope this hairspray can continue to keep my Dad in the &amp;#34;game&amp;#34; for years to come. Please don&#x27;t discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair spray for years and can no longer buy it locally.  I use it with an electric hair curler to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my hair and then use it all over when I&#x27;m finished with the set.  It keeps my straight hair in place and looking good usually for at least 3 days.</li>
    <li> The most remarkable feature of Mink Hair spray is it&#x27;s relative lack of scent.  The hold is a little stiffer than I would find ideal, but the ability to use it without sneezing and red eyes more than makes up for any defect.</li>

    <li> It is the only hair spray that does not leave a sticky mess. Bruses right out but holds hair in place.  Unable to find it in any of the&lt;br /&gt;stores that I looked for it in.  A friend suggested your site and there it was.  Love shopping on line with you.</li>

    <li> I continue to order from this company for several reasons. First of all I much prefer this hair spray. It has pleasant fragrance and a  hold that is just right. For reasons I don&#x27;t undersstand this hair spray is no longer sold in my area. By purchasing 3 cans at a time I don&#x27;t have to worry about having to make a purchase every few weeks. Thank you for a great item,  a simple solution for me to always have some hair spray on hand, being able to purchase a few cans on a regular basis and good customer services that gets my order out to me quickly.</li>
    <li> shocked at the 5 star reviews of this product...i only bought it based on the reviews...wow! not only does it not hold AT ALL, it&#x27;s just really useless...i have thick hair with a fair amount of curl, this hairspray doesn&#x27;t even hold my bangs in place or any part of my hair...bleh...guess i&#x27;ll keep on looking</li>
