      <li>and the scent is nice.</li>
      <li>Best Dove body wash so far.</li>
      <li>- thank God for Amazon!  :)</li>
      <li>I would love to be able to spritz myself throughout the day.</li>
      <li>but the one thing I love is the foamy lather.</li>
      <li>I love the Dove body washes and was looking forward to trying it.</li>
      <li>Love Dove products, skin feels very clean and hydrated.</li>
      <li>This new scent smells very nice, not too girly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try more body washes from dove.</li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to take a chance because after using this product my skin feels extremely clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Out of all of the Go Fresh body washes, this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s lightly floral, and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>lathers well and rinses off cleanly.  </li>
      <li>Orange blossoms are a given, we know that&#x27;s supposed to smell good, but who knew there were blue figs and that said figs smelled so damned divine!?</li>
      <li>Completely full of itchy bumps.</li>
      <li>For the most part I have always used shower gels from The Body Shop because the glycerin content in them makes them very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It has a citrus-y clean scent that I absolutely love, and it makes you feel squeaky clean, and soft.</li>
      <li>My new favorite body wash.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and leave my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>Its formula is way to strong for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>True enough dove gives smooth skin but not this one.</li>
      <li>It is a unique sent, however I feel the other scents are better.</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and clean.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve never had any kind of negative reaction to Dove products, so I was excited to try this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it lathers up really well.  </li>
      <li>Instead the moisture feels like it has penetrated instead of leaving greasy residue on top like some other brands that put petroleum in their formulas.  </li>
      <li>It smells absolutely divine and my skin was so soft!</li>
      <li>I cannot describe the scent other than to say that it smells aquatic, fruity, and clean...very very fresh.  </li>
      <li>I wonder why they didn&#x27;t tape the top like they usually do.</li>
      <li>And of course, it&#x27;s Dove, so it&#x27;s bound to leave you soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>A little sweet, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d originally only bought this because It was on sale, but was pleasantly surprised with the scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stay with you after you get out of the shower, so it wouldn&#x27;t conflict with any other scents you were planning to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wish this did not contain dyes and artificial fragrance, but it has so far been non-irritating, and I definitely feel clean after using it, so I&#x27;d be willing to purchase it again</li>
      <li>I have hard water so cheaply made body washes dry my skin out to no end.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little different than other body washes but not bad.</li>

<li> It gives my skin a moisturized feeling without being slick or sticky.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think this is a substitute for body lotion, but it should, at least, be non-drying, and it won&#x27;t strip the oils out of your skin like some harsher soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Ordered this and it came open :(</li>
<li> I used it once two hours after use my skin was terribly broken out.</li>
<li> so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

<li> Worst DOVE product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <li> Love Dove products, skin feels very clean and hydrated. This new scent smells very nice, not too girly so my husband can use too</li>
    <li> Out of all of the Go Fresh body washes, this one is my favorite.  They all smell incredible, but this one makes me think of what a clean person should smell like.  I cannot describe the scent other than to say that it smells aquatic, fruity, and clean...very very fresh.  For the most part I have always used shower gels from The Body Shop because the glycerin content in them makes them very moisturizing.  I have hard water so cheaply made body washes dry my skin out to no end.  I am glad I decided to take a chance because after using this product my skin feels extremely clean and moisturized.  Don&#x27;t worry it does not leave an awkard film.  Instead the moisture feels like it has penetrated instead of leaving greasy residue on top like some other brands that put petroleum in their formulas.  My only wish is that they would create a body mist as they did for the others.  I would love to be able to spritz myself throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The best dove. Skin feels soft and clean. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I always buy Dove. It smells fantastic and leave my skin feeling soft and clean. Does not leave a film and lathers up quite nicely. All of the scents in this line are great so you can&#x27;t go wrong. Also, for the price (and two day shipping) sign me up!</li>
    <li> Worst DOVE product I&#x27;ve ever used. True enough dove gives smooth skin but not this one. Its formula is way to strong for sensitive skin. I used it once two hours after use my skin was terribly broken out. Completely full of itchy bumps. And that was two days ago and the bumps still haven&#x27;t gone away. Not dove&#x27;s best product</li>
    <li> This body wash smells so great but the one thing I love is the foamy lather. The smallest amount lathers up and is very thick and rich. It gives my skin a moisturized feeling without being slick or sticky. I use less lotion now because my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out or look &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;. there are several drugstores that have this product in a trial size. I say go for it.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves this stuff. Feels like you are washing off using mysterious! I&#x27;ve now ordered some other scents. Try it!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed at how quickly my body wash arrived. It was also carefully packaged, no leaking! It smells absolutely divine and my skin was so soft! Dove soaps and body wash have never left my skin feeling dry also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this body wash! My husband even loves this body wash! The scent is heavenly!!! Go Dove!</li>
    <li> It is a unique sent, however I feel the other scents are better. You CAN smell the fig in it.</li>
    <li> I used the product and felt improvement in my skin,more soft,more hydrated. it&#x27;s smell so good.I recommend this product for everyone!</li>
    <li> I was little apprehensive at first, due to the reviews but I ordered it anyway and the scent is nice. It&#x27;s a little different than other body washes but not bad.</li>

    <li> The smell of this body wash is amazing! The body wash leaves my body moisturized and smelling great! I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Dove products.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale at Target and I&#x27;m really happy I bought it.  It smells really good and it lathers up really well.  I have a bad habit of not applying lotion after my shower, and with this body wash my skin isn&#x27;t dry at all.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I need to lotion.  This is a HUGE bottle of body wash, so it&#x27;s a great value.  I&#x27;m excited to try more body washes from dove.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash! It smells amazing! My new favorite body wash. You won&#x27;t be sorry you got it.</li>

But it&#x27;s a pleasant, floral fragrance.

    <li> Perfect for shower and go.  Don&#x27;t even need to cream up.</li>
    <li> Dove makes the best body wash in my opinion, and out of all the ones I have used; this one is my favorite. It smells AMAZING. It has a citrus-y clean scent that I absolutely love, and it makes you feel squeaky clean, and soft. I would recommend this to anyone. Best Dove body wash so far.</li>
    <li> Ordered this and it came open :( body wash was all over the box. I wonder why they didn&#x27;t tape the top like they usually do. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> OMG!  I love the smell of this bodywash!  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my area - thank God for Amazon!  :)</li>
    <li> This smells so amazingly good! Orange blossoms are a given, we know that&#x27;s supposed to smell good, but who knew there were blue figs and that said figs smelled so damned divine!?
