      <li>(so why pay a huge difference in price?).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product. Easy to style, not sticky. But it does weigh the hair down a little bit. It looks best on the first day it is applied.</li>
    <li> It made my hair so sticky I threw it away.  Big waste of money. No matter how little I used, I could never run my fingers through my hair. Worse mousse ever!</li>
    <li> I tried this because of the rave reviews. I agree that it&#x27;s a good product but a little pricey for me. I&#x27;m certain I can find something less expensive that works as well.</li>
    <li> ItItem has never been received expected on the 3rd and never happened.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product elsewhere and loved it. I was happy to find it on Amazon for a relatively good price. When I received it from you, the can was very warm and the product shot out in a big glob and did nothing for my hair. I tried it several times and was very unhappy. I really wanted to send it back, but noticed after the fact that it was not refundable. I suspect that the product got damaged in the mail, being that the can was very warm when I received it. I am very disappointed that I lost money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your concern.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair in a short wedge and find that It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Styling Mousse is aptly named.  It is a miracle for styling my hair....just apply, comb in place and air dry.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all, looking for the product that will give me natural looking hair. Finally found it in this one!</li>
    <li> This item arrived as described.</li>
    <li> works wonders on my daughters curly hair!  TY</li>
    <li> Well this was horrible, the bottle does not even work... worst thing that i ever bought on amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am so pleased to find it on Amazon for a lower price.  I have been purchasing at Ulta and these prices are so much better.  This product does not leave your hair sticky.  It is easy to use and I would recommend all the products in this line.</li>
    <li> Made my hair more manageable.  I will reorder</li>
    <li> Made my scalp horribly itchy</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair and you are trying to get some volume, this mousse will not work for you. It weighed down my hair. The product smells good and I&#x27;m sure works well for other hair types, but not for mine. I previously used a different brand and it was very light and gave me volume. I read how this mousse helps treat your hair and wanted to give it a try. Sadly it did not work for me. However, i have to say this mousse feels like a good high quality product.</li>
    <li> I like how light this product is.  I can blow dry hair without the brush sticking or dragging, yet it still provides hold and volume.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended it and I love it.  Hair feels so nice and not stiff like other hair products.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Best stuff. I have been using for about 1 yr.</li>
    <li> My hair has gotten very dry...this mousse gives my dry hair life.  It was discontinued at my hair salon so I was happy&lt;br /&gt;To find it on line.</li>
    <li> The. Best mousse in the markey</li>
    <li> I love the It&#x27;s A 10 hair products. I have the mousse, hair spray and leave-in serum and they are terrific. They smell very good and they moisturize the hair and give it volume. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. Bi have been using it for almost 3 years now and it has been a good product.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason I could not style my hair using this product.  I blow dry my hair with a round brush, I couldn&#x27;t even get the brush to go thru my hair.  Gave it to my hair stylist, so at least someone is getting use of it.  I was disappointed because I have used other products from &amp;#34;It&#x27;s. A Ten. &amp;#34; and was very happy with them.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this at my last cut, and I didn&#x27;t think too much of it at first. I had never heard of the brand, it made my wavy/kinky hair look less frizzy and helped my curls form nicely, but it didn&#x27;t seem at all special at the time.  That was until I woke up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, my hair is wavy and tends to be very frizzy, especially on top. I have to wet it thoroughly or wash it everyday to make it look presentable. When I sleep, it gets flattened out, tangled and unruly. I have to use a wide toothed comb in the shower while my conditioner is in to get through all the knots, and then let it air dry (with a lot of product in it) without touching it, or else it gets huge and puffy. This is all kind of a pain in the butt to do everyday. That&#x27;s where this mousse amazed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after I used this the first time, I woke up to beautiful hair. It was bouncy, tangle free, the curls were still formed, and the biggest deal was there was NO FRIZZ! I was so happy to have found this. The real miracle was I took a bath that night, left my hair up since it still looked great so I didn&#x27;t think about washing it. The next morning (day 2 after my cut) it STILL looked great. Normally if I don&#x27;t wash and mousse my hair for two days in a row, it looks and feels like a bird&#x27;s nest. I have never had hair that I could just finger style and leave the house, but now I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a game changer.</li>
    <li> I love this and can&#x27;t always find it at the store</li>
    <li> This product did give me the curls I wanted, but they were so stiff and very hard to comb through.</li>
    <li> Gives great body to my hair.  I love most of the It&#x27;s a 10 line.  I love there leave in conditioner with Keratin too!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Not sticky or stiff</li>
    <li> I Love this mouse!  It&#x27;s not sticky, or stiff.  It is easy to use with a blow dryer.  It adds the perfect amount of body and lift that last.</li>
    <li> I do like the It&#x27;s a 10 products, but this was before I was introduced to Deva Styling products.  However, based on this product alone, it is fine.  I just do not like crunchy, dry looking hair.  It does work for styling the hair but I&#x27;d prefer a product that doesn&#x27;t work like other products at a drug store.  The price is high for something that doesn&#x27;t do anything different than Suave would.  However, I will say this product was great for keeping it in place at least.  I just prefer the Deva Foaming Mousse because it starts crunchy but when I scrunch the hair after it dries, it removes the casing leaving me still with high hold, high gloss, super-soft curls.  This on the other hand, if I tried that, left me with frizz and limp hair.</li>
    <li> This moose is not gooey or sticky.  It is a very nice product!  Nice styling and control.  Feels good in your hair.</li>
    <li> It may just be my hair but it makes my hair incredible sticky like. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good for possibly curly hair but this just did nothing good for my hair. And yes I used a small amount. Sorry if someone loves this. It very well just could be my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Really adds volume to my hair.  I ordered the It&#x27;s a 10 volumizing shampoo too. Price is much better here than Ulta or a salon.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me.  My hair is fine and thinning, but this product made it look and feel like I had a full head of hair.  The next morning&#x27;s result is even more fantastic with my hair still feeling thick and manageable.</li>
    <li> Great mousse especially for fine, hard to hold hair.  I love that after you apply it, your hands are not sticky--this means it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;harden&amp;#34; on your hair as it dries while you are blow-drying.  Long lasting -- you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at a time.</li>
    <li> Didnt really define my curls and it was kind od crunchy. Only its a 10 product that doesnt work with me</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair a bit oily the day after. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair shiny like I would want. I was hoping for so much more.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very hard to get where I live. I love this mousse. I have very thin hair and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> happy with our purchase</li>
    <li> I have thin wavy curls and this product didn&#x27;t really control the frizz enough.  I ended up trying DevaCurl after this product and I would never go back.  It might work great on hair that isn&#x27;t curly, but it didn&#x27;t work for mine.</li>
    <li> It is great for those who like to style their hair or even add a little fluff. I like it.</li>
    <li> Love all the Its a !0 products</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; price!</li>
    <li> Really volumizes my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Not as terrible as \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Blow-Dry Volumizer\\&quot; (which left my hair a sticky horrid mess), but still a very disappointing product.  This styling mousse left my hair lifeless and dull, with no improvement in texture or volume after styling. My hair fell flat within an hour; but from that point on, this product did indeed hold that flat lifeless style until I washed my hair.  Oh well, another donation to the landfill.......  (I have found the best success with Moroccan Oil Root Boost).</li>
    <li> Great product - does weigh down fine hair is the only negative</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my 90 year old sister who&#x27;s hair is thinning. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Another hit product from It&#x27;s a 10 Hair Product.  Very light, great smell, but&lt;br /&gt;wonderful holding power.  Does not make hair dry - plenty of bounce.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to use ALL It&#x27;s a 10 Products to actually see the difference from&lt;br /&gt;other products.  It is a huge improvement over other products no matter what&lt;br /&gt;the price of others.  With It&#x27;s a 10 Products, it takes soooo little of any of them,&lt;br /&gt;that the price is actually very good.  Amazon has the best prices around and&lt;br /&gt;very fast shipping !&lt;br /&gt;Love each and every It&#x27;s A 10 Hair Product that I have tried and will not use&lt;br /&gt;anything else !</li>
    <li> Great product. Does the job, all you have to do is follow the instructions and it accomplishes everything it says it will.  Came on time, packed well, will recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Stiff and nonholding product. It&#x27;s useless in high humidity</li>
    <li> The scent gave me a migraine. I will never use this again, sadly, because I think it likely holds well. I just can&#x27;t take the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> great product! does not leave hair weightless and frizzy. love the price compared to getting in salon! would recomend to anyone who has curly hair.!!</li>
    <li> I love this mousse. It made my fine, limp hair full and manageable. It also makes it shiny too. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but hey, for good looking hair it&#x27;s worth it to me. If you want a great mousse that does what it says it&#x27;ll do, look no further.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used on my hair and I will definitely be ordering more as soon as I start to run low. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and actually gives it a little *bounce*</li>
    <li> Probably the best mousse I&#x27;ve used. Over application will give you the crunch look but once you learn which amount is best on your hair, helps form and maintain fabulous curls!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this mousse!!  It does exactly what it says!!</li>
    <li> Holds style without feeling crunchy.  I used this on both my kids hair.  They both have fine hair but one has thick hair and the other thin.  Great product for both kids.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. There&#x27;s UV protection so it&#x27;s a great product for colored hair. A little bit goes along way.</li>
    <li> I have thinner hair and this mousse is amazing for it! It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I put in about an egg size amount on damp hair. I go to bed with my hair damp and when I wake up all I have to do is brush it and it looks amazing. Great product and I would purchase it again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> love how this is not the typical sticky mousse...it works great for volume. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Great body &amp; hold, my hair looks soft &amp; smooth without looking like stiff &amp; dry!</li>
    <li> I usually buy this when I go to the hair dresser, but it is so much more economical to buy it online! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I put this on my fine, thin hair in the morning and by the evening, it still holds its shape!  It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
    <li> These does moisturize your hair and make it shiny.  I get really dry hair occasionally and this helps get it on track, but can actually make it too &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;.  So I change it up and use it occasionally.  If you have really coarse or thick hair, you could probably get away with using it every day.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! It is my FAVORITE styling product for curly hair. After using it on day one and not washing it, but wetting it and styling with this product on day two it looks even better!</li>
    <li> Love it would recommend it to anyone with damaged hair.product arrived promptly will order again!! the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> Such a good product.  Gives my hair body without straightening it or making it stiff.</li>
    <li> love it, looks even better the next day!!!!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist has used this one me for the last couple of visits, and it does a wonderful job of maintaining my curl, even after sleeping on it. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit expensive compared to some others, so I&#x27;ll have to see exactly how long this container lasts for regular usage.</li>
    <li> A great product for my needs.  Adds volume and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product...hard to find but nice that can order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 10 has great products...You have to make sure you don&#x27;t use too much (same with leave-in spray.  I now use the Lite version), because it will make your hair (esp fine hair) flat and dirty looking.</li>
    <li> My stylist turned me on to this mousse. I had been going from product to product using each for about a eight months to a year. And let me tell you, those products were pricey, salon-bought. The pomades most will recognize cost an arm and a leg now. I tried gels, styling lotions, pomades. All were good products from the top-flight brands. Nothing has done better than this mousse in holding a style and without being stiff. I am lucky in that my hair is thick and smooth but it has a mind of its own in Florida&#x27;s miserable humid summers. Keeping hair smooth and glossy is a big challenge in a humid climate. I put a generous amount in my hands and through my hair, along with a heat protectant. Then I blow dry completely, and go over it with a 410-degree flat iron. I can drudge through the swamp without looking like swamp woman. What products we use depend on what kind of style we want and our type of hair. Remember: if you use a flat iron, always always use a heat protectant, and always blow it dry first, so as to lessen the time the heat stays on your hair. I&#x27;ve used Chi serum, Fredrick Fekki and also Keihl&#x27;s Silk Groom. All are great heat protectants, I haven&#x27;t found much difference (so why pay a huge difference in price?). Here&#x27;s to a great hair day.</li>
    <li> This is a great mousse.  It leaves your hair soft and very manageable.  My roll set  lasts at least 10 days!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now and I really like it.  My hair is super fine and straight (limp and lifeless).  This product makes each hair feel thicker and more manageable.  I can style and and it stays styled.  I also use the It&#x27;s a 10 miracle blow dry with it too.  Unfortunately the last can of mouse I purchased the mouse just comes out without expanding like normal. It is still usable though.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad can, or if I got &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; from that particular seller.  I will purchase this again, but from someone else.  But it really does work.</li>
    <li> This Mouse is awesome!!! Leaves hair light and bouncy!!</li>
    <li> I use this with their spray volumizer. The spray is so good you almost don&#x27;t need the mousse as well.</li>
    <li> Can I give this mousse 10 stars instead of 5? Love this product. It gives my hair the lift I need and shine. I have never used this&lt;br /&gt;mousse before but now it&#x27;s my BFF!</li>
    <li> Really good mousse it holds style, gives volume and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crusty or greasy. This product is great</li>
    <li> This mousse is a great product.  My daugther has curly hair and besides the style, this mousse prevents hair entanglement.  The smell is great too.</li>
    <li> Best mousse I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried many. It holds my hair well and provides that extra styling help needed.</li>
