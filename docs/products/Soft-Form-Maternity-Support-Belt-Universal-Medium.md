      <li>This is probably a good product because my doctor liked it when I showed it to her</li>
      <li>I came across this one and it is worth every penny and more!!!</li>

      <li>, I love it!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing</li>
      <li>This product is amazing</li>
      <li>I try to tuck it in between two layers of clothes, but I find that kind of limiting.</li>
      <li>I wear nice dresses and sweaters so this belt is just too balky for something like that...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own muscles too.</li>
      <li>This has absolutely got to be the best engineered product of its type ANYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve also gotten to the point where I just frankly don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m out running errands and part of it hangs out below my shirt...</li>
      <li>I liked it when I was doing yard work.  </li>
      <li>kind of a pain to deal with at work.</li>
      <li>It is kind of a pain to put on (lot&#x27;s of straps).  </li>
      <li>Furthermore, I&#x27;d recommend that any pregnant woman consider a support belt of some kind, and this one would be a great choice.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put on, adjust it when needed and it fits well under my maternity clothes.</li>
      <li>the Medium should fit perfect right?</li>
      <li>This got so many high ratings and looked perfect.  </li>
      <li>Upon retrying it on, I liked the product and was glad i kept it.  </li>
      <li>Strong velcro grip, the velcro does not fool around!</li>
      <li>This is a very supportive, comfortable belt.  </li>
      <li>It is very comfortable to wear.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Its also very comfortable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
      <li>But after that it is very comfortable</li>
      <li>Loved this while I was pregnant.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very smooth, so you have to be creative when trying to hide it.</li>
      <li>it really helps lift the belly and helps your baby move around more I think its great</li>
      <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>As it turns out the ever-helpful relaxin hormone does more then help your hips and cervix spread...</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I really wanted, so I guess I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>I was hardly able to walk, roll over in bed, etc.</li>
      <li>glad I did...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK,</li>
      <li>You can get away with anything!! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly comfortable and in my month or so of using it, it has held up nicely.</li>
      <li>Some people may not like this, but for me I think it&#x27;s great because I can really conform the belt to my belly and customize my support.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more just the outline of it, than bulky lumps.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t think I would be able to keep up my hours without this.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Curad Maternity Belt because I was feeling more pressure from the weight of my baby on my lower abdomen.</li>
      <li>I think I needed something that had more support because I was all belly with an 8 lbs baby.</li>
      <li>well, though I don&#x27;t need that top strap at this point.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This maternity support belt is a must have and is comfortable to wear. If your experiencing moderate to severe pelvic pain due to your growing uterus than this will provide some relief. I used it to help me walk and climb my stairs without as much pain as I had before its use. Nothing will stop the pain all together but to give birth but this makes it much more bearable. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This band seems to help some with my lower back pain, but I can&#x27;t hide it very well under my clothes.  It isn&#x27;t very smooth, so you have to be creative when trying to hide it.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase one when I was diagnosed with placenta previa on my second pregnancy.  I have asthma and being restricted on my top belly area makes me feel like I can&#x27;t breathe or having a mild anxiety attack.  I will only find comfort when I remove the upper belt support and kept the lower part on.  It gave me support until my 6th month of pregnancy.  Beyond that, I felt restricted and belt felt tighter.</li>
    <li> my only complaint is the 2 bars in the back start to make my back sore if i wear it for too long.</li>
    <li> It is a little big and shows under the clothes if you are not wearing long shirts but it is very supportive. I think it helped with the hip pain that I was experiencing due to pregnancy.</li>
    <li> GREAT product.  I used this from time to time, throughout my second pregnancy.  I wish I&#x27;d had it for my first one too!  Was great and totally helped with back pain.  Highly recommend for anyone pregnant!  Helps with pressure too.</li>
    <li> Comfy and easy to put on. Instant relief of back pain. I think it is comfortable enough to wear underneath clothing. Strong velcro grip, the velcro does not fool around! I live in Seattle so the weather never gets hot enough to where I notice that this belt will cause any sweating issues, but if I lived in a warmer climate then maybe this belt could possibly be a little hot. All in all I looooooove this and wear it whenever I am up and on my feet for any amount of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this maternity belt because I had such bad back problems with my first child. I had never used one before but it looked like it gave a lot of support. I do use it a few times a week. Especially if I am walking places for longer periods of time. I started using it when I was 7 months pregnant. I do not use the strap that goes across the tummy. Seemed like it didn&#x27;t add any additional support. I love how the back part is so tall. I think that is one of the best features. It really helps support and straighten your back. I would definitely recommend this belt to anyone who is looking for additional back support during your pregnancy! It has helped me get through some days where it would have left me sitting on the couch!</li>
    <li> I thought this item would help me with some back pain from the 5th month. It not only helped with that but also minimized the sharp pain some women (me included) feel between the legs due to expansion in the hips. In addition, the pain around the belly button was greatly reduced when wearing the belt.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my second pregnancy, I was really uncomfortable.  This support made a huge difference.  It is kind of a pain to put on (lot&#x27;s of straps).  And It took a day or two of fidgeting to find the best placement around my growing belly.  But after that it is very comfortable and I won&#x27;t leave the house with out it on.</li>
    <li> As I get bigger and bigger, working out in the gym has been getting harder and harder. This brace has helped relieve my back pain and keeps my belly from jiggling and bouncing.  It is comfortable and easy to put on.  Now that I am almost 8 months pregnant and getting more uncomfortable throughout the rest of my day, I will wear this around the house for the extra support.</li>
    <li> I got this in my 2nd tri when I started having mild lower back pain.  Instant relief when i put it on!  I only use it when I start to feel pain because I don&#x27;t want to be bracing my back all day.  Now, in my 2nd tri with worse back pain, it still alleviates it but not completely (honestly, I don&#x27;t think anything would alleviate the pain completely).  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. My wife loves it, it provides great back support.</li>
    <li> I got this product as I have back problem, it seems to be helpful for that but really didnt like the fabric as it is so stiff that it makes it hard to sit....It gets hard on back as u sit as the fabric doesnt seem that great.....</li>
    <li> All good. No complains. Vendor delivered fast</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  Though I&#x27;m not pregnant, I can wear it for back support and not restrict my breathing as I have COPD.  Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I had a tried a couple of other support belts because this one just looked so heavy duty. Well, it is heavy duty. It works like a charm. The others I tried don&#x27;t even compare. Not only did it support my back but it also helped to relieve round ligament pain.  It gets pretty hot in the summer, but that&#x27;s to be expected. I have used it now with all my pregnancies and have been very relieved by the support.    Also, many times your insurance will cover the cost of these so check with your insurance company.</li>
    <li> I regret purchasing this and I really wish I had picked a different kind, because I spent around $30.00 on it and I don&#x27;t use it, because it&#x27;s so uncomfortable.  The velcro sticks out around the edges and scratches my skin or scratches my clothing if I wear it over things.  I guess it does what it should, if you can be compelled to wear it!  If I had this purchase to do over again, I would definitely look for one of the ones that doesn&#x27;t have velcro or at least has a better design made for comfort.  Pregnant women have enough trouble getting comfortable as it is, we don&#x27;t need to wrap a rough, velcro belt around us as well...</li>
    <li> I ordered the Curad Maternity Belt because I was feeling more pressure from the weight of my baby on my lower abdomen. I am a short person and the baby and my uterus don&#x27;t have much room to spread lengthwise, so quickly I had a basketball belly with a bunch of weight throwing off my back. I am a teacher so I stand often during the day. This maternity belt really helped me to feel supported. I don&#x27;t even waddle as much. I only wear the belt to work. It&#x27;s fairly comfortable and in my month or so of using it, it has held up nicely. It depends what kind of clothing you wear, but since I wear the elastic belly of my maternity pants OVER the belt, it doesn&#x27;t really show much through clothing (unless your outfits are super form-fitting).</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product and probably provides a lot more support than ones slightly less expensive.  I purchased this because it is my fourth pregnancy and my back and abdominal muscles are not as strong.  I usually wear it around the house while I&#x27;m doing my daily chores, or when I go shopping or for longer walks.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to restrict movements like bending or squatting, and if you have it on correctly it&#x27;s no less comfortable sitting vs. standing.  It&#x27;s not very noticeable under clothes.  I ordered this particular maternity belt because of reading the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra 5 or 10 bucks.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this belt for 2 days now, and I have had no back pain! Usually I have pain in the upper part of my back on the left side by mid day, and now nothing! Hopefully as I get bigger it will continue to provide relief.</li>
    <li> What a back saver!  My tummy was getting too heavy for my small frame and giving me lower back pain.  This support belt has made a big difference.  It is comfortable as long as you wear something underneath it so the velcro doesn&#x27;t scratch, well made, and so supportive.  Sometimes I forget I have a big tummy when I&#x27;m wearing this!  I normally wear it under my scrubs so I don&#x27;t have a problem with it showing, but today I wore it under normal clothes and you could barely see it as under my two layers.  I can see this being a problem in the hot weather though.  Overall I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Loved the support it gave during the last trimester. I only wore it while doing physical activity (yoga, walking, etc..)  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This belt does offer good support. I wear it mainly at work and definitely have more stamina for running around then the days I don&#x27;t bother with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My main problem is something I should have paid more attention to in other reviews. I ordered the universal medium, and while i think it fits appropriately, the Velcro on either side ends up sticking out over the sides, which really isn&#x27;t comfortable. I try to tuck it in between two layers of clothes, but I find that kind of limiting. It means every time I use the restroom I have to rearrange all the layers and make sure the velcro isn&#x27;t against my skin. I will probably try to cut down the velcro so that it is not so unnecessary wide. There is plenty of velcro without the extra, and plenty strong at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also tends to bunch up if you are sitting or bending a lot, but I think most things would do this once your belly is big enough.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a store, so I am reviewing for what I think is the same, or at least very similar product.    When I herniated a disc in my back at 19 weeks I knew I was in trouble. As it turns out the ever-helpful relaxin hormone does more then help your hips and cervix spread...it can make all your joints loose and in some cases your spine totally unstable. I drew the lucky card, and since that first herniation have had one joint after another dislocate. This brace has been a lifesaver! While it&#x27;s not a cure, it provides the support my back has needed and allowed me to be on my feet at times when I otherwise just couldn&#x27;t have managed.  You can adjust the tightness and level of support as needed.  I&#x27;ve not used the above belly strap, so I can&#x27;t attest to that, but the other two pieces have worked for me throughout my pregnancy as my belly has grown and my body has changed.    There are a few negatives.  First, this belt is pretty large.  This is a large part of why it offers so much support and why it&#x27;s far superior to the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, but it also means that you have to think about it when making clothing choices.  All those adorable little sundresses...not so cute with the velcro bumps this thing creates not to mention there is no way to adjust it wearing a dress.  (And you&#x27;re going to want to if you are changing between sitting and standing or after eating etc.)  I recommend long shirts and skirts or pants.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve also gotten to the point where I just frankly don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m out running errands and part of it hangs out below my shirt...I&#x27;m pregnant, get over it. &#x3D;)  Second, my physical therapist has warned me not to use it too much since muscle atrophy isn&#x27;t going to help.  I pretty much carry it with me and try to only pull it out when I find myself on my feet for more than an hour a so and still needing to keep moving.  (As a plus it&#x27;s great for holding an ice pack in place!)  Third, one of the pregnancy symptoms we all love...having to runto the bathroom every 10 minutes, is not exactly alleviated by essentially tightening a giant band around your bladder.  For me I&#x27;ll make a few more trips to the bathroom for the ability to walk, but that&#x27;s just me.  Know that if this belt is tight enough to offer support, it&#x27;s also going to most likely put some pressure on your bladder.    While I hope that you don&#x27;t get the rubber band spine I did, nearly every pregnant woman I know has had some sort of back pain towards the end of their pregnancy. I&#x27;d imagine this would help with any kind of back weakness or pain you experience. As an added plus my OBGYN says it will help post-baby as well as it takes a few months for the relaxin to leave your body and your joints and abdominal walls strengthen. I&#x27;d say this is a pregnancy must have!</li>
    <li> I was having sharp lower left back pain during my pregnacy.  I got this belt &amp; started wearing it around 7.5mo.  It has been a life saver.   I am on my feet all day at work &amp; I don&#x27;t think I would be able to keep up my hours without this.  It is worth every penny.  I also wear it whenever I am doing house work or going to the mall.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing this consistently for the past few weeks and I can totally feel the difference.  The only downfall of it is that the part of the band that goes in front of the belly is not wide enough so that the Velcro of the back part is fully covered.  It makes me itch.  but honestly i would recommend this for anyone who is having back and frontal soreness from the baby growing... : )</li>
    <li> a little funny looking and it has 4 pieces, which means you need 30 more seconds every time you use the bathroom. but it really works!     it helps with my lower back soreness and pelvic/thigh? ligaments pain.     it fits well and stays in place ---- i don&#x27;t even need the belt above the tummy.    by the way, i&#x27;m 5&#x27;1\\&quot;. I wear size s or 4p before pregnancy and size s or mp (maternity clothes) now.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife at about 8 weeks and she has been wearing it ever since. Helps support back and belly. She has had a difficult pregnancy and the support belt has been a great buy for us. After I bought this I saw it in Babies r us for a couple dollars more so if you can&#x27;t wait a couple days to receive it, just go get you one from there.</li>
    <li> This belt provides good back support, but digs into your lower stomach when you sit.</li>
    <li> This is my first pregnancy and I am 5&#x27;1\\&quot; having really bad round ligament/muscular pain going all the way up my stomach.  I am a dental hygienist and w/the way I sit having my stomach muscles engaged all day.  I was in so much pain that I had to take a couple unexpected trips to the doctor to try to figure out why.  I was in tears at the end of the day and thought I was going to have to stop working.  At that point I was willing to try anything.  After looking around the internet I found this product.  I can&#x27;t believe how well it has worked.  It was like night and day.  I now work totally  pain free.  The support is incredible!  I told my husband whoever invented this product I want to hug.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs stomach or back support.  I even wear mine under my shirt w/no irritation.  I did try wearing it over but it was too much of a hassle when you need to go to the restroom.  I am a size 6 or 8 pre-pregnancy and ordered the medium which fits well.</li>
    <li> I would not have made it through my pregnancy without this support band. It really helped to alleviate the heaviness I felt around my belly. Soft and comfortable, I used it everyday and went nowhere without it.  The Velcro held up nicely in spite of being machine washed frequently. So glad I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> This belt really works!!!  It takes the pressure off your back and gives support to your belly and lower back.  I have tried 2 other belts with no success.  I came across this one and it is worth every penny and more!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable. Easy to figure out. I felt pressure taken off by back immediately</li>
    <li> I was pregnant with twins and i knew i needed something to help support my back.so i had bought this and i didnt use it at first but as soon as my stomach was growing bigger. It helped me sooo much.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in the 6th month of my 2nd pregnancy.  What a relief:)  This has helped support my growing abdomen and lower back so much.  I was having trouble sleeping at night due to the pain of my body shifting.  I have slept great the last week and just hope it continues.</li>
    <li> My wife complainted that her tummy hurts when sitting down w/ the belt.  I guess it&#x27;s only good for walking.</li>
    <li> This is a very supportive, comfortable belt.  It really helps stabilize the belly and distribute the weight more evenly.  I wish I&#x27;d had one during my first pregnancy for walking and exercise.  I think this isn&#x27;t just for women with back problems or other issues -- it&#x27;s for anyone who could use a break from the belly so they can be more active and utilize other muscles more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t tell from the picture, the belt is made of three pieces that attach together with velcro.  All three are completely separate, which makes it very adjustable and adaptable.  I frequently opted out of wearing that small strap that goes over the top, just because it didn&#x27;t always feel necessary.  (But that little strap isn&#x27;t necessarily annoying or anything, so no big deal either way.)  The entire front piece is covered in velcro loops, and the pack piece has velcro hooks that attach from both sides.  I like that the sizing of this is universal -- there seems to be some sizing confusion for a few other belts I&#x27;ve looked at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this belt when I was strongly advised by my doctor to get something supportive.  I have had aggravated asthma during this pregnancy, and I have coughed so much that I strained a lower abdominal muscle.  (Probably doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;m also carting around a toddler!)  This belt definitely helped.  But a few weeks after I bought this, I realized that I also have an abdominal muscle separation (diastasis recti).  This is a common pregnancy condition and I would actually advise any pregnant lady to look up and see if it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re dealing with before you choose a pregnancy support belt.  (It&#x27;s easy to Google this and check at home to see whether your muscles have separated.)  I ended up buying a different belt, the [[ASIN:B000WFWN1W Gabrialla Maternity Support Belt (Strong Support), MEDIUM]], which provides a bit more general support than the Soft Form belt while also helping with some of these new issues associatedwith the diastasis.  (I also find it more comfortable and quicker to put on than the Soft Form, but that&#x27;s probably just personal preference.)  So while the Soft Form belt is great, I wish I&#x27;d just gone straight to the Gabrialla instead of buying two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I can definitely give a strong recommendation for the Soft Form belt.  It&#x27;s very helpful and comfortable.  Furthermore, I&#x27;d recommend that any pregnant woman consider a support belt of some kind, and this one would be a great choice.  During my first pregnancy, I thought it would be a \\&quot;cop out\\&quot; for an otherwise healthy woman to purchase a support belt.  But this belt makes carrying the belly more efficient, alleviating unnecessary strain and -- if you so choose -- giving you the opportunity to let the rest of your body be more active.  That is a very, very good thing.  :o)</li>
    <li> Prior to my pregnancy, I have a history of low back pain.  I wear a lumbar support back brace to work daily as I am on my feet most of the day.  Upon pregnancy, my chiropractor suggested a replacement maternity back brace.  I started using this brace at the start of my second trimester.  I am toward the end of my second trimester and still find this brace helpful.  I am unsure if it will fit and work late in my pregnancy, but to date I have found it works well to replace my previous brace.  I was used to wearing a similar brace, so I don&#x27;t find it iritating or difficult to wear.  (I do wear a t-shirt between the brace and my skin).  It can be a bit tricky to get both sides of the brace velcroed in place and adjusted the way I want it, I have noticed.  Overall, I am pleased with this brace to replace my trusty old back brace.  Time will tell if it will be supportive enough when I have a larger abdomen to support.</li>
    <li> Worst customer experience ever!!!!!  I wanted to return it.  Told me no way, since i had opened it and tried it on.  NO WHERE on the website does it say to not try it on if you wanna return it, but you kinda need to try it on to see if it works for you... She was soooooo rude, she told me is was federal guidelines but they don&#x27;t say it anywhere on website.  When I contested this she just hung up the phone on me, so i called back got her again, and as soon as i spoke she hung up on me, when i said i wanted to speak to a mgr she hung up on me right away.  WORST SERVICE EVER.  I later called to return it and got same answer and tone...  So i was going to resell it on amazon, or send it back for an exchange but they have nothing i needed or wanted it&#x27;s all hospital supply stuff and socks...  so i decided to keep it.  Upon retrying it on, I liked the product and was glad i kept it.  IT was described as a maternity belt when it was more a back support belt.  I felt it didn&#x27;t hold my belly up as much as i needed, however, when i retried it on it felt better.  I believe it was because i was further along in my pregnancy and it worked more like it was supposed to.  all in all great product but I would NEVER buy from MEDLINE again.  RUDE RUDE RUDE AND FALSLY ADVERTISED AND LABELED (NO RETURN POLICY AND WHEN I TRIED TO PROVE IT GOT HUNG UP ON MULTIPLE TIMES)</li>
    <li> i am so grateful to this support belt. i feel a whole lot better now that my back is supported and some of that weight is lifted.</li>
    <li> This  product caused  more pain  by pulling the arch of my back deeper.  The product was also non returnable which was very  disappointing  considering  it was unusable.</li>
    <li> I am 7 months pregnant with twins and have mostly used this when standing for work and taking walks.  The support has been good and the large velcro area makes it easy to adjust for many positions depending on what I am doing or how you may be carrying.  It is not as comfortable for sitting, but I did not find it uncomfortable as some other reviewers noted (no digging).  I have not used the thin support straps.  Pre-pregnancy I am 5&#x27;7\\&quot; and 135 pounds (I bought the medium).  I think it will have enough expansion room that I can use it to the end of my pregnancy (so far I have gained about 20 pounds with the twins).</li>
    <li> I bought it for the second time. You need time to get used to it because it may seem not very comfortable from the beginning, but its great for relieving back pain and nerve pain shooting down my leg from the weight at the last weeks of pregnancy. I definitely recommend it. Remember to get the right size so velcro won&#x27;t  irritate your legs. I also discovered that the additional strap I never used before is very helpful to prevent the belt sliding during the last weeks</li>
    <li> i like the support i get from this belt it has made a big difference but my only complaint is that it is hard to hide under your clothes.other than that it is a great product</li>
    <li> Many of my girlfriends suggested getting a support belt and the price was right for this one. I haven&#x27;t tried any other belts, so maybe there is something else out there that is even better, but here&#x27;s what I do know:&lt;br /&gt;- you can throw it in the wash, so that&#x27;s great&lt;br /&gt;- it fit well&lt;br /&gt;- it gave great support</li>
    <li> This support belt has been a life saver for me through the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of my past two pregnancies. I wear it for abdominal support, not back support. My abdominal muscles separate during pregnancy (severe diastasis recti) and do nothing to support my growing baby. I wear the support belt backwards &amp; upside down with the support ribbing in the front under my belly. It gives enough support to keep my heavy, growing baby off of my pelvis and allows me to be mobile and functioning as mommy to 4 young children. Before I found this belt, I was in so much pain during pregnancy with baby pressure on my pelvis that I was confined to the couch, lying on my side. I could hardly walk or breathe because of the pressure on my pelvis and organs. This support belt is worth every penny. I wear it over my clothing, and towards the end of my pregnancies, I&#x27;ve found relief and support from wearing it to sleep as well. Buy 2 so you can still wear one while the other is out of the wash and hanging to dry.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable I could not even wear it it has some hard parts on the back...that was hurting my back</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was about 24 weeks pregnant.  I was having low back pain and rectus abdominal muscle pain.  By the end of the day, I was hurting so bad, I couldn&#x27;t cook or get laundry done or anything when I got home.  Since wearing this brace, my pain has been decreased greatly!  Now I am still comfortable enough to get a few things done at home after work.  I also tried 2 other support belts that were smaller, but none of them provided enough support.  The only thing I don not like it that I do have to wear it with a shirt or belly band underneath it.  It is too itchy on my skin.  Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> The support belt came promptly and it&#x27;s easy to put on and take off. I purchased it because I was having hip and lower back pains from pregnancy, and when I put it on-immediate relief. I wore it one day, and my pain was gone. It has worked so well that I have only worn it a few hours on a few occasions, maybe a total of 5 times, and it works wonders every time. Very handy to have!</li>
    <li> Ordered this belt for my 25th week.  I was experiencing back and rib pains and was having trouble sleeping.  When this belt arrived I noticed that the brand on the package was not \\&quot;Soft Form\\&quot;, as listed on the Amazon website, but \\&quot;TruForm\\&quot;.  I have had good experiences with TruForm products, so I let it slide.  The website lists the Small size as a dress size from 2-6, which I am a size 6.  However, the product barely fit around my waist.  My husband had to help me pull it tight around my waist to reach the velcro, and I was not comfortable pulling the belt that tight around my waist.  I was only in my 25th week, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine this belt working in my third trimester, once my belly really started growing.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, I thought the quality of the belt was very good.  I am still happly with TruForm products.&lt;br /&gt;The day I received this product, I ordered the next size (medium) from the same company.  Once again, the product they sent me was not the \\&quot;Soft Form\\&quot; brand.  But this time, I did not recognize the brand.  The quality of the second belt was not as good as the Truform brand.  However, the size was much better and would accomodate me when my belly would get bigger.  After one week the piece in the front stretched out and would wrinkle up.  It wasn&#x27;t supporting my belly as well as the first belt I ordered, which was thicker and had vertical supports to keep the belt from being pushed down by my belly.  The elastic belt that holds the front piece in place began to lose its elasticity.  So now, I use the front piece from the first belt I ordered (TruForm) with the back support piece from the second belt I ordered, since it was longer.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend using a pregnancy support belt, but I would be cautious about this supplier since they don&#x27;t send the same brand they advertise on the Amazon website.  If I were to buy one again, I would make sure to find the TruForm brand or find one from a local store that I could see and try on first.</li>
    <li> I started having pelvic girdle pain at about 6 1/2 months pregnant, to the point where I would go out for a walk and get up the block and not be able to make it home because of the pain. I first thought it was just from the weight of the baby, but I was also having pain getting out of cars, which is also associated with symphysis pubic dysfunction. I thought this belt looked the most supportive of any others I had seen, so I chanced it and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First complaint, the instructions are VERY lacking. There are kind of a ridiculous amount of pieces to this item, it&#x27;s not as easy to get on your body as it may look from the picture, and the instructions are incredibly vague. The first time I wore it, I&#x27;m pretty sure I had the front section upside down because I came home from my walk in the worst pain I had ever felt. I gave it a second chance though, and found that the front piece fit better if I flipped it around, to what I now believe is right side up, but the directions should have indicated which side was up, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;It would also be easy to flip the backside upside down. I&#x27;m still not 100% convinced I&#x27;m wearing it right.&lt;br /&gt;Second complaint, the sizing! I was a pre-pregnancy 10, so the Medium should fit perfect right? Wrong! It just barely fits, it&#x27;s at the very edge of the velcro, in fact a little bit of the rough side of the velcro hangs over and rubs against my skin. Ouch. And who knows how much longer I&#x27;ll be able to wear it, I have 11 weeks to go.&lt;br /&gt;Third complaint, not very discreet. It&#x27;s bulky &amp; obvious under clothes. Luckily I don&#x27;t care too much about this.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been able to make it work so that I can take my walks without pain. That&#x27;s what I really wanted, so I guess I&#x27;m happy. However, if it wasn&#x27;t for the shipper&#x27;s lousy no-return policy, this thing would for sure be going back so I could look for a less complicated &amp; more comfortable support belt.</li>
    <li> My hips have been \\&quot;buckling in\\&quot; right from the beginning of my 4th pregnancy.  My lower back and sacrum area were getting sore as soon as I entered the 3rd trimester.  Now that I have this brace on, I have no fear that my hips will buckle in and it is easing the pain on my lower back/hips.    There&#x27;s a notice on the box \\&quot;Due to health and sanitary issues, this item may not be returned, exchanged or credited once it has been opened.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a good thing that whatever size I got, which was \\&quot;Universal (Medium)\\&quot; was able to fit me well even though I was a Petite/Size 4 Pre-pregnancy.  I&#x27;m not carrying multiples.     The little size guide it included said this:    Dress size before pregnancy  Petite: 2-6  Universal (Med.):  6-14  Large:   16-20    I will now take a walk and later attend prenatal yoga class. I want to test if this brace will keep up with me.  I will update this review if I have anything to add.</li>
    <li> Uncomfortable, but did pull my tummy in. Got a tummy ache after wearing it, but that&#x27;s probably just me. Also didn&#x27;t look good under clothes. You&#x27;d only be able to hid it in a huge over-sized sweater.</li>
    <li> Was not at all comfortable &amp; didn&#x27;t actually help that much at all. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to help with back &amp; hip pain. Also to help with pelvic pressure. It didn&#x27;t help with any of that &amp; it caused my stomach to hurt! It was very uncomfortable. You can&#x27;t sit in it without it rolling up &amp; jabbing you! I was hopeful this product would work even with the mixed reviews, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> The belt is extremely durable &amp; helped the pain in my back from pregnancy. Great for the price! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Two problems with this belt.  One is it&#x27;s too small.  It&#x27;s supposed to fit up to size 14, but it doesn&#x27;t.  At five months of pregnancy it barely fits.  In a month or two, it won&#x27;t fit at all.  The other problem, when I sit down, the front bottom digs into my belly and I spend most of my day sitting.  Not what you&#x27;d call comfy.  I hate wasting money!</li>
    <li> My wife wears this thing all day every day.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive but she&#x27;s worth it.  It really supports her back</li>
    <li> This belt is GREAT!  I wish I would have had it with my previous 3 pregnancies.  With this 4th pregnancy; my back has really been hurting.  I was finding it difficult to do normal daily tasks such as dishes.  I had to sit on a stool to do them.  This belt has enabled me to get back on my feet and take care of everyone who counts on me.  With the holidays upon us; this belt has been an instrumental part of my being able to participate in all of the fun.</li>
    <li> This belt has provided much-needed support for my 3rd pregnancy.  I have been surprised at how comfortable it is to wear -- not only for the belly/back support it provides but the fact that it breathes, doesn&#x27;t itch, and doesn&#x27;t compress the baby while I am sitting.  It is a huge improvement over the no-frills Motherhood Maternity elastic band that I wore occasionally during my last pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing I had a double level lower back fusion a year ago and I got pregnant since i was still having problems with my back i thought i will try this out as the weight of my belly was making my pain worse...Well, I can definately tell you this has helped me so much for my posture, for the support and also because of the convenience of being so thin so u can always use it underneath your clothing...I do recommend tho to use thin clothing underneath as sometimes you tend to put it wrong and it can be a bit unconfortable...u also need to realised that this is not a magic wand so it does not takes the pain away it just helps to eased it up a bit..Put it this way b4 i got it I was getting pain that was making me walk like a very old person but now i can move easily &#x3D;)   Hope this helps out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently 29 weeks pregnant with twins and measure full term.  Wow, what a difference this makes!!  It actually feels like my belly is lighter.  I have less back pain.  I have less pelvic pain.  I feel like I can move around easier.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I hate it. it is not comfortable at all. i would like to return it for a refund. How do i go about this?</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t help my sciatica pain (as people have said) but it was great to wear when on my feet cleaning / laundry - really helped with the pain</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great belt. It supports back, and the belly in the front. It helps a lot while I&#x27;m working.</li>
    <li> The package came and was already opened, Ordered Medium....but  No medium or large size on the package.&lt;br /&gt;This item was defective because the velcro sticks out around the edges and scratches my skin. I guess it does what it should, if you can be compelled to wear it! Its giving me a rashes on my skin. I wants to have a replacement because the product does not made properly.  No returns because &amp;#34;FDA regulations if product has been opened or tried on we cannot take it back due to sanitary and bacteria&amp;#34;. which was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I Really Love This Belt, Only Problem Was No Instructions Were Included:( At Least YouTube Helped:)</li>
    <li> at 7 months pregnant this was helpful when walking around at work, doing laundry, or cleaning the house.  Gave good support.  The velcro area did start to fuzz up pretty quickly but, I did put this thing through the ringer and it still works fine.  Will use it for next baby.</li>
    <li> Very nice. My daughter is 5 foot and was having back trouble till we found this. Very soft, very comfortable and helped a lot to balance the belly weight.</li>
    <li> My wife used this almost daily while she was pregnant withour children.  She said it really helped relieve her lower back pain.</li>
    <li> Bulky and hard to use. Way too many contraptions</li>
    <li> The support arrived just in time for us to move and I was able to go to bed that night with no back pain!  I love that it supports the belly as well as providing back support.  The only drawback is that it is too itchy to wear under clothing.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these after my doctor recommended it for my round ligament pain and backaches.  I can honestly say that the relief it provided was immediate and intense.  I didn&#x27;t even realize how heavy my tummy had become until I had the support this belt provided, and I really wish I&#x27;d had one for my first pregnancy.  It&#x27;s not exactly a smooth fit under clothing, so I only wear it after work in the evenings, but it has made a world of difference in my overall comfort level.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for prego tummy support! Excellent for even postpartum tummy support. This is the only belly support you need. Don&#x27;t waste money in anything else.</li>
    <li> This support belt really made a difference in my 3rd trimester. It takes some of the pressure off your lower back. Don&#x27;t expect to not feel the weight of the belly at all, but there is noticeable relief. The velcro &amp; straps dig in a little, so it&#x27;s not something I could wear the whole day, but easily made it for 2 hours at a time.</li>
    <li> I started using this belt starting week 20 of my pregnancy in 3 occasions: long walks, cardio exercises and while cooking (since I have to stand for a long time). It provides great support!!! In my 3rd trimester I started using it all the time and so happy that I chose this particular belt. It&#x27;s very easy to put on, adjust it when needed and it fits well under my maternity clothes. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s highly recommended and works great. I use it everyday for my back and to help me carry my baby, it puts less pressure on your back</li>
    <li> Love the belt, works very well especially since I am expecting twins . gives good back posture as well . Def would recommend this product !!</li>
    <li> It is comfortable although it did look a bit different than what the picture displayed. I was not sure how to use it and would have liked instructions in terms of where to place the different straps.</li>
    <li> After talking to our obstetrician (which I recommend before you buy), we decided to purchase this.  My wife loved it, and it helped relieve her back pain.  She wore it outside of her shirt around the house and under it when we would go out.</li>
    <li> I thought this would help but it made things worse. I was so short of breath with it on I couldn&#x27;t wear it. (I was also pregnant with twins)</li>
    <li> Pregnant with twins.  Early on in the pregnancy I started having back to leg discomfort.  This was part of the cure.  When I didn&#x27;t wear it, I was in severe pain.  Taking it easy was e other part of my cure.  Highly recommend.  Started using in late first trimester thru term.  Babies are 6mos old.</li>
    <li> I carried my second low and way out front. I was suffering from sciatic nerve pain and was hard for me to walk around. It helped me to get around and chase my two year old a little better and especially keep up during the busy summer. A must for those suffering from sciatic nerve pain and carrying low.  Comfortable, but it is warm in the summer.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing but it ended up being too small for me after a couple of weeks.  Wish there was a size for bigger sized women.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t something to use when you are sitting down or or driving. Very uncomfortable. But it does help with the pain.</li>
    <li> Cannot review.  This was a gift for a woman waiting tables at a banquet with a fairly large tummy.  When I asked about her back she said it really hurt. So...</li>
    <li> This was 4 my wife .. She said it is very helpful.. Especially for the one having more than one child before..</li>
    <li> Nice maternity belt and great price.  Arrived in a timely fashion.  Complaint has to do with me being too short and the corset digging into my back and butt.</li>
    <li> When I initially placed the belt on, I thought I would like it.  However, if you are active at all it does not work well.  I am working full time as a veterinarian through my pregnancy and spend a large portion of my day squatting up and down to examine bigger dogs, kneeling, sitting on the floor, and lifting pets.  The thing was constantly riding up and I was tugging it down, therefore not providing any support for my belly or back.  There are many different adjustments you can make for varying tightness, and I tried different adjustments for about a week.  I tried it again a few weeks later when I was getting a bit bigger as well.  I always ended up giving up by lunch and taking it off.  I would return it but the box was thrown away by accident.  I am 21 weeks, average weight and height, and definitely have a belly.</li>
    <li> It rides up when you sit down and digs into your legs. It&#x27;s great to use while standing, but you have to take it off if you are going to sit.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my wife&#x27;s last pregnancy as she needed extra support for her belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she used it daily for about a couple of weeks, I noticed that eventually she stopped using it. When I asked her why she said that it was uncomfortable and that she was better without it. She then used it sparingly throughout the rest of her pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This support belt is comfortable and supportive. It makes a big difference with my back, pelvis and hip pain. Some reviews complain the velcro is uncomfortable. I just wear mine with a beband under it, or over my maternity pants.</li>
    <li> This maternity belt has been a lifesaver. I am at the beginning of my third trimester and moving in to a new home. After a couple of days of getting the house together, I was experiencing fatigue and back pain to the point that I couldn&#x27;t do any physical activity at all. I have to walk several blocks to work each day and was desperate to find something to help ease the back pain and make it easier to stay active. I bought this belt out of desperation, and was so excited to find that it worked immediately. I only wear it when I&#x27;m on my feet. It can be uncomfortable to wear when sitting, but I highly recommend this belt if you need some support when moving around.</li>
    <li> I tried another belly support which didn&#x27;t offer much support at all. This one was fabulous!   Since I had twins, my belly got large &amp; I started getting sciatica to the point where it was painful to walk. I wore it every waking moment for the last several months, &amp; I had no pain at all. When I took it off for a while (an hour or two), the pain came back. The velcro can rub your leg, which is uncomfortable, but I just moved the band up so that wouldn&#x27;t happen. Definitely worth getting! (BTW I didn&#x27;t use the top band that goes over your belly.)</li>
    <li> I have only used this product about three times so far. It has been most helpful when I was doing bending over type work (picking asparagus). I could really tell it was working.&lt;br /&gt;I like materials that it is made if. They are not too stiff, but feel strong. It also contours in at my waist tightly which feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend highly for anyone with pregnancy back pain!</li>
    <li> NOT a USA product. Came from China. Took WEEKS to get here! Ordered Medium....they sent a Large. Scratchy material across the back...some sort of rough netting. Did not fit. NOT USEABLE. Can&#x27;t be bothered to send back. Will sell to a consignment shop for less than half of what I paid for it. Thats all it worth!</li>
    <li> It came in the mail on time and was pretty comparable to others similar to it in price. I found that it really helped with my lower back pain and the heaviness felt by the huge bump. Had to wear it over the clothes though because it got really sweaty really fast (even in the middle of winter) and the Velcro was a bit scratchy. Other than that, it was a huge life saver!</li>
    <li> I am 7 month pregnancy, and  feel uncomfortable with my pelvic. After searching for something to support my belly,I bought this one. In fact, I don&#x27;t use it when I am at home because it&#x27;s a little tight, but when I go out it&#x27;s really a big help. I highly recomment this product for any mom-to-be who loves walking like me.</li>
    <li> This product definitely gives back and belly support. I do however run into a problem with my symphysis pubis dysfunction. In supporting the back, it squeezes the top of my pelvis and opens my PS and hips and makes for a very sore pelvis. It also pushes the baby up into my lungs more and makes it harder to breathe. I think for most pregnant women, it is a great investment, but those of us with loose joints and pelvic issues may have to pick which pain is worse at the time and only wear it for small intervals. I&#x27;m still deciding whether it was worth the money for me... maybe coupled with a trochanter belt?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 39 weeks preggers now and this has provided me great support from the lower back and round ligament pains during the last stages. However, the velcro and material wears really fast and the belt actually gets uncomfortable and feels like its applying too much pressure and pushing baby back &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; inside. Overall, I would use it again if I were having more children.</li>
    <li> This helped with anterior pressure in the abdomen and with low back pain, but has not eased any of the sacroiliac or pubic symphysis pain at all which is what I bought it for.  I was hoping I could walk better by wearing it, maybe my symptoms are just too severe.</li>
    <li> This is probably a good product because my doctor liked it when I showed it to her but I could not use it for too long because of the way I was carrying. But otherwise I think it would be very helpful. I used it after my c section and it helped a lot.</li>
    <li> This really helped out my friend. she was soo big and carried mostly in the front. She stayed active thru her pregnancy and it really made a difference for her. She was soooo happy I reccomended her to get this item.</li>
    <li> This helped my mother with her pregnancy more than we could imagine. She wore it everyday and could not leave the house without it because it provided such great support. This does its job and can fit pretty much all sized bellies. Nothing bad about it. Excellent!</li>
    <li> es un buen producto, es comodo y se ajusta a mis necesidades. llego en un excelente tiempo y el precio es muy conveniente</li>
    <li> Great product... Take away my back pain.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m sleeping without the terrible pain.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Very good support for expecting mom. Fine Quality belt.</li>
    <li> This product rolled over and worked it&#x27;s way up rather than staying around my belly. Great as long as I remained standing. But once I sat down it moved and it had to be readjusted.</li>
    <li> the product i buy ad amozone still now are excellent for my like this Marternity support belt so good using</li>
    <li> I have been using this support throughout my third trimester of a twin pregnancy.  I have not used the over the stomach strap really at all, and I do wear it over my pants to avoid some of the itching problems others mentioned from the velcro.  While it was inconvenient to take it off and put it back on with all of the frequent bathroom trips a pregnant woman makes, I found it well worth the bother.  My physical therapist was also impressed that it seemed to keep my back straight (vs. the typical forward sway of the lower back in late pregnancy).  I&#x27;m in my 37th week of this twin pregnancy now and have had no strong back pain through this pregnancy, which is a minor miracle because I have had chronic back issues for years, including a major flare-up right before I got pregnant.  I definitely recommend this support.  Pelvic tilts are also key for keeping back pain at bay.</li>
    <li> This helped me a lot with my lower back pain during pregnancy. So I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Would recommend this product to anyone pregnant suffering from low back pain!! I used this belly support since I was carrying my baby low and had to work. Loved it! Fast shipping! Smooth transaction! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had major pelvic pain in my pregnancy, and exercise made it even worse! I purchased this to help ease the pressure on my pelvis. I had gestational diabetes and was ordered to exercise every day to control it. I wore this as I walked (usually about 45 minutes per day), and it was the only thing that helped me. Without it, I would have barely been able to move after exercising. I highly recommend this to anyone with pain from pressure on the pelvis!</li>
    <li> Excellent back support for carrying my daugther that is low. Before the support I suffered from back and upper back pain.  I would highly recommend and I plan to save in case I need it for my 3rd pregnancy. The belly is sensitive as it is so place a soft shirt under the support to avoid scraps from the velcro.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this item, because I have been in a lot of pain due to my pregnancy. When I received it I immediately put it on. Not as comfortable as I hoped it would be. Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I received the belt pretty quickly.  It is comfortable for the most part.  I usually wear it on top of a tank top so my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated or itchy.  I have been using it for 2 months and there are some folds that are forming in the belt.  But it&#x27;s still doing its job.</li>
    <li> [Thrilled to receive this (in NJ) way earlier than expected, even before the seller&#x27;s delivery range (thank you!)!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it yesterday and have been wearing it all day.  Usually, by 5pm, I am lethargic and have to have my feet up.  I feel so much more energetic because I have little to NO back pain!  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s pretty stretchy, I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about the sizing.  I was a size 4 pre-pregnancy, and now I&#x27;m 32 weeks (with quite the basketball bulge) and the Universal (which doesn&#x27;t say medium anywhere on the packaging) really supports but also has so much velcro and stretch that it could fit a woman both a few sizes larger AND smaller than myself.  I wear it over clothing so I don&#x27;t sweat on to it and I imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be as comfortable on skin.  Hope that helps (because I read the reviews before every purchase!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;3 Alex</li>
    <li> I still give it five stars, because I believe this back brace would help in most situations.  Unfortunately, I have severe tailbone pain - and I have found that this brace is probably more for Lumbar back pain (and maybe some thoracic).  It does support my 5 month pregnant belly well, though I don&#x27;t need that top strap at this point.  It is very soft and comfortable - even when worn directly on my skin.  The only time I found it was itchy was when I didn&#x27;t attach one side very centered on the front belly strap, and the velcro scratched at me a little.&lt;br /&gt;I am a pregnant-sized 11 jeans, with medium sized top, and the medium brace fit me perfectly.  It will continue to fit the whole pregnancy too - even though I am carrying LOW and still pretty pointy into the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product.  Only one down-side:  The directions are definitely not helpful in applying this brace -I had to look at pictures closely to make sure I &#x27;installed&#x27; it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - and yes, it&#x27;s slightly bulky, but I don&#x27;t wear anything skin tight, but pretty close.  You can see it if you&#x27;re looking for it, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable.  It&#x27;s more just the outline of it, than bulky lumps.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps make your decision.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended I use something like this during my second pregnancy for my back pain.  This did the job and was affordable.  It&#x27;s highly adjustable.  Gets uncomfortable and digs into the skin after awhile as I imagine most of these supporters do. Was great for walks, when doing house work and if I had a long drive.  Not good for sitting comfortably - while watching TV on the couch for example.</li>
    <li> This product is soft and supportive.  It is very comfortable to wear.  I cannot believe the difference it has made reducing the pressure on my back.  I have never written a review before but felt compelled after receiving this support.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what everyone is raving about (except that when the seller sends this product, they bribe you with free stuff and coupons if you leave a favorable review) - this support belt is not that great.  It&#x27;s OK, but not what I expected based on these reviews.  Here are the problems with it:  The back part is so wide, it digs into your thighs when you go down stairs or sit down.  The top strap does not help at all as far as I can tell (I&#x27;m 6 mos pregnant, maybe it will be more useful later on).  It does help support the abdomen if you are carrying your baby low.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very supportive of my back, but I have back problems even when not pregnant.  If I can get this to stop digging into my thighs, I&#x27;ll be glad I got it, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any better than any other maternity belt out there.</li>
    <li> I am expecting twins and I had purchased another brace previously that worked well for 1 month..but as I got bigger I needed some more support...this brace makes a differenct on my sacro-illiac joint.  I ordered the Extra large...glad I did...my waist size is now 46.5 inches and I&#x27;m 27 weeks. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this belt after developing extreme pubis symphysis pain.  I was hardly able to walk, roll over in bed, etc. I did do one chiropractic session which I think helped a little, but this band after wearing it for 2 days is a Godsend. The brand was Curad and actually included good instructions on the box (whereas another brand I purchased did). Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy to put on and off.  The medium fits well -- I was typically a small before pregnancy (wearing pant sizes 2 or 4) but the medium seems great and should allow for good room to grow (still have  2 1/2 months to go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band is actually pretty comfortable, even when sitting (I have a desk job) -- I may bail on the over-the-belly band though, as that does tend to cause a little irritation and I dont notice the support band sliding at all, so I dont think I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are experiencing this pain, do not wait another minute -- order this belt express delivery and hopefully it will help you as it has helped me.</li>
    <li> SO far I have used my maternity belt a few times and it brings some relief. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Good product for my wife&#x27;s back pain when she was pregnant!.  She didn&#x27;t heavily use it but she like it</li>
    <li> Worst decision to buy this! Can&#x27;t wear it against my skin because it&#x27;s very irritating. Can&#x27;t wear it under even loose clothing because it sticks out in places &amp; looks obvious. Therefore, to use, you&#x27;ll have 3 layers around your waist. Maybe it will be good for the winter when it&#x27;s cold anyway but it&#x27;s impossible in the summer! No returns because \\&quot;FDA regulations if product has been opened or tried on we cannot take it back due to sanitary and bacteria\\&quot;. Save your money!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t totally work on me. It&#x27;s almost too long and I have a long body to begin w/ so I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;d work on someone w/ a short body! It hits the bottom of my ribs and then if I sit it won&#x27;t stay down. Other then that, it seems to work. I&#x27;m wishing I had gotten just a strap one like motherhood maternity has and I&#x27;m just too cheap to go and buy that after buying this one ( since I can&#x27;t return this one).</li>
    <li> Great support throughout my pregnancy!  I would recommend it for anyone experiencing back pain due to long periods of time standing or sitting.</li>
    <li> I am carrying very heavy in the front.  Before pregnancy I was a xs/s.  now I&#x27;m wearing m/L maternity clothes. I grew big very quickly.  I can barely stand up to wash dishes. The band has really helped to alleviate back and hip pain from the standing. I can&#x27;t wear it all day though because the baby doesn&#x27;t want it taking up his space.</li>
    <li> This got so many high ratings and looked perfect.  However, It was incredible uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone could sit in it.  AND if you&#x27;ve tried it on you cannot return it.  That&#x27;s unacceptable.  How would you know if you want to return it if you cannot try it on?  Please save your money.  Try to find this in a store so you can try it on.  Don&#x27;t order it online.  I just lost money.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m sure it would have been great for support on pregnant women based on it&#x27;s texture at least! but my sister gave birth at 25 weeks before this arrived. we were planning she&#x27;d use this on her 3rd trimester but oh well things happens. i would just like to appear on your generous hearts to pray for my nephews recovery, baby mateo rafel!TIA</li>
    <li> My belly was seriously weighing me down. I&#x27;m a waitress/bartender, plus I do lady night parties, so I&#x27;m constantly on my feet. When I wore the brace it helped, temporarily. I think I needed something that had more support because I was all belly with an 8 lbs baby. But for the price, this brace is ideal. Its also very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I was on my fourth pregnancy before I discovered the saving grace of maternity support belts! These are awesome if you have back pain issues!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I don&#x27;t know if this is the best one you can get (it&#x27;s the only one I tried). The lower band in the front tended to bunch up under the weight of my belly, and I found the upper elastic band itchy and not very useful. If I were going through another pregnancy, I would try another brand to see if it was any better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this belt for my mother who is recover from cancer treatments and is mostly in bed. She was having hard time standing without extreme back aches, this belt is soft and light enough to wear all time. She is about 5 feet and 125 lbs and medium was perfect for her.</li>
    <li> My wife is a labor and delivery nurse and spends the vast majority of her shift (12 hours), on her feet. An OB Dr.  at the hospital recommended a back support sling to help eliminate back pain and the strain that accompanies the pull on the lower belly. We found this one on Amazon and now she can not go out without it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with instructions. I had no idea if I had it on right.</li>
    <li> it was everything you said it would do. she can wear it with almost everything she has. i recommend this product</li>
    <li> Despite being hideous, this belt is a lifesaver!! Not visible under clothes unless you&#x27;re wearing something very tight. Even fitted, ruched maternity t-shirts don&#x27;t show it, but super tight tanks do. If you were trying to wear a skin tight maternity dress, you couldn&#x27;t wear this, but something slim fit would be fine. Love the belt!!</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying this since it had some mixed reviews. But I&#x27;m very happy that I did. I am 27 weeks pregnant with my second child and I wish I had this the first time around. It definitely lifts your belly and you feel a huge weight lifted off your back. It is extremely supportive. So far I&#x27;ve used it without the top strap (over the top of my belly), so I can&#x27;t say how that works. But the fabric is soft and pliable, not scratchy like some other people have mentioned. Yes, if you wear a tight shirt, people will be able to see it. But do you want support or do you want it completely hidden? The two don&#x27;t go hand-in-hand. Most maternity tops are fairly loose around the belly anyway. I have worn tank tops under it and my main shirt over it several times too, just for the added comfort of feeling fabric against my skin and not the belt. But I love it and would recommend it to anyone who is feeling like they need a some support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to wear 24 hours a day, you don&#x27;t want to weaken your back muscles, just help support them. I would recommend you wear it when you&#x27;re going to be standing a lot or going for a walk or something. Then leave it off if you&#x27;ll be doing a lot of sitting or relaxing, because it isn&#x27;t necessary at those times and you should give your body a break and make it use it&#x27;s own muscles too. Plus, if you sit with it on for long periods of time, I feel like it makes it a little bit hard to breathe because it&#x27;s lifting your belly so well it almost impedes on your lung space. That&#x27;s why I would suggest it for standing or walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped sooner than they said it would and got here quickly. There aren&#x27;t a ton of instructions for it, just some simple ones on the box. But they are sufficient.</li>
    <li> Got it for a friend, not a pregnant woman, just a woman with a bad back that has to work.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> It worked fine, but not what I expected</li>
    <li> After I bought this product, my obgyn said it&#x27;s useless as a support belt, so I didn&#x27;t even bother trying it. The package came and I never opened it to try it on.&lt;br /&gt;Seller&#x27;s return policy is ridiculous for unused, unopened items. They can only offer store credit.&lt;br /&gt;I was instructed to go to their store front to get something in exchange, but there is no information on how I&#x27;m supposed to actually do the exchange.&lt;br /&gt;They clearly do not care about customers. Also, given this type of strict policy, they should have clearly disclosed this at the time of purchase rather than expect the customer to dig through the fine print.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Bought for my daughter and she loves it.  Excellent support for her growing tummy. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> What a godsend for my back during those last couple of months when I needed support during my afternoon walks and trips to the store! So glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> It gave me great support when going for walks. Without the belt, I would get a pain in the lower part of my belly at after walking approximately 1/2 mile (at the end of my pregnancy). With the belt, that pain did not come at all in my 2 mile walk. I just wish it was easier to put on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting my third trimester with twins and wow this makes a HUGE difference in how I feel throughout the day.  When I don&#x27;t wear the belt I feel like I can hardly move from the pressure on my pelvic floor (the twins are both head down and measuring larger than average).  My doctor suggested a belt like this since it is more adjustable - the stomach piece is separate from the back piece.  Some people may not like this, but for me I think it&#x27;s great because I can really conform the belt to my belly and customize my support.  The over the belly strap is really just there to keep the belt from shifting left or right as you stand up/sit down, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problems with this shifting or rolling when I sit or move throughout the day.</li>
    <li> After studying all of the various maternity support products on the market, I selected this one for a friend when she was about 5-6 months pregnant. Do not look any farther.  This has absolutely got to be the best engineered product of its type ANYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;It gave her immediate relief. She walked instead of waddling she was able to move in general as if she weren&#x27;t pregnant. SHe said she also wore it to bed and it helped her sleep much better.  Furthermore it relieved the urge to go to the bathroom every 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The band that is anchored from the back and goes around the top of the tummy makes a HUGE difference.  The color is a true nude, better than as shown in the pictures.  The entire band is adjustable from every angle.  The sides are non slip breathable material.  How I wish I had had one of these when I was pregnant! Buy it or recommend this belt ONLY for anyone you know who is expecting.  I have no connection to this company.  Just can&#x27;t say enough about the stellar quality of the Soft Form Maternity Support Belt and was very proud that I figured out which one to buy that was different from all the others and ended up having  such a huge positive effect for my friend.  I only wish I had spotted it in the very beginning of her pregnancy so she could have enjoyed the benefits the entire term</li>
    <li> My wife is 29 weeks pregnant and she was experiencing horrible back pain. At first they thought it was sciatic pain, but it turned out to be pelvic girdle pain (which has the same type of horrible nerve pain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, she was in so much pain that she could even walk. Massage and heat did NOTHING to help. After seeing her suffer and reading the reviews, I bought this (against my wife&#x27;s decision since she didn&#x27;t think it would work and wasn&#x27;t worth the money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally within about 2 minutes of wearing the belt her pain level went from being around an 8 / 9 to about a 5 out of 10. A few hours later her pain level was at 1 or 2. She was amazed at how much relief she experienced and how quickly it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been wearing it now for 3 days and she is VERY happy with the results. Some people complained that the material was itchy or uncomfortable, but she said it feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT noticeable under her clothes, but she said she&#x27;d wear it regardless since it provides sooo much relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you experiencing this type of nerve pain during pregnancy (i guess its estimated that 50% of women do at some point) please try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husbands - do not let you wife talk you out of getting this for them (as mine tried to do) it is worth the money. With the belt she is walking normal and smiling. Previous to this she was hobbling around grimacing with pain.</li>
    <li> This belt has been very helpful for my pelvic and lower back pain. It&#x27;s kinda bulky and the velcro itches so I don&#x27;t wear it under clothes. But I look forward to getting home and putting it on over my comfy clothes. If I&#x27;m having alot of pain one day I can literally feel it fading in the time after I put the belt on. This is the only one I have tried so there may be a more streamlined version that works as well. That would really be my only complaint.</li>
    <li> Definitely takes some of the weight off, but presses against the bladder increasing visits to the restroom. Also, the velcro catches on clothes and is scratchy on bare skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I started to experience lower back and hip pain in my seventh month of pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I did not find that it gave my belly or lower back much support, nor did it alleviate my pain. Also, I found the fabric scratchy and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I found that swimming regularly was the best solution for my back pain. But if I were to try another maternity support belt, I would look for one that goes over the shoulder and is made of softer fabric.</li>
    <li> I had ordered for Soft Form Maternity Support Belt, but to my surprise got a &#x27;Curad&#x27; Maternity Belt. However, it is pretty decent &amp; we are happy with that. But it would have been better if this would have been mentioned upfront since we had done research on Soft Form &amp; were expecting that product.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest invention ever! I used it until I gave birth to my daughter and I have recommended this to all my pregnant friends. It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it will help to reduce my back pain. But found out that it is not helpful for back pain.</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten a bigger size. I know it&#x27;s suppose to fit snug, but I always worry that it&#x27;s going to come off. But it does work well and supports my baby belly so it does what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> It truly did not work for me. Maybe it was the shape of my belly, or idk? but such a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> good price good quality</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help much with back pain and was a pain in the butt to put on.</li>
    <li> This helps her a lot.  We had to travel across the country via plane when she was 7 months pregnant.  She says she couldn&#x27;t have made it through all the walking without it.</li>
    <li> It works okay, but given where your pain is located or if you have round muscle ligament problems then the supportive aspect rubs right on the problem areas making it uncomfortable to sit. It was good for early pregnancy but not possible for my complicated pregnancy&#x27;s latter half.</li>
    <li> First of all, the webpage for this item does not say that it is none other than Curad belt. Also, it does not mention that if you buy it once, you cannot return. If you anyway want to buy Curad, it is available for half the price on Amazon itself. Thanks to wonderful Amazon customer service, my return was authorized as I was not comfortable wearing it as soon as I tried. The package has a big pink tag that says &amp;#34; Due to health and sanitary issues, this item may not be returned, exchanged&amp;#34;. What the hell, I am customer and if I am not happy I have all right to return it back within the normal return limit on Amazon items. If at all this belt might have such a &amp;#34;non-returnable&amp;#34; policy, it should have been written on the Amazon page where this item is advertised. Buyers please beware of such frauds and do not purchase from this seller.</li>
    <li> I have pregnancy related sacro-iliac joint dysfunction (meaning my si joint begins to separate during pregnancy). My physical Therapist actually had me try this on in her office. They didn&#x27;t have any available for sale, but after trying it on there I decided, for the price, this was a better option than my other two support belts, one of which was a comparable price, and the second being almost twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been wearing it for about three weeks now and it definitely gives me the support needed, not only helping with the SI joint pain, but also with the severe pubic symphasis pain that has resulted from a twisted pelvis placing pressure in that area. The one thing I do differently is to place the elastic strap designed to go just under the breasts around the waist instead to give added support to the soft portion of the belt. I also do not use the elastic strap that keeps the soft portion of the belt in place-it seems superfluous (the larger elastic portion serves the same purpose) and i use this also around the waist on days i feel more support is needed there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some previous reviewers made comments about this being uncomfortable when worn next to the skin or sitting down. I discussed this with my Physical Therapist, and she agreed that support belts like this are not designed to be worn next to the skin, and should be removed when sitting down. While inconvenenient to constantly be removing this belt, it is nothing compared to the pain of going without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im giving this 4 stars mainly because it doesn&#x27;t always give the support I would like it to, but I also understand that, for my condition, there really is no perfect product out there, and I&#x27;m just glad to have found something that helps with the pain.</li>
    <li> Great, very helpful, but quality could be better.  For the price I would expect it to hold up better.</li>
    <li> Good maternity belt it really helps lift the belly and helps your baby move around more I think its great</li>
    <li> I was having a lot of back soreness during my pregnancy.  This belt help alleviate a lot of the pulling of my belly on my back.  I will definitely use again if I get pregnant again.</li>
    <li> lame packaging and too expensive</li>
    <li> Universal Medium doesn&#x27;t fit well at all. If you&#x27;re not a model or rail thin to begin with, you may want a large.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful product. A must in pregnancy if you want to keep your wits in place. Worked like a charm, and was used heavily from month 3 till delivery. Supports the belly and the back beautifully. Velcro allows for easy adjustment to the size as belly grows. Washed periodically in the washer.&lt;br /&gt;One minus is that the Velcro does start to look bad after heavy use - still works though. And the belt has developed a lot of creases after 6 months of daily use. But that was expected, so no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion - great product, must-have for pregnancy and keep those babies growing while keeping the mom comfortable at the same time.</li>
    <li> It really works. I had low back pain and could not walk for a long time but now I use it every day and it just works.</li>
    <li> The belt provides good belly support, but not quite as much back support.  If worn for long periods of time seems to feel tight.  Perhaps readjusting the belt throughout the day would be helpful.  The reality is your belly grows and you probably just need to adjust it!</li>
    <li> it was a gift and the lady to whom i gave it to said that the side kept tugging her dresses. and it&#x27;s not cute to be outside and &amp;#34;be seen&amp;#34; unless you&#x27;re at home.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my sore back when I was pregnant!</li>
    <li> I was quite big by my 7-8 month of pregnancy, and I found this to be a fantastic band.  Had tried others that were uncomfortable and did not work nearly as well.  Also relatively easy to conceal under clothing.</li>
    <li> Great support but bulky to wear under clothes to work. I can wear it around the house or to run errands. Also, try to order the smallest size if you are thin; the medium almost doesn&#x27;t fit me.</li>
    <li> The belt is quite difficult to put it on! and once you finally get placed in a comfortable position it just does the work while you&#x27;re standing because it rolls under the stomach when you sit.</li>
    <li> Great support! This belt helped relieve pain in my lower back, hips and entire pelvic area. It was sturdy and worth every penny. It does show through tighter maternity outfits, but no one minds. You&#x27;re pregnant! You can get away with anything!! :)</li>
    <li> Have only had this product for two days, but already can tell a difference!  Absolutely would recommend &amp; wish I would have gotten this sooner!</li>
    <li> This band provides great support and helps relieve back pain.  It made the difference between suffering terribly and being able to walk around and accomplish daily activities.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Work well for your back.</li>
    <li> They send a Curad belt that is $10 cheaper (if you actually wanted to buy the Curad Belt). This replacement belt does not sit well and is bulky and uncomfortable. Try something else.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use and when I wear it, it really takes the weight off my back and throws it on my legs. It is so much easier for me to move when I wear this belt. When I wear this belt, my back do not hurt any more. The thing is, when I do not wear this belt, I notice how much lower back pain I have. This belt is a life saver.</li>
    <li> Great at lifting up off your pelvis. I only used it for a couple weeks tho- kind of a pain to deal with at work.</li>
    <li> I am a doctor and this helped me stand on my feet all day when on call. Not very comfortable when sitting, so generally used it for surgeries only.</li>
    <li> This support belt does what it is supposed to do.  It adds support under my belly.  I ordered it when I was about 20 weeks and have used it in a few different situations.  I just don&#x27;t really like how it feels.  My doctor recommended I try one due to some discomfort I had been having.  I liked it when I was doing yard work.  I do think it helped my back, but I don&#x27;t like just wearing it for everyday activities.</li>
    <li> not for me i never felt support need it and it bothers me all time i think i use it for 3 hours during my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Loved this while I was pregnant.  The support it gave was such a relief.  I didn&#x27;t care much for the over the tummy strap though - it just got inthe way.</li>
    <li> Not much helps when you are uber-uncomfortable experiencing terrible back pain at the end of pregnancy, but this does provide some relief.</li>
    <li> It really does support my belly &amp; it does relieves a lil bit of my back pain from the baby weight.</li>
    <li> This product is made great and supports well.  I found that after sitting for a while it started to hurt under my belly from a little too much support.</li>
    <li> I am petite and a slight back problem so I wanted so support. This belt is very thick and definitely supports but only if you wear Very Baggie clothes or tshirts. I wear nice dresses and sweaters so this belt is just too balky for something like that...</li>
    <li> I really like this Maternity belt.  I first bought a belly band from a local retailer that did not provide enough support, but this Maternity belt is perfect.  It is comfortable and also gives me enough support to get through my work day.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money!  A friend of mine - who is also an OB-GYN - recommended a support belt when I started feeling back pain toward the end of my second trimester, and I ordered this one because of the good reviews.  I was really disappointed as soon as I put it on.  Not only is it uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s also made of a scratchy material that is impossible to wear next to your skin.  Of course, you could put it on over a layer, but it&#x27;s TOTALLY obvious when you put another layer on top of that.  It&#x27;s bulky and slides down quickly (I am small-hipped to begin with), so you end up having to adjust it constantly.  I considered giving this to a pregnant friend - now that my own baby has arrived - but it actually seems like a mean gift!  Sorry, not worth it.</li>
    <li> My wife has sciatica.  This product did not help.  And her doctor said it would not help (of course, I learned this after I bought the item).  The one product that did help her was: Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow.  We give that product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
