      <li>a dream come true!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product; it really works well!</li>
      <li>This stuff is pure magic it works great.</li>
      <li>well then I might be a child in heart because I LOVE glitter</li>
      <li>I love this product,  even the cheapest eye shadow will work with this, and i have been using this for 2 years now</li>
      <li>I love wearing glitter shadow and</li>
      <li>I love this glue bc</li>
      <li>This is my favorite glitter glue.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied with this item.</li>
      <li>This is more like an eyeshadow primer.  </li>
      <li>I love to wear glitter on my eyes.</li>
      <li>Overall- great product!</li>
      <li>and I am just as pleased with this as I was with those.</li>
      <li>so all I can say it&#x27;s .....finally not in my eye!! :-)</li>
      <li>i just love it.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping and I&#x27;m pleased with the product!  </li>
      <li>For eye looks that include glittery shadows I find that it works flawlessly at keeping glitter in place, even for long wear.  </li>
      <li>very cool product</li>
      <li>I like this one much better than the original Shadow Insurance.</li>
      <li>it doesnt even come off easy by using make up removers.</li>
      <li>it will hold gliters in a way that is perfect for soft, evryday and natural looks</li>
      <li>This held the light glitter I was using without being too sticky or clumpy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great primer to have in your collection if you wear any sort of shimmery product (especially MAC pigments, or UD shimmers)</li>
      <li>Amazing primer for shadows, pigments and glitter with high fall out.</li>
      <li>I did use it recently to stick nail gems to my face, and they stayed nicely.  :)</li>
      <li>My eyelids are super oily</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I tried it in sephora store and it held gliters some how but not as good as the spirit gum or the gliter glue from ben nye or kyroline, although I wiped the gliters strongly and about 50-60% of the gliters stays while 40% or half of gliters went off... what I like about this gliter glue it doesn&#x27;t crease and not too sticky as the duo glue..</li>
      <li>it holds the eyeshadows right there</li>
      <li>For example, the glitter eyeshadow applied at 4:00 PM lasted well into the new year and continued to look great with minimal fall out.</li>
      <li>well it is good to glue the glitter, but it dry so fast..</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>It creates a slightly tacky film on your eyelid that loose pigments and glitter adhere to perfectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of an eye shadow primer rather than sticky enough to hold glitter.</li>
      <li>This stuff does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>It dries very quick which makes it hard to put glitter on without having to utilize more of the Glitter Glue.</li>
      <li>This product is great with Too Faced and Urban Decay shadows, due to their high glitter content.</li>
      <li>I try the other day for the first time it ok but thank</li>
      <li>its use is much easier compare to duo and spirit gum which I found to be very sticky and missy, moreovere, the glue sticks on the brushes that you may use to apply the gliter over the glue and if lifted on brush may really damages it&lt;br</li>
      <li>These stuff really works</li>
      <li>But it holds the glitter on very well</li>
      <li>but this stuff really works-</li>
      <li>Very.</li>
      <li>if you are looking for something easy to use and not very missy I will recommend this product to you</li>
      <li>So right, it totally works well.</li>
      <li>of course I love it on small portions and I wanted to keep the glitter from falling off my face and into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s easy to wash off later with wet wash cloth.</li>
      <li>It dries clear and you wouldn&#x27;t ever know it&#x27;s there</li>
      <li>clear liquid glues/mixing mediums.  </li>
      <li>I thought this product was going to be clear.</li>
      <li>it is clear so it wont cover you eyeshadow</li>
      <li>With this small extra step, you will have crease-proof holding power and true color payoff with all of your shadows, even the cheapies!</li>
      <li>you are looking for something that is more for dramatic looks and hold 100 % of gliters and want to cover your skin completly with gliter this product wont do that</li>
      <li>although I haven&#x27;t tried it with loose glitter, my really sparkly eyeshadows from urban decay don&#x27;t fall at all onto my face during application when I use this stuff, finally!</li>

<li> although I haven&#x27;t tried it with loose glitter, my really sparkly eyeshadows from urban decay don&#x27;t fall at all onto my face during application when I use this stuff, finally!</li>
<li> I still had a little bit of glitter flake off but that is to be expected with any glitter glue you use really.</li>
<li> I recommend applying a coat of Urban Decay Primer Potion and letting it dry before you apply the Glitter Glue.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not clear.  </li>
<li> This glue is just what you need I order to apply the loose Too Faced glitter to stay on all day / night.</li>
<li> I use it a lot with loose glitter eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out!</li>
<li> - Work with one eye at a time, because this will dry before you can handle the other lid.</li>
<li> and I apply glitter immediately after while still wet / sticky.</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first</li>
<li> and I will not recommed it for you on the other hand,</li>
<li> but I have owned other Two Faced products</li>
<li> This holds all day, and a little goes a long way!!</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> with other brands I would always end up with glitter speckles all over my face resembling a fairy but not with this stuff!</li>
<li> tried this too faced little cream and..</li>
<li> It holds eyeshadow quite well but still get little fallouts for glitter eyeshadows.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not easy to work with if you are trying to apply glitter OVERTOP of your eyeshadow, which is what I wanted to use it for.  </li>
<li> Takes very little glue</li>
<li> No glitter will fall out and will stay 24 hours if not more.  </li>
<li> no more fall outs</li>
<li> not sure if i am going to buy it again..</li>
<li> and I wear glitter at least twice a week.</li>
<li> No more fall out!</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with it.</li>
<li> I have the NYX primer creams and I wanted to get something for glitter even though some people hate glitters</li>

    <li> This stuff does exactly what it claims to do. It creates a slightly tacky film on your eyelid that loose pigments and glitter adhere to perfectly. This product is great with Too Faced and Urban Decay shadows, due to their high glitter content. However, a word of warning, this stuff will crease if you use it alone. I recommend applying a coat of Urban Decay Primer Potion and letting it dry before you apply the Glitter Glue. It even works great over the shimmery formulations of UDPP like Sin and Greed, as well as over the matte, Eden. With this small extra step, you will have crease-proof holding power and true color payoff with all of your shadows, even the cheapies!</li>
    <li> This is perfect to use before you place glitter on.  It holds the glitter in place and nothing falls on your face.</li>
    <li> I like this one much better than the original Shadow Insurance. I use it on a daily basis with matte/shimmer/glitter eyeshadows. It holds eyeshadow quite well but still get little fallouts for glitter eyeshadows. My eyelids are super oily so I&#x27;m satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> I tried it in sephora store and it held gliters some how but not as good as the spirit gum or the gliter glue from ben nye or kyroline, although I wiped the gliters strongly and about 50-60% of the gliters stays while 40% or half of gliters went off... what I like about this gliter glue it doesn&#x27;t crease and not too sticky as the duo glue.. it is clear so it wont cover you eyeshadow and it works as a good eyeshadow primer as well... its use is much easier compare to duo and spirit gum which I found to be very sticky and missy, moreovere, the glue sticks on the brushes that you may use to apply the gliter over the glue and if lifted on brush may really damages it&lt;br /&gt;I will get it but not sure if i am going to buy it again..&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for something that is more for dramatic looks and hold 100 % of gliters and want to cover your skin completly with gliter this product wont do that and I will not recommed it for you on the other hand, if you are looking for something easy to use and not very missy I will recommend this product to you it will hold gliters in a way that is perfect for soft, evryday and natural looks</li>
    <li> This is a great product; it really works well!</li>
    <li> I got this to use with glitter I got from a makeup place, but never ended up using it.  I did use it recently to stick nail gems to my face, and they stayed nicely.  :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  No glitter will fall out and will stay 24 hours if not more.  Super fast shipping.  Always very pleased with Amazon´s service.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  even the cheapest eye shadow will work with this, and i have been using this for 2 years now and it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out!</li>
    <li> I had no idea such a product even existed until a makeup artist introduced me to it.  For eye looks that include glittery shadows I find that it works flawlessly at keeping glitter in place, even for long wear.  For example, the glitter eyeshadow applied at 4:00 PM lasted well into the new year and continued to look great with minimal fall out.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with it. &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; as said. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This held the light glitter I was using without being too sticky or clumpy. I didn&#x27;t use it with a chunky glitter so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I have owned other Two Faced products and I am just as pleased with this as I was with those. Very.</li>
    <li> Primer plus a primer?? are you kidding me! a dream come true!! very cool product and I do recommended to all MUA</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this! I love to wear glitter on my eyes. This holds all day, and a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Works really great, does what it claims to do. I still had a little bit of glitter flake off but that is to be expected with any glitter glue you use really. Overall- great product!</li>
    <li> This glitter glue does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is hold pigments and glitter on your lid instead of letting it fall all over the rest of your makeup. It is awesome, it is not terribly sticky, and it lasts a looooooooooooooooong time. LOVE THIS and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this glue bc it isnt so sticky that you cant wash it off. But it holds the glitter on very well</li>
    <li> Amazing primer for shadows, pigments and glitter with high fall out. It stays place all day, no problem. It&#x27;s a great primer to have in your collection if you wear any sort of shimmery product (especially MAC pigments, or UD shimmers) - Work with one eye at a time, because this will dry before you can handle the other lid. No more fall out!</li>
    <li> I try the other day for the first time it ok but thank</li>
    <li> These stuff really works</li>
    <li> i just love it. it doesnt even come off easy by using make up removers. it holds the eyeshadows right there</li>
    <li> So right, it totally works well. I use it a lot with loose glitter eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;When It runs out, I will but another Too Faced glitter glue. I would recommend it to people who like  their eyes to look shinny and glamorous!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure magic it works great. So great I could eat and drink without the glitter washing off my lips. And it&#x27;s easy to wash off later with wet wash cloth.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, but comes off with a swipe of eye makeup remover.  A great product.</li>
    <li> This glue is just what you need I order to apply the loose Too Faced glitter to stay on all day / night. Takes very little glue and I apply glitter immediately after while still wet / sticky.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite glitter glue. I can apply it to my eyelids with a q-tip, and it holds my glitter allll day. It dries clear and you wouldn&#x27;t ever know it&#x27;s there (plus you will have glitter covering it). I have been using the same tube for almost a year and I wear glitter at least twice a week.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and I&#x27;m pleased with the product!  Love it! It def works as it said it would and it was a life saver for carnival makeup in my kit.</li>
    <li> Man does this work keeps my shadow on for days if I dont remove my makeup lol. I love wearing glitter shadow and with other brands I would always end up with glitter speckles all over my face resembling a fairy but not with this stuff! its the best :)</li>
    <li> I thought this product was going to be clear. It&#x27;s more of an eye shadow primer rather than sticky enough to hold glitter. The glitter started to fall in my eyes after about an hour. It dries very quick which makes it hard to put glitter on without having to utilize more of the Glitter Glue. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> You only need to use a drop and the next product you put on (glitter) sticks all day. Wish Ulta would carry this again.</li>
    <li> great product for glitter..no more fall outs</li>
    <li> I wanted a glitter glue.  This is more like an eyeshadow primer.  It&#x27;s not clear.  It&#x27;s not easy to work with if you are trying to apply glitter OVERTOP of your eyeshadow, which is what I wanted to use it for.  It does not work for that purpose so I need to find another glitter glue.  I have seen girls on YouTube use Lit and Ben Nye clear liquid glues/mixing mediums.  So I am gonna try one of those.</li>
    <li> This was a more expensive primer because it&#x27;s suppose to hold glitter in place. Not worth the price. It didn&#x27;t hold any longer than my regular primer.</li>
    <li> This Stuff Is Aaaaamazing....Just A Drop AndYourGlitter Is Good All Day AndNight....Hands DownBestOn The Market AndBelieveMe I Have Tried Them all</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this stuff really works- although I haven&#x27;t tried it with loose glitter, my really sparkly eyeshadows from urban decay don&#x27;t fall at all onto my face during application when I use this stuff, finally!</li>
    <li> well it is good to glue the glitter, but it dry so fast.. however, this is the best glitter glue so far</li>
    <li> I have the NYX primer creams and I wanted to get something for glitter even though some people hate glitters and this is for children.....well then I might be a child in heart because I LOVE glitter....of course I love it on small portions and I wanted to keep the glitter from falling off my face and into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this too faced little cream and..what do you know, it works :-)&lt;br /&gt;I had some eye shadow with lots of shimmer and it also works as a primer, so all I can say it&#x27;s .....finally not in my eye!! :-) lol</li>
    <li> This holds the glitter on my models in almost all locations on their bodies.  I was most impressed. I will definitely order more.</li>
