      <li>If you want a great brush with great results, try it.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I can not believe how great this toothbrush works.</li>
      <li>It works great, has plenty of power and does the job.  </li>
      <li>Amazon just dropped their price to $78 (no tax or shipping is a great deal).    </li>
      <li>However, it is a great toothbrush, and maybe the rusting was my fault.  </li>

      <li>This toothbrush has a very nice looking and color.  </li>
      <li>It comes with a very nice traveling case with a place for two heads.    </li>
      <li>Once you get used to the vibration (after a brushing or two), it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
      <li>Another thing that I am impressed with is my coffee and nicotine stains on the top of my molars have almost disappeared, I&#x27;m thinking it will take a week for the stains to fully disappear.</li>
      <li>This is a great tootbrush with good controls.</li>
      <li>Braun claims that this toothbrush can be used for up to 14 days without a charge, that might sound impressive but Braun is assuming that you brush twice a day for two  minutes each brushing.</li>
      <li>and I think I have a good handle on my almost 50y pearly whites.  </li>
      <li>This is a great upgrade from the Oral B 3-D power toothbrush I was using, which I also liked.</li>
      <li>Now, the good stuff.  </li>
      <li>in all a good brush, price is good too.  </li>
      <li>That tells you they are good.</li>

      <li>Oral B is more attractive in terms of colors and design.</li>
      <li>I did a lot of research before buying and am very satisfied with this product and its performance.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m happy to report I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>but I am very satisfied with this unit.</li>
      <li>Then the dentist came in and found my very first cavity!!!</li>
      <li>is a great product, I used in the soft mode, is excellent!!!  </li>
      <li>When I keep my toothbrush continually charged, it has never failed to do a great job!</li>

      <li>Hope this helps you in your quest for a nice machine.</li>
      <li>I bought it rather than another kind because I liked the idea that the brushhead was what I was used to and because of the oral b name.</li>
      <li>I have a much better sense of how my teeth should feel after brushing because I know how good they feel when I use this brush.  </li>
      <li>I already own a CREST Spinbrush which cost about $10 and that I use about once per week.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent.  Very satisfied with both the shipping timeframe especially being close to Christmas since it was a Christmas present and pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral B Sonic Care Power Toothbrush and I can only say that this is the best toothbrush I have ever used in life!  I have no desire to change to any other brand because this one does the trick.  You really do feel as if you just left the dentist office when you brush as suggested.  Wish the life of the battery were longer; my made it about three years (with recharging) and then just went capput.  LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush of any sort so I have nothing to compare it to but itself.  I bought it rather than another kind because I liked the idea that the brushhead was what I was used to and because of the oral b name. It cleaned my teeth very well, leaving them smooth almost like the dentist.  However, after a little more than 2 yrs. it started stopping too soon, only charging partially etc.  I phoned Oral B and asked them what the problem could be and was informed that the battery was probably going and indeed after a couple of months of this it completely stopped working.  Of course I still have 2 unopened brand new toothbrushes which fit no other model to put on a shelf and look at or throw away. When pressed a little further I was told by Oral B that the batteries are only meant to last 3-5yrs as well and of course, are NOT replaceable.  I think that I am not willing to invest again in a toothbrush as pricey for it to have such a short lifetime.  When it worked it was wonderful but given the what I feel is too short a battery life, I would find a less expensive brush to use.  I brush often (with a manual brush, I only used this in the a.m.and p.m.), actually every time I eat, and I still have some plaque when I go to the dentist.  I don&#x27;t see the difference in the amount prior to and since getting this so I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  Yes, it is easier, and my dentist highly recommended an electonic toothbrush for cleaning my teeth but there are lesser priced options on the market and I will try one of those next time.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift. I can not believe how great this toothbrush works. It really feels like you have just gotten your teeth cleaned by the denist!! It is really to use and has a great battery life. I have used other rechargeable toothbrushes in the past, and by far this has surpassed any others that I have used previously. I highly recommend this toothbrush, it is worth the investment!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for about 8 months.  My dentist said that my teeth are much better from using it.  It is easy to brush with.  The only problem I now have is that the metal part that I stick the brush on has rusted.  I am not sure though if this matters, because I don&#x27;t think that it will ever get into my mouth because it is inside the brush, but I am not sure I want to keep using it, because the thought of putting rusted metal into my mouth scares me.  However, it is a great toothbrush, and maybe the rusting was my fault.  I would recommend getting it, and my dentist is pleased with it too.  But I think I am going to get a different one, because I am scared of the rust.    Edit:  I noticed that some of what I thought was rust might have been dirt, however some of the metal corroded.  I put on a new brush head and it works fine, and I am going to keep using it.  In the meantime I tried the sonicare advance from phillips, but I found it to be too bulky.  The Oral B is a much more comfortable brush to use, and the brush head replacements are pretty inexpensive too.    I would probably give it 4 stars instead of 3 now.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric toothbrush, especially for the price. Cleans extremely well, quiet, holds it&#x27;s charge for a very long time, and comes with a wonderful travel case. Highly recommended to anyone considering getting an electric unit.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have bought.  It works great, has plenty of power and does the job.  The first one&#x27;s battery just lost it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge after about 3.5 years.  I bought the same one again since it really did a good job for my wife and myself.</li>
    <li> The oral B Sonic Care Complete is a great toothbrush.  My teeth feel like I came from the dentist getting a professional clean every time I use it.  I have not used the Philips Sonicare, but I do believe that I would not like it as well.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B brush is stiffer than the Sonicare brush.  This, and the fact that the brush vibrates in place instead of back and forth like the Sonicare&#x27;s, makes the Oral-B more effective for cleaning teeth with braces.  Also, the handle is lighter and thinner than the Sonicare&#x27;s, making it easier and more comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> I realize you can clean your teeth just as well with a manual toothbrush as an electric one, but I like the way the electric one forces discourages you from rushing through your brushing.  I particularly like how this model beeps every 30 seconds, so you can pace yourself.  It also cleans well, particularly along the gum line.  Replacement heads are dreadfully expensive, though.</li>
    <li> My dentist says he&#x27;s \\&quot;very impressed\\&quot; with my dental hygene. I mean, I brush, floss and rinse 3 times a day (at work is with a manual), but I really think this toothbrush has made all the difference. It&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner your teeth will feel. Ditch the manual (but use one at work after lunch!) and get a Sonic Complete! There&#x27;s even a setting to brush your tounge and gums!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these toothbrushes and they are terrific at cleaning teeth.  However, both toothbrushes stopped working within a year.  For those considering this product, see the other reviews which give a low rating for similar reasons.  Buyer beware !!</li>
    <li> I have used my Sonic complete for about 2 years. The brush works fantastic when it works. Unfortunately it has what appears to be a design problem. When the batteries run low or you discharge the battery as recommended in the owners mannual, it stops working. This products cost a lot of money for something that may only last 2 years. I have contacted Oral b, and they refuse to acknowledge the design flaw. They want you to believe the battery is dead. I had the battery tested at the local battery store and it is fine. Many other people are having this problem as noted by the many complaints over the web. Do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of brushing, but grudgingly went through the motions of moving my toothbrush up, down, left, right and in circles to avoid the dentist reaming me out each visit. It still didn&#x27;t work and I was still missing all of the spots! At times, I would fall asleep brushing, while foaming at the mouth with toothpaste because my hands got so tired!    Tonight, I used the Braun Sonic Complete, my first electric toothbrush, and for the little effort I put in (all I had to do was hold the brush and moveit around a little), my mouth sure got a workout! It felt like I was at the dentist&#x27;s office... and that was only a few weeks ago! Now I actually look forward to brushing and can&#x27;t wait to do it all over again in the morning so I can make my dentist proud at the next visit! The sharp design of the set makes it attractive to the eye that even my old fashioned parents enjoy it (purchased a set for them as well!) I tried out all 3 modes and am extremely pleased at the selection. I will most likely always be using the &#x27;clean&#x27; mode since it&#x27;s more vigorous, but for my parents who have very sensitive gums and existing teeth/gum issues... the slow or massage mode is PERFECT for them as it&#x27;s quite relaxing. There is also a hidden compartment for you to secretly tuck away up to 3 brushheads while not in use. So each person in the family can have their own brushhead, but use only one base! How convenient?! Perfect as all 3 of us plan on taking a vacation later on this year and all we will have to do is bring one of the charger bases! The 30 second and 2 minute timer are also convenient as a reminder to switch brushing quadrants in your mouth, but I was having so much fun that I moreorless ignored the reminders and continued brushing for almost a full 10 minutes straight! I&#x27;ve yet to really test out the battery life as I just received my shipment today, but after all of my dental bills... I do not mind a small fortune investment into something that will help me retain mypearly whites for a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used three electronic toothbrushes in the last two years and the Sonic Complete toothbrush is by far the best. The brush is easy to clean (unlike the Sonicare toothbrush in which water leaks into the screwed area) and cleans better then Triumph.    Highly recommended.    I bought it on Ebay for $50.</li>
    <li> When the dentist told me that my gingivitus was flaring up and wanted me to start floshing twice a day and massaging the gums in the evening, I bought the Sonic Complete instead.  I would bruch twice a day and in the evening would flosh and use the massage \\&quot;speed\\&quot; on the Sonic.  Six months later at my next visit, the dentist just said, \\&quot;see you in six months\\&quot; after examining my teeth.  That was seven years ago.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for 3+ years and it still works great! It holds a great charge (gets me through weekend trips with no problems). My teeth always feel clean after I use it. The only down side is that it is getting a little harder nowadays to find replacement heads for it. I have had good success online finding them though.</li>
    <li> This electric tooth brush is a terrific product.  I cannot imagine ever using anything else.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush will make your teeth feel super clean!  Great for your gums too!  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because our first one died after around 3 years.  I have come to learn that this is pretty much the life expectancy of the rechargeable battery.  When doing the math, 25 bucks per years seems like a reasonable price to pay for the feel of super clean teeth.  It comes with two heads, one for your spouse too.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush EVER I will never usse any other toothbrush if I can help it.</li>
    <li> This tootbruth is great.  Cleans extremely well, and was recommended by my dentist b/c he felt the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; would be gentler on my gums.</li>
    <li> This toothbruh is fabulous....my teeth have never been cleaner.  I also like the different speeds - especially good if you have a sensitive area.</li>
    <li> I owned an older brush of this same model and liked it so much that when the battery began tp fail, I decided to purchase the same model again.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a 5 year old unit that still worked but occasionally skipped a beat (shut off prematurely!) Excellent product that does a thorough cleaning job.  Highly recommend this item!!!</li>
    <li> Previously, I was used to the rotating brush style of an electric toothbrush. The S-320 is fast, powerful and very effective in cleaning. I don&#x27;t use the other options beside just cleaning but I am very satisfied with this unit. It takes up a very small footprint on my vanity counter and does well what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I switched to Oral B from Sonicare about a year ago. What a difference. The Oral B has a much better design. The Sonicare had a poor fit between the head and the base which let water leak inside and form gunk. The Oral B has a nice tight seal. No gunk. The Sonicare had the idiotic quad timer that jiggled every 30 seconds and shut off every 2 minutes. The Oral B copied the jiggle, but at least it doesn&#x27;t shut off until I shut it off.    Most importantly, the Oral B cleans better. I have a mouth guard. I clean it every morning. It had become yellowed over the years. After just a few days with the Oral B, it lost most of the yellowing.    It comes with a very nice traveling case with a place for two heads.    It does have one annoying \\&quot;feature\\&quot;. The on/off button has 4 steps: \\&quot;clean\\&quot; (full on), \\&quot;soft\\&quot; (half power?), \\&quot;massage\\&quot; (vibrate), and off. This means that it takes three pushes to turn it off. Very poor engineering decision. Either eliminate the other two settings, which I bet less than 5% of the people use, or put those settings somewhere else. I just want a simple on/off button. When I turn it on, it comes on and stays om. When I turn it off, it turns off, Period. Put all the rest of the hokey marketing gimmicks somewhere else.    Still, a huge improvement over the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Sonic complete IS what it says, COMPLETE mouthcare.   After cleaning teeth on the first level, your able to switch to the third level to massage the gums. The second level is there if you should need more tender mouth care some day. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush.  Every day after I use it I feel like I just came from the dentist.  It is easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.  This is the second one I have had and the last one lasted about nine years.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It reaches all of your teeth especially the hard to reach places.  It is well worth the price if you</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this toothbrush until it quit working after three years. I told my wife I was heartbroken. Anyone got hundred bucks I can borrow?</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B Sonic Complete.  The first one lasted 3 years before it wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge.  It works great for cleaning teeth, but I&#x27;m just disappointed the battery can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
    <li> Really am pleased with this toothbrush.  It gives me a good feeling to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I first was exposed to this product at my significant other&#x27;s house and fell in love with it.  The way it cleans, massages and works ones gums is nothing less than terrific.  How do I know because I&#x27;ve had gm problems in the past and I know what is necessary to prevent them now and in the future but most importantly my lady friend was married to a dnetist for 22 years and is a dnetal hygenist by profession and uses it herself...... therefore \\&quot;if it is good enough for her, it&#x27;s good enough for me\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Nice cleaning job on teeth. But, too rough on the gum line. I used this brush for a few days, stopped using it a couple of weeks ago and can still feel a burning in my gums.  Never had an issue with sensitive gums before.</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare for a couple of years.... and every time I needed to replace the brush head I had guilt about throwing that metal, plastic and magnet mess in the garbage.  So when my Sonicare died, I bought this.  It works as well, and with the smaller brush heads I have a lot less guilt when it&#x27;s time to replace them... so that&#x27;s a definite win.    I have recommended it to friends and family when they were considering getting a sonic toothbrush, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> The concept is nice, but the product quality is very bad.  mine is S-320 complete, after about 6 months of usage the power button stop working i had to press it like 10 times to make it work or some times it work some times not.   Now i don&#x27;t know what happened to the charger as well, the device is not charging properly, i can see the LED indicator blinking in very odd way.    Bottom of line! Do not buy this product, it is expensive and not reliable</li>
    <li> Works great, lasts (especially the brushes)long.  I&#x27;d give five stars, but the first two I&#x27;ve bought both gave up for the same reason: the switch quit, and no way to get at it to fix it.  Seems it might be a basic flaw.  Still, I will get another.  SO I bought another, my third, and NOW, a year or two? later, same thing.  Switch doesn&#x27;t work.  Still charges up great, and if I pound the thing on the counter, I can get it to start.  Then I pound it on the counter again to stop it.  SOOOOO, I either buy another one now, and I admit I think it does a FANTASTIC job on gums and teeth, or I switch to another model.  It&#x27;s a bummer, though, that I have some of those very expensive replacement brushes (extremely durable) which, of course, won&#x27;t fit all other models.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about 2 years and it works great.  It was recommended by my dentist.  I just bought a second one for my son.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve tried others brands in the same price range (even a bit higher) and find this one to \\&quot;really clean,\\&quot; and do exactly what it says it will. Go for it...your smile will thank you!</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is AMAZING!!  I have used both the Sonicare and this toothbrush and this brush provides the exact same results as the Sonicare but isn&#x27;t anywhere near as harsh on the gums.  I have extremely sensitive gums and my dentist used to constantly get on me about brushing too hard with my manual tooth brush.  I started using this brush and my dentist&#x27;s complaining has stopped!  haha.  Every time I go in for a cleaning, the hygienist raves about how easy I make her job (being that my teeth are so clean).    Bottom Line:  If you want the Cadilac of toothbrushes, look no further.</li>
    <li> I purchased the toothbrush from an outside seller, they charged my credit card, told me it was out of stock (not back-ordered), and refunded my credit card.  Not a terrible experience at all, but a huge waste of time.</li>
    <li> This is a great upgrade from the Oral B 3-D power toothbrush I was using, which I also liked. The sonic version cleans better and I found the brush bristles more flexible, gentle, and easier to position on my teeth than the round style of brush.The unit is easy to keep clean and the brush easy to remove and attach. In any case, when I switched from a manual to power toothbrush several years ago, the manual brush just couldn&#x27;t clean as well, regardless of how long I spent brushing.</li>
    <li> After many years of manual brushing I decided to take the plunge and buy an electric toothbrush, my only stipulation being it had to be a sonic one. I researched on the net and it came down to two choices, the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete and one of the Sonicare brushes. I chose the Oral B X-320 not only because of it&#x27;s cheaper price, the smaller brush also appealed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B now for over a month. It does clean my teeth extremely well and I feel quite guilty having put my poor little ivory whites through manual brushing for as long as I did. My teeth feel cleaner and are gradually improving in whiteness. Years of tea drinking and 10 years of smoking had left their marks too and those stains are gradually being removed. I could see the difference in my bottom front incisors within two weeks, which really impressed me. My teeth look and feel great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The brush takes some getting used to. The high setting is incredibly vigorous at first. When I first started using I used the softer setting then moved up to the high setting. The softer setting is great for sensitive teeth and the massage setting does a good job cleaning the tongue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are two minor negative points to this brush though, which irritated me enough to only give it four stars. First of all, there is no indicator to let you know the brush is low battery. It just stops working as I found out to my annoyance one morning mid brush. I had to finish off my brush with a MANUAL toothbrush, oh the horror. Seriously Braun, you could have fitted something in to let us know it needs recharging. The other one is the bad location of the on/off button, it&#x27;s very easy to run one&#x27;s finger over it and switch modes mid cycle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great brush and a great price. I would recommend this to anyone thinking of buying their first electric toothbrush, the value is great.</li>
    <li> Bought this in October, 2005.  Really liked the cleaning action and appreciated the \\&quot;buzzer\\&quot; feature telling you when to switch sections of your mouth.  Up until about a week ago (late May, 2006) I would have given it a four, possibly a five, star rating.  Then, the switch just stopped working.  It will either not turn on the brush or will turn it on for a few seconds and then it will go off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry, but when I pay nearly a $100.00 (inc. shipping) for something, I actually expect it to last more than seven months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not recommended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I have to buy a replacement and am stuck with the three extra heads I so foolishly purchased, thinking it would last that long. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its predecessor, a plain old Braun Oral B, lasted me over five years.  Will NOT be replacing it with a Braun product, for sure.</li>
    <li> Short story:  Feb 2006 - Dental Cleaning.  Jun 2006 - Got this brush.  Dec 2006 - Dental Cleaning 4 months late.  My hygenist asked if I had changed to a sonic brush.  I said I had.  She was so impressed with my snags that I bought this same brush for my sister. She loves it already.  The extended battery life is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for about a year now.  Best electric toothbrush I have ever owned!  My dentist thought I started flossing! (did I really admit that?) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts about two weeks on a charge.  Travel kit holds 2 brushes and base.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its mental or what, but I seriously feel like my teeth are getting cleaner and cleaner. It cleans the surface of your teeth with no problem and with ease, but its a bit awkward cleaning the insides of your teeth(the part you dont see when you smile)....but you get used to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, i&#x27;d recommend and its affordable. You don&#x27;t need all those other bells and whistles. This is more than enough to get your teeth feeling super clean.</li>
    <li> Everything needs to be said had been said. Good brush, but it completely died on me after 10 months of normal usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 months for a electronic is not really an acceptable amount of usage.</li>
    <li> clean tooth!!!! is a great product, I used in the soft mode, is excellent!!!  never back to the regular toothbrush... no way</li>
    <li> I have had my OralB S-320 for, I guess, 4 or maybe 5 years and the battery is just about dead now and I&#x27;ll have to replace the unit.  But, the problem was that the battery never held charge for any significant length of time anyway.  I could never take the toothbrush on even a single overnight stay, despite a charge supposedly being able to last for 2 weeks, because it needed a full recharge every day.  I think I got a lemon and should have returned it (didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon) but had misplaced my receipts.  At the price I paid (&gt;$80) together with the cost of replacement heads, that&#x27;s a LOT of manual toothbrushes (not including 2 free ones at the dentist each year) and sometimes I wonder if it&#x27;s worth it, especially as my husband has a $20 electric brush that&#x27;s still going strong after 7 years.  Yes, for me it&#x27;s been well worth it - my teeth and gums have just been so much healthier since I got this toothbrush.  It really does a great job at getting that shiny after-cleaning-at-the dentist feeling every day which a non-sonic model never did.  The gentle setting works well on the tongue.  I also think using this brush has helped me clean my teeth better with a manual toothbrush when I need to - I have a much better sense of how my teeth should feel after brushing because I know how good they feel when I use this brush.  I really do like this product, but for me the battery issue drags its star rating down and I&#x27;m not yet sure that I will get a second one to replace my current S-320.</li>
    <li> My dental hygenist recommended the Oral-B Sonicare Complete 320 over two years ago. I was so impressed with how well it cleaned my teeth, that I gave the same unit to 5 other people.  All have been extremely pleased with their gifts, especially since it has helped their oral hygiene.  When I keep my toothbrush continually charged, it has never failed to do a great job!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a unit that batteries died. I loved the previous one and the new one is just as good.    Jack</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years, loved it to death. Then the battery gave way and it would turn on in the middle of the night. Knowing I couldn&#x27;t replace the battery of this model, I opted for a different one, the Oral B Professional Care with timer. Ouch. It was horrible and loud and the brush heads cleaned nothing like the Sonic Care. So into the vault of \\&quot;Toothbrushes I No Longer Love\\&quot; went the mega priced Professional Care, and One Click Order from Amazon and the new Sonic Care was on its way. Even though I know someday the battery will give up (I got called out of line at airport security when it turned on in my carry on!), it&#x27;s the only toothbrush I will ever own. Period.</li>
    <li> This brush is far superior to the earlier Oral B that I used.  It does an excellent job of cleaning.  The change in the sound makes it easy to tell when you&#x27;ve done 30 seconds of cleaning.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush model was recommended by our previous dentist where we used to live. My wife has had one for a couple years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  We purchased her Sonic directly at the dentist for $80 which was $40 off at the time.  Since then it has been difficult to find this model anywhere else below $110.  I don&#x27;t like sharing base units and then switching brush heads each time I want to use it.  I finally picked one up for myself at a local grocery store for $70 on sale a few weeks back. Amazon just dropped their price to $78 (no tax or shipping is a great deal).    My feedback:  Impressive results during the 1st week of use with just this Sonic Complete and Crest Complete gel toothpaste.  I drink lots of coffee, but despite thorough brushing with my manual brushes I was never able to get rid of coffee stains without resorting to white-strips or trips to the dentist for cleaning.  My teeth are not all that even, so getting around the edges is more difficult than those who have perfectly aligned teeth.    This Sonic Complete knocked the stains right off my teeth... man are they white and not just on the front surfaces but in between in hard to reach places too!  After using it for just a couple days I turned to my wife and said \\&quot;check this out\\&quot;.  She was equally wowed even though she has used her Sonic for a long time. Taking a before and after photo would have been a great idea.  No going back now.    I had some gum-line/plaque issues back where wisdom teeth were pulled.  This \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; seems to zap out all the nasty stuff and prevents it from sticking there.  Awesome!  After a month using the Sonic Complete, my gums are looking really good everywhere - not red, not puffy, but nice pink and tight.    By comparison, I had previously used other Oral B rotating brush heads which DO NOT WORK anything like this Sonic Complete vibration brush head.    I&#x27;m looking forward to my next trip to the dentist to get their opinion.  It will be a laugh if they thinkI&#x27;ve been going elsewhere for cleanings in the interm.    If I have any \\&quot;cons\\&quot; to report: A full recharge from empty takes over 18 hours.  That&#x27;s a lot of time between brushing... of course you can use the brush turned off, but that would be too silly ;)  Luckily complete discharging is not necessary very often, only after a few months of daily recharge usage, so not a big deal.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    Update:   Visit to the dentist (2 months ago) went great - they were equally amazed at the improvement of my teeth and gums.  I went from 4,5 &amp; 6 ratings down to 2-3 with only a couple 4s.  Then I told them what I changed in my home maintenance... this brush.  They also said I should have before &amp; after photos for a poster :)    I now have my 80 year old mother using one and her gums have improved significantly in a short period of time.  She is happy her teeth are better than previous and she doesn&#x27;t need to scrub - which is something she had trouble doing before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but for the best cleaning action the Sonic is far superior.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Our teeth are feeling very clean and gums very tingly. Love the massage and tongue cleaning speed features. Two problems: [1]If you do not hold the main handle correctly [lower than I feel comfortable with], you inadvertently turn the action off by pushing the control button [2] Somehow the flip to cover over the brush head storage compartment came off and I had to reassemble the plastic post, spring, and push the cover back onto the compartment.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush over a year ago.  I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s kept my teeth as white as it could considering the amount of coffee I drink on a daily basis.  It has three settings, but all you&#x27;ll really find yourself using is the first one, which is for regular brushing.  There&#x27;s a softer version for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lasted pretty long.  The manufacturer recommends that you let the battery drain every 6 months for a longer battery life.  I do this everytime I remember.  Though, recently I did this and the toothbrush charged but when I turned it on, it only had two settings, on and off.  There is no longer a setting for a softer version for your gums and tongue.  No big deal, I don&#x27;t use them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good brush, price is good too.  I would have given it five stars if it managed to keep my teeth white even with my coffee consumption &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I had two Sonicare Elite 7300 toothbrushes over the last 4 years. Sonicare works great and cleans your teeth well. It is a bit bulky, noisy and vibrates a lot but you get used to that. If you don&#x27;t remove the brush head from the base after each use to clean the interior mold starts to build. Not good.     Besides, both Sonicare units I owned had the same problem. After around 18 months the battery took less and less of a charge until after around 26 months I could only brush my teeth 4 to 5 times per charge. Big problem if you travel a lot or when several people use the same base. I called Sonicare about it and was told the base should last for up to 5 years. Whatever, the warranty is only two years.     So I looked at other products and found the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete system. The base is made by Braun in Germany. I have owned 4 Braun electric shavers over the past 24 years. The last one still worked fine when I replaced it 5 years ago but I wanted to upgrade to the new Activator. So my experience with Braun products \\&quot;made in Germany\\&quot; and their reliability had been very good.     The Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete is lighter than the Sonicare Elite. The Oral B toothbrush head is designed a bit different than the Sonicare. After using the Oral B now for about 2 month I have the feeling that the Oral B cleans my teeth better and I think it is due to the difference in toothbrush design.     The Oral B sits essentially on a vibrating stick vs. the screw cap method used by Sonicare. The vibrating stick seems better from a hygiene standpoint and creates a similar amount of vibration.     Another big difference between both systems is the cost of the brush heads. 3 replacement heads for Oral B Sonic Complete are $18 on Amazon; 2 brush heads for the Sonicare system are between $23 and $28 on Amazon. Since the price for the base systems is similar the savings from the toothbrushes for the Oral B is quite substantial, especially if several people are using the system.Overall, I am very pleased with the Oral B system and even my dentist thinks there is no difference in terms of effectiveness between both systems. Based on my experience with the Braun shavers I am hopeful the Oral B will last longer than the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Great product, for teeth cleaning. noticeable difference at the dentist in plaque reduction. Will never go back to regular brushing</li>
    <li> I liked this product but the battery only lasted a year.  Now it won&#x27;t hold a charge and I have to buy a new one. Disappointing considering the price.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush -- both my wife and I use it extensively and have been very pleased with it.  As many others have statedin reviews here, it&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable, well made, and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things that other electric toothbrush neophytes might appreciate knowing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not much different to use this than a regular toothbrush, just slightly less pressure and slower wrist motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You use regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Especially notable when you first start using it, using the Sonic Complete makes your teeth feel shiny-clean like they would after a dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The vibrations from the brush feel odd at first but especially at the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting, you get used to them very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing at all \\&quot;off\\&quot; about the product is that it uses NiCad batteries, which are a toxic waste item that can&#x27;t be thrown out, a problem when the product gets older.  These NiCad batteries are slow to recharge, also, if you don&#x27;t throw it on the charger every night as the manufacturer recommends.  A recharge from a week&#x27;s worth of twice daily use takes about 8-10 hours.  Drain the battery completely, and the recharge takes about 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that minor quibble, this is a wonderful product and I whole-heartedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I owned a older version of this before I upgraded.  It has the 30 second interval timers which is great.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, clean teeth.  It is a little larger than my old version which is good for my large hands.  It also comes with a little travel case which is convenient. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the battery level notification.  Or to put more aptly, the lack of.  I only like to charge it after the batteries are drained because of space issues.  It&#x27;ll just be working one day and the next day it&#x27;ll just stop.  No indication whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 in May 07 and our family loves them. Takes a few days to get use to but after that you ask yourself why didn&#x27;t I do this sooner? Getting the area where the teeth meet the gum clean is easy and healthy (especially for those that suffer from gum problems -- like I do). I am brushing more often than I have ever done because it is that simple and comfortable. Takes some getting use to as I stated and forgetting to turn it on/off while in your mouth will make way for a light mist (the sonic vibration does not allow for liquid to remain still on the brush). After the first week of use by my sons (who are terrible at brushing) I knew a great choice had been made. I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in their gums already. Only complaint I have is that I would have liked to see tapering at the tip, I find it a little difficult to get to the back of my mouth where the molars end; but then again it may just take me a little more time to get the hang of that. The ease of holding the toothbrush and letting it do the work makes it a great item for children. Just be careful where you decide to place the charger, we are not keeping ours in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> battery performance was weak from the beginning, but continued to drop off over three months until it wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore, despite continuous charging.    i just got the sonicare e9000 to replace it, and i am so so happy with my new toothbrush.  the sonicare leaves my mouth tingling and refreshed....so much better than this or my previous electric oral b toothbrush (the one with the spinning head).</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my dentist and am buying another for three reasons.    1.  After years of fearing a new cavity at my dental visits, ever since I bought this (almost 10 years ago) I have not had a single cavity.     2.  I have had this nearly 10 years and it just started malfunctioning.  Ten years is a fantastic lifespan for a toothbrush.    3.  You can switch the heads to allow more than one person to use the same toothbrush.  In this way, my toddler is able to use my toothbrush and get the same benefit of very clean teeth.    So glad I got this toothbrush and am looking forward to what I hope will be another 10 years of easy dental visits.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush we have ever owned.  Highly recommned.  It cleans your teeth and has a massage setting for your gums.  We love it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush after it was recommended by a friend.  I was hesitant spending so much money on a toothbrush.  However, I made the purchase.  Once again, cheapest price was on Amazon.com!  It was simple to set up and easy to use &amp; clean.  I love it!  My teeth feel dentist-clean and have brightened in just a few weeks.  I love the timed brushing--now I know I&#x27;ve brushed enough!  I&#x27;ve recommended this tooth brush to everyone I know.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> While this is the first battery powered toothbrush I have purchased and I have no basis for comparison, I have had a good experience with it for a month.  The three different speeds offered work well and the massage feature feels particularly good on the gums. I have not changed my toothbrush head yet, but I will soon.  They were selling three new toothbrush heads for $20 which is a little pricey, but compared to normal toothbrushes you&#x27;d find in a drugstore, I think the additional price is worth the better cleaning. I still feel like I&#x27;ve come back from the dentist after each use. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the charger/battery yet, but I realize it&#x27;s still early for that.  Take a chance on this toothbrush.  I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Best Toothbrush I have ever use !!! Period !!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used several power brushes and this is by far the best one. The brushes do a good job and I like the timer features that tell me when to move on to another part of my mouth. I also like the different brush speeds. The &#x27;slow&#x27; mode is good when I need to brush quietly.</li>
    <li> I bought this, loved it, bought another for my husband, and he also loves it.  I have always had issues with feeling like I really have to scrub to get my teeth clean enough, which ends up making my gums more sore, among other issues. This toothbrush really makes my teeth feel clean without the terrible hard scrubbing from before. It holds a charge long enough to get me at least through a week (I used to travel a lot for work), which is so helpful. I really like the 3 functions too for the added benefits of gum stimulation and cleaning your tongue.  Great product! I just wish I could find the toothbrush heads in stores. I have yet to see them locally and end up having to order online.</li>
    <li> Just used this thing this morning and oh boy...feel like I just get my teeth cleaned by the dentist. I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic sonic toothbrush for over a year now and this Oral B Sonic Complete is way better. Faster speed then Panasonic. A bit heavier though and the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch should have been positioned better. I keep hitting the \\&quot;on\\&quot; swith while using this thing. &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular oral b tooth brush and loved it.  I had a sonicare and because my mouth is small I had a hard time getting the toothbrush head anywhere near my back teeth.  So when I saw that the oral b sonic brush was smaller I got it.  I love it.  I had finished a week of Crest white strips and thought that I&#x27;d go get another box and do them again.  I wanted my teeth really really white.  After a few days of using the oral b sonic.. I didn&#x27;t need to get another box of the crest white strips.  My teeth are so white. I love that is has a more gentle speed for the back of my front teeth that are sensitive and you can clean your tongue and massage your gums</li>
    <li> I just replaced my Sonicare with the OralB Complete...the Oral B is much better.  Teeth seem cleaner and much whiter.  Head is a bit easier to get into hard to reach back teeth.  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying and am very satisfied with this product and its performance.  Update Feb 2010 - still going strong, got one for husband and son, too.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like this tooth brush. It makes our teeth feel clean and it helps to focus on all the teeth! The shipping process was complicated because I have an APO address. I had to have the product shipped to someone in the states and they had to send it to me.</li>
    <li> I know electronic toothbrushes do a more effective job than manual brushing but don&#x27;t love this. It is my 1st so can&#x27;t compare to others but I would like one not to remind me of a dentist&#x27;s drill. Also every time I use that I accidentally hit the power button and either change the speed or tune it off completely before I finish the 2 minute session and I&#x27;ve used it at least 30 times. Good price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> It helps you brush enough and in the right way. Once you get used to the vibration (after a brushing or two), it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> About six months ago we bought this toothbrush--I remember my mom&#x27;s dentist recommending an electric toothbrush when she started having tooth and gum problems at around 40 and thought I&#x27;d give one a try. Felt foolish spending $100 on a toothbrush but boy was I in for a surprise. Initially had a little trouble adjusting but after about a week I got used to it and the improvement in my teeth and gums has been amazing! Teeth feel cleaner and dull yellow color from tea/coffee drinking started to disappear. After six months I&#x27;m delighted I spent the money and don&#x27;t know how I lived without one this long. Never going back.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get one of these or a Sonicaire because they do such a better job of cleaning below the gum line than regular toothbrushes.  After reading the reviews for this one I was really excited about getting this toothbrush.  It took a day or two to get used to the vibration in my mouth but not that long to realize that my mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean after I brushed with this toothbrush.  Yes, I did it exactly the way I was supposed to, and cleaned for the entire 2 minutes, sometimes more but my mouth and teeth did not feel nearly as clean as they did when I used the regular toothbrush.  Maybe it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t get much \\&quot;lather\\&quot; with this toothbrush but I&#x27;ve actually gone back to my regular Reach toothbrush and feel much fresher.  I would NOT recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This fantastic brush has revolutionized the way I brush my teeth.  I&#x27;m the kind of person who has poor time perception, and thus rarely brushed my teeth long enough with a manual toothbrush.  About 6 months ago, I decided to make a change for better health, and invested the $100 it cost me at the time for the Oral B Sonic Complete with 3 power levels.  My teeth and gums have never been so clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---GREAT for people who like the feeling of extra-clean teeth without damaging their gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Excellent for those with sensitive teeth and gums - the second setting, gentle, is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Good for a pick-me-up after lunch, with a \\&quot;massage\\&quot; power level that you can use after a quick brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- TIMER - 30 second timer helps you keep track of your time; occurs as a small interruption in the vibration for the first 1.5min, and at the end of 2 minutes a longer interruption.  It does not turn off until you turn it off, however, making it just fine for those who like to brush longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging unit also has a holder for 3 spare heads - fewer trips to the store - and stickers to remind you when the head needs to be changed.  Batter life is excellent - it appears to be exactly as advertised.  Mine came with a carry case that holds the brush unit and 2 heads, excellent for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend the Oral B Sonic Complete (S-320), especially for someone switching from a manual to a sonic toothbrush.  It&#x27;s versatile, friendly, and holds a good charge.</li>
    <li> What convinced me to buy this toothbrush was the great price I found only here at Amazon.com, and also the other high user recommendations.  Now that I&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks I can join the chorus and tell you that this toothbrush will leave your teeth and tongue spotless, with that smooth-teeth feeling that only normally comes after a dentist visit.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> works great!  love the different levels-WAYYYYY BETTER than the newest Oral-B (the \\&quot;Ultimate\\&quot; i think it&#x27;s called) which is retail price 140.00.</li>
    <li> This is our second Oral-B-320.  Our first one lasted 8 years.  This is an excellent product.  Our Dentist always complements us on the condition of our teeth when we go in for cleaning.  What more could you ask for?!</li>
    <li> This is one of the great inventions of man. Probably right up there with sliced bread or bacon cheeseburgers.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Happy I purchased the toothbrush.  Two minor drawbacks, the base does not indicate that battery is low and it takes 3 clicks before it turns off causing the the foaming toothbrush to splatter about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for 3-4 years. I absolutely love this brush. But the truth is, in 3 to 4 years that I&#x27;ve used it, I had to replace it 3 times.     It just stops working properly after about 12 months. I called the company each time it broke, and they offered to send me a free replacement in exchange of my broken toothbrush. Yesterday my toothbrush stopped working again. I guess I will be calling OralB tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This sonic toothbrush gave us very poor reliability and service life. It barely made it through the warrantly period. We had problems with the on/off switch not working after using it for a couple of months.  Barely 2 years and it stopped working. My hygentist also told me my tartar build up has been much worse since I changed to to the sonic.    Our much cheaper Oral-B 3D is still going after 5 years of hard use and cleaned my teeth better.  No more sonics for us.</li>
    <li> When my dental hygenist recommended I get an electric toothbrush, I have to admit I was hesitant. I have always had sensitive gums, and normal brushing would sometimes leave my mouth bruised as it was. I read the product description for this toothbrush, and learned that it doesn&#x27;t actually spin. This lead me to believe that it would be the most gentle brush I could find. Since I began using it, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. The brush features 3 modes, which have been wonderful to have! When my gums are sore, I simply switch modes! I would highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a great product, especially if you have a sensitive mouth!</li>
    <li> A recent visit to the dentist suggested I needed to consider a new brushing method.  I&#x27;m just too hard on my gums with a standard toothbrush in hand.  I like them to be clean you know!    (...)  First brushing - incredible!  Never had my teeth feel so clean after a 2 minute brushing.  It&#x27;s actually relaxing and painless.    Maybe any Sonic Toothbrush (Sonic Complete from OralB or SonicCare?) would have done.  But this unit does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great tootbrush with good controls. I highly recommend it and my dentist thinks it&#x27;s a good idea to use.</li>
    <li> Every time I asked my dental hygienist about an electric toothbrush she told me that I was already taking excellent care of my teeth and that one can do just as good a job with a manual toothbrush.  I just got my first 2 crowns put on @ over $2,000, and the dentist says that if I take good enough care of them they might see me out.  I have fillings that are about 30 years old and sill working, so I know it is possible to extend the life of dental work.  I do not expect to have dental insurance when/if those crowns need replacing.    I already own a CREST Spinbrush which cost about $10 and that I use about once per week.  My hygienist does not like the angle-cut bristles on it, which cause tiny bristle points to scrape your gums even though you do not feel it.  But, soak the bristles in hot water to soften them, and only use about once per week, and I think it is a positive.    I am always in a hurry when brushing so do not do the manual brushing for the full 2 minutes.  Also, I had read on the web reliable studies saying a sonic toothbrush is very good.  So, fresh back from $2,000 dental investment, I sprang for the extra to get this brush.    Wow!  it has been wonderful.  For starters, it feels great, like a massage.  I brush the full 2 mins in part because the timer helps, and in part because I don&#x27;t have to concentrate on it.  Maybe you can chew gum and cross the street, but I find it hard to do manual toothbrushing while adjusting the shower water temperature, and getting a fresh towel, and dashing upstairs to turn on the coffee, etc.  But I can hold this electric brush on my teeth while doing all that, so I brush longer by multi-tasking    My teeth feel really clean, like I just got back from the dentist, after using this brush.  I like the gentle tongue cleaning feature also, but I only do that just a little occasionally.    Thanks to all the previous reviewers whose words helped me decide to buy this.  I encourage everyone to review your stuff here at Amazonso we can all benefit from each other&#x27;s experience.  I wish I had bought one of these sooner.</li>
    <li> For years I thought electronic brushes like this were funny and wierd.    Boy was I wrong.  The Oral B Sonic toothbrushes cleans wonderfully and virtually eliminates any plaque or tartar on my teeth.  It&#x27;s quiet and pleasant sounding as well.  You can watch TV and or be in the same room as other people while using it and still hear everything.    Great product.</li>
    <li> So I am 26 years old and up until I bought this toothbrush I had never had any cavaties in my entire life. Well after about 6 mos of using this toothbrush I went to my first dentist appt. I always get complimented on my teeth cleaning and the dentist always says that I am a model patient and he enjoys seeing someone who cares about their teeth so much. Well last week I went in and as soon as the hygienist looked into my mouth she started in on me. She said that there was serious build-up and wanted to know if I smoked!! I do not. Then she had to spend quite a while scraping my teeth . She did say that my gums looked healthy, but that was the only positive thing. Then the dentist came in and found my very first cavity!!! I was shocked! He said it was a little one, but I was still very upset. Then to top it all off they recomended that I try an electric toothbrush!! Hello! SO You are probably wondering why I still gave this product 3 stars. Well the reason is because I have to be fair. I do like the toothbrush. I like how it has the three different settings and the little warning signals that let you know when it&#x27;s time to stop or channge sides of you mouth. I also have to say that my teeth always felt much cleaner than when I used the manual toothbrush. I really don&#x27;t understand why I had the worst dentist appt. of my life after using it. It could be that I wasn&#x27;t pressing on my teeth hard enough with the brush head. The vibrations kind of fool you into thinking you are pushing harder than you you really are. So the whole problem could be my fault. So I am not giving up on this toothbrush. I will brush a bit harder and see what my next appt. brings. It quite possibly could have just been user error.</li>
    <li> This is our second Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.  We purchased the first one through our dentist who highly recommended it.  We had the first one for four or five years and our dental checkups improved, especially the gum health. Our original one finally lost its recharging power.  The new one we purchased was a deal and cost about $50 less than the first and we received it within a week and a half.  It is nicely packaged and arrived in a strongly sealed package (inside and out)!  After brushing with this electric toothbrush it feels like you&#x27;ve just had your teeth cleaned by the hygenist.  Your mouth will tingle and feel so fresh.  [[ASIN:B0002M50Z6 Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]It is fabulous.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. My Wife just bought herself one. But I bought mine over a year ago and so far no problem. Based on what my dentist said at my last visit, it does a good job too. And I personally don&#x27;t like to have to switch back to my old style toothbrush.  I really recommend this product. The only downside is that it&#x27;s really bulky and heavy to travel with... I leave mine at home then.</li>
    <li> If you want truly clean teeth, this is the electric toothbrush that beats all others. Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything less.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these same brushes for several years. I bought my first one from the dentist. That tells you they are good. I bought this one cheaper than any place I have found. The main thing however; is that, I always have excellent check-ups at the dentist every 6 months. That tells you this brush does its job. The party whom I ordered this from I would recommend highly. Everything was sent in a timely manner. Thank you for allowing me to give this review. I also want to give thanks to AMAZON for referring me to this website.</li>
    <li> Purchased in July 2009, too soon to tell if the power switch will wear our like two of my Philips Sonicare Elite units or if the batteries will die in a year. Easier to use and less expensive brush replacements make this the better choice for one or multiple users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish they would make the batteries standard size and replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. October 2011 and still working&lt;br /&gt;Update. July 2014 and still working</li>
    <li> It cleans pretty well. I like its 30 second timers and it feels like the brisels have a good reach.  It does not remove plaque, but I doubt it was designed for it.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with it and feel like it does a good job. Of course the ultimate test will be my dentist.</li>
    <li> Second one we&#x27;ve bought for the family - it works great! Like professional cleaning, only without the pinchy bits.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying this was a fantastic toothbrush. It seriously feels like you just got your mouth cleaned at the dentist office every time you use it.     With that said.... Now I got a good deal on it, but this is still a very expensive toothbrush. I expected to get substantial usage out of it or for it to at least have a lifetime warranty (as it retails over $100). After about 18 months of use, mine stopped charging well and at about 20 months the pulsating mechanism started failing... would just turn off every couple seconds. Luckily the brush does have a 2 year warranty, so I&#x27;ll be able to get it repaired for free still. However, 18 months from now, I feel like it&#x27;s going to start acting up again and I will no longer have a warranty. That means I&#x27;ll have gotten less than 4 years usage out of a toothbrush costing over $100. Looking back, I should have found one with a lifetime warranty because that&#x27;s a lot to spend on a toothbrush every 4 years. Or god forbid it lasts 2 years before it acts up... then I might have dropped a lot of cash on a toothbrush I really only got to use 2 years.</li>
    <li> We bought two; one for me and one for my wife. My wife&#x27;s stopped working within a year, so we were able to utilize the warrante. Mine stopped working within two years. Too Late. This is not worth buying for one or two years of use. I now have purchased a Pursonic High Power. We will see how it does.</li>
    <li> My reason for buying the Sonic Complete is because I was experiencing lots of sensitivity with a regular tooth brush, and my  Sonicare Advanced stopped working after three years. I did a little research and decided to get the Sonic complete based on design and competitive price. I have used this tooth brush for three days now and was compelled to write this review.  The s-320 is well designed and superior to my old Sonicare because of the following:   - Criss-crossed brisles cover more surface area than regular brisles.  - Removable built-in brush head storage on charger has drainage holes to prevent mildew.  - Brush head is overmolded with rubber.  - Handle is very light and compact compared to Sonicare Advanced.  - Handle is overmolded with rubber that prevents slippage and is contoured for the hand.   - The color of the unit itself is eye catching.   - The shaft that holds the brush heads acts like a tuining fork.  - Three speeds   - Charger is wall mountable.     The only drawback that I can think of is the battery because it is nickle-cadmium (ni-cad) which charges slow and is prone to \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot;. What I do now is not leave my toothbrush on the charger on a daily basis, I learned my lesson from the Sonicare that I had previously.    Braun claims that this toothbrush can be used for up to 14 days without a charge, that might sound impressive but Braun is assuming that you brush twice a day for two  minutes each brushing. I happen to brush after each meal and I eat allot so I dont think that my toothbrush can last the 14 days without a charge, in addition to that I always brush my tougue so that&#x27;s another minute or two.    Despite some of the drawbacks that I mentioned this toothbrush impresses me. It&#x27;s been close to two months since my sonicare broke and before I got the Sonic Complete I have been using an old fashioned manual tooth brush. My gums have been receding because agressive use of the manual tootbrush most of my life, so I was upset to use it again until I found a suitable replacement. My gums were bleeding and my teeth had lots of tartar left behind before I flossed. Now since I have used the sonic complete no trace of tartar has been left for me to floss and my gums aren&#x27;t bleeding anymore. Another thing that I am impressed with is my coffee and nicotine stains on the top of my molars have almost disappeared, I&#x27;m thinking it will take a week for the stains to fully disappear.</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended an electric toothbrush - a sonic (any sonic) in particular.  After looking around at the different offerings, I decided that this model appeared to offer everything I wanted and apparently was well liked by other users.  I found the best deal I could and decided to take the plunge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m happy to report I absolutely love this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve tried other cheaper electrics that have left me feeling like I&#x27;d been trying to change a spark plug with my teeth.  The sonic complete has a strong but well controlled vibration that actually feels quite nice during brushing and leaves gums tingling (in a good way) afterwards.  Very hard to describe, but I guess that&#x27;s what people are referring to when they say their teeth &#x27;feel&#x27; clean.  I find myself going past the clearly timed 2 min brushing just because it feels so nice.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I have mixed feelings about the packaging.  The toothbrush comes in a box which is encased in a very rigid plastic shell which must be cut to open.  On the one hand, it is environmentally wasteful... on the other, this is one item that I want to be SURE wasn&#x27;t used and returned by someone else (yeesh).  The peace of mind of this packaging allowed me to purchase my toothbrush on e-bay for less than half of what Amazon currently has it listed for... if you go this route, make sure that it says that it is factory sealed.  I bought the S-300 which is the same package with one less brush head for $38.  At whatever price, it is a wise investment in your overall oral health.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great electric toothbrush, comes with a hard case for travel.  I keep it on the charger all the time and have no worries when going on a week trip, I just bring the toothbrush, no charger necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smaller head, allows great access to every nook and cranny in your mouth.  I like the criss-cross design of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different modes to choose from, but I almost always just use the first (normal brush) one - I don&#x27;t have any need for the softer/massaging modes, but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 30 second and 2 minute timer on it.  So as it&#x27;s vibrating along, after 30 seconds, the vibrations pulse a few times to let you know that 30 seconds are up - then the steady vibration continues.  After 2 minutes, there is another set of break in vibrations to let you know that 2 minutes are up.  Although it&#x27;s kind of a nice feature to let you know how much time has elapsed and make sure you brush in all quadrants of your mouth - I wish I could just turn this feature off.  Reason is, every time there&#x27;s an interruption in the steady vibrating brush, I pause and wait until the pulses pass and it goes steady again.  This breaks my whole momentum and is slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that one minor issue, this toothbrush has not failed me in any other way.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought in September 2005 an Oral B S-320 for my wife and it worked fine for a while, but in less than an year the battery was dead, so she can&#x27;t use it anymore. Her previous Braun thootbrush is still working after 5 years of using. The next thootbrush that I&#x27;ll buy will be for sure a Braun one.</li>
    <li> Never going back to a regular tooth brush again. I would bring this with me on call!</li>
    <li> Our daughter had dropped a hint about this item months before her birthday. Seems a friend had one, and she was eager to try it for herself. Well, when her birthday finally arrived, of all the gifts she received, the Oral B Sonic Complete was the hit of the party. She couldn&#x27;t believe I had remembered, and she was delighted. Since receiving it, she has mentioned several times how pleased she is with the toothbruch and how well it has worked. She has not mentioned any problems at all. I just know that when a young woman receives clothes, shoes and money and then raves over a toothbrush - well, I guess I&#x27;ll be buying one for myself as well.</li>
    <li> Worked well while it lasted. It just bit the dust the other day and had to throw it out because the rechargeable battery cannot be replaced. I bought one of the cheaper models that when they stop working you don&#x27;t mind buying another. This was very expensive and didn&#x27;t last as long as I felt it should for the price.</li>
    <li> I tried all kinds of electric tooth brushes, and this by far is the best.  The three speeds is a real winner.</li>
    <li> This works well- I prefer to use it without toothpaste! (their literature never mentions toothpaste, incidentally). &lt;br /&gt;The one drawback in my opinion is that the control for changing speed, etc (really not a necessary feature, either,i.m.o.) can be activated in just the process of toothbrushing- bad design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks, twice a day, and it&#x27;s still holding the charge I gave it when it first arrived. By the way, instructions say it is fully charged out of the box but mine wasn&#x27;t so don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s not broken! It also definitely encourages you to brush for the full 2 minutes with the 30-second reminders. It&#x27;s much better than the battery-operated brushes I had gotten as a step-up from standards brushes, and I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> For the first time my teeth looks whiter. My dental technician tells me that my teeth are cleaner. My friends are noticing my teeth are looking good. This is a toothbrush of the future.</li>
    <li> This toothbrust turns itself on randomly. I purchased it 10/7/05. Sometimes, not for weeks, and then other times intermittently it turns itself on.  I&#x27;ve found it on the floor with the battery dischanged.  I&#x27;ve had to get out of bed multiple times in the middle of the night to turn it off.  One night last week, I ended up groggily bringing into bed so I could shut it off whenever it turned itself on.  My mother-in-law said she had the same problem with hers.      I emailed Oral B - no response.  I&#x27;ve checked to see if there were recalls but I haven&#x27;t found any.  I&#x27;m going to telephone 800-566-7252 to ask for a replacement even though it was bought many years ago.  This should not be happening.</li>
    <li> I have used a similar version of this toothbrush for several years. Although the batteries cannot be replaced it still is worthwhile.  I was very impressed with the rapid shipment by the supplier, BardPaper. It was received in three days via priority mail - even though amazon&#x27;s indicated supersaver time is 10 days or so.</li>
    <li> I wondered when I started using but got used to it.Use at night and never had any problems with.Purchases more toothbrush tips later on and still have the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrush and my teeth feel clean. I had another electric toothbrush that also had 30 sec increment but it would turn off after 6 segments to let you know you were done--this toothbrush does not turn off. But I do like the 3 different strengths you can select. The holder is very lightweight and I wish it were a little heavier to make it stable.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my hygienist.  Battery lasts longer than my last sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for years now and it still works wonderfully. Three speeds, I usually use the first and fastest but the slower and massage are nice when my gums are feeling sensitive or sore. Holds it’s charge for less time now than it did when I got it, but it’s still a few days and not life ending if it does give out on a trip since it’s still useable as a toothbrush. The case is handy but mine tore in half at the seam a while ago – I do probably take it on the go more than most people though. Otherwise haven’t had any problems. Put it on the charger at night, take it with me in the morning. Teeth feel clean and my dentist always compliments how great my mouth looks. Nice having the little timer function to know how long I should be spending on each section and overall on brushing.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a very nice looking and color.  Its battery is durable and last a couple of weeks at one charge when used twice a week.</li>
    <li> I did love this while it lasted.  I would have replaced the battery, but they stopped selling the toothbrush heads in stores.  I have gone through many oral-b products, they do not seem to last very long.</li>
    <li> After owning a Sonicare Elite 7500 for just over a year, like many other people, my battery started to give trouble. I kept it for awhile longer until eventually I could only brush once after charging for 12+hrs. So I decided to try the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete. It was hard to decide which was better based on research alone, as each company had their own studies claiming which was better. Below are my own personal comparisons after using each toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oral B S-320 advantages over Sonicare Elite 7500: &lt;br /&gt;1. Much easier to handle and easier to clean brush head. The Oral B brush head is nice and small and a snap to clean. The Sonicare&#x27;s head is big and is extremely difficult to thorougly clean and easily builds up a stench. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. Cheaper brush heads. Oral B heads are 3 for $20. Sonicare&#x27;s are 2 for $20. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Cheaper toothbrush. Oral B retails at an average of $100. Sonicare used to be around $130 but can be found now for about $115. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. Oral B is more attractive in terms of colors and design. This is based on opinion, however, as some may prefer Sonicare&#x27;s more basic and &#x27;professional&#x27; looking design. Plus Oral B&#x27;s brush head is fairly ugly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5. Oral B&#x27;s bristles are harder. This should mean it will better remove stains from your teeth. For some this could increase chances of bleeding gums, but in most cases, in time your mouth should become accustomed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6. Oral B&#x27;s brush heads are bigger. I would&#x27;ve thought this to be a disadvantage as it may be harder to reach the back of the mouth, but the head isn&#x27;t obtrusive, it just cleans more teeth at once. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;7. Oral has 3 cleaning modes. The massage mode is actually a different type of virbation. I don&#x27;t know if it actually works, but hey, it&#x27;s there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sonicare Elite 7500 advatanges over Oral B S-320: &lt;br /&gt;1. The Sonicare shows 5 different battery levels. The Oral B only uses one light like the Sonicare 7300. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.There are separate buttons to change speed and to power on/off the toothbrush. The Oral B uses one to control both, which is easy to do but may be sometimes annoying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other things of note &lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare may feel slightly more expensive than the Oral B, but that&#x27;s not to say the Oral B feels cheap. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Oral B continues vibrating after the 2 minute timer is up, the Sonicare stops and if you want to continue you must turn it back on. This would be a preference of either depending on the individual. I prefer it to stay on because I like to brush a bit longer than 2 minutes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s my opinion on the two brushes. You can check the Sonicare Elite 7500 page on Amazon for my review on the product. Overall, you can obviously see I think the Oral B is better. So I am happy with my switch. Hopefully the battery doesn&#x27;t mess up like the Sonicare, since they utitlize the same technology.</li>
    <li> I was using another Oral B power toothbrush (that comes with 3 or 4 different brush styles) until my dentist highly recommended the sonic by Oral B.  Teeth feel cleaner, and by brushing properly, it improves gum health too.  Get the advice from your dentist; here&#x27;s what mine recommends:  angle it against the gums and the little bubbles created by the sonic action will shoot up into the gums and ferret out more bacteria which is, of course, a good thing.</li>
    <li> I recently received this and I love it.  I had a power toothbrush that was inferior to this one, and I shopped reviews to find one that I know would not disappoint me.  This one fits the bill.  First, it&#x27;s nice to look at.  It is sleek and fits in a corner of the bath counter top.  It comes with it&#x27;s own carry case so I can take it on road trips with me; it holds a charge for a couple of weeks so I don&#x27;t need to drag the charger every where I go.  Now, the good stuff.  It feels so good !  I am a \\&quot;brusher\\&quot;.  This makes me a better brusher.  It has a timer for the 4x quads at 30x seconds each...and then has a timer when the full 2x minute recommended brushing time is done.  I like going over, I am a brusher !  And it cleans stains you didn&#x27;t know you had !  This combined with my water pik and I think I have a good handle on my almost 50y pearly whites.  It even helps with periodontic issues that we seem to get with age.  My dentist is impressed !  I would recommend everyone to try it.  If you want a great brush with great results, try it.  Oh, bonus:  It comes with a $10 mail in rebate..so I get this for next to nothing (compared to the costs of other power brushes of this quality).</li>
    <li> I have had two of these, paid full price too, twice. They both run out of life after about 9 months or so. They die, they wont power up when turned on. THey will run a second and shut off or wont turn on at all. I am really out on this product. Hope this helps you in your quest for a nice machine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product while it will last.  After 1.5 years the thing died.  I guess I will not be getting this brand again.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonic Complete in late 2005.  I used it every day twice a day for the time recommended.  In the beginning, it would hold a charge for two weeks as advertised.  In October 2006 I moved abroad for 6 months and was unable to charge the toothbrush for a month before finding an adapter &amp; converter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush did fine until two weeks ago when it randomly cut out mid-way through a brush after being charged for 12+ hours.  I was on vacation and was pretty annoyed.  I went home and when I put it on the charger, it wouldn&#x27;t even blink as if it were charged!  The light stayed steadily as if it were fully charged.  Since then it&#x27;s been totally sporadic.  I sometimes get a full 2 minute brush, other times it cuts out every 2 seconds (which is super annoying).  I&#x27;m checking out some Sonicare brushes now but I&#x27;m taking careful note of the battery reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In checking out the online service guide it says that the battery can be removed for disposal but cannot be replaced.  I guess Oral B wants you to buy a new $100+ brush every two years?  I don&#x27;t think so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great brush when it works, though I found the brush heads to be hard to find and expensive.  The battery was what really made me think poorly of the brush.  For the amount of money spent on it, I would have expected it to last 5+ years not 2 years max.!</li>
    <li> In the future, this is how people will be brushing their teeth !  Wonderful ! I love it !</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush for about 5 years without any problems. Great brush and teeth feel great after brushing. I replaced my Oral B 5000 on advice of my hygienist. Holds charge a couple of weeks and have travelled extensively with it with no problems. About a year ago, my dentil hygienist gave me a couple brush heads that were lying around the office. I now need new brush heads and as far as I can see, the Oral B Sonic Complete has been discontinued and brush heads are now very expensive and come in package of three. Not sure whether to continue with Sonic Complete or purchase new Philips top of the line sonic brush that comes with great reviews. Probably buy new heads and see if the price of the Philips ($189) comes down over the next year.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd since my last one kicked the bucket after 5 years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> A good product, however the ruber handle eventfully builds up mold unless you dry it very well after each use</li>
    <li> All I can say this item is a piece of crap! After using it for 8 months it gave up on me ;-(.Some problem with charging and power button. I have to say I&#x60;m quite dissapointed aspecially when my previous Oral B toothbrush lasted 5 years.Will not buy this product anymore</li>
