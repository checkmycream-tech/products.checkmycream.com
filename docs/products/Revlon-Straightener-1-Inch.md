### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I am now the proud owner of another paper weight!</li>
      <li>This hair straightner works really good</li>
      <li>VERY EASY AND VERY HANDY</li>
      <li>so I straighten it most of the time, when I have used this by lunch time I need a touch up!</li>
      <li>and you could order this one and save more money!</li>
      <li>this thing works great, did not expect much at such a great price!!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that tends to have a mind of it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone :]</li>
      <li>love the design on it.</li>
      <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve had this item for almost a year now</li>
      <li>This I was pleased with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, looks cute, and works FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>Reliable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The Easy Bake Oven of drug store hair straighteners.    </li>
      <li>so I have to flip it over so my hair can straighten fine.</li>
      <li>all light are ON</li>
      <li>&amp; I highly recommend buying this product if you need a cheap, cute, and functioning hair straightner!</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with how it leaves my hair straight.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good as a temp straightener, but definitely not a forever one.</li>
      <li>It does heat up quickly and as mentioned before</li>
      <li>I like how it heats up fast and it makes my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>This is essentially a piece of plastic that gets moderately warm.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time, figuring it probably wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>and I returned the old one free of charge.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend! :)</li>
      <li>After the first use it has stopped heating, could not even send the back as its costing me more than the purchase, should send their people to collect their stuffs if defective.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>After the first use it has stopped heating, could not even send the back as its costing me more than the purchase,&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I just recently received this straightener and i LOVE it.</li>
      <li>The product lasted me for a while, however it was just overall made pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>Also my hair is long, curly, and thick and it still works great on me!</li>
      <li>is very lightweight but the grip near the top gets way to hot to touch which means I cannot clamp down on my hair as securely as I would like.</li>
      <li>They shipped me a new one right away</li>
      <li>It was really straight.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>Love the design and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
      <li>So I got a new one.</li>
      <li>But to my surprise the new iron looked exactly the same....</li>
      <li>and The entire iron is not even hot ,  </li>
      <li>I won this in a raffle and am glad I did not pay for it because after a year of little to moderate use I am in the market for a new one.</li>
      <li>This product burnt my 11 year old daughters hand on Christmas day.</li>
      <li>I finished straightening my hair and was surprised at how well it worked.</li>
      <li>upset with the purchase this item completely</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t grab onto your hair because the plates don&#x27;t completely close all they way...</li>
      <li>Yes, its got cute packaging, yes its lightweight, and YES IT STRAIGHTENS my thick curly hair</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t touch Outside When high temperature .i think it use low material .</li>
      <li>My old straightener actually wasn&#x27;t working on my hair.</li>
      <li>Sometimes doesnt turn on, doesnt heat effectively making it difficult to straighten hair.</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny, and it does not make my hair frizzy like my other straightener did.</li>
      <li>It also loses its heat after a short amount of time which isn&#x27;t too good if you&#x27;re one of the people like me that has REALLY thick hair and needs an extra kick of heat to keep your hair from frizzing out.</li>

<li> 1 star for the overall customer service - 1 star for the adjustable temperature setting - 1 star for the affordable price...but ultimately not what I expected.</li>
<li> and it does nothing for my thick, wavy, stubborn hair- even with settings all the way up to high.</li>
<li> Returned first one as it arrived broken.</li>
<li> The entire iron gets hot, including the handle, so you can&#x27;t hold it without burning yourself, rendering this item completely useless.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve looked for other hair straightners at the mall &amp; stores but</li>
<li> but the other does,</li>
<li> BUT, the black coating that is on the plates wears down and flakes off into your hair</li>
<li> I bought it the end of December and one of the black circles on the side</li>
<li> like I have black dandruff (not cute)</li>
<li> there usually around $30-$50</li>
<li> That was a little disappointing.</li>
<li> (that holds it together is already broken.</li>
<li> So it can be difficult to straighten.</li>
<li> I hope it holds up for a while without it :(</li>
<li> i think this is the worst product i ever used ...</li>

    <li> Great product! Love the design and it hasn&#x27;t let me down. Reliable and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone :]</li>
    <li> I just recently received this straightener and i LOVE it. It heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny, and it does not make my hair frizzy like my other straightener did. Definitely recommend! :)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up also it doesn&#x27;t grab onto your hair because the plates don&#x27;t completely close all they way...</li>
    <li> I like how it heats up fast and it makes my hair smooth. I bought it the end of December and one of the black circles on the side (that holds it together is already broken. I hope it holds up for a while without it :(</li>
    <li> this thing works great, did not expect much at such a great price!! love the design on it. thank ya!!!</li>
    <li> I am not complaining about the product. I like it a lot, but I am complaining about the price. As soon as I got mine, I saw the same straightener in stored for only $14. That was a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> I will not recommend this straighter to any one .. i think this is the worst product i ever used ... it stopped working even it all light are ON and The entire iron is not even hot ,  After the first use it has stopped heating, could not even send the back as its costing me more than the purchase,&lt;br /&gt;Very upset with the purchase this item completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, time n energy</li>
    <li> 1 star for the overall customer service - 1 star for the adjustable temperature setting - 1 star for the affordable price...but ultimately not what I expected. I&#x27;ll start off by saying when I received the iron it didn&#x27;t look how I expected. The picture gives a sort of metallic impression but the iron is a simple matte white color. When I opened the package some areas were scratched and there was a cracked circular piece by the handle that kept sliding which irritated me. I immediately contacted Amazon to have the item exchanged. They shipped me a new one right away and I returned the old one free of charge. This I was pleased with. But to my surprise the new iron looked exactly the same.... I guess that&#x27;s how they come. I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it so I decided to keep it since it is usable; I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t touch Outside When high temperature .i think it use low material .</li>
    <li> This product burnt my 11 year old daughters hand on Christmas day. &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; left her this hair straightener that burnt her</li>
    <li> This works well and the flower design is a plus. I am satisfied with how it leaves my hair straight. I would recommend this for people who are looking for a simple straightener for hair.</li>
    <li> Yes, its got cute packaging, yes its lightweight, and YES IT STRAIGHTENS my thick curly hair BUT, the black coating that is on the plates wears down and flakes off into your hair so when I&#x27;ve finished straightening my hair its looks like I have black dandruff (not cute) both in my hair and all over whatever shirt I&#x27;m wearing. It does heat up quickly and as mentioned before is very lightweight but the grip near the top gets way to hot to touch which means I cannot clamp down on my hair as securely as I would like. I won this in a raffle and am glad I did not pay for it because after a year of little to moderate use I am in the market for a new one.</li>
    <li> I am now the proud owner of another paper weight! I have fine hair that tends to have a mind of it&#x27;s own so I straighten it most of the time, when I have used this by lunch time I need a touch up!</li>
    <li> I used it once and am returning it.  The entire iron gets hot, including the handle, so you can&#x27;t hold it without burning yourself, rendering this item completely useless.</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve had this item for almost a year now and I&#x27;ve had NO problems with it!! It&#x27;s cheap, looks cute, and works FANTASTIC! I&#x27;ve looked for other hair straightners at the mall &amp; stores but there usually around $30-$50 and you could order this one and save more money! Also my hair is long, curly, and thick and it still works great on me! No complaints over this year that I&#x27;ve used this product! This hair straightner works really good &amp; I highly recommend buying this product if you need a cheap, cute, and functioning hair straightner!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She doesn&#x27;t like it as it seems to pull her hair out as she is straightening it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. So it can be difficult to straighten. My old straightener actually wasn&#x27;t working on my hair. So I got a new one. I tried it for the first time, figuring it probably wouldn&#x27;t work. I finished straightening my hair and was surprised at how well it worked. It was really straight. Not to mention before hand I had my hair curled for an event. I had a Loy of hairspray in it too. And it stayed straight for a few days. It works very well.</li>
    <li> VERY EASY AND VERY HANDY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and it does nothing for my thick, wavy, stubborn hair- even with settings all the way up to high. This is essentially a piece of plastic that gets moderately warm. The Easy Bake Oven of drug store hair straighteners.    **FOLLOW UP** This straightener just stopped working out of the blue. I&#x27;ve used it MAYBE 15 times.</li>
    <li> After the first use it has stopped heating, could not even send the back as its costing me more than the purchase, should send their people to collect their stuffs if defective.&lt;br /&gt;Very upset with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, time n energy</li>
    <li> Sometimes doesnt turn on, doesnt heat effectively making it difficult to straighten hair. Returned first one as it arrived broken.</li>
    <li> The product lasted me for a while, however it was just overall made pretty cheap. It just broke where one side of the iron doesn&#x27;t work but the other does, so I have to flip it over so my hair can straighten fine. It also loses its heat after a short amount of time which isn&#x27;t too good if you&#x27;re one of the people like me that has REALLY thick hair and needs an extra kick of heat to keep your hair from frizzing out. It&#x27;s good as a temp straightener, but definitely not a forever one.</li>
