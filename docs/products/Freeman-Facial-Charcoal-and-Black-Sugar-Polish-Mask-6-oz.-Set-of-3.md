      <li>It clears the pores, makes them look smaller and and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>

      <li>My skin has never been smoother, softer, or nearly as polished.</li>
      <li>This is the first face scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried that does not leave my face feeling irritated and dry.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re face wash with a few tiny smooth beads floating around.</li>
      <li>I have light, sensitive skin with a few breakouts, and after using various kinds of scrubs, I was having the worse luck in finding a product that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my face causing more breakouts.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff. I have sensitive very fair combination skin. I have bizarre skin sensitives as well. Most products will leave me lobster red. I also I tend to collect dead skin cells around my nose that cause that flaky look once foundation has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every scrub I could find and nothing worked. I discovered that most things labeled as &amp;#34;face scrubs&amp;#34; are absolute jokes. They&#x27;re face wash with a few tiny smooth beads floating around. I needed the thickness of a body or foot scrub, but those left my face scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect. I rarely use it as a mask. Instead of scrub my face every other day in the shower. My skin has never been smoother, softer, or nearly as polished. There&#x27;s zero redness too! I simply adore this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it mind it&#x27;s sold for about three to four bucks a bottle at walmart, ulta, cvs, and walgreens. Smaller walmarts may only carry the individual packages.</li>
    <li> Use this 2-3 times a week. A little goes a looonngggggg way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use just a little bit or add a little extra if you cover neck and chest. Feels great gently messaging it on the skin. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, massage again with a bit more water (this time the granulates will be mostly if not completely dissolved) then rinse and feel the softness of your skin (this follows the directions on the tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a faint smell...the ingredients list several things that could add to a scent and they even add &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;. It is not over powering but noticeable until rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, LUV IT!!!</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week. It clears the pores, makes them look smaller and and leaves the skin feeling smooth. I use it in the evening which gives my regular evening treatment a chance to be absorbed an work better.</li>
    <li> I love this, and was surprised at how soft my face was. I don&#x27;t even remember my face being so soft as a child. I&#x27;m so impressed and will definitely keep ordering this brand and even this exact product.</li>

    <li> This is the first face scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried that does not leave my face feeling irritated and dry. I have light, sensitive skin with a few breakouts, and after using various kinds of scrubs, I was having the worse luck in finding a product that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my face causing more breakouts. I had tried the Freeman avocado clay mask first, and decided to give this charcoal sugar mask a try. I absolutely loved how it left my face feeling smooth and did not dry my skin out. My breakouts are more controlled since my face is much less irritated by the sugar. I also love how it is a 2-in-1 product! It is perfect for my endeavor to decrease the amount of products I use. I now use it as both a face and body scrub. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the harmful chemicals I&#x27;ve seen listed in other face masks and facial products, and it&#x27;s more affordable than the majority of other facial sugar scrubs I&#x27;ve seen out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great Polish Mask!!! Really removes the dead skin cells and leaves the skin glowing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Your face feels SO smooth after just one time.</li>
    <li> I love this product it opens the pores and makes my skin feel incredibly smooth, I also use it on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Super love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes your face feel so clean!</li>
    <li> For a while I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin due to excessive oil production and failure to exfoliate my skin properly. My nose has looked like it&#x27;s had freckles on it since the beginning of puberty, but they weren&#x27;t freckles... Grey blackheads were everywhere, along with acne scars and zits... I&#x27;m 19 now, and I&#x27;m acne and blackhead free due to this scrub. Holy freaking cow this stuff is gooooooood. My face is gorgeous now, no thanks to Proactiv or any other face wash. This leaves your skin perfect, smooth, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out one bit! It actually hydrates your skin the right way. I will use this for the rest of my life. Thank you Freeman!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;d recommend trying some of their other products as well, this company knows what it&#x27;s doing to say the least.</li>
    <li> I bought this once at a CVS - it was the last one left and I figured I&#x27;d try it.  I LOVE it!  I can&#x27;t find it in my local stores so searched on Amazon.  This facial mask heats up in your hands and leaves my skin feeling really soft and smooth.  This is a product that I continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Makes face soft as a baby and really produces large poors</li>
    <li> It works. It&#x27;s nice. What&#x27;s NOT nice is the 2 bottles I e had the caps don&#x27;t just fold and click back on. You have to press it hard. Time goes on and you have to then tap it to close all the way. Used in the shower so I didn&#x27;t care.......much the damn thing should close.with a flick n slight push!!  Haha</li>
    <li> It was perfect thanks</li>
    <li> All of the benefits of a scrub and none of the downsides of others.  We&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.</li>
