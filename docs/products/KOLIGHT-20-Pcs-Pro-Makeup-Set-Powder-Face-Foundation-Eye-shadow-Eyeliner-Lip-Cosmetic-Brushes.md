<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They look soo nice. I like how the stick is a matte black and the top part is shiny, looks good. Brushes are soo soft it even feels good!</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for these based on the reviews. I am a huge fan of firm brushes bc they are easier to control ur application. These brushes however, are WAY TO HARD and Firm. I know it says 20 pcs but so many of them are the same brush over and over and over. The concealer brush was the best part of this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love them so far. Haven&#x27;t got to use them yet since I just opened them.&lt;br /&gt;Also could someone show me exactly what each brush is and what it&#x27;s for. Most look the same to me.</li>
    <li> poor quality, save yourself the time and hassle and invest in quality products. The brushes do not evenly distribute product even after flicking excess off</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush set.  Can&#x27;t believe how little it cost.  Very much worth the money.</li>
    <li> good quality however it looks like the brushes are repeated</li>
    <li> I got them quicker than expected and they are very nice and sturdy. I was  surprised because of all the bad reviews, but they&#x27;re really good for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Good enough quality brushes for the price, but not entirely pleased. Opened one of the brushes for the first time, and it fell off of the handle. Guess it&#x27;s time to whip out the super glue.</li>
    <li> Love them they are perfect</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet. But so far so good. Super soft and no shedding. For the price these are great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with the brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes at a great value. Definitely a win win. I love them.</li>
    <li> Perfect conditions my sister love this!!! 👍 (^__^)</li>
    <li> I ordered Saturday and got them within 2 days.  They&#x27;re great. Some are a little stiff but I&#x27;m fine with that.  For the price that&#x27;s good. You won&#x27;t regret buying them.</li>
    <li> not bad.. just too long of a stick.</li>
    <li> In love with these brushes they are quality brushes</li>
    <li> I love them so much.!! They are really cheap, but work like the usual price. Also these brushes haven&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes were made of nylon fibers so a bit rough/hard on skin...so I got what I paid for!&lt;br /&gt;Next time I would invest on better brushes but it&#x27;s a good starter kit.</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes. Great quality. They&#x27;re all eye brushes except one foundation brush. You get that, a spooly, tapered brush, two yellow bristled bigger shadow brushes, one small angled brush, one medium angled brush (double ended, small shadow brush on the other end), one large angled brush, eight medium and small shadow brushes (two double ended, one with a sponge and one with a thin liner brush), a sponge brush, a liner brush, a large flat brush, and a flat angled brush. This set is great if you want a lot of eye brushes. They are all very soft with little-to-no shedding. Also nice handles, black, not thin but not thick. My only complaint is that they&#x27;re not labeled/named/numbered/anything - but I do love them!</li>
    <li> I really liked the brushes. They were individually wrapped, and really soft. They do smell new, but the smell goes away after you open all of them. I like they way they pick up make up and I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Package came right on time &amp; was exactly what I expected! Wish it came with &amp;#34;brush application uses&amp;#34; for amateur MUAs&#x27; :) lol! Love it tho</li>
    <li> These are okay brushes. You get what you pay for on this product.</li>
    <li> I like them because they are small &amp; non of the hair came out while using them.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s maybe 5 brushes that I really liked. The rest of them are too stiff but I guess for the price it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft and you get a lot more for what you pay for, the brushes are amazing they apply wonder fully. Great use of money!</li>
    <li> Good brushes. Only negative was that one of the brushes the brush&#x27;s bristles whatever those things at the top are called, fall out when u use them. The rest are perfect. The kabuki brushes are my absolute favorite.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes never hurts to have too many same brushes And these were wonderful!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes. Affordable.</li>
    <li> These brushes were very versatile to be used for many different eye and face makeup looks. I enjoy using them daily. Easy to clean and not flimsy or cheap. Great variety as well. Some seem like duplicates but if you look closely you will see the texture of the bristles are different. Some firmer and some softer to create different looks. Excellent deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Different sizes; event though some of the tools may look the same, or are the same, Yet&lt;br /&gt;the versatility to have different sizes and shapes of makeup brushes is great when applying your product, no need to worry about transferring different color products (eye shadows) on to your eye lids. Synthetic brushes are of good quality.  It is worth the price...</li>
    <li> These are great for the price. I thought they would be cheap but they work nice and are super soft.</li>
    <li> They came in weeks earlier than expected so I was really surprised. The bristles are really soft and pretty high quality. I&#x27;m a person who always looks for the cheap things and I&#x27;ve bought a different cheaper brand of brushes online before and they sucked so I had my doubts about buying these since they were pretty cheap but I&#x27;m not disappointed. I love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived a day before i love them only down thing is the smell of the handle but left them out to air out and they are fine</li>
    <li> they where amazing! im a makeup artist so my brush is my main tool, so I need the best of the best, and these are it! they are so soft and blend so easily. could not be any happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I ordered last Friday and received them today. No shedding at all. I pulled the bristles on each brush and received no shedding. No harsh smell. Each one individually wrapped. I received 20 brushes no duplicate&#x27;s. These are nice starter brushes. Will I order again? Most definitely. This is my initial review upon receiving them. Have not used these yet.</li>
    <li> Brushes work great.  Great variety of sizes.</li>
    <li> They get the job done. Nothing too special about them.</li>
    <li> They are smooth and the ends are super soft. I love applying my makeup with these brushes.</li>
    <li> These are great quality. Although it says &amp;#34;20 piece&amp;#34; some of the brushes are double sided. These are not the softest brushes in the world BUT they are firm and as far as color pick up they are comparable to ELF brushes and are better in some ways. I really reccomend this set to someone like me who loves makeup but hates paying ridiculous amounts of money in stores.</li>
    <li> Decent quality brushes, very worth the price. I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> Very good brush n cheap</li>
    <li> Great for beginners&lt;br /&gt;They are ok brushes, good for packing on the color, not so good for blending</li>
    <li> so I got my brushes today and decided to try them out. Overall they are really good brushes for eye makeup and contouring the face. The quality of these brushes is great however some of these brushes do seem do be duplicates. I do not too much mind the duplicate brushes because it allows me to keep going without having to clean a brush for a new task. The only major downside to these brushes is the lack insrtuctions. These brushes come in a plastic bag with no instructions so for anyone who is new to make-up these may not be the brushes for you. I did not have a problem with this because I have been doing make up for years and pretty much knew what each brush was for. However, if you are new to make-up this could be confusing.  Overall, for the price the quality is unbeatable and I would say this is a great purchase for a seasoned artist.</li>
    <li> Really  stiff brushes that bend at force  not as soft as i thought they where</li>
    <li> They look nice, and work even better. I would absolutely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! I&#x27;m considering buying again just to have double the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d change is adding a blush brush/blending brush. Honestly this is a great set and I&#x27;ve been using them daily for a month and a half with no issues.</li>
    <li> Great quality, great assortment</li>
    <li> These are pretty decent brushes for the price. I&#x27;ve used about half of them so far, and have not had any fallout. I always wash new brushes when I get them, so I didn&#x27;t notice any weird scent or coating on them. If you&#x27;re on a budget or starting out with makeup and want to experiment with different sizes/shapes/styles of brushes, these are a good choice. Then you&#x27;ll know what you reach for the most and can invest in better versions of just those.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes just wished the were labeled</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes not even 5 minutes ago. They came early which I like. These brushes are very soft and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. The only down fall is that some of the brushes are exactly the same. I got three of the same brushes which could be used as a lip or concealer brush. But overall I like them a lot.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re OK brushes. Nothing great, they blend alright but not very well. Sythetic hairs.</li>
    <li> These were great. I&#x27;m so glad I bought them. They are of good quality for less money.</li>
    <li> love these brushes and very soft foundation brush I washed them as soon as I got them they did not have a harsh Small at all still always wash before use 1 brush did shed a little but for the price it&#x27;s a good buy I would recommendMakeupAcc® 20 Pcs Pro Makeup Set Powder Foundation Eyeshadow Eyeliner Lip Cosmetic Brushes</li>
    <li> Great product especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Really good, and effective</li>
    <li> Nice brushed for the price.</li>
    <li> They are nice brushes for the price. but I just feel Like a lot of them are the same and there are not and Fluffy Blending brushes. I have used a majority of them and they work well. I Just wish there was more variety and more fluffy brushes...</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes.... Especially for the price... Better than some of my more expensive ones!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get these brushes after reading so many positive reviews, but I am not happy with them now that they have arrived. The are so stiff. The concealer brush is the softest one, and they aren&#x27;t meant to be soft. They don&#x27;t evenly apply eye makeup, and don&#x27;t even think about blending with these brushes. The best use is for harsh lines like eye liner. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy a better quality brush set  I don&#x27;t know, maybe I got a bad set</li>
    <li> For the money these brushes are amazing, they even rival some of my really expensive makeup brushes</li>
    <li> AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!! brushes are so soft and I use them every day!!! Well worth the $8!!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality and the price is perfect👍👊😀</li>
    <li> This set has every size and shape brush that I use in my makeup routine and then some.  I hesitated on buying such a large collection but am SO glad I did because I&#x27;m really happy with the quality so far.  The thinner brushes are especially awesome, and I like the foundation brush a lot too.  Nice smooth bristles, easy to clean material.  Yay, overall.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful! I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them but I am pleasantly surprised on how nice they are considering the mixed reviews</li>
    <li> Okay so I was doubting about buy these brushes , but I am glad I did ! They are amazing ! They are so soft and work amazing . One of favorite sets of brushes . . Must say that a lot of the brushes look a like but some come small and thinner</li>
    <li> You get everything in the picture. The brushes seem to be in fine quality. Not a bad buy at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use all of these because to be honest I don&#x27;t know what half of them are for, but the ones I do use are great! I definitely recommend buying!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these.  No bristles have fallen out.  Weight is kind of light but still very well made.  For the cost these are amazing I was expecting subpar but not with these.</li>
    <li> These brushes are GREAT</li>
    <li> Wish it told you on the brushes what brush was what for beginners. Other than that, looks very nice</li>
    <li> Good for beginners and good value set.</li>
    <li> Its amazing! It got here on time. The brushes are really soft!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice quality! I don&#x27;t agree with anyone who doesn&#x27;t think they are awesome. They also work great. I definetly recommend! In the photo I already unwrapped a few so I could see how they feel. All of them are individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes. Easy to clean</li>
    <li> They came on time which was great! They have a smell when you unwrap them individually but o washed them and they held together well, I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
