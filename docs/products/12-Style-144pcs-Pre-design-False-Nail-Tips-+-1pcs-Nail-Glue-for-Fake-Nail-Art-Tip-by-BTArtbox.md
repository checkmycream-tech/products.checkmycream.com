    <li> If you can wear them super long there&#x27;s no problem.  I need to clip these down and they break and also the decals peel from the edges.&lt;br /&gt;Very pretty nails however!</li>
    <li> Over it so much I even got it early the glue bottle is small but that&#x27;s all get this now</li>
    <li> Love these nails..need to sell more different styles</li>
    <li> I loved the nails very much .I give you a five star rating thank you</li>
    <li> They lost my package! They did resend new ones, but they are broken and EXTREMELY long! They are very fake looking. The glue is a VERY tiny bottle as well...NEVER BUY THESE!!</li>
    <li> Very good item for a quick nail fix.  Very pretty.</li>
    <li> I really like the nails! They give you more nail designs then shown. Only thing is they are VERY long</li>
    <li> Another set of nails I&#x27;ve ordered and what I got was nothing near what is shown in the picture.  If I&#x27;d known I could upload a picture I would have taking a picture so everyone can see what I actually received.  When they finally arrived they looked like something that a little girl would play with, not as advertised.</li>
    <li> i love this idea my wedding will be very diffrenance happy</li>
    <li> I am editing my review to a more positive one. This was my previous reviuew...Disappointed! Not what is shown. Some are OK. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more than I did.  Needs the description to say &amp;#34;may not receive the designs pictured&amp;#34;. Fool me once, shame on you.....there won&#x27;t be a &amp;#34; twice&amp;#34;.. The dealer paid attention and sent me the ones pictured. The nails first time and second are very long. Most can be trimmed and still look good. They are more flexible like real nails. If you pair them with kiss flexible nail glue, you will get a comfortable fit.each set last me 7 days unless I break one. I get lots of compliments. I will be a return customer! Thanks seller for listening and acting!!</li>
