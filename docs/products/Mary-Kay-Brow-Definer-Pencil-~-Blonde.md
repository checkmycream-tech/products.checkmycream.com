    <li> Hard as a brick and didn&#x27;t work. Threw it in the gargabe.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BROWN HAIR AND THIS BLOND PENCIL FILLS IN MY BROWS WITHOUT MAKING THEM LOOK LIKE I PUT BROW PENCIL ON. WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING IT ON IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING UNTIL YOU STEP BACK FROM THE MIRROR AND YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS. I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS PENCIL TO ANYONE WHO DOESN&#x27;T WANT TO LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF MAKEUP ON.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected.  There may be a better product from Mary kay that does not have to be sharpened every day.  Sometime it is hard to tell when ordering on-line.</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention when I bought this.  I like the Mary Kay \\&quot;classic wood\\&quot; pencil.  This is the definer pencil which is totally different.  I kept it and use it but it is a little more difficult to apply than the wood pencil.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair and this is the perfect color to get the natural look. Love this and will use it again and again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay products for the past 27 years and have found nothing better. The quality is better than any product I&#x27;ve used in my 67 years of life. It&#x27;s superb! I&#x27;ll always use Mary Kay because it works and lasts.</li>
