      <li>/&gt;This has turned out to be a much longer review, but it is for 4 products!!!</li>
      <li>I am excited to see what my skin will look like in another three weeks.</li>
      <li>The overall difference in my skin is amazing but the difference in the dark spots is INCREDIBLE!  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the entire line, so this handy sample size was idea for me to try without spending a lot on full size bottles of a product that didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
      <li>I have a nice glow to my skin, pimples I had before using this are clearing up nicely, and I have noticed dark spots/scars are already fading away.  </li>
      <li>I recommend buying the travel kit to test out before buying full sizes.</li>
      <li>Love this whole line.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately I found a great substitute at my local CVs, which is Jason&#x27;s Ester-C Super-C Cleanser, much cheaper</li>
      <li>I used this product for 2 days and my face broke out mildly.</li>
      <li>Great product works like they say it does my dark spots are almost gone.</li>
      <li>The spots have not disappeared, but they do seem less noticeable and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Absorbed quickly into the skin after cleansing in the morning, I think it protects/shields the skin before applying moisturizer/sunblock.</li>
      <li>I bought this after a facial and really love it!  </li>
      <li>I was left to figure out how to use each product on my own.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and bought this because it said that it was ok for all skin types ( 30 with acne</li>
      <li>I wish the serum was in a larger bottle, it works so nice.</li>
      <li>well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I get a rare pimple</li>
      <li>Soon, I&#x27;ll do an evaluation of whether they&#x27;re worth the price for long-term use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth continuing with it since I have seen an over all improvement.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Nice way to test the different products before spending $$ on the line.  </li>
      <li>Will purchase the full size with a higher SPF if poss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great starter set to see if you like the product. I found the murad products really make a difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and bought this because it said that it was ok for all skin types ( 30 with acne prone skin).&lt;br /&gt;My normal routine is Simple Moisturing wash &amp; Moisturizer followed by Retinol for the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to even out my skin tone and help with the sunspots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this two weeks ago and have only used it once due to my face breaking out in a terrible rash! The first time it happened I shrugged it off as environmental (like I said, super sensitive skin) but after a week of cortizone and letting my face rest- I tried it again and it happened again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with extremely sensitive skin- be careful. It&#x27;s not worth the itching/redness and bumps!</li>
    <li> The Murad Radiant Skin Renewal kit works great! I wear it every day because I am always out in the sun for long periods of time. It keeps my skin looking healthy and adds a nice glow/gleam. The moisturizer does protect my face from the sun for almost an entire day, and that&#x27;s only using a little dab. This kit does last quite a long time if used sparingly. 5 star product in my opinion! It&#x27;s all I need to protect &amp; enhance my face despite the sun.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the product itself because it did not come with any directions. I was left to figure out how to use each product on my own.</li>
    <li> I love these Murad products!  I would definitely recommend this item to others.  They smell good, my skin likes them too, and I would purchase again!!</li>
    <li> perfect travel size; I actually bought a second set specifically for travel.  Also, I&#x27;ve been using at least the two daytime products for a month or two now, and have been pleased.  Soon, I&#x27;ll do an evaluation of whether they&#x27;re worth the price for long-term use</li>
    <li> will start using it as soon as i&#x27;m done with the Age Defining.</li>
    <li> I was a sun worshiper as a kid, before we all knew the affects of the sun. So now just want to repair so sun spots, I have only been using product for three weeks buy have noticed my skin&#x27;s clarity brighter.</li>
    <li> I love it! great product</li>
    <li> Used it two times and a huge blind pimple, I never break out , so going back, plus my skin looks shiny</li>
    <li> seemed to be a very good products</li>
    <li> Great product works like they say it does my dark spots are almost gone. Very happy and will keeping on using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 43 y.o. female who was introduced to the murad Vitamen C line with a professional facial. I had been wanting skin products to even out uneven skin tone on my cheeks and forehead for a while, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money testing lots of different products that may or may not work. I am really happy to say that I used these for 4 weeks and my skin tone was definitely more even. The best compliment was when a co-worker asked me what I used on my face because my \\&quot;skin always looked so great.\\&quot; I tried a different line of murad for more moisturizing and fine lines, but I&#x27;m coming back to the vitamen C line. It is refreshing and make your skin feel good and healthy! Try it!</li>
    <li> My skin discolorations faded after one week and continued to fade thereafter. I have one dark sunspot that was lightened by this product. Murad Radiant Skin really works!</li>
    <li> I like the Murad put four of their skin products in one group.  Everything arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I usually use Murad&#x27;s acne facewash, but decided to introduce this to remove freckles and age spots on my face post pregnancy.  I&#x27;m 30 and have combination skin, and this not only helped reduce my newly developed age spots, but was ALSO great for my sometimes breakout prone skin. GREAT product set!</li>
    <li> This is the smallest kit you could every imagine for the price.  Better of buying from Murad and asking for free samples.  They always provide me with great samples and service.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. bough this for my mom and she loves it! i have heard a lot of good things about this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. Used daily for 2 months and ZERO improvement to pigmentation or overall texture</li>
    <li> I like murad product a lot . I just wish these were just a little larger</li>
    <li> This shipping was fast and everything was in great shape!&lt;br /&gt;the product works great! At first my face broke out in a rash on my jaw line, but after a few days everything cleared up. after two weeks my skin looked more even in color and people would say, &amp;#34;you look so young and fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This skin care kit works amazing ,the box tell you then you see improvemnt in you first apication, so i did . so far so good but i still have a few spots to fade away ,all the sun burn my skin pretty good . i hope if i continued with the Murad skin renewal kit i be better shape . i highly recomended to any one or not any one but you have to try see if you skin accep the murad kit. ps this kit is so small like hotel shampo size.</li>
    <li> Just started using The kit two days ago I don&#x27;t see a major difference in my sunspots except my face feels amazing! This kit comes with a day lotion that has SPF in it so it&#x27;s not great to use at night you might want to also buy a separate night cream. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 days and my face broke out mildly. So I gave it a few days off and then tried again. I was embarrassed to go to work today because my face is so broken out. I am in my 50&#x27;s and have not had a breakout for 25 years. This is definitely not a product for me.</li>
    <li> Smells good , love the cleanser plus extras.. all for an affordable price. Will definitely reorder in months to come.</li>
    <li> These products are top notch! Lightening serum works wonders. Love the sunscreen moisturizer! Smells amazing citrusy and soaks into your skin instead of sitting on top.</li>
    <li> It took about a week to start noticing results, but I could definitely see that the spots were fading.  After ordering another kit, I could see even more fading results.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It works for my skin. The treatment portion works well for me; my skin glows so much.I learned about Murad products in Esthetics School, so I knew the product would deliver the results I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Has a good variety and the products are very high quality. They seem small, but they go a long way.  Nice way to test the different products before spending $$ on the line.  The products go on smooth, absorb quickly into skin, and have a pleasant sweet orangy smell.  It&#x27;s a nice travel/sample kit.</li>
    <li> I liked this kit. The cleanser and active repair serum were wonderful and I think I&#x27;ll buy them again as full-sized products. I didn&#x27;t really get to test the spot clearer. The sunscreen/day lotion was a little too thick for me. I have combination/oily skin and live in a very hot/humid climate, so I love the idea of having the sunscreen built in, but it was too heavy for daytime, and there&#x27;s no reason to have a night cream with SPF. This kit is cheaper than buying even a single one of these in full-size so I recommend it if you&#x27;re interested in trying something out.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while, and I have to say that I haven&#x27;t noticed much change. May be, I have to use it longer, not sure. The quality of cosmetics is very high, but I am not sure if this brightening treatment works.</li>
    <li> I have gotten several complaints about my skin since using this line of products. However,  my brown spots have not lightened. Which is why I purchased it.  It&#x27;s worth continuing with it since I have seen an over all improvement. Gives your skin a very nice healthy glow.</li>
    <li> Love this whole line.  Murad makes my skin look and feel wonderful without making it oily (something I have had issues with in other products)</li>
    <li> Would like better if items were bigger.</li>
    <li> I trust people have some great things to say about this product.  I am 35 and mildly sensitive skinned.  I used Oil of Olay Regenerist prior to trying this product.  The first time I put it on my skin, it started to burn by the end of the day and felt like I had a chemical burn.  I tried one more time and then decided I needed to return it.  The burning and itching did not go away until finally after 2 months of irritation and what looked like 5 years of aging being added to my eyes (and swelling and itching of my eyelids), I went to my dermatologist and was diagnosed with Seborrheic Dermatitis.  I almost wrote it off that it was me not the product, but according to research, this is a chronic disorder (woohoo, a life time of flare ups, can&#x27;t wait!) that is usually triggered by stress to the skin or body.  They may be totally unconnected.  However, I went into this with the attitude that, \\&quot;Hey, I can always get my money back, what can I lose?\\&quot; And now I know.  I can no longer use my Olay product or really any lotions on my face due to the irritations (I am using straight coconut oil now) and my eyes look so much older.  I am drinking water like crazy and taking cod liver oil supplements to try to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, all kudos to the company for a very easy return policy (I gave them a star for that).  If you have hardy skin, then perhaps you can keep the attitude of what have I got lose? (well, maybe $5-10 since they don&#x27;t return your shipping money).  But please take my advice and stay away if you have sensitive skin of any type.  The risk is NOT worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this kit.  I didn&#x27;t&#x27; really notice my acne scars going away which was the main reason I purchased the kit.  BUT it does make your skin brighter and the cleanser really got into my pours and pulled up a lot of crap that was in there.  I would suggest starting this kit when you have a couple of \\&quot;date free\\&quot; days cause it&#x27;s going to make you brake out... Cause it really pulls up all the dirt that&#x27;s in there.  Once that is done you should be good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add to my review.  IT WORKS FOR SURE!  For some reason my laugh lines are getting dark.  I didn&#x27;t notice it really till I stopped using this product.  I stopped because I finished it but didn&#x27;t think I needed to get it again.  BUT I was wrong... One week later my laugh lines were very dark &lt; I don&#x27;t understand why this is happening&gt;  BUT I do know that these serums take away the dark lines.  SO I am defiantly going to continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I did see results within a week of the red spots on my cheeks and dark spots on my forehead lighten. Unfortunately, the product line also made my skin break out so I have to discontinue use of it. I recommend buying the travel kit to test out before buying full sizes.</li>
    <li> Murad has a great line of face products. This is my second purchase. I have oily skin &amp; the line for my skin type really works well. I wish the serum was in a larger bottle, it works so nice. Definitely try it out even though it is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad sun damage and was thinking about doing laser to get rid of it but I really can&#x27;t afford it. I saw the ad on TV for Murad. decided to give it a try. this is the first time that I use a skin care line that actually delivers. My dark spots are fading. I&#x27;m very impressed!!! well worth the price. For people who got trashed by the sun in the 80&#x27;s, give this proctuct a try.</li>
    <li> Not for me irritated my skin even more, if you have dry irritated skin I do not think you should use it.</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old woman, olive complexion, combination/sensitive skin with the occasional blemish. I like to look &#x27;natural&#x27; so I wear no makeup besides BareEscentuals maybe twice a week. I wanted to find something that would even out my skin tone and give me a &#x27;glow&#x27; so I could continue my au naturale look for many years to come. I ordered this last week and it came at the beginning of this week and I&#x27;ve been using the set for three days. It smells great, leaves my skin soft, and gives my skin lots of moisture. I will say that the skin lightening gel tingles a little and leaves my skin pink-ish for a few minutes because of my sensitive skin, but it subsides quickly. I&#x27;m anxious to see if my skin tone does completely even out. It seems like it&#x27;s working already BUT that could just be my imagination from the excitement of a new regimen!   Also, if you&#x27;ve considered buying the products in this kit seperately, DON&#x27;T! It is really expensive. Just buy four of these kits. You&#x27;ll get 2.17 ounces more product for $50+ less than the individuals combined! Just a tip... :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Mother and she loves it! I arrived fast and in a great secure package, the creme is awesome makes your skin feel incredible. My Mother says she could tell the difference in just one use.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference at all. It&#x27;s just another thing pilling on the cabinet. It didn&#x27;t work for me but I can&#x27;t say it wont work for you</li>
    <li> I heard rave reviews about this product, but I was not impressed.  I think I will stick with Resurgance by Murad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 46 years old and have never really cared for my skin other than washing with soap and occasional light moisturizer. However, time is starting to take it&#x27;s toll and I thought i would try this for some spots and uneven color that I&#x27;ve developed. The combination of products in this kit have definitely evened out my skin and leave it quite soft. The spots have not disappeared, but they do seem less noticeable and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love that they delivered it so quickly but the product is not working for me.  My face has not cleared a bit even using this day and night every day.</li>
    <li> Was very drying on my face and  I have normal to oily skin. was disappointed that it did not tone my skin at all. was hoping it would help even my skin out from getting wiser and sun exposure.</li>
    <li> Great little travel kit with all the good stuff. I like that the cleanser is in a slightly larger bottle than the rest of the lotions and serums.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product multiple times. It is great for travel and I am a big fan of Murad products. The last two times I have ordered this the face wash bottle has cracked and leaked all over my travel bag. Sad to say I will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the entire line, so this handy sample size was idea for me to try without spending a lot on full size bottles of a product that didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> At first, the price seemed like a deal but when you see you get so little product, it&#x27;s just not worth it.  And the products themselves are just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Murad Radiant Renewal Kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product, it really helped me clear up my face, I had a lot of dark spots and this product cleared my face up in about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> perfect for travel. love it</li>
    <li> Lasts about 2-months. Started to see results within 2weeks.  Worth the money. My face is free of dark sun spots, acne marks, and is clear and glowing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Murad products. I can feel the radiance and  my skin feels so smooth - it removes old skin cells, spots, puffy eyes, the  whole enchilada.. I love it. I have a bad complexion, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever been satisfied with. The product was delivered quickly and in good shape. Thank you</li>
    <li> Some works more than others but there was not enough (for the price) to really see if it works.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of improvement after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference in the lightening of spots at all. Used for a month so far. Going to keep using it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I cannot do without it! It is very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to reduce the horrible sun damage to my skin.  This is a good product for the price.  I try and use it every morning and night, but once in awhile I forget.  I do believe it has lightened some but I haven&#x27;t even been using it for a month.  I think I may try another month&#x27;s worth to really see a difference.  Personally it works better than Garnier, and even better spot remover and the other expensive dept store one. They were $60 for small package.  They didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The box with my  Murad Radiant Skin Renewal Kit came smashed so I don&#x27;t know if instructions came with it, but it would have been helpful.  After finding reading glasses so I could read the tiny print on each item, I finally learned how to use each.  In case you didn&#x27;t receive instructions or can&#x27;t find your reading glasses, here is a simple review for use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Every morning, dampen face and neck and massage a small amount of the Essential C Cleanser on face and neck.  Rinse with warm water and pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. The kit doesn&#x27;t come with toner, but it then says to use toner and then massage a thin layer of the Active Radiance Serum over your face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;3. Then evenly massage the Essential-C Day Moisture over your face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;4.  At night, cleanse again with the Essential C Cleanser as noted in #1 above.&lt;br /&gt;5. Then use toner and massage a thin layer of Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum over face, neck, chest and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to how it works, after a week of use,  I am seeing a lightening of some pigment on my face.  I do feel a tingling on my face  when I use the Rapid Age Spot  Serum.  I  will keep using the kit as instructed and update my review.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this made much difference in the look or feel of my skin.  I will give other Murad products a try and see if I get better results.  This one just didn&#x27;t to it for me.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.... Just as described... Seal was off of the box though... Products were were new.. not used</li>
    <li> REALLY LIKED THE PRODUCT.HAVE USED IT FOR QUIET A WHILE.WHEN I FIRST TRY THE ITEM I THOUGHT THE ITEM WAS A VERY GOOD VALUE PRICE WISE.I SEEMS TO GO UP IN PRICE I ALSO RUN OUT OF 2 STEPS AND HAVE ALOT LEFT IN THE OTHER 2</li>
    <li> I bought this after a facial and really love it!  I&#x27;m so glad I checked on Amazon for it- it was $10 cheaper!  The small size lasts longer than I expected, and I&#x27;m happy just buying these sample boxes over and over.</li>
    <li> works great for me.  I get a rare pimple but I have not gotten any since i started using this.  my skin is bright and looks very healthy</li>
    <li> Pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a week now and I already notice a difference in my skin! This was well worth the price, it&#x27;s great! I have been searching for a reasonably priced skin product to remove sun spots/acne scars and this stuff is it.  I have a nice glow to my skin, pimples I had before using this are clearing up nicely, and I have noticed dark spots/scars are already fading away.  This stuff is AMAZING and I will definitely be buying it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I am a 50 y/o previous &amp;#34;sun-worshiper&amp;#34;. Two years ago, a trip to Hatteras Island left me with sun damage that looked like leopard spots on my right cheek. I tried all kinds of stuff. I heard Murad had an excellent hyper pigmentation corrector so I bought the Essential C kit and have been using it faithfully for almost three weeks. The overall difference in my skin is amazing but the difference in the dark spots is INCREDIBLE!  At last, I have found something  that DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO!  I will stick with Murad forever. My tiny lines are less visible, pores are smaller and &amp;#34;fewer&amp;#34;.  The overall appearance is clearer/brighter. I have never seen my skin look so deeply translucent and radiant. I am excited to see what my skin will look like in another three weeks. I have very sensitive skin and was worried about the Dark Spot Corrector. My skin LOVES these products.  Other reviews have mentioned the price. It is worth every penny and no more money wasted on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I also ordered other items in this line which was recommended by a spa where I received a facial. It was a little pricey at the spa. It was the same item on Amazon  and a lot less.  The tubes are a bit to small to know whether or not it works. Would have to buy larger quantity to know. Would recommend to buy from Amazon verses a Spa.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for me.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I ordered this bundle 3 weeks ago and I can already tell a difference in my skin.  I had sun spots and darkening due to birth control and it has already diminished by at least half.  I expect even better results with continued use.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had some sun spots after my pregnancy. Murad&#x27;s sun undone has helped the spots fade -after about 2 weeks of use. They are not completely gone but I still need to finish out the month.</li>
    <li> I am 53 with coloring similar to Halle Berry&#x27;s (that&#x27;s were the likeness end&#x27;s) and I&#x27;ve suffered with hyperpigmentation for about fifteen years. I believe this is largly due to the fact that I foolishly underestimated the British sunshine and did not wear sunblock on my face even whilst gardening, big mistake!!!....Have spent thousand&#x27;s over the years trying to get rid of the unattractive brown patches, but nothing has worked until now!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing an impressive presentation on T.V I checked out reviews on Amazon before buying (as I didn&#x27;t want to make yet another expensive mistake) and was surprised to find that the reviews were mostly very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;The 4 samples lasted from about 2 weeks - 2 Months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Essential-C Cleanser *** Was good but since we (my husband too) used this twice a day it was impractical and expensive to keep purchasing on line.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I found a great substitute at my local CVs, which is Jason&#x27;s Ester-C Super-C Cleanser, much cheaper too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Advanced Active Radiance, great product***** Just purchased the full size which was pretty expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it. Absorbed quickly into the skin after cleansing in the morning, I think it protects/shields the skin before applying moisturizer/sunblock. Also appears to minimize pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Rapid Age Spot &amp; Pigment Lightening****. Very impressed with this product, dark brown patches began to fade to pink very quickly. Fully intended to purchase the full size but was diverted by another product on Amazon that apparently worked particularly well with my skin coloring :) Have to say it is also working very well so far and is slightly less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Essential-C Day Moisture Broad Spectrum SPF 30*****. This is very good, love the rosy healthy glow! Morning application kept me hydrated all day. No longer need the heavy foundation &amp; powder, just concealer, a real bonus!!!. Will purchase the full size with a higher SPF if poss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has turned out to be a much longer review, but it is for 4 products!!! I hope it&#x27;s helped someone out there.with a higher SPF if poss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has turned out to be a much longer review, but it is for 4 products!!! I hope it&#x27;s helped someone out there.</li>
