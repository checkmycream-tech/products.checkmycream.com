<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR YOUR FACE.YOUR SKIN WILL FEEL ALOT SMOOTHER IN LIKE 4 DAYS AND IT WILL CLEAR UP IN 9 DAYS. BUT I WAS ALSO USING THE ACNE TREATMENT SERUM. I AM 14 YEARS OLD.</li>
    <li> What a find !!!! This is the only thing that has help with my daughters acne...do not bother with the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; stuff....</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;m able to use this twice a day with no overdrying or break outs. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The exposed skin care products are very effective, especially the facial cleanser which starts by cleaning away all the dirt and greasy build-up very effectively. I ran out of this product some time ago and thought I could get away without using it, but no other cleanser comes close so I soon put in an order for two more bottles!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Perfect for sensitive skin (which I have) and excellent for combatting breakouts.  Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this cleaning product is phenomenal.  I have pretty sensitive skin, but exposed never gave me any issues.  I&#x27;ve been acne free for over a year, and glad everyday that I made the switch.  Very effective and a good value compared to other products out there.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with my skin for years. I have tried ProActive but it just messed up my skin. I was searching online for product/treatment of adult acne and found Exposed Skin Care. The first two weeks were pretty rough. My skin felt and appeared overly dry; I thought that it was going to be like ProActive. But I stuck it out and my skin loves it.  I have a back up cleanser and toner (another brand) for when I run out of Exposed, but my skin doesn&#x27;t respond nearly as well.  I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from acne with sensitive skin. Remember the first couple of weeks are tough but its worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> I like all of these products! For the first few weeks it actually seems like it&#x27;s making it worse, as it does almost always with new acne treatment. Seriously, softer, smoother, and clearer skin. My skin is really sensitive, I am very thankful I found this product! Only thing I would change is when ordering the kit, the facial cleanser runs out faster than the other products. Obviously, because you use that product twice a day, where the others are used only once.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used where my skin feels really clean immediately after use and a dramatic improvement has been noted over only a few short days. I have very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin skin and find that most acne cleaners have either dried my skin out and aggrevated it or doesn&#x27;t cleanse thoroughly enough and leaves a residue. This cleanser does everything it says on the tin and more. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in reccommending this product for anyone with acne prone skin or is just looking for a cleanser that really cleans your skin. I never leave home without it!! Thanks exposed!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s, and while I don&#x27;t have acne, I get the occasional bumps under my skin on my jawline and chin. I&#x27;ve tried other acne products before, but they always dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t work. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about 4 years now. It&#x27;s effective without irritating skin. It&#x27;s better than any acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is FAB-U-LOUS! I know that for me it&#x27;s been hard to find a product that would help my acne and not destroy my skin in the process. This cleanser is gentle enough for my VERY sensitive skin but also pleasantly effective. My skin feels so clean, refreshed and balanced after using this cleanser. Plus, a little goes a long way so you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Does not dry out or irritate skin fresh scent. Good cleanser and only need a little product. It has help reduce my redness a bit.</li>
    <li> I started using Exposed after I turned 30 and my skin started to change on me.  I started to have cystic acne on my chin coinciding with my cycle and it was awful!  After some research, I found Exposed and decided to try that over Proactive.  My skin looks great!  I do the whole system - cleanser, toner, acne treatment serum, moisturizer (daytime) and then cleanser, clear pore, moisturizer (nighttime).  It lasts a long time.  Sometimes Amazon has better pricing/shipping times, so I&#x27;ll get it here.  And sometimes I just buy directly from Exposed.</li>
    <li> Finally found something that cleans without drying out my skin.  Has helped immensely with my moderate adult acne.  Love this stuff and also the Pore Clearing Gel.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> This product needs to be used with the whole kit for stubborn acne however it is so gentle which is a nice change from the normal facial cleanser!</li>
    <li> This Exposed facial cleanser is awesome. I am 43 years old and still have acne. It controls the acne, yet does not dry out my skin, which at my age, you have to start worrying about wrinkles. My face feels clean and refreshed. I also like to use the derma cloth at least twice a week with it for a deep clean. I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different product lines in the past and the Exposed system seems to give me the best results.  For awhile I was using the entire system on a regular basis but after awhile I found that I was using less and less of the product to achieve the results I was looking for.  I still use the system on a regular basis but more often than not I tend to use the facial cleanser in the morning and night and that is all I need to maintain the healthy looking and feeling skin that I desire.  The cleanser leaves my face feeling clean, tight and oil free.</li>
    <li> My son turned 14 and started having a lot of problems with acne.  Over the counter products did not help much.  Then we started using Pro Active which did help but he was still having break outs.  My sister recommended Exposed Skincare because it really worked well for her daughter.  We decided to try it.     Now my son&#x27;s skin is much clearer.  Even when he only uses the facial cleanser and treatment serum his skin us relatively clear of breakouts.  He also likes the clear pore serum, clearing tonic and microderm scrub.</li>
    <li> My acne has never been too severe but always enough to make me feel self conscious. What I experienced was mostly mild forehead acne and rosacea on my cheeks. Never zits but just a bunch of tiny bumps everywhere- stuff makeup can&#x27;t hide. So after trying everything in store and even a couple prescription creams I gave this a shot and it was the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made. Most products I have tried are either too extreme for my skin or not enough, being that my acne was only mild but nontheless a nuisance. Within the first three days of using this product I saw a difference. Within ten days my skin was clear. And I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in two weeks now. This product hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin nor made it extremely oily. The only negative aspect that I&#x27;ve found so far is that upon occasion it can make my rosacea act up but that usually is easily tamed by outside rosacea moisturizer. I love this product. I recommend by the kit because the cleanser with the tonic and acne serum tends to work best.</li>
    <li> I used to have serious acne, but I took medication to cease it; however, it commenced to reappear, thus I bought this product. Though it works, it seems not to cure my acne--sadly. It turns out my acne is caused by my unbalanced diet and stress. Though, this product is overall superb--even though it comes in a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is only cleanser that EVER cleared my skin completely, worth every penny!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exposed Skin Care is the best and affordable option for acne! It has amazing effects and it works just as well as the top, more expensive skin care products.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for really long time and I have tried many many products, such as clean clear, h2o, proactive, etc, but none of them worked for me. Not until I tried exposed skin care, my face is still quite out of control, very oily and have huge breakouts from time to time. This product definitely saved my face!</li>
    <li> My daughter has suffered acne since the onset of puberty.  It isn&#x27;t severe (cystic), but it really is bad.  Her skin is also sensitive, so the plethora of products we have tried have always made it red and inflamed.  It has been hard to watch the toll acne has taken on her self esteem.  She discovered Exposed through the many positive reviews, so I only thought it right to leave my own.  I am happy to report that after a month or so, her skin looks great!  Not perfect, there are still some small pimples, especially around that time of the month.  However, the breakouts are vastly reduced, the redness is gone, and she really looks so much prettier.  The most important part is that she is holding her head a little higher :)  This is a 5 star formula.  I am only deducting a star because I would like to see more product size options.  She goes through the cleanser and toner faster than the serums, so we would prefer to be able those in larger, more economic sizes.  Otherwise, I don&#x27;t mind the kits and auto orders - very easy to log in and change or cancel.  If you feel like you&#x27;ve tried everything (been there), just bite the bullet and do it again.  Soooo worth it...</li>
    <li> For bad acne treatment is definitely worth five stars. I&#x27;m 30 and just started having trouble with acne. Not real bad, but enough to make me look for something better and stronger then your average products from Walmart/ Walgreen&#x27;s. Started using this and works great!! Only down fall is it will fry your skin out real bad! And if your like me and don&#x27;t have a extreme problem only use every other day. Twice daily will make you develop red spots. After figuring all this out I love it and use it!! Definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> Facial cleanser is one of the best around.  Better than proactive and anything you can buy at Walgreens or CVS.  It is very gentle and does not over dry.</li>
    <li> I battled with acne for my entire life and as a professional it was quite embarrassing.  I tried everything in stores and one day went online to do some research and found exposed, that was over 1 year ago.  It is wonderful.  My skin cleared up and while I don&#x27;t have the best skin genetically it has provided the most long lasting and effective results yet.  yes the bottles are a little small, but one bottle of cleanser and tonic usually lasts about 3 months and it worth every penny!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LIKES IT VERY MUCH  HAS ACHNE BREAKOUTS AND THIS SEEMS TO HELP QUITE A BIT</li>
    <li> I am a 56 year old business woman who has fought acne and stress picking all my life.  Once I started picking at my acne,it just started a downward spiral...pick at one and you have two more the next day.....miserable.  I always wished that something would clear up all my acne so I wouldn&#x27;t have anything to pick on.  I have tried everything!  I came upon Exposed cleanser while searching for the best acne treatments online and FINALLY found THE perfect acne product after 40+ years of acne.  It all cleared up within 1 month and has been clear ever since.  I have been using this product for 3 months and will not use anything else.  IT WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it is not harsh. Iy cleans the clean without over-drying and irritating.  I used to use Proactiv, but it o my made my acne worse because it was too harsh. For $15, this face wash is pretty cheap compared to most acne washes. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best and only face soap that works. It keeps my skin clear and looking fresh even after a long day at work. I love this, buy it, use it and never look back to those stupid kits at walmart which fail to do anything except waste my money.</li>
    <li> I use the Exposed facial cleanser twice a day-once in the morning and once at night. It has been helping clear my skin. I used to have bad acne and it has helped control it. I usually break out bad during the summer time, but I this summer has been the best in my acne being controlled and I can say Exposed Skin care has helped! Get the whole kit to have consistency in your facial cleansing regime.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked really well for a few weeks. Then it gradually lost its effectiveness. By 2 months later it was completely useless. I still have some of it now but I dont use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using Cetaphil bar soap once or twice daily and managing your stress. I find that if I do this I am usually alright.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few times from Exposed and regardless of whether I buy the full line or just a couple of items, they always come faster than expected and in the full box packaging for quality. I&#x27;ve had skin troubles since my teenage years and changing skin types that varied from extremely sensitive, dry, oily, etc. This product is the only one I trust to regain my skin&#x27;s consistency, keep it from breaking out, and quickly heal blemishes and balance redness. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this product definitely works for me. I started with a couple of full sets, and now only need the cleanser and acne serum. Definitely recommend, especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin but I wish it came in a bigger bottle. I find myself going through this small bottle in just a couple weeks. Overall I do see an improvement in my skin. I still break out but minimally and not as bad as I was before. Will continue to use until my skin completely clears up</li>
    <li> The facial cleanser keeps my skin looking healthy and removes makeup easily. I also appreciate the fact that this product contains no fragrance that might irritate my sensitive skin. I have been using this product for three months and have noticed a significant improvement with skin tone and control over break-outs. I highly recommend the facial cleanser to those individuals looking for a product that is gentle yet effective.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great. It is the first I&#x27;ve used in years to treat stubborn acne that does not leave my face dry or stinging, but still gets the job done. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been ordering the Exposed kits for a few months now and my skin has improved a lot. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best facial cleanser on the market. Nothing else compares. Unlike other cleansers this can be used twice daily without drying out your skin. Best used with other exposed skincare products.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am 30 years old and have suffered from severe acne since the age of 16. My skin is oily, sensitive and very acne-prone, and I have tried most acne products on the market without any good results. When I found the exposed skincare products I was thrilled - they actually work really well! I wash my face with the facial cleanser in the morning and evening, and it is very gentle yet effective on my skin! It controls my acne and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and it leaves my skin looking fresh and clean. I can really recommend this product for people with acne-prone skin. For optimal result, the facial cleanser is best used with other exposed skincare products.</li>
    <li> I initally bought this for my two sons with acne.  Then I tried it and I loved the results.  As an adult, I have fought all my life with acne.  I love Exposed facial cleaner.  It leaves your face clean and doesn&#x27;t leave the dry flaky skin most of the other products I have tried does.  I would recommend this product to anyone who struggles with oily skin.  I use the moisturizer also, on a daily basis.  My face isn&#x27;t oily all day.</li>
    <li> Might have reduced frequency/severity of my breakouts, but left my skin rough and badly irritated. Will never use again.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about a month longer than my first review, and I&#x27;ve decided to come back and update since acne wash isn&#x27;t really something you can review once in the early stages and never come back to. Like I said before, the was works very slowly (again I only used the face wash) and after a few weeks it seems to sort of just stopped getting rid of the acne, and is just keeping my face toned down in any redness and big serious pimples. It definitely did not get rid of my acne, but it helped. Most washes seem to just help and then stop, and this seems to be one of them :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREVIOUS REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much to complain about with the Exposed Facial Cleanser. It&#x27;s mostly natural, has softened my skin, reduced redness, reduced acne, fragrance free (there&#x27;s a little smell to it, but it&#x27;s not an artificial smell, just the smell of the wash itself), and overall a good face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I think it&#x27;s worth $15 plus $5 shipping? No. But it has improved my skin. I started using it a few weeks ago, maybe about 3? A month? Nothing more than that, and I started its use during a bad wave of deep, under the skin pimples that are in general a pain to get rid of, no matter what you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has taken a few weeks to take effect, and to be fair, I have ONLY been using this face wash and NOT the whole kit (I can&#x27;t afford the $50+ price for it!) So maybe that is a factor to why it&#x27;s been such a slow process, and why it hasn&#x27;t cleared my skin completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issues are, other than the price, that it seems to work very slowly (as I still have the acne I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of, but again it&#x27;s not just a regular zit, very deep under my skin), and I&#x27;ll admit I sort of \\&quot;cheated\\&quot; on it by using my previous foaming Biore face wash to give it a bit of a boost, which really seemed to help actually. After that it was smooth sailing. Lastly, it did dry out the corners of my mouth, but was solved with some extra moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this face wash, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be able to use it regularly because it&#x27;s so expensive. $20 isn&#x27;t much, but it&#x27;s only 4 ounces (I could have sworn that before I ordered it, it said it was 6 ounces!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin wasn&#x27;t too bad before so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use this on a regular basis to keep my skin clearer, and adjusting my diet and some extra moisturizer will help!</li>
    <li> Come in the mail fast. Good face wash</li>
    <li> It works! I have acne on my face for 4 years. After I use it for two or three days, it improves</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Seeing results after 2 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks and I find it comparable to Neutrogena or Oxy facial treatments I can purchase at Wal-Mart. It really dries my face out, so I have to use it sparingly. I wish I hadn&#x27;t fell for the hype!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. I have had acne prone skin for many years, and as I tried what seemed like every cleanser on the market I used to wish that there were something I could use that would be more natural and use less harmful chemicals. The Exposed Cleanser was the answer to my prayers! It combines natural ingredients with helpful chemicals and not only clears up the acne on my skin but also leaves it feeling truly clean. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash for every day and night. It goes great with the microdermabrasion cloth that Exposed sells. Really am grateful for the help in clearing up my skin.</li>
    <li> This product really helps with overnight clearing. It makes sure that your skin is constantly clear. It&#x27;s really gel-ly and makes your skin feel clean and healthy. I love using this product because it really just gets deep into your pores! I wish i had a lifetime supply of this stuff. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday twice a day and it has significantly reduced my breakouts. I also like that the formula they use includes a lot of natural substances.</li>
    <li> I was had very bad breakouts for long time even I tried so many different acne products before I start to use Exposed. At beginning I bought the kit and I found something that works beyond amazing. Now my entire face is clean and looks healthy. I only use this cleanser and the tone for most time now, it is unlike others, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I would strongly recommend this cleanser to those who don&#x27;t like spent too much time on it. It definitely works. Thanks Exposed![[ASIN:B002CIXVVI Facial Cleanser]]</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY facial cleansers to help me get rid of my pimples. They all work temporarily or cause severe dryness with their chemicals. I had given up on finding a solution. Then I tried Exposed Skin Cares: Facial Cleanser. No more irritation or dry flaky skin. I get the odd pimple now and again but noting long lasting or severe. If you are looking for a gentle cleanser than I would suggest this one in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> This review is for all those thousands of other women out there who have experienced the same frustrations.  I am 47 years old, and I never had skin problems until I got into my mid-40s. Suddenly, I began getting embarrassing, painful acne along my cheeks and jawlines. I tried everything, from dermatologist-prescribed medications to expensive products sold on those infomercials.  I tried it all and wasted so much money, as nothing worked.  My skin is very sensitive to just about everything -- oils, alcohols, fragrances.  Nothing cleared up my skin.  My biggest problem was this--all those products out there that are designed to clear acne -- they are too harsh on my nearly 50-year-old skin!  They turn my skin to leather.  I used to use ProActiv even, but it was too rough on my skin.  I came across the Exposed Skincare line, and I can&#x27;t tell you enough just how wonderful it is.  It not only cleared up my skin right away, but it leaves my skin so soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve found nothing like it EVER ,and I have tried every single thing out there.  What I like most is this -- so many product lines instruct you to use their product for a month before you see positive results, claiming that you have to give the products time to remove all those toxins from your skin.  They warn that your skin will get worse before it gets better!  I have found this to be so annoying, because I don&#x27;t want to give a product a month to get results, because I never know if the product is truly pulling out the toxins from my skin or if I&#x27;m having a reaction to it.  Even more frustrating is when you give a product a month to work, and it doesn&#x27;t, and then you can&#x27;t even return it because you have passed the 30-day guarantee period!  The shocking thing with Exposed Skincare is that I found that it worked right away.  Within days, it began to clear up my skin, and again, it leaves your skin so soft and smooth.  I only wish that the company would sell the product in much larger bottles; other than this, I strongly urge any woman in their mid-40s who are suffering with bad skin to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Great product for most skin types. Clears up acne fast! The only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is because it can be really drying to your skin unless you have a super moisturizing moisturizer. I use E40 cream for after use of this face wash which works great.</li>
    <li> This product works very good for me.  I&#x27;ve tried proactive for a while which was successful in the beginning but seems like my face got too used to the product and stopped working all together.  I then tried Murad which was the worst acne product and made me break out all over my face for 9 weeks.  Then went to this product which really cleanses my face.  My face has never been more clear and its rare when I do get pimples.  When pimples do come for me no more than two at a time and they&#x27;re gone within a few days.  My clear skin to even a couple pimples ratio is Clear skin&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Couple pimples.  I use facial cleanser, clearing tonic, and ance treatment serum.</li>
    <li> Best. Acne. Prone. Cleanser. Use this and ONLY this twice a day in the shower, and you WILL see results in 2 weeks or less</li>
    <li> Tried other products like Proactive and this is the only thing that has worked on my skin. Used to have horrible acne, now it&#x27;s clear! It works :)</li>
    <li> This cleared up my skin quickly, and my skin tone has improved greatly. It&#x27;s a bit drying, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Best product out! Couldn&#x27;t live without it! I&#x27;ve tried lots of other alternatives but none compare to Exposed. I also love how you can create subscriptions so you get what you need shipped whenever you need it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I searched high and low for a product that would be effective in clearing up my acne before my wedding. Exposed Skin Care Has been a blessing for my skin. The whole line is amazing and I highly recommend every single product they have to offer!</li>
    <li> i love this face wash!!! i never have BAD acne but i would break-outs at times due to my menstrual cycle and im sure other random things like... stress or make-up. This has helped a lot and the price is right... proactive is NO GOOD!!</li>
    <li> This is the second customer review I&#x27;ve ever written. Since everyone&#x27;s skin is different I can&#x27;t say that this product will work perfectly for everyone but I can say in complete honesty that this product is the ONLY product that has improved my skin and greatly reduced my acne. Other products, especially Proactiv, deeply scarred my skin.</li>
    <li> very gentle on the skin and it really does work, pimples will vanish. I love this product. its the only product out there that actually works.</li>
    <li> If you are an active teenager with acne problems, try these products!  My teenagers tried everything available and this was the last resort.  All of these products have worked wonders on getting rid of acne!  This cleanser is not drying, very gentle, and doesn&#x27;t cause redness.  It works!  Use it in conjunction with the other Exposed products to clear up your skin once and for all.  It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> As title suggests, cannot live without the cleanser and toner in particular. I had adult acne that I just couldn&#x27;t get a handle on. Stress would make it worse and I would get bad breakouts particular on my chin. I did a google search out of desperation one day and found a website reviewing the top ten acne products and this was number one. It took about 2 weeks for my skin to settle down and now it&#x27;s very rare I get a breakout. Love that the website is very easy to use, safe and I am in Australia and shipping is very fast. Could not recommend it higher. Just wish you could buy it in stores.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day, once in the morning and once at night. Other products make my face more oily later in the day but this does not make my face all oily. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Made no difference. I used it for a month before throwing it away</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing! I have been using this product for 10 years. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and rarely have any breakouts!</li>
    <li> After using the Exposed Skin Care Treatmeant kit for about a year, I am happy to say that I have been able to maintain the positive results by continuing using the Facial Cleanser and Acne Treatment when needed.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser - keeps skin clear with out over drying! I have been using the cleanser and other Exposed products for almost a year and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> This works really well but honestly, there&#x27;s a lot of similar cleansers out there like Murad that you can get more for the same price.  I like it but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to clear this horrible ance. Within about a week, I started to see improvement; and now about a month in, almost all the little bumps I had are gone! I definitely recommend this product!!!! What do you have to lose? besides bad skin!!</li>
    <li> My teenage son struggles with moderate to severe acne, and he started using the Exposed Skin Care products in August. I choose this line after some research on how it compared to the other popular lines such as ProActiv. I liked that the ingredients in this line are more natural. So far he&#x27;s had good success. His skin is not clear, but it has helped to keep it from worsening and has helped with decreasing the severity over time. We will keep purchasing the line for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for almost a year now and I have to say my face looks amazing. I switched from Proactive due to allergic reactions and I have not move since. You know when using a product and it stops working after a certain time, well Exposed Skin continues to work and i would have maybe 1 or 2 bumps pop up two to three months at a time. Other than that my face is cleared. Also my complexion is brighter and you hardly see any of the blemishes i had before. Im crazy about this product and hope it doesnt fail!</li>
    <li> If you want a cleanser that is gentle on your skin AND assists in clearing up acne, this is the product you&#x27;ve been looking for</li>
    <li> My kids have been using this product for a few plus months now and have seen great results. They were seeing a doctor who was prescribing different products through the pharmacy and I wasn&#x27;t seeing anything getting much better. My son asked to try this and he loves it. So easy to order, no doctor appointments and no products with a bunch of chemicals in them. We will continue to use this for as long as we need to.</li>
    <li> I tried this for several months based on reviews and it ended up making my face worse. Be careful of their return policy- all individual items that have been opened are not refundable. So if you try this and don&#x27;t like it- you won&#x27;t be getting your money back. The refund policy is strictly for ordering a first time kit.</li>
    <li> best face product yet. removes black heads, and pimples. face was closer within two weeks!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement to the cleanser that came with the set of face cleanser, tonic, pore clearing serum, and acne treatment. Since I started using the Exposed Skin Care line, my cystic acne has cleared up. For months I had been trying different options, I even put diluted bleach on my skin at one point. I began using these products and my skin has vastly improved. I still have trouble areas, but it&#x27;s a vast improvement! The troubled areas are stubborn because I have to wear makeup, if I didn&#x27;t I know my skin would be so much clearer...because of these products!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am prone to dryness. This cleanser is mild and gentle. I use it twice a day and my skin does not dry out like it has with other products. I love the entire exposed skin care system. It has changed the look and texture of my skin. Ill never stop using it!</li>
    <li> My daughter struggles with moderate to severe acne.  She has been using Exposed for 5 months now.  It took a while for it to completely clear up but at this point she hasn&#x27;t had any new breakouts in over month.  Her skin is smooth, glowing and doesn&#x27;t get dry.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny!  It really made a difference.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, clean, and smells healthy. I have been using EXPOSED products for over 4 months now and I love it so much.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 3 weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change. It is def drying. I am holding out to see if I start to see results. I am looking for results that scream &amp;#34;exposed skin&amp;#34; I am looking for fresh, dewy, acne free skin that is healthy and for once, not an affliction.</li>
    <li> The Facial Cleanser from Exposed is one of the best face washes I have used, from drugstore Clearasil to prescription grade Obagi Acne products, Exposed surpasses the rest. It is soft, potent, lathers well, and smells good. It doesn&#x27;t sting, itch, or create a harsh cooling sensation. It contains Salicylic acid which is a standard acne fighting synthetic used by many companies, but it also has all natural sage extracts and Pro-vitamin B5. I use the Cleanser twice in the morning and twice at night. To say the least my skin has been looking pretty flawless the past several months. One of the best on the market today, and a great price.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has been great for my skin because it does not dry it out and my skin feels clean and fresh after using it. It has helped in clearing up my acne more than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried! I&#x27;ve had to be careful with other cleansers not to use them twice a day, but I&#x27;ve been able to use this facial cleanser twice a day to clean my face without over-drying it. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an effective facial cleanser along with the other products on the Exposed Skincare line. [[ASIN:B002CIXVVI Facial Cleanser]]</li>
    <li> I started using Exposed Skincare a few months ago and fell in love! Never before has anything worked so well on my acne (Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried everything)! This cleanser leaves my skin feeling VERY fresh and clean. I wash my face with it morning and night. I only wish it came in a little bigger bottle, but since it doesn&#x27;t, I always buy a couple at the beginning of each month to get me through that month. It is definitely a great cleanser for anyone with acne! I highly highly highly recommend this Exposed skincare product, along with the many other Exposed products.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser by far. I have had acne that was hard to get rid of and this got rid of it. I have used proactive and it dose not compare.</li>
    <li> I just received this product five days ago and can say that when I used for the first time and since then, I&#x27;ve noticed a feeling of really clean and refreshed skin.  The product describes that it can dry your skin a bit but I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all. I just feel like the entire surface of my face has been thoroughly but gently cleansed. There&#x27;s no heaviness due to moisturizers.  It feels as though it&#x27;s a deeper cleaning.  Very satisfied and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Exposed Facial Cleanser cleans my face without drying it out which is perfect since I like to use it both morning and night.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my skin. I have combination skin and it does break out. I&#x27;ll get some whiteheads and blackheads on my nose..Nothing to serious, Id just enjoy having clearer skin which is why I purchased this product after a friend had great success with it. My skin seemed to be a little clearer after the first week, but after that I had a very large breakout to the bottom right of my lip running up the side of my cheek bone (where I have NEVER broken out). Used for another two weeks and then i stopped due to no improvement.the product did make my face feel cleaner after washing, but it did severely dry my upper lip and nose after the first week, but then subsided. This is a hit or miss depending on skin type. I did want to return..and they emailed me a form I had to fill out to send back with it, but I just opted to give it to my friend who used the remainder. Two stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the products fault..it just didn&#x27;t work with my skin. If saliycylic cleansers work for you this will probably work. I&#x27;m back to using cetaphil and a microderm.</li>
    <li> Listing doesn&#x27;t tell you what size container you are purchasing but the shipping weight says 6oz ...this is actually a very small 4oz bottle.  Expensive!!  I&#x27;ll be going back to my old brand of cleanser next time.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! It is gentle yet effective.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like harsh cleansers.  If I have on make-up I remove it before hand so that the ingredients can work their best.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products you cant live without! You feel like you are doing something great for your skin every time you use it. I can definitely tell a big difference when I run out of it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002CIXVVI Facial Cleanser]]&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman in my late 40&#x27;s and have suffered from cystic acne for more than 10 years.  I was willing to pay any amount of money if a product worked because I was embarrassed as a woman my age shouldn&#x27;t have acne.  Not to mention the fact that cystic acne is really painful.  I have tried all kinds of products from very expensive ones to drug store brands.  Nothing holds a candle to this cleanser as well as all other products in this line!  In addition to the cleanser, I do use all products in the basic kit and use them as instructed.  I have been using these products over a year now and have had maybe 3 minor break outs during that time.  It took about 6-8 weeks to get it under control and then it was smooth sailing.  Before using these products, I could not go more than 2 or 3 days without at least one cyst.  My skin is very smooth and soft now and is never feels dried out. My only complaint is that these products are only available on-line.  I would like to see the offered in stores. This product is worth the money and to me is reasonably price considering I&#x27;ve paid much more for other product without achieving the results I was hoping for.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I started using the starter kit about 6 months ago. This face wash leaves your skin feeling clean, without drying it out. I recently bought a Clarisonic Mia, and I&#x27;ve now started using that to buff in this facewash morning and night. I&#x27;ve noticed a DRAMATIC difference in the effectiveness of this product. I highly recommend buying a Clarisonic and using the Exposed products with it. The Clarisonic deep cleans your skin, allowing the Exposed products to seep into your skin and be most effective. My skin is super soft and nearly completely clear. I highly recommend this product. Also, a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need much of the face wash at a time, so it will last a few months. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Facial Cleanser from Exposed is one of the best cleanser i&#x27;ve tried, it is not strong or aggressive to your face specially if you have sensitive skin, i like it because cleans your skin from acne very very fast, in about 3 or 4 days i feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. Almost every facial cleanser to date has caused my face to break out further or dry and scale. This cleanser, however, has been wonderful. I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with a clarion face brush and some prescribed acne cream. Works like a charm. It&#x27;s really easy on your skin and feels smooth afterwards. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this facial cleanser in the morning and at night. It works great! Other cleansers are too harsh and dry out my skin, but not this!!</li>
    <li> The texture of this cleanser is very comforting I think. I use this product with the Clarisonic brush to remove makeup and wash my face every morning and night. I have a clean smooth skin right after and I am relieved and know for sure that there is no makeup left before I go to bed. I really like this cleanser. and I used to have very very bad acne that made me not want to see anyone or go out at all. This has changed my life a lot! Hope it works for you all too!</li>
    <li> This product works very well, my daughter&#x27;s skin went from very pimply to clear with dedicated use of this product.  She still gets a few pimples, but it&#x27;s nothing like the acne that covered her entire face.  I wish this product had existed when I was a teen!</li>
    <li> The Exposed cleanser is by far my daughter&#x27;s favorite cleanser.  We have tried other products and this one has worked the best by far.  The customer service for these products far exceeds any other companies we have ordered from.  We are extremely happy with their products.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different face washes, most being the different brands available at retail stores, but never found anything that worked. I then took a chance on a product called \\&quot;Acnetix\\&quot; which was supposed to be an all-in-one acne face wash. Acnetix left my face pretty oily and was never successful in clearing up my acne. After a few months of using that product, I was reading reviews online and it was a toss-up between trying either Proactive or Exposed. I decided on Exposed and have been using their products for about a year and a half now. I started buying the kits, which cleared up my acne in only a couple months. I then found that I only needed to use the facial cleanser along with the acne treatment serum in order to maintain clear skin. Exposed puts out great products and they have been worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I received my order earlier than expected and I was very impressed by the quality of the packaging. Also, everything about the product speaks to its superior quality and the dedication of the company. But most of all, I was impressed by the customer service and will definitely by purchasing from Exposed Skin Care again.</li>
    <li> I have bought this several times for my son, he says it is a great shower face wash and helps control the oil.</li>
    <li> seems to work when my son actually puts it on his face</li>
    <li> This product works great. It gives a clean/refreshing feeling that is meant to be beneficial to your acne. The product is small, but  requires very little as it lathers great.</li>
    <li> I really like using the Exposed facial cleanser as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and works wonderfully at cleaning it.  I use it in conjunction with the entire Exposed skin care kit and my skin has never looked so great!  I truly love Exposed Skin Care products and have been using them for years and am very satisfied.  I would highly recommend giving them a try![[ASIN:B002CIXVVI Facial Cleanser]]</li>
    <li> Exposed facial cleanser is great for leaving the skin clean and clear. I used to have many breakouts and finding the exposed skincare system has been the best thing for my skin. I have been using it for 5 years now. I recommend using the toner after using the cleanser, if sensitive skin, start out using at nighttime and gradually increasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve left a detailed review on this product in the past when I bought the kit. I like it. It has really cleared up my face. I get regular comments that my face looks better. But let me be honest... it looks BETTER, it isn&#x27;t free of acne. Often when I get a pimple it seems to be a cystic one under the skin that is visible but never actually gets a head so it doesn&#x27;t ever go away. I would rather it be gross for a few days but then go away.</li>
    <li> Best face wash I ever used ! Very gentle on the face . Those for have sensitive skin this you would like ! Won&#x27;t regret using this product ! I sure dont !</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid of my acne. but it didnt make it worse either. It did make it a lot better though. I barely notice that i have any, anymore. I also use the acne spot treatment with this and it works great. This comment isn&#x27;t a fake like some are. I am totally telling the truth. I have tried everything even the $150 cream, and it didnt work as good as this</li>
    <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have tried everything! Everything from drugstore cleansers like Clearasil to mail order products such Murad or Proactive. Every time I have tried a cleanser, if it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or irritate it more, eventually it just stopped working after a few months. Well, I got tired of my skin becoming too oily or too dry after using the product for awhile so I tried Exposed. I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time now and love it! It took about a week and a half to really start clearing up my skin and I had NO reaction to the cleanser. It felt very clean and I didn&#x27;t need to use much of it. I would highly recommend this to anyone that has tried EVERYTHING and feels like nothing will work, because this cleanser will.</li>
    <li> Great stuff definitely works</li>
