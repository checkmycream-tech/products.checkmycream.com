      <li>Awesome!</li>

      <li>I love that it is alcohol-free, and worked great every time!</li>
      <li>They work great!!! :))</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m still saying this is good</li>
      <li>Fascinating to examine after I pull it off.</li>
      <li>ok, so i wasn&#x27;t happy about waiting over 2 weeks for arrival..</li>
      <li>Also, I love how I got some free samples from the seller :D</li>
      <li>These are amazing.</li>
      <li>I liked this product, but I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
      <li>Hoping she liked the product.</li>
      <li>Cleanse skin with warm water.</li>
      <li>And I honestly can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;ve made a difference or not.</li>
      <li>Another review said these are amazing at cleaning out pores, and when you pull them off you see more crud on the strip than you even thought you had on your nose, but they weren&#x27;t as spectacular as I had anticipated.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use warm water to loosen pores.</li>
      <li>It pulls out blackheads but the charcoal smell is really strong!  </li>
      <li>I just love them.</li>
      <li>TonyMoly is better.</li>
      <li>I also notice that they don&#x27;t really do that great a job at clearing out my blackheads.</li>
      <li>but i love how you guys sent me a note saying thank you for your purchase</li>
      <li>This product is okay.</li>
      <li>I will finish them though, they seem to work better after using the mint julep mask from Queen Helene.</li>
      <li>I use them once or twice a month and my pores look much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
      <li>but I do like to look at all the gunk the strip was able to remove.</li>
      <li>This seems to work much better for me than the biore strips.</li>
      <li>wishing that these did more.</li>
      <li>These nose strips are okay</li>
      <li>I am ok with that.</li>
      <li>Ok product used for a week it worked well.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>so the pore strip can attach better.</li>
      <li>Also using a vitamin enriched serum is recommended since the pores are more susceptible to absorption after use.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the biggest problem with blackheads, but maybe to someone with a more severe case of acne/blackheads these would work better?  </li>
      <li>that most of these strips promise.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads it just removes the top layer of dirt off of your skin.</li>
      <li>It was interesting to see what is on the sheet after you pull them off you.</li>
      <li>Love these pore strips.</li>
      <li>These pore removers were pretty good.</li>
      <li>It does explain how you use it and most importantly how to apply it on your nose.</li>
      <li>Really good strips, they work very well</li>
      <li>i think these are good for people who don&#x27;t have much stuff on there nose.</li>
      <li>how well it works, since I haven&#x27;t used it too much, but it&#x27;s fairly smelly.  </li>
      <li>i guess they don&#x27;t really work that good</li>
      <li>These are cool!  </li>
      <li>It gets the job done but it has a really strong smell.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;but make sure, after you use this, you have to put special item which helps your pores minimizing on nose.</li>
      <li>Since gravity pulls oils and skin down lifting up or sideways will give the best results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After using it once, I can&#x27;t say there was a huge difference</li>
      <li>It gives off this light charcoal smell.</li>
      <li>because I&#x27;ve found that the week or so after I use one, the pores on my nose remain free of blockage and my skin stays smooth.</li>
      <li>If you like Biore you will enjoy this.</li>
      <li>and you guys also sent me a facial wash sample the seller was great.</li>
      <li>leaves your nose clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>These arrived quickly and were easy to use.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find them to be as strong as Biore&#x27;s version, but for a fraction of the price they&#x27;re well worth it.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good pore strip.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not painful to take off.</li>
      <li>this product was amazing for the price and its easy to use, even though the directions were in a language i didnt understand it was still very simple.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant about this product but quickly learned there was nothing to be worried about.</li>
      <li>These are the first nose strips I have ever purchased/used, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect when I first tried one.  </li>
      <li>The product is definitely worth it for the price, but there&#x27;s not anything too special about this product.</li>
      <li>If you are in very hot weather and your sweating often these really will clean your pores well!</li>
      <li>Mostly because I have 3 boxes, but also because they leave my skin SOOOO soft!  </li>
      <li>These strips are ok as far as pore strips go.</li>
      <li>It feels more natural than pore strips that you can buy in the states and the price is comparable.</li>
      <li>Cousin gave this to me years ago and finally got the chance to get my own.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price though compared to the ones you get in the store.</li>
      <li>And as a nice bonus there are English directions on the box in case you are unsure how to use the strips.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m more sensitive than others</li>
      <li>I was able to get the sticker completely off.</li>
      <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
      <li>I had just used a pore strip the week prior, so while there wasn&#x27;t much to see on the strip, I think these do a good job.</li>
      <li>no dirt, no little blackheads, just smooth, clean skin.</li>
      <li>First use a warm wash cloth to open your pores.</li>
      <li>They worked very well for my skin :)  English instructions are in fine print on the side... took me a while to find.</li>
      <li>and I find the best results are after facial cleansing and slight steaming of the face.</li>
      <li>Then again, my skin was already pretty clean, so maybe I just didn&#x27;t have that much gunk?</li>
      <li>Find a good moisturizer to keep pores moist so they clog less.</li>
      <li>Love this product, certainly takes out most of the black heads.</li>
      <li>sure if it really gets rid of blackheads, but it left my nose feeling really soft and smooth afterward!</li>
      <li>literally.. tan and non sensitive.. easily came off , but i did need to rub off a little left on the top and side of my nose.. not a big deal... overall - happy and glad i bought these!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i used it to me it doesnt get my black heads out. but takes alot of stuff off my nose so i end up having hair growing on my nose....funky smell to me it doesnt work. just try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Love these pore strips. First use a warm wash cloth to open your pores. Leave your nose a little wet so the pore strip can attach better. Then I use the wet wash cloth to pat it down. Make sure not to get it too wet. Just damp. Then the strip will dry on your nose. When fully dry (15-20 minutes) you can take it off. It&#x27;s kinda gross but I do like to look at all the gunk the strip was able to remove.</li>
    <li> these are awesome. great nose strips.  comparable to similar more expensive brands. don&#x27;t waste money on strips like boscia which are twice the price for half the amount of items.</li>
    <li> These actually came quicker than I had expected. These are amazing. I use it once a day and I&#x27;m surprised that it works. They sometimes leave black marks on my nose from the paper. It smells a little weird like pefume and medicine mixed together which is fine by me.</li>
    <li> well it does take out a lot of the white heads form my nose. Overall it gets it done. But here are some of the cons that influenced my rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:&lt;br /&gt;It smells horrible. The smell is like that of charcoal and soggy biscuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size:&lt;br /&gt;The strip is too small. My nose is not grotesquely large but I would have liked if the strip could come over the tip of my nose and slightly onto my cheeks so that it could cover the sides of my nostrils completely. I saw other people have the same problem on youtube reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that this product is decent but i can find similar quality in my local drug store for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wah wah waaaaaah...lol</li>
    <li> My neice had asked for these as a gift. I was disappointed that when they arrived, there was a huge sticker across the front of the package and it blocked out the graphic...not the way I like to give gifts. After getting out the Goo Gone I was able to get the sticker completely off. Hoping she liked the product.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> Always looking for decent nose masks and this one seems to do t he trick.</li>
    <li> Ok product used for a week it worked well. Happy with result I had and will buy again. Worked as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far, but it seems to work fine. The smell was pretty strong, but it was only during the first application. Once it&#x27;s on your nose, the smell is gone. Also, I love how I got some free samples from the seller :D</li>
    <li> smells funny at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wash nose first, don&#x27;t over wet the strip, let it dry on nose completely, and peel slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulled off just as muh, if no more, than biore.</li>
    <li> Works minimally, smells horrible lol</li>
    <li> Really good strips, they work very well and I love they are black as you can see very clearly every blackhead it nixed.My advice is to immediately wipe your noise with a vitamin toner to keep the pores from reclogging with yuck. Never put a moisturizing agent after any strips or you&#x27;ll be filling your open pores with it, creating a brand new spot for dirt to collect and BAM, self defeated.I give these 5 stars for not only effectiveness but also the color, as I said,  easier to see what you got out. The shipping was slow as molasses I assume because coming from Asia, so reorder as soon as you decide you like them.</li>
    <li> The best nose strips I have ever used.  This seems to work much better for me than the biore strips.</li>
    <li> These took forever to arrive and the directions were in Chinese! Ugh!</li>
    <li> These strip works well for its price.  They&#x27;re definitely cheaper than what you find at the drugstore.  They work the same as the brand name strip at the drugstore, so why paid extra for the brand name?  The reason why I gave it a 3 stars because of the smell.  The charcoal smell is a little strong for me.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m more sensitive than others but since the nose strip is right on your nose, its kind of hard to avoid the smell.  Also you have to leave the strip on for 15 minutes so its a little uncomfortable for me to breathe in the smell for that long.  I know the charcoal is suppose to be good for you, but I&#x27;m just a little too sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like how it was black and I couldn&#x27;t really see the junk whenever it pulled this off my nose. It didn&#x27;t really took as much as people said it would it just took some and i left it on for 15min once too. Ill just stick to biore.</li>
    <li> cleaned out my pores and left my skin feeling really soft afterwards. the only thing is it smells like mud when you&#x27;re applying it but it goes away. and it&#x27;s not painful to take off.</li>
    <li> These are the first nose strips I have ever purchased/used, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect when I first tried one.  Another review said these are amazing at cleaning out pores, and when you pull them off you see more crud on the strip than you even thought you had on your nose, but they weren&#x27;t as spectacular as I had anticipated.  Again, these could actually be the holy grail of nose strips, but I just don&#x27;t have enough experience with other brands to make that call!  They DID remove a few of the blackheads/whiteheads as well as dead skin, but after pulling it off I looked at my nose and could still see some pores that managed to escape.  I don&#x27;t have the biggest problem with blackheads, but maybe to someone with a more severe case of acne/blackheads these would work better?  I will continue to use them, though!  Mostly because I have 3 boxes, but also because they leave my skin SOOOO soft!  Not quite like a baby&#x27;s butt, but still pretty soft.</li>
    <li> I love these pore strips!! When I&#x27;m done using them, it looks like I have no pores at all!! It cleans out EVERYTHING and leaves your skin looking and feeling great!!!</li>
    <li> These arrived earlier than I expected, and as most of the Asian beauty products I&#x27;ve tried it worked well!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using this after a shower so your pores are open and your face is wet, I&#x27;ve used these about 3 times so far and my nose always feels very soft and hydrated after. If you are in very hot weather and your sweating often these really will clean your pores well! Definitely will be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It is quite similar to biore nose strips and does an amazing job at removing black heads.</li>
    <li> it works great. every time I use this strip, it brings out lots of black head.</li>
    <li> Love this product, certainly takes out most of the black heads. Only thing I do not like is that it does not come with English manual/instructions. I think it would help in terms of how the thing works. But the pore strip itself works great! leaves your nose clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> after 15 minutes, my blackheads are running away with this product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but make sure, after you use this, you have to put special item which helps your pores minimizing on nose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I dont have a lot of black heads but for me this product didn&#x27;t do much. Maybe I removed it too early? But i would leave it on for 15 mins as instructed. I have spanish skin, so maybe this is only for asian skin? I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> These nose strips are like any nose strips really. They pick up a lot of gunk in your nose, but because they&#x27;re sulfur strips they come with that sulfur smell. Definitely irritated me the first time I used it, but it&#x27;s not terribly bad. I think my biore strips pick up more gunk usually as well. The product is definitely worth it for the price, but there&#x27;s not anything too special about this product.</li>
    <li> Used immediately after receiving this. I love that it is alcohol-free, and worked great every time! Leaves my pores clean and small. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good pore strip.</li>
    <li> I would give this a zero if I could, not only did it not pull out blackheads but it put on the charcoal on my nose. No Help!</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but it has a really strong smell.  It&#x27;s worth the price though compared to the ones you get in the store.</li>
    <li> You have to place a wet cloth over it to even stick to your nose but then when it finally dries, nothing is there...</li>
    <li> These are cool!  They worked very well for my skin :)  English instructions are in fine print on the side... took me a while to find.</li>
    <li> wishing that these did more. My sebaceous filaments can get crazy, so i just pop them instead. I will finish them though, they seem to work better after using the mint julep mask from Queen Helene.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. Its just like biore pore strips, or any other pore strips at your local beauty store. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> this product was amazing for the price and its easy to use, even though the directions were in a language i didnt understand it was still very simple. I would repurchase from this seller!</li>
    <li> Meh. Have used better blackhead removers... leaves black dye on your face and doesn&#x27;t rip errrrthang out. TonyMoly is better.</li>
    <li> These pore removers were pretty good. I didn&#x27;t find them to be as strong as Biore&#x27;s version, but for a fraction of the price they&#x27;re well worth it. Another plus, you can really see everything it removed because the strip is black making it easier to see. Don&#x27;t get me wrong they do remove a lot of gunk but I still feel the Biore version would have eliminated everything. I will be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> These smell HORRIBLE. They smell like cigarette butts. And I honestly can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;ve made a difference or not.</li>
    <li> It pulls out blackheads but the charcoal smell is really strong!  it also took a long time to be shipped.</li>
    <li> Not to bad. They definitely  don&#x27;t  rip the top layer  of skin off like bore strip do. The smell very good. The only  thing I wasn&#x27;t  sure  about  was that you can&#x27;t  see the results  as well as you can against  the white  strips. So I couldn&#x27;t  tell how well it was work.</li>
    <li> These strips are ok as far as pore strips go. They are a bit messy due to the charcoal I guess. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These nose strips are okay i guess they don&#x27;t really work that good they do pull some off but not much but i love how you guys sent me a note saying thank you for your purchase and you guys also sent me a facial wash sample the seller was great. i think these are good for people who don&#x27;t have much stuff on there nose.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this product but quickly learned there was nothing to be worried about. This is a great alternative to the store brand and Biore products for the price.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work well.  I&#x27;m not too sure how well it works, since I haven&#x27;t used it too much, but it&#x27;s fairly smelly.  In my opinion, it smells like second-hand smoke, which is not the best, buttt I should&#x27;ve expected it since they are charcoal strips.</li>
    <li> If you like Biore you will enjoy this. It works just as well, and including the shipping and handling costs is actually cheaper than getting Biore from the store. I gave it only 4 stars because it works as well as Biore but not any better. And as a nice bonus there are English directions on the box in case you are unsure how to use the strips.</li>
    <li> The price was surprisingly low, and delivery was almost a month ahead of schedule! The only reason they&#x27;re not getting five stars might be my fault; I wasn&#x27;t able to get the cone-shaped pore gunk-residue that most of these strips promise. Then again, my skin was already pretty clean, so maybe I just didn&#x27;t have that much gunk? Anyways, the product I got for the price was a great value. Would definitely buy these again. ^^</li>
    <li> i honestly am i having trouble using this. can anyone please explain to me how to use this...</li>
    <li> I must say I have not used many nose strips being that I am just starting to make over my skin care routine. However these strips really got the job done. I&#x27;m sold after just one use. It hurt so bad to remove but it was worth the pain. I highly recommend. Also using a vitamin enriched serum is recommended since the pores are more susceptible to absorption after use. I am 20 years old for the record. Enjoy I will re-purchase!! :D</li>
    <li> works, but smell not good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biore pore strips for a while, and while they seem to work okay, I wanted to try something different. These arrived quickly and were easy to use. I had just used a pore strip the week prior, so while there wasn&#x27;t much to see on the strip, I think these do a good job. They dry faster than regular pore strips. I did not care for the &amp;#34;tobacco&amp;#34; smell, but it&#x27;s charcoal, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be odorless.</li>
    <li> These work, but did leave marks on my face and I only left on for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get half of my blackheads. Must be my skin. I&#x27;m Vietnamese with a little bit of oily skin</li>
    <li> I used different kind of nose strips before, but this one is my favourite so far. It&#x27;s scent is mild enough (it&#x27;s similar to the etude house green tea ones, but not so strong), to not bother me, while it&#x27;s on. It is really strong, I use it only once a week, and afterwards my nose is much cleaner, no dirt, no little blackheads, just smooth, clean skin. What also makes this my favourite is the shape. It&#x27;s slightly curved, so it stays away from the sensitive skin around my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Only con maybe, that sometimes getting it off can be a bit unpleasent, but since I don&#x27;t use it that much it&#x27;s not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;(For anyone interested, you have to make your nose area wet with water, put a strip on it and wait till it dries a bit. Then you have to pull the strip off, and wash off any residue.)</li>
    <li> The instructions on this product is all Korean, with a small statement in the very bottom on the back of this product, does it explain in English. It does explain how you use it and most importantly how to apply it on your nose. The only down fall to this product is when you put it on your nose and let it dry. It gives off this light charcoal smell. It&#x27;s not over powering but it was still a bit irritating as your waiting for the product to dry and than you gently remove the strip off of your nose.</li>
    <li> works as well as Biore Pore strips, if not better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of whiteheads all the time and I use this about once every 1-2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my boyfriend is into it LOL</li>
    <li> It could just be me, but everytime I try and use one of these strips it leaves little pieces all over my nose! I also notice that they don&#x27;t really do that great a job at clearing out my blackheads. I prefer Skinfoods&#x27; egg white pore strips.</li>
    <li> i was pretty skeptical of this at first when i tried it, but it was actually pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;it actually pulled out a lot of the hair on my nose as well as the peach fuzz, but it hurt A LOT to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;not sure if it really gets rid of blackheads, but it left my nose feeling really soft and smooth afterward!</li>
    <li> ok, so i wasn&#x27;t happy about waiting over 2 weeks for arrival.. and then i tried these strips tonight. i don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about them hurting when you remove them? i like them a  lot! i didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars because they don&#x27;t take most of the white and black heads off, but they did take a lot of the stubborn ones off. Plus it does NOT hurt when you remove them.. however i do have some thick skin..literally.. tan and non sensitive.. easily came off , but i did need to rub off a little left on the top and side of my nose.. not a big deal... overall - happy and glad i bought these!</li>
    <li> I just love them. I bought them for the first time when I was in South Korea. They work great!!! :))</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected, they added cooling gel too :)</li>
    <li> These work great. Yes they do smell a bit like charcoal, but I dont mind. And yes, there are a few black spots when you pull the strip off, but just a slash of water after gets it off.</li>
    <li> It draws a lot of crud out. Fascinating to examine after I pull it off. It did not draw everything out but it drew a LOT out. I am ok with that. I have a lot of blackheads that go pretty deep.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very messy to put in your nose</li>
    <li> Cousin gave this to me years ago and finally got the chance to get my own. Love this product, and definitely grateful that the instructions were in English on Amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but I don&#x27;t know why. It works if you use it correctly. I like that it uses charcoal. It took a long time to receive, considering there was a small quantity. It feels more natural than pore strips that you can buy in the states and the price is comparable. My advice would be to order multiple packs if you end up liking the product, since delivery is a longer wait time.</li>
    <li> they didn&#x27;t work at all, and I only got 6 and I was supposed to get 8...</li>
    <li> I gave this a 3 star because it did get the grossness out but not all of it....and I have sensitive skin which case I ended up tearing up because for somehow or another it was giving me a burning feeling😓</li>
    <li> Arrived a week before the estimated date which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I had to come back to amazon to read how to apply it on at first because I couldn&#x27;t read the Korean characters on the box.&lt;br /&gt;After using it once, I can&#x27;t say there was a huge difference but I did see some disappearances of black heads on my nose. It was interesting to see what is on the sheet after you pull them off you. Yes it does slightly hurt when you pull it off but at least I know it is pulling something off of my nose. I will be ordering these again in the future.</li>
    <li> These work really well for me, especially for the price.  I &#x27;m a pore-strip junky, have tried all kinds, and really like these.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads it just removes the top layer of dirt off of your skin. It makes your nose soft but then the blackheads are still there. Maybe I just need a different product?</li>
    <li> Horrible, don&#x27;t buy. Instead of ripping things off my nose it felt horrible but left the charcoal behind.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but these kinds of things never work well. I tried these hoping for a better result than previous brands, but all in all I&#x27;m just left with pain and a less-than satisfied feeling when I tear them off...However, I&#x27;m still saying this is good because I&#x27;ve found that the week or so after I use one, the pores on my nose remain free of blockage and my skin stays smooth.</li>
    <li> It does what its suposed to do and i dont images bot having these.</li>
    <li> It´s ok, but I´m not satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are indeed heavy duty; they managed to pull stuff out of the bridge of my nose, something no other pore strip has done.  The downside is that they tear up the sides of my nose.  I&#x27;ve used three of these strips and every time, it leaves my nose cracked and flaky and in pain.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it... :(</li>
    <li> I tested this on my boyfriends face as he has larger pores than mine and after peeling it off his nose, I saw all the little \\&quot;fuzzy appearance\\&quot; of the dirt and oil that was remove.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use and I find the best results are after facial cleansing and slight steaming of the face.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love this product. I have used this product once a week for about a month and the pores on my nose or noticeably smaller! Will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> These actually work really well. They hurt to rip off but they work better than the standard pore strips. Best results on nose and forehead. If they don&#x27;t work for you chances are you are using them wrong.  1. Cleanse skin with warm water. I dont use soap for this. I use hot water and a towel to wash away excess oil and dirt. 2. Make sure you use warm water to loosen pores. Saturate area with the water. the warmer your skin the looser your pores will be. 3. Apply the strip and run your fingers over it a few times to make sure it is in COMPLETE CONTACT with the area. 4. Try not to move your face. Use this time to relax. If you do too much expressions or the strip will come loose as it dries making it less effective. 5. wait till 100% dry in all areas. takes about 5-10 mins. 6. Slowly and smoothly pull against gravity. Just like with waxing you want to pull the strip against the grain. Since gravity pulls oils and skin down lifting up or sideways will give the best results.  Follow my instructions and they will work. Also the active charcoal cleanses pores helping the area heal so your blackheads will become smaller over time. I use them once or twice a month and my pores look much better. Don&#x27;t overuse as it stresses the skin. Find a good moisturizer to keep pores moist so they clog less. That&#x27;s what works for me.</li>
