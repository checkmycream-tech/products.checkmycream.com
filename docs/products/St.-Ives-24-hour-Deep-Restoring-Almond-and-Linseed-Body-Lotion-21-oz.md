      <li>It is fragrance-free (meaning no perfumes added) but does have a light scent which I&#x27;ve always liked.</li>
      <li>Love it as my hand lotion.</li>

      <li>Love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>of all the st ives products it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I think most hand lotions are the devil</li>
      <li>It has a nice, clean scent too.</li>
      <li>Perfect in dry weather and works well when used after shaving.</li>
      <li>I have been very happy with every single flavor I have received</li>
      <li>so if you don&#x27;t like very sweet smells</li>
      <li>Works very nice through the winter, it kept my hands nice and moist, and I swim a lot which can cause my skin to get even more dry from the Chlorine, but I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>so easy to have it delivered to my door because i cant always find it in stores.</li>
      <li>easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I happen to love the Deep Restring the best because it really moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t contain any perfume smells, which I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s never failed to keep my skin feeling nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a heavily tattooed person,and this lotion works great on my ink keeping my skin moist through out the day,as well as helping them heal nicely.</li>
      <li>you will get more than your moneys worth.</li>
      <li>this lotion is silkey smooth on my skin making it ever so soft all over my body really good lotion</li>
      <li>Your skin will start to feel better after the first couple uses.</li>
      <li>have used alot of lotions in the past and i have found this one to be the best.</li>
      <li>Deep restoring and moisture like it says smells pretty good too. :)</li>
      <li>The smell for the restoring 24 hour moisture version is pretty light though if you are not a fan of strongly scented lotions.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and my skin is much softer than before</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years, but since the most recent label/bottle change I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on Amazon, but for a really good price.</li>
      <li>&quot; they made to this lotion ( older one smelled better)</li>
      <li>For the money I find St. Ives to be the best, comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best body lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all,  from the cheapest, (Jergens) to the most expensive (M Asam).  </li>
      <li>This is a great body lotion for any season - I feel like it hydrates well without leaving a heavy film on your skin.</li>
      <li>but I think it leaves my skin smelling fresh and feeling soothed...</li>
      <li>My favorite St Ives lotion so far.</li>
      <li>With these lotions I dont&#x27; have to worry about that, but then again finding the right one for me is always a challenge.</li>
      <li>very moisturizing St. Ives Coconut Milk &amp; Orchid Extract is the most moisturizing the only thing is it has a strong smell of Orchid</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding the ST Ives, so was really happy to find it.</li>
      <li>I discovered this lotion at a friend of mine&#x27;s house and I instantly fell in love with this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I first tried this lotion about a year ago (recommended by a family member) and have been using every sence.</li>
      <li>I love the St.Ives facial scrubs.</li>
      <li>smelling funny</li>
      <li>I recommend this lotion to pretty much everyone!</li>
      <li>And really affordable too!</li>
      <li>My skin feels so much softer, which is a feat in Texas!</li>
      <li>The changes are noticeable and will definitely come in handy if you live in colder weather.</li>
      <li>the other one I tried is the Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter and it smells amazing</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I&#x27;ve tried 2 other St. Ives lotions and if you need something</li>
      <li>I love this one as it truly keeps my body, face moisturized for long time, yet does not feel greasy or block my pores.</li>
      <li>It has a slight fragrance that is nice.  </li>
      <li>The scent is subtle and smells nice and clean.</li>
      <li>I tried many creams but they did not help the very dry skin in my lower legs.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than Vaseline Clinical Therapy and works just as well.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Not greasy but very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I will buy more of this product... for my very dry skin, it works!</li>
      <li>Not much more to say, it does what it is meant to do, feels nice and soaks into my skin well without a greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed more expensive lotions much less than this one, which is now my favorite.</li>
      <li>Ordering through amazon is a decent price and it came quickly, not too much more to say after that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a super thick lotion with just a hint of almond scent.  The thing I like most about it is that it&#x27;s almost &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;...leaves my hands feeling moisturized, but not slippery.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell anything close to almonds; a bit heavy and sticky</li>
    <li> I think most hand lotions are the devil and I cant stand how they make the office stink.  I bought this for someone that sat near me because the scent does not bother my allergies.</li>
    <li> Love it as my hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Great for winter time when your skin gets the driest. Deep restoring and moisture like it says smells pretty good too. :)</li>
    <li> It is non-greasy and makes my skin feel so soft. Perfect in dry weather and works well when used after shaving.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. it not greasy. easy to apply. my skin stays soft entire day. I would definitely recommended it.</li>
    <li> All of St. Ives products have a very light scent and feel to them but this one is really great and provides the moisture that you need. I would recommend it. Also they packaged it perfectly for no leaks or spills before arriving.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion qualify for free shipping, and it turned out to be the thing I like the most from my order! It&#x27;s thick, creamy, NOT greasy at all, and it absorbs SO quickly. The scent is really subtle - I can only really smell it if I put my nose about an inch above it, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t linger. My skin feels so much softer, which is a feat in Texas! Definitely a great lotion at an even greater price.</li>
    <li> Just a good affordable lotion.  Not much more to say, it does what it is meant to do, feels nice and soaks into my skin well without a greasy residue.  This is our household lotion staple.</li>
    <li> Your skin will start to feel better after the first couple uses. The changes are noticeable and will definitely come in handy if you live in colder weather.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion without having a greasy feeling after using it.</li>
    <li> And really affordable too! I&#x27;m surprised to have such an affordable product which works this well. St Ives really did a good one!</li>
    <li> I never end up buying the same lotion, but I would probably by this again. It smells great and keeps my skin well maintained.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It gives deep moisturizing for you and works very well. It was a good buy</li>
    <li> love this cream! of all the st ives products it is my favorite. doesnt leave greasy after feel! so easy to have it delivered to my door because i cant always find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, not girly, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin moisturized, while not giving you that icky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;etc etc.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out if I use anything too oily but gets very itchy and rough if it doesn&#x27;t get enough moisture. St. Ives 24 Hour Moisture lotion provides the perfect amount of moisture without being greasy; it absorbs within minutes but my skin really does feel moisturized and soft all day. I started using this product 4 years ago and turned to Amazon when it was no longer available in my local stores because I loathe the thought of having to switch to a lesser product.</li>
    <li> I had really dry skin on my legs in the winter. Using this lotion every day, I no longer had problems with dry skin. My favorite St Ives lotion so far.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I tried many creams but they did not help the very dry skin in my lower legs. This one has pleasant scent and does the job, without being greasy. It makes my skin not dry for 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing I read a lot of reviews before buying because I wanted to see if anyone was going to say anything about it smelling funny lol but I took the chance and it smells good and moisturizes the skin I did have to use it twice a day and I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I&#x27;ve tried 2 other St. Ives lotions and if you need something very moisturizing St. Ives Coconut Milk &amp; Orchid Extract is the most moisturizing the only thing is it has a strong smell of Orchid so if you don&#x27;t like very sweet smells you may not like it I don&#x27;t mind it the other one I tried is the Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter and it smells amazing but you may have to use it a couple time through out the day</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I have ever used.  It was half the price I paid at a retail store, and it works wonders.  Makes my hands stop hurting from the winter dry time. I have a hard time finding the ST Ives, so was really happy to find it.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every morning and night and also after washing my hands. I don&#x27;t know about the 24 hour moisture claim but my skin does feel softer and smoother after applying it and letting it dry some. However, I think the Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter version provides better results in terms of obtaining smoother skin. The smell for the restoring 24 hour moisture version is pretty light though if you are not a fan of strongly scented lotions.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for the price</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t by any other body lotion.  It&#x27;s quality is far above any other.  I am so happy that I found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This lotion does last longer then name brand like Kiehls as far as the effect of moisturizing. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy that the St. Ives brand is consistent in terms of quality, I&#x27;m not particularly in love with the scent of this particular lotion.</li>
    <li> this lotion absorbs and works well . it is not greasy or too heavy yet is substantial compared to other lotions</li>
    <li> Good lotion and use all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives lotions for about 10 years and I have no complaints. The price is right and it really works; I&#x27;m always left feeling hydrated after I use it. I happen to love the Deep Restring the best because it really moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t contain any perfume smells, which I can&#x27;t stand. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> I like St. Ives products in general. However there is this lotion that makes my skin itch, and i am hoping this isnt another one of those.</li>
    <li> I hoped this would moisturize enough for me, but it doesn&#x27;t. The others by St. Ives work well though, and I like that they dont&#x27; have all those bad chemicals that irritate my skin. I have sensitive skin, and often dryness that is hard to get rid of. With these lotions I dont&#x27; have to worry about that, but then again finding the right one for me is always a challenge. I like the product line and will continue to use them. I have a couple by St. Ives that work well, the orchid one is nice, smells good too.</li>
    <li> Works very nice through the winter, it kept my hands nice and moist, and I swim a lot which can cause my skin to get even more dry from the Chlorine, but I would recommend this to anyone. It has a nice, clean scent too.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than Vaseline Clinical Therapy and works just as well.</li>
    <li> it is really nice. I love the scent and my skin is much softer than before</li>
    <li> this lotion is silkey smooth on my skin making it ever so soft all over my body really good lotion even better price.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives lotion, that&#x27;s all I ever buy!  I usually switch up the &#x27;flavor&#x27; from time to time, but I find that St. Ives always does well for me!  Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a great body lotion for any season - I feel like it hydrates well without leaving a heavy film on your skin. I also love the scent - not flowery but just a wonderful out-of-the-shower smell. I&#x27;ve enjoyed more expensive lotions much less than this one, which is now my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for 5+ years and it&#x27;s never failed to keep my skin feeling nice. I&#x27;m a heavily tattooed person,and this lotion works great on my ink keeping my skin moist through out the day,as well as helping them heal nicely. I read a lot of bad reviews on St.Ives official site in regards to the \\&quot;change\\&quot; they made to this lotion ( older one smelled better) but I think it leaves my skin smelling fresh and feeling soothed...great product</li>
    <li> This body lotion smooths into the skin really nice and does not feel greasy.  It has a slight fragrance that is nice.  Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Its hand lotion, it does its job. Ordering through amazon is a decent price and it came quickly, not too much more to say after that.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as fragrance-free...it is NOT!!!  For those of us who suffer from migraines caused by smells....do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best body lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all,  from the cheapest, (Jergens) to the most expensive (M Asam).  Great stuff at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love the St.Ives facial scrubs. This is also very good product for the skin. I ordered four of these body lotions for my relatives in Bangladesh. I use this body lotion after I get of the shower when my skin is damp. Smells really good too.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the silkiness and lasting softness of this lotion!  I will buy more of this product... for my very dry skin, it works!</li>
    <li> Another great product from St. Ives. I have been very happy with every single flavor I have received and I think by now I have tried them all from Amazon! For the money I find St. Ives to be the best, comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Not greasy but very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> have used alot of lotions in the past and i have found this one to be the best. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years, but since the most recent label/bottle change I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on Amazon, but for a really good price. This lotion initially feels heavy, but spreads around easily and feels light on your skin. It absorbs quickly so you can get dressed soon after putting it on without having to worry about having trouble getting your jeans on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed in another review there was a complaint about it having a scent. It is fragrance-free (meaning no perfumes added) but does have a light scent which I&#x27;ve always liked. You can&#x27;t expect something to have no scent whatsoever! Compared to other frangrance-free lotions, this smells loads better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my skin soft and smooth all day long and into the next, and it has never irritated my sensitive skin. I recommend this lotion to pretty much everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent well over hundreds of dollars on expensive lotions and creams to help my dry skin. When I saw this lotion by st Ives I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was below $5. The scent is subtle and smells nice and clean. My skin feels soft after applying it on and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasey after-feeling. This has easily become my favorite moisturizer and replaced my expensive lotion that I buy from my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Love love love this body lotion. Not at all heavy, not greasy, and soaks right in. Lasts for a long time too! No need to try any other brand, this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Feels like I didn&#x27;t use anything just minutes later</li>
    <li> Good value.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I am in my fifties and found out that body moisturizers work better for my face now. I love this one as it truly keeps my body, face moisturized for long time, yet does not feel greasy or block my pores. Is wonderful moisturizer. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I first tried this lotion about a year ago (recommended by a family member) and have been using every sence.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I discovered this lotion at a friend of mine&#x27;s house and I instantly fell in love with this moisturizer. It is ideal for a hands and feet because it absorb so quickly and its none greasy. The natural moisturizers have thickened my nails. My hands don&#x27;t feel dry at all throughout the day especially during the winter months when my skin is most dry. But I recommend  reapplying it after washing your hands which is why I wish St. Ives would make a travel size of this product because no lotion is water resistant. Another bonus is the smell and price of the product. 9$ for 21 oz. you will get more than your moneys worth.</li>
