      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Nice light scent.</li>
      <li>BB just does it all better.</li>
      <li>Both my husband and I use this product and we love it.</li>
      <li>I no longer go to the salon that uses Bumble and Bumble products, so I was happy to find that I could order it online and at such a good price.</li>
      <li>This works great on holding my very curly hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of B&amp;B Prep and love it.</li>
      <li>My hair is softer and more touch-</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to get some shampoos and the Prep and Styling Lotion for sure but was hoping to find them at a discount.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love them...</li>
      <li>When I found the Prep and Styling Lotion on Amazon I was very excited.  </li>
      <li>Easy, effective and quick.</li>
      <li>I use Prep first and then add Bumble and Bumble Styling Cream for light hold and good volume.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful spray for detangling wet hair - have used for years and found nothing comparable.</li>
      <li>good product, fast delivery</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for!</li>
      <li>It nourishes your scalp and hair, makes the tangles easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>For my fine hair it makes it managable and extremely easy comb</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Positives: There is a light odor when you spray it on but after that it disappates and does not linger on my hair.</li>
      <li>I like the free gifts and shipping, etc.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I suppose it is a good general conditioner for the hair.  </li>
      <li>up friendly.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited when my B&amp;B Prep bottle arrived yesterday.  </li>
      <li>It makes you hair special.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a fine product if you have the right expectation.</li>
      <li>Not something I use every day, but it really does make a huge difference!</li>
      <li>A fellow dread working the juicebar at Whole Foods here in Austin tipped me off to how great this spay works for keeping your hair fresh and soft...</li>
      <li>I recently started going to a salon where they use B&amp;B products and just loved the results from them and from the samples they gave me to use at home.  </li>
      <li>It makes my straight hair look shiny and definitely healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Bumble &amp; Bumble products and am very satisfied with Prep.</li>
      <li>I have long curly hair, this is a good detangler which also preps your hair for product.</li>
      <li>We alternate though between Prep and Tonic because we love both!</li>
      <li>Too much gives your hair a sort of beachy/been in the ocean texture, which is okay for natural drying but not so great if you are planning to blow dry.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it with success ever since.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I highly doubt Bumble &amp; Bumble had African American dreadlocks in mind when they created this leave-in conditioner-type product, but that&#x27;s perfectly alright.</li>
      <li>Smells yummy and makes my long hair tangle free!!</li>
      <li>right out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more suitable for fine to thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel really soft and strong whenever I use it in conjunction with my argan oil.</li>
      <li>With lots of baby fine hair that tangles easily &amp; looks flat as a pancake if I use too many hair products, including heavy conditioners, the hair prep has been ideal for detangling my hair after a shower without leaving any sticky or heavy residue.</li>
      <li>With this it really perks up!</li>
      <li>Pretty smell.</li>
      <li>After trying it out myself, I will be buying more when my current one runs out.</li>
      <li>This is a great product at first i thought it was for thick hair which i have</li>
      <li>Love it, have used several years.</li>
      <li>Nice product to spray on your wet hair after you washed it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, enough of it, it&#x27;s not thin, but it shows very quickly if I use too much product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also useful as kind of like a styling product \\&quot;lite\\&quot; and to be used when you don&#x27;t want a heavy product in your hair.</li>
      <li>I have full, soft, manageable hair even on the coldest, wettest winter days.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair and this product keeps my hair easy to style and restores luster between shampoos.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair super soft and tangle-free.</li>
      <li>My hair brushes out easily, detangles immediately, and is ready for the next step.</li>
      <li>Initially, I didn&#x27;t buy this product - I \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; it from my mother who has extremely fine, stick-straight hair.</li>
      <li>as it advertised like a light conditioner for fine hair that does not need heavy, weighty conditioner.  </li>
      <li>You can use as much as you want without hair getting gunky.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who wants improvements with their hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years (thanks to a recommendation from my hair stylist).</li>
      <li>and my hair is so much healthier than it used to be.</li>
      <li>that wasn&#x60;t  doing much of anything...to be fair,other t &amp;g products worked well....seemed like perfumed water...</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do anything but become somewhat gummy.  </li>
      <li>She uses it on a daily basis, and her hair looks fabulous.</li>
      <li>Having wavy hair, too, my hair tangles easily, so much</li>
      <li>I have curly/frizzy hair with a mind of it&#x27;s own and this product really helps tame any of my fly-aways.</li>
      <li>I use this every day as a leave-in conditioner and I love the way it &amp;#34;preps&amp;#34; my hair for blow-drying and curling.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thick hair that gets weighed down really easily by products.  </li>
      <li>I have very thin baby fine hair - and this stuff is great as a leave in conditioner instead of using regular conditioner in the shower.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent at first, but then I don&#x27;t seem to notice it later, which is a big plus for me as I really can&#x27;t stand heavily-scented products (and since you&#x27;re layering B&amp;B products, layers of scent could be a disaster).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good stuff, I like it.</li>
    <li> A great detangler for think and curly hair. My stylist no longer carries B and B products, so I was happy to find it on-line.</li>
    <li> Best stuff created for hair in ages. You can actually go a week without washing your hair! I don&#x27;t, but you can. It makes you hair special. You just have to try this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t matter your hair type. Mine is thick and tends to just hang. With this it really perks up! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles of B&amp;B Prep and love it. Unfortunately, this bottle is not a clear spray liquid as it supposed to be but a thick viscous substance that will not even pour out of the bottle, much less spray. I did not try to use it until a couple of weeks after the return period had expired. But there is a quality control problem somewhere. I have never had this happen with a product before.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Spray before combing out wet hair and drying to achieve a smooth look.  Love it, have used several years. Fan of Bumble and Bumble Products.</li>
    <li> I highly doubt Bumble &amp; Bumble had African American dreadlocks in mind when they created this leave-in conditioner-type product, but that&#x27;s perfectly alright. A fellow dread working the juicebar at Whole Foods here in Austin tipped me off to how great this spay works for keeping your hair fresh and soft...and I&#x27;ve been using it with success ever since.  Luckily you can find this stuff on Amazon, because it&#x27;s semi-hard to find outside of salons.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for your hair. I use it everytime I get out of the shower and my hair is so much healthier than it used to be.</li>
    <li> I add this before Styling Creme [[ASIN:B000BIXP4O Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme, 8-Ounce Bottle]] on days I&#x27;m going to blow dry and heat style my hair.  It seems to keep my hair freshly-styled all day, which just amazes me.      It has a light scent at first, but then I don&#x27;t seem to notice it later, which is a big plus for me as I really can&#x27;t stand heavily-scented products (and since you&#x27;re layering B&amp;B products, layers of scent could be a disaster).  I&#x27;d prefer a trigger bottle, easier on arthritic hands, but that&#x27;s a personal choice.    Bumble and Bumble products are expensive, but if you understand what Prep does - it&#x27;s for fine, soft, or thin hair, before styling products and/or heat - you might be just as delighted with your hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is great for detangling my wavy hair after I&#x27;ve washed it.  It also helps to protect my locks before I blowdry or flat iron and add additional products.  It is light and does not weigh my hair down.  I&#x27;ve been using this spray for the past year and a half and plan to continue in the future!</li>
    <li> The only problem I had was that is was frozen when it arrived, so it must have froze in shipment.  The bottle expanded, but it didn&#x27;t crack or leak.</li>
    <li> I bought this after rave comments from my daughter.  She uses it on a daily basis, and her hair looks fabulous. She wears the tousled look. Sadly, I could not use this product. I color my hair and this product appeared to diminish the color, or at least it didn&#x27;t last as long when I used this prep.  I gave it to my daughter and she was very happy to get it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for sometime and bought directly from B&amp;B - I can&#x27;t live without it.  For my fine hair it makes it managable and extremely easy comb right out of the shower.  To refresh my stock I ordered from Amazon Prime and I&#x27;ve used the bottle two times so far just in case I was wrong.  It hardly sprays and is very thick compared to the usual product.  It practicaly makes my hair impossible to comb and gluey.  Downright gross.  Something is definitely wrong with this stock.</li>
    <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> The military recently transferred me from previous stations in warm climates, to Alaska.  Hello staticy and dry hair!  Not a problem I knew how to deal with.  Well, I was recommended this product and it works so well!  I have full, soft, manageable hair even on the coldest, wettest winter days.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  My hair is amazing.  Even let my mom use some when she came to visit and she is a believer.  Even better is that is not full of petrol chemicals or parabens like some other products out there.  I am a B&amp;B fan now!</li>
    <li> I no longer go to the salon that uses Bumble and Bumble products, so I was happy to find that I could order it online and at such a good price.</li>
    <li> Love Bumble and Bumble Prep!</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the thickening spray (see my other review on that!) as it advertised like a light conditioner for fine hair that does not need heavy, weighty conditioner.  I also was lured that it could be used the day after you wash your hair to prep it up a bit.  It really doesn&#x27;t do anything but become somewhat gummy.  Wasted $$$$$ again!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when my B&amp;B Prep bottle arrived yesterday.  I recently started going to a salon where they use B&amp;B products and just loved the results from them and from the samples they gave me to use at home.  I wanted to get some shampoos and the Prep and Styling Lotion for sure but was hoping to find them at a discount.  When I found the Prep and Styling Lotion on Amazon I was very excited.  I used both for the first time last night and see a noticeable difference with how my hair looks and feels.  It looks like it did at the salon which I am not usually able to achieve.  I can&#x27;t wait to get more B&amp;B items!</li>
    <li> Buy it. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful spray for detangling wet hair - have used for years and found nothing comparable.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this product untangling my wet hair is a breeze and after blow drying my hair the volume of my hair seems thicker and I am very happy with the results that Bb prep has giving me. Would recommend this product to anyone who wants improvements with their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my frizzy hair less frizzy when I blow dry and helps make using a flat iron quicker.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have curly hair and we use this product after shampooing and on dry hair to \\&quot;re-set\\&quot; the curls and reduce the frizz. You can use as much as you want without hair getting gunky. Expensive, like all B&amp;B, but worth it!</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and this product adds fullness without weighing it down or being sticky.  I wish I had discovered it sooner!</li>
    <li> I have heard nothing but great things about the Prep spray. After trying it out myself, I will be buying more when my current one runs out. Not something I use every day, but it really does make a huge difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble &amp; Bumble Prep for years. With lots of baby fine hair that tangles easily &amp; looks flat as a pancake if I use too many hair products, including heavy conditioners, the hair prep has been ideal for detangling my hair after a shower without leaving any sticky or heavy residue. I just wash my hair, pat it with a towel to take out some of the water, and spray this on.  My hair brushes out easily, detangles immediately, and is ready for the next step. Easy, effective and quick. It may seem pricey but lasts so long and works so well that I don&#x27;t give the price tag a second thought.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at first i thought it was for thick hair which i have but it&#x27;s more suitable for fine to thin hair.  All bumble and bumble products are awesome.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel really soft and strong whenever I use it in conjunction with my argan oil. But don&#x27;t buy it from an online vendor, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going to get. Instead, if you must order it online, try Sephora online or the company&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Smells yummy and makes my long hair tangle free!!</li>
    <li> Not sure why this works, but it does work for itchy scalp and dandruff. Too much gives your hair a sort of beachy/been in the ocean texture, which is okay for natural drying but not so great if you are planning to blow dry. No smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using B&amp;B Prep for quite awhile now.  I have short hair and this product keeps my hair easy to style and restores luster between shampoos.  Great for a quick spritz and scrunch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past before but for some reason the one that I purchased from Amazon just smells funny.  Amazon should find a way to seal wrap product it can&#x27;t be open and tampered with.</li>
    <li> I suppose it is a good general conditioner for the hair.  Makes it feel smooth and the ingredients are good, but I eventually gave it to my sister because I think it made my hair a little dull looking.</li>
    <li> Initially, I didn&#x27;t buy this product - I \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; it from my mother who has extremely fine, stick-straight hair. My hair is the complete opposite - thick, curly and tangled. This product leaves my hair super soft and tangle-free. My hairdresser even noticed a difference in my hair texture. Needless to say, but I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> not great...second prodecy in a row that wasn&#x60;t  doing much of anything...to be fair,other t &amp;g products worked well....seemed like perfumed water...</li>
    <li> I forgot how much I liked this product. My hair is getting longer, so this is a needed product. The main ingredient is water, but there are vitamins too. It makes my straight hair look shiny and definitely healthy. It&#x27;s impossible to spray too much, hair keeps looking better and better. Nice light scent.</li>
    <li> This works great on holding my very curly hair</li>
    <li> I use this every day as a leave-in conditioner and I love the way it &amp;#34;preps&amp;#34; my hair for blow-drying and curling.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thick hair that gets weighed down really easily by products.  This product does NOT weigh it down at all.  I usually spray it in while it&#x27;s wet, but it says you can spray it on dry hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy loads of hair products, and there&#x27;s not many that I keep on buying.  This is one that I continue to buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble products for about 5 years...I absolutely love them...I have fine hair and it&#x27;s dry and the prep helps  me style my hair after a shampoo or on the mornings I don&#x27;t wash my hair  after a night of sleep..It truly works and I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair, this is a good detangler which also preps your hair for product.</li>
    <li> I have very thin baby fine hair - and this stuff is great as a leave in conditioner instead of using regular conditioner in the shower.  It allows me to brush my hair without the tangles and does not weigh my hair down.  I probably would not recommend as a leave-in-conditioner for those who have thick hair - it does not have that much conditioning.  I usually use the bumble and bumble thickening spray or aveda volumizing tonic after using the prep.</li>
    <li> Nice product to spray on your wet hair after you washed it. It nourishes your scalp and hair, makes the tangles easy to comb through. Pretty smell. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice product that enhances your hair.</li>
    <li> Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE hair product! This is the best from taming my frizz and detangling! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this product and we love it. We alternate though between Prep and Tonic because we love both! I feel like its vitamins for my scalp and hair. B&amp;B makes great stuff, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use this after my shower before I apply my mousse and it works wonders.  It helps the mousse work longer and hold my style longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years (thanks to a recommendation from my hair stylist). It&#x27;s fantastic. I have curly/frizzy hair with a mind of it&#x27;s own and this product really helps tame any of my fly-aways. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t add any unnecessary weight to my hair and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> The product description says the product is intended to detangle hair prior to prep. I never have tangles anyway as my hair is very short. this product was recommended to me by a stylist for another reason: Something to give me a little stylng power but without goopiness or smelliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fairly well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: There is a light odor when you spray it on but after that it disappates and does not linger on my hair. It is imperceptible as a styling product ie. it looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t feel icky or goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  It provides just a little bit of ability to style my hair, but nothing like the power of using a really goopy product. It doesn&#x27;t give my hair (which is dull) any extra shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a fine product if you have the right expectation. The product description says it removes tangles. It&#x27;s also useful as kind of like a styling product \\&quot;lite\\&quot; and to be used when you don&#x27;t want a heavy product in your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is softer and more touch- up friendly.  It does weigh my hair down a little</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I am so picky about what I put in my hair and this stuff is really good!  Doesnt make it sticky or anything!  I never ever let the bottle get empty!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Bumble &amp; Bumble products and am very satisfied with Prep. It untangles my fine, mid-length hair without weighing it down. My hair also seems less dry since I began using it. I use Prep first and then add Bumble and Bumble Styling Cream for light hold and good volume.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  At first I thought all I needed was the other products I use.  I mean what does a hair product really do to prep the hair? to get ready for the other products?  I thought is was just going to weight down my hair with too much product, and I am very sensitive to the feel of that.  I have fine hair, enough of it, it&#x27;s not thin, but it shows very quickly if I use too much product.  Well, the verdict is in and it&#x27;s practically as though if I had to get only one product, it would be this.  Having wavy hair, too, my hair tangles easily, so much so I comb through in the shower with conditioner just to not have to go through that. My mother cut my hair into a pixie from it&#x27;s long red waves; that will tell you something.  With this product, I have no problem with tangles, overly weighed down hair, goopy or stickiness, and overall it does seems to balance the ph of the hair so it accepts and distributes product.  I&#x27;ll tell you this, it does what it says it does.  I like that about these products.  They are pricey, but really not, because they do what they say they will do, and you won&#x27;t  have full bottles just sitting there because they just did not work out. Bravo Bumble and Bumble..  I did not buy mine on Amazon, however, I buy directly from B &amp; B.  I like the free gifts and shipping, etc. Enjoy your hair.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairdresser and greatly discounted on Amazon.  Makes hair behave.</li>
    <li> This is another one of those items you just can&#x27;t find a cheaper replacement for. I tried numerouds other brands and the were either to heavy, no hold, oily, or something else. BB just does it all better. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive. I guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Wash your hair, towel dry and spray on Bumble and Bumble Prep before you blow dry, curl, flat iron or just spray it on as a leave in conditioner on wet hair and just let hair dry naturally to give your fine, fragile, thin, colored etc. hair extra conditioning on days your hair needs a rest from all the hair styling tools.</li>
