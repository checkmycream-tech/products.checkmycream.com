      <li>It arrived it arrived on time, which pleased both of us.  </li>
      <li>Its a great product and very helpful.</li>

      <li>Other than that pretty happy.</li>
      <li>I can only place 4 pills in container, but overall a great way to carry in pocket and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Worked good for my Mom&#x27;s Rx when I set-up her pills when she began to get forgetful as to whether she&#x27;d taken her pills that day or not.</li>
      <li>I mark the days of the week for my forgetful loved one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this pill organizer/dispenser/planner for anyone who wants a safe, reliable way to store up to a week&#x27;s worth of medicine and/or vitamins.</li>
      <li>I also use one for a month&#x27;s worth of pills taken first thing in AM.  </li>
      <li>I am able to set up 2 months of my medications and see at a glance which ones I need to take on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although some say that more than one compartment opens too easily when you only want to open just one compartment; I rarely if ever have that problem with this product.</li>
      <li>If a compartment does just happen to open, it sure beats trying to pick up a week&#x27;s worth of meds from the golf course and put them back in the right compartments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As of 2009, after 4 years of testing, I continue to prefer the LARGE Medi-Chest.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a nifty organizer.</li>
      <li>So much for their effort and concern.  </li>
      <li>After several conversation with family members, it was decided that I should search on line to see what was available.  </li>
      <li>I was also surprise that there were various sizes, colors, types of containers available.  </li>
      <li>Very large individual spaces that can hold large medications and vitamins.</li>
      <li>While I liked the overall size of the product, the compartments were not deep enough to hold all of my scheduled prescriptions.  </li>
      <li>Nothing has broken on any of the 5 units and the removable daily case is great for making day trips or going out hunting, fishing, canoing, or golfing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Someone from the company did email me saying they wanted to know if there was anything they could do to get a 5 star rating, but then after I responded by saying I would be interested in a dispenser with larger compartments I never heard another word from the company.  </li>
      <li>as importantly, I can carry my plethora of cardiac, kidney, prostate and arthritis medications in one daily container when I go golfing, fishing, hunting or canoing.</li>
      <li>If this is true in your case, you may want a pill organizer with larger individual compartments than there are in this product.</li>
      <li>Always before I had ordered the dispenser that has the clear compartments if any of you know which one I am talking about.  </li>
      <li>far, thank goodness,</li>
      <li>Some people have to take several large pills and/or vitamins at the same time of the day.</li>
      <li>Good construction, but a bit difficult to remove individual day tray for access, cleaning, or separate use.  </li>
      <li>I typically leave it lying flat on my night table; I never have to open any one section with so much effort that other sections would also open and let more pills out by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was always searching on various pharmacy and was surprised that there was no replacement for the type I had.  </li>

    <li> This pill organizer makes it easier for me to take my medications without missing any. I am able to set up 2 months of my medications and see at a glance which ones I need to take on a daily basis. This way I NEVER forget to take my meds.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a pill organizer that was like one I already have I found out it is not as good as the one I have. A whole section lifts out when I try to open just one part, and then it is hard to get back in place tightly.  I will not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I know the picture says \\&quot;Actual product color may vary\\&quot;, but the website shows a translucent blue box and the one I got was opaque white -- meaning you can&#x27;t see whether there&#x27;s a pill inside a compartment without opening it.</li>
    <li> Good construction, but a bit difficult to remove individual day tray for access, cleaning, or separate use.  When you order these the seller does not allow you to select color.  One pill box was opaque white plastic, which means that you can&#x27;t see what is in the compartments.  The other colors are transluscent so you don&#x27;t have to open each compartment to ensure that you haven&#x27;t missed a dose.  Price o.k. for size and design.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for one of my weekly container that I received when I had kidney transplant.  After seven months of taking several anti-rejection medication a day, I misplaced one of my container.  I tried to used one of the other day twice to compensate for the one I lost.  I was always searching on various pharmacy and was surprised that there was no replacement for the type I had.  After several conversation with family members, it was decided that I should search on line to see what was available.  I was also surprise that there were various sizes, colors, types of containers available.  I like it that the container is smaller and not as bulky as my other ones.  I am very satisfied with my Apex 7-day pill container.  Thank you, J.</li>
    <li> The medi-chest is a perfect size for me being a transplant patient.  However, I am not sure how long it will last as the lids seem a little cheap and we will see if the hinges dont break?  Other than that pretty happy.</li>
    <li> this organizer is perfect: easy to organize the pills plus removable sections for each day;  does the job.  only one i&#x27;ve found that actually is usable.</li>
    <li> It arrived it arrived on time, which pleased both of us.  However, it was small than we anticipated and will not hold the large amount of pills I have to take.    I WANT TO RETURN THIS FOR A REFUND SO THAT I CAN ORDER A MEDICATION BOX FROM THE SAM COMPANY.  ONE THAT IS CONSIDERABLY LARGER,</li>
    <li> Its a great product and very helpful. I can only place 4 pills in container, but overall a great way to carry in pocket and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The size is great, but the ones I already had were labelled with the specific days.</li>
    <li> This product is great!!! I not only take quite a bit of med but at all different times throughout the day and evening.  I also travel quite a lot.  I ordered three and I&#x27;m good to go for 3 weeks and never miss a pill.  Great product and shipped quick as lightening.  Thanks for a nifty organizer.</li>
    <li> Holds a good amt of pills without being overly large.  I mark the days of the week for my forgetful loved one.  Only problem is she loses the entire day sometimes.  I wish I could buy single day replacements.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000LQGDDG Medi-Chest - Pill Organizer Dispenser Planner by Apex Healthcare Products]]    While I liked the overall size of the product, the compartments were not deep enough to hold all of my scheduled prescriptions.  had I known this prior to ordering I would have considered a different dispenser.  If the compartments had been a little bit deeper it would have been perfect.  Aside from this the product is fine.  Someone from the company did email me saying they wanted to know if there was anything they could do to get a 5 star rating, but then after I responded by saying I would be interested in a dispenser with larger compartments I never heard another word from the company.  So much for their effort and concern.  It might be fine for some, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my needs.  Since the Morning compartment will not hold all of my pills I end up storing some of them in the Evening compartment and then have to try and remember to take them out of the Evening compartment to take with the Morning pills.  Always before I had ordered the dispenser that has the clear compartments if any of you know which one I am talking about.  I guess I will end up buying that one next time, but I will try to make do with this one for a while.  Hope this gives you some understanding of the product.  The review is not meant to be mean in spirit, but simply to let you know that it did not meet my need(s).</li>
    <li> These are so handy for sorting out morning and evening pills in one box and the mid-day pills in a separate box located in an area where they can be remembered.  I also use one for a month&#x27;s worth of pills taken first thing in AM.  I like the versatility of these boxes.</li>
    <li> Apex Healthcare Products makes a very good pill organizer that comes in quite handy for me. Unfortunately, because of multiple health problems I have to take seven types of prescription medications daily; and sometimes when I&#x27;m not feeling well I can accidentally forget if I&#x27;ve taken my pills or not. This product allows me to place all of my pills in their individual compartments within the organizer so I won&#x27;t forget to take them. It also helps me remember whether or not I&#x27;ve taken my pills. This is especially useful to me as every once in a while I can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve taken my bedtime medications or not; and an accidental overdose of these is potentially quite dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some say that more than one compartment opens too easily when you only want to open just one compartment; I rarely if ever have that problem with this product. I typically leave it lying flat on my night table; I never have to open any one section with so much effort that other sections would also open and let more pills out by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, thank goodness, I don&#x27;t need to use the noontime and the evening pill containers; but if I ever did they would be a great help to me. I&#x27;m sure that people who need to take medicine or vitamins at these times of the day will find these containers quite useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you can remove any of the seven day planners and carry it with you if you need to travel for just one day. Although I haven&#x27;t used it this way very often, it&#x27;s still good to know that I can. Another plus is that each compartment has Braille markings on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one possible negative that I must mention. Some people have to take several large pills and/or vitamins at the same time of the day. If this is true in your case, you may want a pill organizer with larger individual compartments than there are in this product. Look at the measurements for the individual compartments to determine if their size will be sufficient for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this pill organizer/dispenser/planner for anyone who wants a safe, reliable way to store up to a week&#x27;s worth of medicine and/or vitamins. In addition, people can use this to remind themselves of whether or not they took their medicine; and that&#x27;s important.his pill organizer/dispenser/planner for anyone who wants a safe, reliable way to store up to a week&#x27;s worth of medicine and/or vitamins.

    <li> These are excellent. Very large individual spaces that can hold large medications and vitamins. I fill this once for TWO WEEKS and works great. My wife and I each use one of these for AM and PM meds. So far they have been durable, functional and extremely helpful. They appear to be well built.</li>
    <li> actually, the item is too small for my pill schedule. item is now in storage.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Unavailable in the UK. A must for anybody who has elderly relatives and it is available in 3 colours if you have more than one person in the household to care for.</li>
    <li> As of 2009, after 4 years of testing, I continue to prefer the LARGE Medi-Chest.  Nothing has broken on any of the 5 units and the removable daily case is great for making day trips or going out hunting, fishing, canoing, or golfing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have met the test! They still snap shut tightly and no compartments have lost their tops due to stress fatigue from opening and closing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as importantly, I can carry my plethora of cardiac, kidney, prostate and arthritis medications in one daily container when I go golfing, fishing, hunting or canoing. If a compartment does just happen to open, it sure beats trying to pick up a week&#x27;s worth of meds from the golf course and put them back in the right compartments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2009 NOTE:  I ordered two more units FROM AMAZON so we can travel more than a month at a time.</li>
    <li> Worked good for my Mom&#x27;s Rx when I set-up her pills when she began to get forgetful as to whether she&#x27;d taken her pills that day or not.</li>
    <li> This pill organizer and dispenser is very nice.  The markings are clear and there are a lot of ways to organize your pills giving nearly anyone every opportunity to come up with the perfect schedule, no matter how many  pills you take.  They seem sturdy and well made.  My only problem with it that the lids on each of the pill compartments can be difficult to open at times.  This can be a pain when filling the compartments for the week with all the opening and closing.  Even for me, with strong fingers, it got to be uncomfortable to do.  I suppose this means each compartment is sturdy and tight, but I feel like it should be easier to open.</li>
