<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the 3rd box of lashes I&#x27;ve purchased off of Amazon all different brands. These are the best all lashes are perfect. The other two boxes about a quarter of the lashes were miss shaped and unussble. I will be reordering these again :-)</li>
    <li> I love them! My package came on time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;I have already worn 3 different pairs of lashes and they looked great!</li>
    <li> These are amazing quality! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! Will definitely buy again if I ever run out!</li>
    <li> When I got them in the mail, I felt like a kid on Christmas day. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them on. I have been wearing false lashes for years, so I had no problem applying them. I especially loved the fact it came with an application tool, I don&#x27;t understand how I ever lived without this tool. The lashes were beautiful and I would recommend them to any one who wants beautiful quality lashes.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I bought something similar probably 1 year ago, and what a like about these ones is they have different styles eyelashes, so I can be ready for valentines day, I really liked!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Was so excited to check these out when they came in!! Better than expected!! Can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
    <li> You get such a good variety of lashes and they are pretty good quality, they shipped extremely fast (it only took 2 days) and I love them! If your thinking about buying these I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great deal ! Love the variety of styles. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Works alright, as the first two sets are pretty good they are natural, now the other 50 pairs are really thick and I do not plan on using them as it would look very un- natural. Unless you do cosplay or photography or really love the thick ones, I would not buy the whole set.</li>
    <li> Love,love these! will purchase again and again. A couple styles are over the top but 4 out of the six are perfect for everyday.</li>
    <li> Very good! Lov them all!</li>
    <li> Love the lashes ! (: great variety and fast shipping. Very satisfied thank you</li>
    <li> These are great!  I love all the variety and options.  Sometimes I want fuller lashes and sometimes I want something simple.  It has all the looks in every range so you can find the perfect lash for the day or night.  I will definitely be ordering these again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love it, everyone at home love it, I use it many times, not heavy , easy to be used and removed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> since I receive this false eyelashes I only use it one time and don&#x27;t know what to do with it! I don&#x27;t like it! it&#x27;s so cheap! I will never buy it again!</li>
    <li> We are very happy with the quality. I would have preferred more natural lashes then dramatic, but still a great selection for the price!</li>
    <li> Very good assortment - perfect!!!</li>
    <li> These lashes are easy to apply and to wear, However,  I do wish more of the lashes were thicker rather than thinner. I double up on the thinner ones.</li>
    <li> Love these Lashes. Can&#x27;t beat the price !</li>
    <li> My lashes came in three days sooner than the ETA, I love these lashes. I can cut one strip in half and use it for both my eyes, there&#x27;s only one style I can&#x27;t do that with, but, it&#x27;s no big deal. When they came in I was pleased to know they were synthetic, synthetic are easier to clean and they keep their shape better. Only complaint is TAOindustry didn&#x27;t mention this in their description(or at least I didn&#x27;t see it anywhere) and the box came a bit beat up, but the lashes were fine on the inside and that&#x27;s all that really mattered to me. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with these lashes, when I&#x27;m in need of more lashes, I&#x27;ll definitely order again; can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.</li>
    <li> Superfast Delivery, great variety, nice price.  the lashes aren&#x27;t human, so don&#x27;t expect them to bend and apply easily, but the price is right and the lashes are suitable for daily users on a budget</li>
    <li> Loved every thing about it, fast shipping, product was accurate to description...</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Got a few compliments from friends, I love my lashes \\&quot; . These lashes are just so wonderful and cool</li>
    <li> A lil stiff but still manageable. For the price it is well worth the purchase. If your not use to wearing falsies then you&#x27;d have a rough time with them. The thickest set held up through the 4th of July festivities, not my normal set i&#x27;d wear (normal-medium volume). I will buy again soon. :)</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes! I&#x27;m new to eyelashes and for the first hr or so I can feel them but after that I do not feel them. You have to have the right adhesive though I used duo but I started using revlon the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5* is because the bands are thick some more then others but for price and delivery time awesome.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!!! I thought there were lashes that I didn&#x27;t care for but turns out I love them ALL. In fact I bought another set!!!... I&#x27;m a beginner with wearing false eyelashes and this box gave me a lot of experience with wearing them and becoming a pro applying them. Great deal for a great price. Delivery was great As well.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on and they stay on until you take them off</li>
    <li> This 70 pair pack of false eyelashes is great. I&#x27;m not the best at applying these so its awesome for practice. BUT if you&#x27;re a pro, this is a very cheap set. Theres several different styles from natural to outgoing to flashy. They are soft and flexible. It comes with an application tool but not eyelash glue.</li>
    <li> Some are good but they don&#x27;t bend well or stay on. If your eyelid isn&#x27;t very round you should be fine but I have big round eyes and so it came off my corners pretty easily. They look and feel fairly plastic like. I likely won&#x27;t be using any more from my box unless its for Halloween or a really dark club.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great combinations.  Some look very natural.  Some are very full, they look like mascara advertisements. They are not clownish.</li>
    <li> They werr too hard on the eyes.</li>
    <li> Whenever I try to put it on, one side will pop up when I get the other side to go on. When I get that side to go down, the side I originally had down would go up. I&#x27;m a beginner and thought that this would be good for practice but I&#x27;m having more trouble with this than I would with regular lashes that require glue.</li>
    <li> fake looking, not everyday wear.</li>
    <li> She loves the selection to have with this set. Great price also.</li>
    <li> If I could give it 10 stars I would.  It did take about 2 weeks to arrive but they are what they describe and look great and a fraction of a cost of lash extensions, which I have had.  My lash extensions were proving to be very pricey, so false lashes seemed like a great option and I could not be happier.  They are an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Love my product great shipping.</li>
    <li> These are such a great deal, and even the more &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; lashes are pretty wearable, though I wouldn&#x27;t call them office friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these four stars because I think they&#x27;re awesome for the price, but some of the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lashes did fall apart when removing them from their tray. The band is just glued on, and it slips right off, leaving the individual lashes stuck in the glue. I&#x27;ve lost a handful of lashes that way, but I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting amazing lashes for what I paid. I got these to practice applying falsies and get comfortable wearing them, and they&#x27;re great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten multiple wears out of the pairs that haven&#x27;t fallen apart upon removal, and even after 4-5 wears, the lashes are almost like new. I clean them using an oil-free makeup remover, set them back on their trays, and store everything in a little cardboard box (not the one they came in, it&#x27;s very flimsy).</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Happy with most style . Some are a little to full for me.  For the price I will buy again even if I don&#x27;t use all.</li>
    <li> I really do like these eyelash sets! They are easy to apply and you have multiple pairs of one! However, some of the same pairs were made more sloppy than others.. And the pairs range from thin eye lashes to thick ones. I do not wear the thick ones at all though. Besides that, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these lashes omg they are amazing I&#x27;m so excited to try them out and the tool to apply the lashes is a big help I definitely will buy again :)</li>
    <li> Just so new to false lashes but even now I think they are great for learning!!! LOVE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;Tried them on for a date and they were great! Looked really nice! Not bulky at the band where it&#x27;s complicated to put them on, just some glue and the application tool and GOOD TO GO!!!</li>
    <li> YES! Finally, I found somewhere to buy my falsies in bulk! ;) These are fantastic, I am pleasantly surprised to say the least. I love that they come in a variety of shapes and sizes. There&#x27;s some lashes that are BAM! In your face lashes, and some that are natural. Which is perfect because I like to switch things up, depending on my mood, outfit, the weather etc. ;) I agree with some of the previous posters that they are a tad stiff when you first take them out of the package. But all you have to do it just bend them and fidget with them a bit and they&#x27;ll ready to go! I really like the applicator too! I was using a plastic one from Ardell but this one is more sturdy and works very nicely. I&#x27;ve been using my Ardell Lash Adhesive, which has been working just fine. Eventually, I&#x27;ll probably order some Duo, like some other posters mentioned. Overall, I am 100% satisfied and I will be buying again in the future! Oh and they also shipped really quick! Bonus! :)</li>
    <li> did not like. Could not apply these lashes ...the track that it is on is not like regular lashes. A friend tried a pair and did not have a problem however. Giving them all to her.</li>
    <li> Just love them and they last a long time.i even gave some to my sister inlaw</li>
    <li> I Love these lashes!!! I am an olderwoman with very short and sparse lashes. These are easy to put on last for about 3 days I Sleep in them and can reapply glue twice. I have tried 4 styles so far and not disapointed yet!</li>
    <li> Natural looking, great quality. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchase reccomend to all that are reading this.</li>
    <li> These lashes are amazing!! They come with so many unique styles that are for night &amp; day time. TAO industry I give you 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> These are excellent!  I purchase them for our large scale musicals.  They are cheap enough to use a new pair each night but good enough to last a couple applications.</li>
    <li> I had great fun with the eyelashes.  They came with some adhesive so I could bundle them to make them super thick but I needed the Xtra tube to attach them to my eyes even singularly.  Worth every penny I spent on them. I loved not having to  have to  apply mascara!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping , love the lashes but when I put the duo white to clear  eyelash glue it stays white on the eyelash</li>
    <li> Decent. I buy more expensive ones for special occasions since I don&#x27;t find these very bold, but these are great for day to day use!</li>
    <li> On time and loved them!</li>
    <li> A girl that loves lashes this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;They are synthetic and you gotta work with them a little but for the price this is a absolute steal! And the free gift helps alot!</li>
    <li> These are low quality lashes. Don&#x27;t know what I expected with 70 pairs, honestly. They&#x27;re wearable, though.</li>
    <li> really love these lashes.  If you are looking for super realistic this is not the purchase for you.  But if you are on stage or in costume and really need dark full lashes that show up well on camera then this is what you want!</li>
    <li> I really have not used any yet, but I am happy with what I received. A lot of different lashes to choose from. The packaging is excellent. I like how they come neatly in the perfect box. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like them a lot!  At first I was not happy.  But I kept using them. You just need to keep trying. And now i love them. They were sticky so i would first grab a little coconut oil on a qtip and rubbed off the sticky sticky stuff. And now its so much easier!  Works great for clients as well!</li>
    <li> Great lashes!!! So real looking. Can&#x27;t beat the price for 70 pair. I love, love, love them!!</li>
    <li> one of the best eyelashes i ever owned.. rich amount for a great price..&lt;br /&gt;the seller is so cooperative n fast in shipping&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend each girl to have this in her collection</li>
    <li> Love the item.  Careful when pilling out the lashes as they are pre-glued and you may want to re-glue them.  Other than that they are fun and the price make it easy to dispose of without remorse.  Plenty of lashes to last the year.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Perfect for those who are trying to learn how to put on false lashes.  Quality wise, they are pretty good.</li>
    <li> With this many eyelashes it is a great deal for a beginner like me.  I wasted maybe 4 before getting the hang of application and I still have the rest of the box to go through!  I&#x27;m going to have to have an eyelash party or something.&lt;br /&gt;They stayed put through a wedding and a reception.  Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or look monstrously fake. Thank god for the applicator!  You don&#x27;t realize how hard it is when your fingers are in the way!</li>
    <li> Perfect timing great lashes only complaint I have is they don&#x27;t hold their shape super well but it&#x27;s fixable</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t accord with asian eyes as me :(</li>
    <li> plenty of differant styles included here. there are only two sheets of lashes i probably will not use, but less than a doller a pair, you cant beat that. they came with a lash applicator. quick shipping</li>
    <li> I was impressed by these false eyelashes. I am constantly wearing them and needed a bulk order.</li>
    <li> so bad quality can&#x27;t use i have to throw away all</li>
    <li> Wow. Came very fast and the eyelashes were high quality.</li>
    <li> love this product and was blown away by the lightening speed that it arrived like the next day don&#x27;t know how they did it but thank so much!  these are fantastic</li>
    <li> These are great for price, and shipping was fast. I&#x27;m new to false lashes so to have many to choose from and try is great</li>
    <li> I have to say at first i was upset with these lashes. I felt like they where plasticity and to fake looking, But after messing with them i fell in love! Guess i was just so use to my really thin strip lashes but change is good. I will definitely will be buying again. Plus they came with an eyelash applicator as a free gift!</li>
    <li> Great ! Having alot of fun with them .</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it.  For  the price, you just cant beat it.  She pays $3.00 a pair so this is a real steal!!</li>
    <li> These lashes almost feel plastic to me.  They are kind of heavy after I get them on, but maybe I am spoiled by the lashes I am used to using.  Out of the 70, I will probably only be able to use 20, because so many sheets are so full and heavy  Maybe I can wear them for Halloween or something.</li>
    <li> Really great quality and I love how there&#x27;s different styles for different looks! Loveeee it, def worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I will order these lashes again☺</li>
    <li> these are garbage. first they as like gluing wire to your eye lids. so uncomfortable. I thought I could get by with just wearing a couple of hours. but no way !! they are plastic shiny looking on and not anyway natural.  save your money. these would not even be good for Halloween.  junk and waste of money and time ordering.</li>
    <li> Love them.... I have so many for a great price. Good quality as well.</li>
    <li> LOVE these lashes! I will continue to buy these from now on.</li>
    <li> great lashes!! Love it. highly recommend an shipping was faster than actual delivery date.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! Will buy again! They are great quality and they do not look cheap. As a makeup artist, I love the variety I can offer to my clients. Thank you!</li>
    <li> SO many eyelashes for such a great price. Strip is extremely thin so that tool they include is very helpful. Half the lashes are great for an everyday spruce up, half get a bit drag queeny, but I dont mind that lol there&#x27;s a time and place for everything, and who doesn&#x27;t own scissors if it&#x27;s that big a deal. Plus, extra points for great customer service. They  emailed repeatedly to make sure I was satisfied with my order. I didn&#x27;t reply because I was haha, so I&#x27;m writing a review instead.</li>
    <li> 2 of the styles look very similar with other 2 styles.. SO I would say I got 5 styles in the 70 pairs. Still. A very good deal. They look very good.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchasing this item. Diffrent styles from natural to extreme. In love honestly. I was hoping my mom wouldnt see them but she did now she wants to wear them xD thanks!! :]</li>
