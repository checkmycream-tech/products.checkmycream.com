      <li>Great idea.  </li>
      <li>Very nice concept.  </li>
      <li>I loved the idea of this product, but after one use, I threw it in the trash.  </li>
      <li>Glad I found these at Amazon!  </li>
      <li>I ended up throwing them away because it didn&#x27;t feel nice on my skin.</li>
      <li>They are better than not having them though.</li>
      <li>I went and bought cheaper, better quality ones at walmart.</li>
      <li>Wish I could get more than one at a time, though.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 of these soap savers and at first I loved them.  </li>
      <li>Also didn&#x27;t really get a good lather using these.</li>
      <li>To that end, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>cheap quality item</li>
      <li>I love this style of loofah pouch but these ones are cheap and wear out fast.  </li>

      <li>I have used mine twice and it is showing more wear than normal on the back/scrubbing side.</li>

      <li>Smart invention.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a fill in stocking stuffer and didn&#x27;t think much about it.</li>
      <li>The loofah is nice, but seems like it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>It is very convenient and the shower soap is lasting much longer than normal.</li>
      <li>It worked well the first month that I had it, but the scrubber side started to wear away a month from daily use.</li>
      <li>I used to only find these at Walmart, but now their stock is not so consistent.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of using an entire bar of soap, without wasting the little pieces when it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a great solution and was sold on the Loofah feature specifically; however, it was the Loofah feature that was the biggest disappointment.</li>
      <li>Completely destroyed after four months.</li>
      <li>Very poorly made but for the two washes it was good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the wear-ability as it seems to already showing wear but the price was certainly worth it!</li>
      <li>We only used them for two showers and the soap was nearly wearing through the material.</li>
      <li>Great idea just not very well thought out and bad manufacturing maybe a redesign, different fabric.</li>

    <li> Unfortunately the loop that helps hold the soap in the pouch broke the very first time I used it. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased these for stocking stuffers. The quality is about what you&#x27;d expect for the price. They do help to make use the tiny bits of soap that usually get thrown away.  The loofah is nice, but seems like it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I used to only find these at Walmart, but now their stock is not so consistent.  Glad I found these at Amazon!  Wish I could get more than one at a time, though.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these soap savers and at first I loved them.  Unfortunately, they wore out in a matter of weeks.  The same side on each of them didn&#x27;t make it through a week of showers/baths.  The material pulls apart and the soap falls out.  The idea is great but the product leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it!! These fall apart after just one use. I usually buy these from Walmart but they were out of stock at every location in my area at the time. I use these strictly to remove anti-perspirant/deodorant build-up from my underarms. The ones they sell at Walmart last me for months at a time before I have to replace. I just ended up waiting for Walmart to restock and bought a bunch of them so that I don&#x27;t run out again. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> It worked well the first month that I had it, but the scrubber side started to wear away a month from daily use. Completely destroyed after four months.</li>
    <li> These are VERY rough. I ended up throwing them away because it didn&#x27;t feel nice on my skin. Also didn&#x27;t really get a good lather using these.</li>
    <li> Is a great loofah body poouch scribber polisher.. works great in the shower, will deff. purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband who still likes to use a soap bar instead of liquid.  He loves them and now is able to use the soap to the very end.  Smart invention.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of using an entire bar of soap, without wasting the little pieces when it&#x27;s nearly gone. I thought this would be a great solution and was sold on the Loofah feature specifically; however, it was the Loofah feature that was the biggest disappointment. After only one use, the Loofah has fallen apart.</li>
    <li> Purchased for travel. Very nice concept.  It fell apart after first use -material stuck to bar of soap.</li>
    <li> Product description said various colors and I got all of one color.</li>
    <li> Flat out junk and a rip off! Didn&#x27;t last 3 weeks before falling apart!</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this product, but after one use, I threw it in the trash.  Not really a loofah, just fabric.  And there was no way to hold the soap in.  At least have a draw string so it stays put.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great idea, it started to fall apart after 5-6 uses.</li>
    <li> Lasted for about three weeks. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item. One side is really thin and mine got a big hole in no time.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a fill in stocking stuffer and didn&#x27;t think much about it. My husband got one and I find myself stealing in every time I take a shower. It is very convenient and the shower soap is lasting much longer than normal. I&#x27;m not sure about the wear-ability as it seems to already showing wear but the price was certainly worth it!</li>
    <li> I give it an extra star because it&#x27;s a neat idea, but it falls apart immediately. I like to keep my soap in a holder and use it as a scrubber, and it works for that. The wear and tear was immediate and when I tried to peel off a piece of soap from the scrubby side, a big chunk of material came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it held together, it&#x27;d be great.</li>
    <li> These are great for the first few washes, but then they start to fall apart. I had bought 12 of them. Oh well.</li>
    <li> This item Fell apart within a month of using&lt;br /&gt;I Would not purchase this product again&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap quality item</li>
    <li> This product disintegrated after the first use, huge hole in fabric. This is a complete waste of your valuable money. Avoid like the Ebola plague.</li>
    <li> The idea of this item is great however after two washes it falls apart. Very poorly made but for the two washes it was good</li>
    <li> I love this style of loofah pouch but these ones are cheap and wear out fast.  They are better than not having them though. I went and bought cheaper, better quality ones at walmart.</li>
    <li> We only used them for two showers and the soap was nearly wearing through the material. This item is clearly not going to last much longer and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got this for my kiddo to help cut down on the wasted soap. To that end, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Not very durable. Fell apart after one use. Great idea just not very well thought out and bad manufacturing maybe a redesign, different fabric. Needs something sturdier!</li>
    <li> Great idea.  I have used mine twice and it is showing more wear than normal on the back/scrubbing side. I did not have any issue getting lather but I do not think this product will last as long as the bar of soap will.  No one else uses my bathroom so I know it only from my usage.  I am disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
