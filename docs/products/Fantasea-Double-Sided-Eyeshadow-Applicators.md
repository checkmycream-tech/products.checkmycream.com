      <li>They are much more sturdy than they appear in the picture, and work very well at applying eye shadows.</li>

      <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what you&#x27;d expect -- double sided applicator brushes that work great &amp; don&#x27;t wear out fast.</li>

      <li>Don&#x60;t laugh they work.</li>
      <li>The length of the applicators are great, however the sponge material used is very rough and doesn&#x27;t hold onto eyeshadow pigment very well.  </li>
      <li>The black is much more forgiving than white for removal of not so attractive blemishes, etc.  </li>
      <li>I wish these were shorter so they would fit in a normal eyeshadow box to replace the one that came with the set.</li>
      <li>The BEST thing about these applicators is that the spongy tips don&#x27;t come off after only a few uses like all of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>They are inexpensive for a reason, quite cheaply made, the foam covering is not very thick</li>
      <li>a rough kind</li>
      <li>I like the price and how fast I received it,but the brush is not soft at all ,it kind of scraps your eyes as you apply the color</li>
      <li>The different shape on either end gives more control for varied appearances in color combinations.</li>
      <li>These works pretty well</li>
      <li>The applicators are exactly what you&#x27;d expect, but my preference is for brushes.</li>
      <li>I wish the smaller pointed one was a bit more padded, but</li>
      <li>For gun cleaning they are ok except for the above.</li>
      <li>(Had purchased another brand for more money at a local store and the the tips would detach all the time!)</li>
      <li>But I will certainly purchase more in the future!</li>
      <li>And this brand is pretty decent!</li>
      <li>Price is right and the quality is better than we had expected.</li>
      <li>I do wish the large tips were a bit softer, but perhaps if they were, they wouldn&#x27;t hold the eye shadow as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty snobby about my makeup and really prefer high end products.</li>
      <li>- gently.  </li>
      <li>Thanks anyways.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used too much.</li>
      <li>But I really needed it for blending, which as I stated doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for these applicators.</li>
      <li>and I am one of those people who doesn&#x27;t really like using brushes for eye shadow.</li>
      <li>These last longer than others, simply because of how many uses you get from one.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good Product.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for my party makeup samples. No sharing of wands and eliminates cross contamination of products.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smooth application of eye shadows</li>
    <li> You get a lifetime supply of these but they are very nice, especially for the price - two ends on each stick, one long, thin and tapered, the other your standard foam applicator.  Love these!</li>
    <li> Product came as advertised and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye shadow applicators. Very economical in this large pak. Also a favorite cat toy of one of our felines so they are multi-purpose😜</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s are very good applicators. Love the size. Larger and longer than the regular one&#x27;s in eyeshadow cases. You get quite a few. If you have old eyeshadow applicators. There will do the trick for replacements or just having extra!</li>
    <li> These really are quite excellent, better than anything in Australia. The price is very good! I&#x27;ve used better when purchased with more elite products</li>
    <li> These are not good applicators. You do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for art purposes. They work fine for me and I would recommend this product and buyer.</li>
    <li> These are ridiculous, the sponge is so thin you can feel plastic underneath it rubbing against your eye. But company delivered on time packaging was great etc.,</li>
    <li> I have looked in retail stores, drug stores, and on line for quality eyeshadow applicators for many months.  The Fantasea Double-sided applicators are very nice.  They are sturdy, the padded applicator is securely affixed to the post, and they hold the shadows well.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product. The only con I can think of is that they could be a little longer with larger application heads, but they do fit nicely in my cosmetic bag as is.</li>
    <li> The plastic scratches my eyelids and doesn&#x27;t apply the shadow well. I do not recommend these. I am still shopping.</li>
    <li> I am working on wearing more eyeshadow and I found this to be a conven. way to apply for a beginner without investing in all these brushes.  ALso I used one side for each color then used my brush for \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; the color out.  THis is a good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> They are inexpensive for a reason, quite cheaply made, the foam covering is not very thick and I can feel the plastic inside it, and it is sharp.  So instead of using them for applying makeup (because I find it hurts) I use them for removing eye makeup(wetting with makeup remover) - gently.  Couldn&#x27;t return because I opened and used a couple.</li>
    <li> I use these for applying Pearl Ex powders on polymer clay.  The wide tip is good for applying the powders on larger spaces but I really love that the narrow tips are durable enough to let me pick up enough product and get to small detailed areas.  Good quality for art work.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t invested in these years ago, I have used the same old one that came with the eyeshadows all my life and like the idea of changing for clean ones</li>
    <li> These are cheap and easy! Great to have when one has a palette of 50 eye shadow colors.  Exactly what I expected.  Would recommend to anyone for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I am a former makeup artist and super picky about all products including eyeshadow applicators.  I had been searching local stores for an applicator that was thin enough to go into the crease of the eye and couldn&#x27;t find any suitable.  I ordered these and absolutely love them.  They are perfect.</li>
    <li> these are replacement eye shadow brushes.  I wish the smaller pointed one was a bit more padded, but other than that they are great.  I had so many that the ends have come off and I am one of those people who doesn&#x27;t really like using brushes for eye shadow.</li>
    <li> these applicators are a little big but they do the trick.. they are also a little stiff and hard.. but even my powder eye shadow does go on with these..  got a mess of them...</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s just an eyeshadow sponge, I prefer these over an expensive eyeshadow brush any day. And this brand is pretty decent! You get 25 in a generic dark green plastic bag, but the look and feel of the actual product is a bit more sleek and professional. The sponge ends are flexible, soft and porous, to really pick up eyeshadow and blend it in. And I love the all black design! The narrow tip is great for eyelining and detailing. Both ends can be wiped clean on a dry paper towel so that you can use one applicator with different colors (the sponges did not slide off when I tested this). I don&#x27;t know if they are washable, as I usually just use one for the day and throw it away. But I will certainly purchase more in the future!</li>
    <li> I like the price and how fast I received it,but the brush is not soft at all ,it kind of scraps your eyes as you apply the color</li>
    <li> Foam applicator is very light and flimsy. Great for one or two uses, then toss.</li>
    <li> These are okay. Nothing special. Good quantity for the price. I also like the differently sized and shaped tips on each end.</li>
    <li> Got so tired of all the covergirl eyeshadow applicators falling apart half way through the shadow that I ordered these applicators.  Appear much more sturdy and am pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> This came as a huge pack but the brushes are good quality and spread the eye shadow evenly across the eyelids. It doesn&#x27;t cause any caking or clump issues. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Plenty of applicators to last me a long time!  I like the design with a narrow pad on one end and a wide pad on the other.  This allows for more creativity when applying make-up.  They also seem to be well-made (pads not falling off the plastic stick).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problem with them.</li>
    <li> These are so hard, rough, hurts my lids</li>
    <li> What I received wasn&#x27;t exactly is shown on the site, applicator (while double sided) is not the same.</li>
    <li> It does the job. Best eye shadow applicators I have ever used. (but don&#x27;t take my word for the best because I don&#x27;t wear make up too often and I only have ever used a couple other applicators lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only used 3 total. Two for different eye shadows and one for nail polish to get the galaxy design look. Worked well!</li>
    <li> The length of the applicators are great, however the sponge material used is very rough and doesn&#x27;t hold onto eyeshadow pigment very well.  I would not order these again, as I find I&#x27;m destroying my eyeshadow and my eyelids due to the roughness of the sponge.</li>
    <li> I was in need of eyeshadow applicators because my kids loose all the ones that come with the eyeshadows I buy so anyway great product it works great with the eyeshadows</li>
    <li> The BEST thing about these applicators is that the spongy tips don&#x27;t come off after only a few uses like all of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now, and only one applicator has had a lose tip, and it was actually like that when I got it out of the package.  I like the small indention on one side of the large tip.  I do wish the large tips were a bit softer, but perhaps if they were, they wouldn&#x27;t hold the eye shadow as well.  The smaller tip is very flexible, and works well for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative comment ... the package was actually part way open when I received these, and a few of the applicators had spilled out into the box.  Could just be a factory slip-up, but it should have been noticeable by whoever packed the box.  So I&#x27;ll reserve that as a comment against the Amazon warehouse, and will give these another try in the future when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love these applicators.  I had been looking for a good one for quite some time and these are perfect! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Nothing to get too excited about, just good eyeshaow brushes</li>
    <li> These are exactly what you&#x27;d expect -- double sided applicator brushes that work great &amp; don&#x27;t wear out fast. Of course they&#x27;re not the highest quality possible, but for the price you get a good quality brush. They&#x27;re too long to fit in most small compacts, just keep that in mind. But they are double-sided, so you&#x27;d expect them to be long.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for a couple of months now and have yet to have one fall apart on me. Would definitely recommend. (Had purchased another brand for more money at a local store and the the tips would detach all the time!)</li>
    <li> Much more substantial than I realized when I ordered them. In my previous experiences with disposable applicators, the foam is poor quality (begins falling apart during the first usage), and the foam is poorly glued, so some applicators aren&#x27;t usable at all. Plus, if you needed both the pad shape and the definer shape, I&#x27;d have to purchase two separate types of applicators. These have both shapes on a single wand and are substantial enough to use for several applications. I&#x27;ll look for these again when my stash begins to run low!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty snobby about my makeup and really prefer high end products. So I was quite skeptical based on the price of this item, but decided to take a chance anyway. And I&#x27;m really glad I did! They are much more sturdy than they appear in the picture, and work very well at applying eye shadows. I really like that they are double sided for applying a more defined line, or just using for a wide spread over the lid. I will not only purchase these again, but I plan to recommend them to friends.</li>
    <li> Loved your product, but thought it was a quantity of 75, not 25. Thanks anyways. I must have misunderstood what the quantity was. &amp;#34;3 of 25,&amp;#34; I thought added up to 75.</li>
    <li> These are the best ones I have ever bought! I think they are better than what most eyeshadows come with. These applicators are strong and dont break off very easy.  When I run out or eventually break these apart I will only be ordering these from now on!</li>
    <li> These works pretty well, I would buy them again. Foam is a bit thin so you can feel the plastic inside, but I&#x27;ve used much worse.</li>
    <li> These applicators are very hard and are rough when applying eye shadow.  I do not recommend them.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> works fine, for what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> I wish they were a little bit spongier and not so rough, but I do love the shape. Why is this a pointed applicator so hard to find? My mineral eye shadow go on nicely with these.</li>
    <li> Seem to be good quality and better than what is available at the local store</li>
    <li> this product shipped quickly, it was just as discribed and most importantly my friend who i bought them for was over the moon. great product</li>
    <li> Quality was not really good but cheap and useful</li>
    <li> These work as they should and came on time as expected</li>
    <li> these applicators are the worst!  they are very thin and hard.  I used 1 and threw the rest out.  dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife and daughter and they worked out great.  Price is right and the quality is better than we had expected.</li>
    <li> Don&#x60;t laugh they work. They are high quality and don&#x60;t pull off the handles but... If I had to do it over again I would buy the white tip ones. These are great but you can&#x60;t tell when they are dirty and or how dirty. So for makeup I am sure they would be fine. For gun cleaning they are ok except for the above. They work well enough that if I couldn&#x60;t find the white tipped I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> These are just what I wanted. They are big enough to hold on to. The ones in the store were to short!</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money, these could last forever. They are really good quality and i would buy them again in the future.</li>
    <li> I was required to buy eyeshadow applicators for a stage makeup class, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought them at all. The applicators are exactly what you&#x27;d expect, but my preference is for brushes. If you like the sponge-tips, go ahead and get them.</li>
    <li> You can feel the applicator and it&#x27;s very rough on the eyelids, not to mention that it takes three or four tries to get even color on the lids as the applicator has to be packed with makeup to get desirable colors.</li>
    <li> Puts they make up on ok. Haven&#x27;t used too much.</li>
    <li> As a beauty professional, I find these applicators phenomenal.  The black is much more forgiving than white for removal of not so attractive blemishes, etc.  Also having double sided sponges allows me to use it without multiple times on one person, without contaminating my demos.  I can use each side of both ends.  I also like that one end is thinner, allowing for different types of application all in one applicator.  These last longer than others, simply because of how many uses you get from one.  They&#x27;re also made well.  The sponge tips are not too soft, yet not so hard they no longer feel spongy. They&#x27;re not flimsy either.  Well made product.  I will order again if I ever run out.</li>
    <li> I love the double sided applicator with the narrow end. Works well and allows easy coverage in the eye crease.</li>
    <li> These are cheap and plentiful, which is good.  They don&#x27;t fall apart either, also good.  They do, however, feel like you are putting on makeup with sandpaper.  This doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit, but it might bother you!</li>
    <li> Convenient replacements for your favorite eyeshadow applicator.  Better quality and application than the applicator that came with the make up.</li>
    <li> Cheap but I guess I should have expected it for the cost</li>
    <li> I wish these were shorter so they would fit in a normal eyeshadow box to replace the one that came with the set. I have to keep them I. A separate Baggie in my makeup bag and search for the color I am using</li>
    <li> not the best applicators i&#x27;ve ever used, but for the price, they were great. i would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I like the foam double-sided eye shadow applicators.  The different shape on either end gives more control for varied appearances in color combinations.</li>
    <li> Great for lining eyes and applying all over eyeshadow. Perfect product for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I thought the applicators were OK.  Kind of hard.  I don&#x27;t hate them, but I probably won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how many of these came in the pack!  They should last me forever!  My only negative is that the foam tips are thin and the hard plastic pokes through, which doesn&#x27;t feel great when applying your eyeshardow...  Lots of bank for the buck as long as you can tolerate the hard plastic feel when applying....</li>
    <li> Would not order these again. I like that they are two sided, but the sponge&lt;br /&gt;is a rough kind, I like a softer sponge tip for the delicate eye area.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge tip does not come off, but it is not a good quality sponge.</li>
    <li> For the type of quality i would jave rather bought some from the 99 cent store .. I mean 5 dollars for cheap material come on now</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for these applicators. They are not very soft and don&#x27;t blend eyeshadows well. The skinny end is good for using under the eye, brow bone, or to apply just an accent shadow on the base of the eye. But I really needed it for blending, which as I stated doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
