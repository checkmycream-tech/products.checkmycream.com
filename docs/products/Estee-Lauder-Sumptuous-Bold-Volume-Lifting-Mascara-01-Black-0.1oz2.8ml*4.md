      <li>Over all it is a nice product.</li>

      <li>i am post menopausal lady with thinning lashes, this mascara is great, it makes my lashes look full, without clumps of mascara.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>So I really love being able to get these sample sizes.  </li>

      <li>And I am here to report that I was 100 % satisfied with this mascare.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast &amp; works great</li>
      <li>but because of the price I felt okay with buying this.</li>
      <li>It is great to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>(Along with a bunch of other awesome EL products and makeup bag.)</li>
      <li>The mascara is easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>They are easy to carry and to use.  </li>
      <li>It stays all day, but is easy to remove with water or make-up removal wipes.</li>
      <li>I purchased these as AMAZON PRIME item, so felt secure in my order.</li>
      <li>and since I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, I often feel I need to throw out the full size ones before they are used up.  </li>

      <li>But I couldn&#x27;t find the Definicils at a price I was willing to pay and</li>
      <li>I was able to make it last for the three months of summer.</li>
      <li>It only takes two coats to make my eyelashes look fabulous!</li>
      <li>Love Estee Lauder make up, specially this mascara, its long lasting, easy to wash up and doesnt crumble.</li>
      <li>It is easy to wash off with just soap and water, need to put more time into really getting the volume you want, that is why I like the Definicils, you don&#x27;t have to spend that much time on it to get the look you need in half the time.  </li>
      <li>Would rather spent more $ &amp; bought a 100% new bottle straight from Estee Lauder.</li>
      <li>You only need two coats for full lashes.</li>
      <li>I love these small mascaras.  </li>
      <li>These were professionally wrapped and labeled, and from what I can tell they have not expired.</li>
      <li>Mascara was dryer out like it was on old sample.</li>
      <li>The four small tubes allow you to use one at a time, keeping the others fresh and juicy.</li>

    <li> Best Mascara ever!  It only takes two coats to make my eyelashes look fabulous! I have oily skin, so I usually get the black streaks on my eyelids by the afternoon, but not with this.  It stays all day, but is easy to remove with water or make-up removal wipes.</li>
    <li> These were professionally wrapped and labeled, and from what I can tell they have not expired. I hate when you buy mascara at the pharmacy and it is all dried out or smells outdated! These were perfect and I highly recommend. You only need two coats for full lashes.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder Sumptuous Bold Volume Lifting Mascara was the first Estee Lauder beauty product that I have used. And I am here to report that I was 100 % satisfied with this mascare. I typically only purchase drug store brands but because of the price I felt okay with buying this. The wand is thick and catches all of my lashes , one coat is plenty and even in the .1oz I was able to make it last for the three months of summer.</li>
    <li> Love these mascaras! Really give lashes the length I need!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for buying Estee Lauder Azuree perfume. (Along with a bunch of other awesome EL products and makeup bag.) It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as AMAZON PRIME item, so felt secure in my order. These showed up in a zip-lock baggie, were not the same as the picture (blue &amp; gold tubes) &amp; seemed a little dusty. Presentation made me feel a little iffy about using these &amp; where they came from. Would rather spent more $ &amp; bought a 100% new bottle straight from Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> Have used this mascara for a while.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried various different kinds of mascara and this is the one for me. It does not crumble like the others and helps with doing individual eyelash.</li>
    <li> i am post menopausal lady with thinning lashes, this mascara is great, it makes my lashes look full, without clumps of mascara.  i dont even have to comb through them after i apply.</li>
    <li> Mascara was dryer out like it was on old sample.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast &amp; works great</li>
    <li> Best mascara in my book</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. No clumping and gets every lash. I like the set of minis as they come in handy and are a great deal.</li>
    <li> nice works well only have to do it in one stroke</li>
    <li> Great mascara! Much cheaper than buying the full size</li>
    <li> Awesome product at a geat price.</li>
    <li> Love Estee Lauder make up, specially this mascara, its long lasting, easy to wash up and doesnt crumble. Also its a really good deal for this price, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have always worn this expensive mascara.  It is great to find it at a reasonable price. The four small tubes allow you to use one at a time, keeping the others fresh and juicy.</li>
    <li> I love these small mascaras.  They are easy to carry and to use.  The mascara is easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Will order again soon</li>
    <li> I prefer the Lancome Definicils over this one.  But I couldn&#x27;t find the Definicils at a price I was willing to pay and the price on this was very reasonable.  It is easy to wash off with just soap and water, need to put more time into really getting the volume you want, that is why I like the Definicils, you don&#x27;t have to spend that much time on it to get the look you need in half the time.  But this is second best to Lancome.  Over all it is a nice product.</li>
    <li> Mascara is dry and not impressed. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use these religiously. They last a cpl weeks each.. I&#x27;m a mascara. I use lancome mascaras too bit I always come back to these&lt;br /&gt; Two full coats is perfect</li>
    <li> It does not cause irritation (I have problems with flakes getting in my eyes with other mascaras) but it does run on me and I end up with raccoon eyes by midday.</li>
    <li> I like Estee Lauder mascara and since I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, I often feel I need to throw out the full size ones before they are used up.  So I really love being able to get these sample sizes.  Also good value for money.</li>
    <li> This is some good mascara for anyone looking. My wife can only find this one that works for her and does not clump.</li>
