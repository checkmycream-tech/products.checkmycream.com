### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, an excellent value!</li>
      <li>This gift box works perfectly for the teenaged boy in my home.</li>
      <li>someone uses all the products within the set, this really is a good price, and would make a great gift!</li>
      <li>Despite smelling great, Axe Phoenix Gift Box would make a great, affordable gift for the man in your life.  </li>
      <li>This is a great set.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; is really great.</li>
      <li>This is a really great deal.</li>
      <li>I can say is, Axe continues to impress and I was happy with all three products.</li>
      <li>The gift pack is great, I use all three</li>
      <li>This scent would, in my opinion, smell great on a grown man as well.  </li>
      <li>but it smells great</li>
      <li>For $8.73, this is an excellent value for nice smelling/performing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great set.  </li>
      <li>lol - AXE is much more palatable for my wallet!!  </li>
      <li>A very nice gift pack for the person in your life who likes Axe products.</li>
      <li>Very nice perfume smell</li>
      <li>(Good news for the teenagers!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;room killer&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a bit much of a good thing (the AXE scent).</li>
      <li>The deodorant isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
      <li>This says it&#x27;s good for 24 hours, though I prefer the Axe anti-perspirant rated at 48 hours.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good smell that I&#x27;ve been complimented on.</li>
      <li>Ohhhh, this stuff smells good, like really, really GOOD.  </li>
      <li>Phoenix is a great scent that most people should like.</li>
      <li>The cap makes it very safe for travel or inside your sports bag - can never accidentally discharge!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>But all in all, it&#x27;s a good product and has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works as good as any soap, with a nice moisturizing feel.</li>
      <li>The body wash is perfect, lathering up well and leaving just the right amount of residual earthy scent.  </li>
      <li>Nicely boxed, too.  </li>
      <li>Axe Phoenix is a nice gift box for the man in your life.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, all of the products in this set have a nice smell to them.</li>
      <li>Mostly because its priced well and smells good.</li>
      <li>The Axe body spray smells nice, as  you would expect it to, being Axe.  </li>
      <li>the set is a nice way to try the fragrance spray, body wash, and anti-antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for that man in your life and is a great present for birthdays and holidays.</li>
      <li>The Phoenix scent is one of the most popular ones for the AXE.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the fragrance that kind of misses the mark, smelling more like alcohol than the pleasing AXE Phoenix scent.  </li>
      <li>The smell is good and it seems to clean well, but if you have allergies like me, don&#x27;t spray the fragrance in the house.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous rotating cap on the body spray!</li>
      <li>All three scents are almost identical with the body spray providing the most variation,especially if overused.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite things about the spray is how it locks so it can&#x27;t accidentally go off in a drawer and coat</li>
      <li>If it was given to me, I&#x27;d use most of it except for the cologne.</li>
      <li>I like that the three products come in one package, and I’ll say again, this is one of my favorite fragrances to begin with.</li>
      <li>I have had many of these type products shipped to me</li>
      <li>Refreshing Shower Gel</li>
      <li>I like AXE products, most are not overpowering smelling, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
      <li>wish I could write more</li>
      <li>But now I have found a better one.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
      <li>AVE body products are some of the best there is on the market, especially their body wash and deodorant.</li>
      <li>I will buy more.</li>
      <li>As great as it smells, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.</li>
      <li>shower gel lathers easily, and has a very strong scent.  </li>
      <li>The shower gel was very nice, nicely scented and as far as shower gels go, did not leave a slimy feeling film on me like some do.  </li>
      <li>Having said that, I can say that for what this is it is a pretty good deal and if you can get it</li>
      <li>The antiperspirant works as advertised and has a pretty good odor.  </li>
      <li>Quite happy with the antiperspirant; so far I had been using Degree as I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than that.</li>
      <li>It’s a very nice masculine scent that isn’t overpowering and just makes me want to smell it and revel in its wonderfulness.  </li>
      <li>It has a really strong smell though</li>
      <li>Good product overall in a nice set.</li>
      <li>The cologne is a bit too strong, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The strong smell did not bother me, but it may be a factor for some consumers who have allergies to the odor.</li>
      <li>deodorant is fine.</li>
      <li>For some reason this pack contains two deodorants and one shower gel when it would have been more useful to have a shampoo, shower gel and deodorant</li>
      <li>Nice set of Axe products at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>OK, right off the bat</li>
      <li>Axe smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Bodywash specifically is pretty refreshing.  </li>
      <li>The body wash and antiperspirant has a clean, fresh though mild scent that is appealing.  </li>
      <li>Everything that is in the box are items that are used daily and the smell is pleasant; I would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this is an inexpensive bundle, there&#x27;s nothing about the package that screams &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; in terms of special packaging or theme.</li>
      <li>Deodorant stick and fragrance spray are probably more suitable for younger guys.  </li>
      <li>I like that he smells good and his confidence is back up as he was self-conscious about his smell.</li>
      <li>what more could you really ask for.  </li>
      <li>It contains a full sized shower gel, full sized 24-hour deodorant, and a body fragrance.  </li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t really care for the spray, since it&#x27;s much stronger and smells like something more appealing to a teenager.</li>
      <li>This set comes with full sized products.</li>
      <li>We have purchased Axe before and had found that the deodorant/ant-perspirant was not the most effective, this particular scent has been working well so far.  </li>
      <li>, I would buy this kit if it were on super sale.</li>
      <li>shampoo is great stuff and is similar to the AXE body wash that I really, really like.</li>
      <li>There is nothing special to make it a gift box (like a tin, fun inserts, etc.)</li>
      <li>Gel is nice also, but just another Axe bath gel - same as you expect - in terms of suds and moisture and clean feeling after..</li>
      <li>The deodorant, while leaving a pleasant scent, is not as effective at reducing sweat and odor as my go-to product (Mitchum), making it the weak link of the three.  </li>
      <li>Not bad, but the deodorant does not do as good a job for me as other products do in regards to keeping me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A light spray is more than enough to create an effect.  </li>
      <li>Still, my teen gives this set an enthusiastic recommend.</li>
      <li>My teen son was thrilled to receive this set.  </li>
      <li>Nice soft aroma that won&#x27;t gag anyone if you use in reasonable quantities, and</li>
      <li>While my son loves this product, my husband refuses to use AXE because of their powerful scents.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice gift set which includes the shower gel,the antiperspirant and the daily fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is clean and fresh without being “soapy”, with a hint of mint that wafts a light, flowery odor for several hours after application.</li>
      <li>This is the first time using the Phoenix scent</li>
      <li>As luck would have it, Phoenix is one of my favorites from among their many different scents.</li>
      <li>The first two have odor that tends to fade away, while this, by design, is MEANT to be fruity Axey smelly</li>
      <li>This was, however, my first time to try the antiperspirant stick in this</li>
      <li>This has happened on more than one occasion with a different spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for the products, he has worn the AXE solid antiperspirant for years and it has always kept him dry and smelling great.  </li>
      <li>The gel created enough lather but rinsed away cleanly and quickly.</li>
      <li>This would make a great gift for an active teenage boy who may not otherwise be motivated to stave off his body odor.</li>
      <li>The antiperspirant is easy to apply, and carries the same pleasing scent as the shower gel.  </li>
      <li>It is strong but in our house the rule is, it must be sprayed outside the house, away from the body, and then walked into.  </li>
      <li>Its not overpowering but strong enough that you do smell it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The body wash and antiperspirant has a clean, fresh though mild scent that is appealing.  The body wash goes a long way as dispensing a small amount per shower does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body spray is another matter.  Can be very overpowering or intense and should be used carefully.  A light spray is more than enough to create an effect.  All three scents are almost identical with the body spray providing the most variation,especially if overused.  Good product overall in a nice set.</li>
    <li> This nicely packaged set of Axe products consists of three different items, each of which I will briefly review. All three products have that distinctive &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; odor which you either like (I do) or you don&#x27;t. Nothing I can do about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Axe Phoenix Anti-Perspirant Stick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have become a fan of the Axe Anti-Perspirants. This says it&#x27;s good for 24 hours, though I prefer the Axe anti-perspirant rated at 48 hours. In BOTH cases they really do stem under arm moisture for the stated times. This would get 5 out of 5 stars for me by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Axe Phoenix Refreshing Shower Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as good as any soap, with a nice moisturizing feel. Goes on slimy but washes off easily and leaves, yes, the slight &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; smell. Another 5 out of 5 stars just for doing what it says it does with no real issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Axe Phoenix Daily Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could do without this product. The first two have odor that tends to fade away, while this, by design, is MEANT to be fruity Axey smelly and it is. Nothing horrible, but for basically being a men&#x27;s perfume, I&#x27;d give this 3 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 out of 5 stars. A very nice gift pack for the person in your life who likes Axe products.</li>
    <li> Nice set of Axe products at a reasonable price. Phoenix is a great scent that most people should like.</li>
    <li> OK, right off the bat some of you will say, &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t review packaging in a product review!&amp;#34;.  I call, wrong.  If a product appears to be badly inspected or shipped from the factory, I&#x27;m calling it out.  That is the case here.  I find no fault with the product at all.  The shower gel was very nice, nicely scented and as far as shower gels go, did not leave a slimy feeling film on me like some do.  The antiperspirant works as advertised and has a pretty good odor.  The Axe body spray smells nice, as  you would expect it to, being Axe.  My gripe is that the shower gel popped it&#x27;s cap and leaked everywhere during shipping.  I have had many of these type products shipped to me and this is the only one that has done that.  They may need to put a tab or something on their product to prevent this.  Otherwise, I recommend this kit to those who like the Axe product line.</li>
    <li> Myself and my son in law use the AXE brand all the time. Mostly because its priced well and smells good. This is a nice gift set which includes the shower gel,the antiperspirant and the daily fragrance. It does not include shampoo/conditioner like the description says. This is the first time using the Phoenix scent but it smells great and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Axe Phoenix is a nice gift box for the man in your life.  The body wash is thick and lathers well and leaves a light scent that you can boost with the antiperspirant and the body spray.  The scent is very masculine.</li>
    <li> Ohhhh, this stuff smells good, like really, really GOOD.  It’s a very nice masculine scent that isn’t overpowering and just makes me want to smell it and revel in its wonderfulness.  Mmmm….  But down to business.  Despite smelling great, Axe Phoenix Gift Box would make a great, affordable gift for the man in your life.  It contains a full sized shower gel, full sized 24-hour deodorant, and a body fragrance.  My only caveat would be to use the body spray sparingly.  As great as it smells, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 8 year old son to use as he is starting to need deodorant and wants to be manly like his dad. At the price of under $10 for all three items you can&#x27;t go wrong and they work as expected. My son thinks its cool to have black product bottles and he likes the scent. Its not overpowering but strong enough that you do smell it. I like that he smells good and his confidence is back up as he was self-conscious about his smell.</li>
    <li> This set comes with full sized products. You&#x27;ll get a bottle of shower gel(just plain shower gel....not 2 in 1 or 3 in 1), a stick of antiperspirant, and a bottle of fragrance spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes the smell of the shower gel and antiperspirant. He doesn&#x27;t really care for the spray, since it&#x27;s much stronger and smells like something more appealing to a teenager. (Good news for the teenagers!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone uses all the products within the set, this really is a good price, and would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> I like AXE products, most are not overpowering smelling, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Nice soft aroma that won&#x27;t gag anyone if you use in reasonable quantities, and the set is a nice way to try the fragrance spray, body wash, and anti-antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick note here, if you have used the AXE antiperspirant sprays, they can be highly irritating to your throat when you spray them, but this fragrance only spray is no issue at all for me.  Basically spray on cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy the set in the future since I don&#x27;t use fragrance sprays, but will continue buying the body wash and antiperspirant, which I like.  Protection lasts a long time, I like the smell, and the body wash works well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot to say, might not be a bad idea to smell these in a local store before ordering.</li>
    <li> You either like the general Axe odor or you don&#x27;t - in small doses it can be less lethal, but in gym locker rooms it&#x27;s a persistent cloud that won&#x27;t go away. For some reason this pack contains two deodorants and one shower gel when it would have been more useful to have a shampoo, shower gel and deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is an inexpensive bundle, there&#x27;s nothing about the package that screams &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; in terms of special packaging or theme. It&#x27;s really just three Axe items sold together. One of the deodorants has a clever twist lock to prevent accidental spraying when it&#x27;s stored while traveling. The black plastic packaging looks somewhat dated compared with many modern bathroom products for either men or women.</li>
    <li> 3 in 1. This is a really great deal. The &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; is really great. It&#x27;s a spray so there&#x27;s no chance of it spilling all over the place. It has a really strong smell though but it&#x27;s a good smell that I&#x27;ve been complimented on. The deodorant isn&#x27;t that good. It clumps up and can be hard to &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; out. It doesn&#x27;t work that well. It can get very dry at times.  As for the gel, it is what it is and I can&#x27;t tell what the difference is between that and Shampoo. Having said that, I can say that for what this is it is a pretty good deal and if you can get it I say do so. Also, based on my history with AXE products you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This AXE Gift Box is a must have. The price is beyond affordable for what you get. It&#x27;s perfect for that man in your life and is a great present for birthdays and holidays. AVE body products are some of the best there is on the market, especially their body wash and deodorant. I would recommend this box set to anyone, women included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate</li>
    <li> As I’ve said in a number of my reviews of other Axe products, I’ve been a regular, and satisfied, user of Axe products for years. As luck would have it, Phoenix is one of my favorites from among their many different scents. It is clean and fresh without being “soapy”, with a hint of mint that wafts a light, flowery odor for several hours after application. This was, however, my first time to try the antiperspirant stick in this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, Axe continues to impress and I was happy with all three products. Personally, I like to mix and match scents, and I keep enough of these and competitors’ products on hand that I never have to use the same product and smell the same two days in a row. It’s nice to cover all the bases with the same masculine scent, and my wife just likes that I don’t stink after a sweaty day in the factory where I work (where the AC comes and goes all summer long). I like that the three products come in one package, and I’ll say again, this is one of my favorite fragrances to begin with. So, maybe it is a slightly fan biased rating, but I give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Bottom Line: Axe smells great and lasts a long time. It&#x27;s this generation&#x27;s version of Old Spice, the can&#x27;t fail fragrance everyone man can use. The gift pack is great, I use all three and I&#x27;m like a walking advertisement. I particularly like the bath gel which lathers up well with very small amounts of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could write more but I&#x27;m too busy fighting off women who want to go out with me. If only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I like the scent.  Bodywash specifically is pretty refreshing.  Deodorant stick and fragrance spray are probably more suitable for younger guys.  The cardboard insert which hold individual containers inside the outer box sheds fibers, which takes away from the appearance of the product.  Overall, this might be a nice set for younger guys, as for me, I&#x27;d only use bodywash.</li>
    <li> Overall 4.5/5.0.&lt;br /&gt;Positives galore:&lt;br /&gt;1. All I need in one pack at a very affordable price&lt;br /&gt;2. Very nice perfume smell (while they call this fruity - lavender etc, I can&#x27;t smell much of a lavender in this, but still it is a nice)&lt;br /&gt;3. It is a mild perfume - doesn&#x27;t overwhelm - as long as you use it moderately and sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;4. Gel is nice also, but just another Axe bath gel - same as you expect - in terms of suds and moisture and clean feeling after..&lt;br /&gt;5. Quite happy with the antiperspirant; so far I had been using Degree as I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than that. But now I have found a better one.&lt;br /&gt;6. Fabulous rotating cap on the body spray! The cap makes it very safe for travel or inside your sports bag - can never accidentally discharge!&lt;br /&gt;Only negative I can think of? A &#x27;Gift box&#x27; should come in a nicer gift box..it is just functional but not really a gift box.</li>
    <li> For $8.73, this is an excellent value for nice smelling/performing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Antiperspirant Stick protects well and keep you from stinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Daily Fragrance gives an extra boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The AXE shower gel is a 2-in-1 shampoo plus conditioner that works great, although I have little hair, so it&#x27;s hard to judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent value!</li>
    <li> This mix of products; the antiperspirant stick, shower gel and perfume have a unified theme. The scent is similar and perhaps stronger than few brands I have used before, but fades away quickly. The gel created enough lather but rinsed away cleanly and quickly. Overall, the antiperspirant stick and shower gel are average products, but the cologne works pretty well for me. The strong smell did not bother me, but it may be a factor for some consumers who have allergies to the odor.</li>
    <li> I think I tried the Axe first when it was in the clearance bin at Shaw&#x27;s, but it got my teenage boys hooked.  They won&#x27;t use any other brand now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use dollar store knock off brands.  But even I have to concede that the Axe does stay noticably fresher smelling for longer.</li>
    <li> My teen son is a big fan of AXE products, so I turned this gift set over to him and waited for his response.  After a few uses, he reports that the shower gel is excellent,and the antiperspirant effective, but the fragrance smelled faintly of &amp;#34;cleaner.&amp;#34;  My first thought was &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t know what cleaners smell like, given the current status of your room&amp;#34;, but I let that go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower gel lathers easily, and has a very strong scent.  While my son loves this product, my husband refuses to use AXE because of their powerful scents.  The antiperspirant is easy to apply, and carries the same pleasing scent as the shower gel.  It&#x27;s the fragrance that kind of misses the mark, smelling more like alcohol than the pleasing AXE Phoenix scent.  Still, my teen gives this set an enthusiastic recommend.</li>
    <li> For some reason, the AXE brand just resonates with the 12 year old crowd.  The Phoenix scent is one of the most popular ones for the AXE.  This is a great set.  It includes EVERYTHING a mother wants for her son:  SHOWER GEL - YAAAAY, Anti-perspirant/deodorant - YAAAAAY,  and a daily fragrance spray which is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son said to me earlier this summer that he &amp;#34;really needed to find his significant scent for his junior high school career.&amp;#34;  He was looking at the LaCoste line, for about $100 a bottle.  Uggghhh.  lol - AXE is much more palatable for my wallet!!  AND it won&#x27;t last all day like some of the very expensive colognes that cost $100 - which is probably a blessing for all the teachers who have him all day long!!  I think the whole kit costs about $7 including shipping for PRIME - what more could you really ask for.  Nicely boxed, too.  Looks and feels like a gift.  But it truly is a gift you give yourself as a parent to get smelly guy in the shower and using deodorant.  Just sayin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Overall, I like AXE products. I like the scent, their general effectiveness (e.g. the body wash washes, the deoderant does, etc.) and general market appeal. That said, this kit has one issue in the bundle. The cologne is a bit too strong, in my opinion. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;room killer&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a bit much of a good thing (the AXE scent). I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is great stuff and is similar to the AXE body wash that I really, really like. The deodorant is OK, but then I am not super critical of deodorant. Works &#x3D; check. Doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable and slimy &#x3D; check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would buy this kit if it were on super sale. If it was given to me, I&#x27;d use most of it except for the cologne. The cologne brings the average down a bit, so I have to call it a 3.</li>
    <li> young men these days love these types of fragrances and my son is no different.  The smell is good and it seems to clean well, but if you have allergies like me, don&#x27;t spray the fragrance in the house.  Also, be sure to use it sparingly - a little goes a long way.  But all in all, it&#x27;s a good product and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but the deodorant does not do as good a job for me as other products do in regards to keeping me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all of the products in this set have a nice smell to them.</li>
    <li> The shower gel is the largest item in this gift box making it quite large (larger than I thought it would be). All three items have atypical dispensing. With the AXE brand everything is &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; so the deodorant has a rotating crank handle (the whole bottom is a handle that rotates), the shower gel has a flip button open rather than a cap, and the aerosol isn&#x27;t a cap and button but built in trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant is fine. The shower gel does not lather up well and so did its part to make this an &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; 3 stars. The aerosol I wasn&#x27;t expecting (I thought it was shaving gel). It isn&#x27;t it is a refresher spray (perfume for men). I&#x27;d rather have seen a matching scent shampoo -- would have made a lot more sense to have or at least add that to this package. If not, what&#x27;s the point of the matching scented items ?</li>
    <li> My teen son was thrilled to receive this set.  Phoenix is his favorite scent in the AXE line and, as his mother, I don&#x27;t find it offensive like some of the horrific things his teen friends wear.  This scent would, in my opinion, smell great on a grown man as well.  It doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a teenager&amp;#34; like some scents do.&lt;br /&gt;As for the products, he has worn the AXE solid antiperspirant for years and it has always kept him dry and smelling great.  The body wash works well, and the scent does linger a bit, but it does contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) for those who are looking to avoid it.  Finally, the spray... ohhhhhh the spray... it seems to be a *must* for any young teenager.  It is strong but in our house the rule is, it must be sprayed outside the house, away from the body, and then walked into.  This isn&#x27;t for some great health reason, it is for my poor nose when it is stuck in a small vehicle with him I don&#x27;t want gag on a fragrance bomb.  One of my favorite things about the spray is how it locks so it can&#x27;t accidentally go off in a drawer and coat the inside and everything else inside the drawer.  This has happened on more than one occasion with a different spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great set.  It is labeled as a &amp;#34;gift box&amp;#34; but it is really just these three items in the cardboard box pictured above.  There is nothing special to make it a gift box (like a tin, fun inserts, etc.) but it is currently much cheaper to buy these in this set rather than individually.</li>
    <li> This gift box works perfectly for the teenaged boy in my home. The fragrance is reminiscent of the fragrance Cool Water to me.  It is not so cloying and thick as to be overpowering (my son has been known to be a bit heavyhanded with the scent).  The box comes with deodorant, shower gel and body spray.  We have purchased Axe before and had found that the deodorant/ant-perspirant was not the most effective, this particular scent has been working well so far.  Everything that is in the box are items that are used daily and the smell is pleasant; I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The three Axe products in this gift box--body wash, deodorant and spray-on scent--pack enough punch to keep any active male smelling fresh and clean.  The body wash is perfect, lathering up well and leaving just the right amount of residual earthy scent.  The fragrance, though pleasing in the same earthy way, is extremely strong and long-lasting, so a single quick spray to the chest is all I would recommend.  The deodorant, while leaving a pleasant scent, is not as effective at reducing sweat and odor as my go-to product (Mitchum), making it the weak link of the three.  This would make a great gift for an active teenage boy who may not otherwise be motivated to stave off his body odor.</li>
