<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had ordered the hyaluronic acid &amp; decided to order this product also. I have seen this brand in an organic publication. I like that the cream goes a long way. I applied using dots of it all over my face &amp; neck. That is enough product for one application. As with most products like this, results take time. So far I like that my face seems smoother and the skin on my neck seems to be retaining moisture more by using this product. I gave it four stars because I get more results using almond oil from my local organic market.</li>
    <li> Really good moisterizer, thicker cream, nice absorption. My skin felt nice, smoother and nicer texture when applied. I only used one jar so no huge difference yet. I think this is a really good moisterizer and with the added DMAE it has a tightening affect. To me, nothing but retinol ( anything containing retinoids, there&#x27;s a few forms)  is going to reduce or lessen the appearance or depth of lines and wrinkles. This is a good moisterizer but I don&#x27;t think it will rid you of any major lines. Still I do like the moisturizing effect and feeling it left on my skin. Added with other products, I see this as a good addition, when used with retinol products.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like the Reviva products. Finding the right one for you, that&#x27;s the tricky part.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing Dr. Oz talk about it with Dr. Perricone. I have great skin normally, but at age 36 I wanted it to stay that way, so I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t always have a facial cleaning routine at nit, I only have used this about 3-4 nights per week for 2 years. I love it. It makes my skin feel supple and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another jar today for my hands. I&#x27;m starting to notice my hand skin becoming thinner, so we&#x27;ll see if this helps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why ,but my girlfriend said she love it,and maybe buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years.  The DMAE was recommended on the Dr. Oz show so I went looking and decided to start with this one.  Been using for a month and definitely softer and more supple skin on face.  I&#x27;m usually very dry which makes the wrinkles more pronounced.  Definitely less wrinkles which makes for a definitely great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my turkey gobbler fab hanging down on my neck!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. I have use many creams - expensive creams and this is awesome!</li>
    <li> I returned this without trying it because I did not care for the ingredient DMAE - there has been some controversial points on it, and I would appreciate it if someone can clear this up, or prove otherwise.</li>
    <li> Really like it and cost was about half what it is at health food store - very same product.  Shipping was free.  :)</li>
    <li> I think you have to use it for a while to see great differences in your skin, but it makes it feel super soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a month. I think it&#x27;s making a difference - will know better in another month or two. I plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it leaves my face feeling smooth, but not sticky.  I had no issues with red spots, which usually appear when I use a new product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the products. i did a littel research and all the reviews were positive.&lt;br /&gt;i have just begun to use the products but i am feeling very good abut them.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to repurchase the products because i found out a lot of good things about this brand.&lt;br /&gt;i am intersted in pure products and these are and also affordable for me.</li>
    <li> I like this night cream. Many of them keep me from a restful sleep.  This one does not.</li>
    <li> I feel my face skin smooth and soft. The cream absorbs perfect in my skin. I&#x27;m going to review the web site of Reviva.</li>
    <li> This is terrific face &amp; neck cream.  Soft makes skin firmer and never sticky! Better than high dollar brands, at much better price. Recently was told by an old friend that I \\&quot;never change\\&quot;, I&#x27;m pushing 60 and she had not seen me in a few years! Products like this certainly help!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel soft, smooth and fresh when I wake up</li>
    <li> I use it at night around my chin and neck area.  I could see the results in the first week. I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> a very good cream.  it&#x27;s thick and stays on.  i use it at night and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on a blog and decided to give it a try.  I have noticed a difference in the short time I have been using it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it nightly and this is my second purchase of this product. It has made a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Skin became raw and puffy just after using it for three days.</li>
    <li> This really does live up to the hype. I&#x27;m in my early 30s, starting to be concerned about wrinkles, have very sensitive and pale skin. I wanted a great night moisturizer. This does the trick. My skin looks beautiful the next morning, and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in the texture of my skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good night cream. I can see a difference especially in the neck area.  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Bought this because of my love of the Reviva Labs Body Firming Lotion (with Elastin &amp; Collagen).  I thought this was pretty good, and soaked in satisfactorily.  Haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t look any younger, but my skin feels good.</li>
    <li> Works great, chose this product for DMAE and price.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is smoother have not used long enough for any other results.</li>
    <li> This cream feel very velvety on my face and it relaxes my stress points. It is the best cream I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this combined with collagen cream on my upper arms and it does seem to be having some effect at reducing the lumpy, wrinkled appearance of my &amp;#34;wings.&amp;#34; Not ready to go sleeveless yet, though. Been using it for about two weeks, once a day in the morning (contra-indicated per product description as a night cream, but it works for me, not too greasy at all).</li>
    <li> Love this night cream. Goes on smoothly without any smell to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a returning customer.  The cream maintains my skin manageable.  I&#x27;m not a spring chicken; so, the word &amp;#34;manageable&amp;#34; means a lot to me.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> an ok crème kind of drying to me</li>
    <li> Really nice. Works great.</li>
    <li> This product did moisturized my skin! As far as firming my skin, I wish it had a dramatic effect. I&#x27;m not sure if I see any difference in firming of my skin. It might have better results for some one else, but for me..Nada!</li>
    <li> Really noticed a difference in my skin when I ran out of this cream so promptly purchased two so I don&#x27;t run out again</li>
    <li> Very good night product. Most of all my beauty products come from Amazon. I search out the best products and reviews.</li>
    <li> Been using for awhile. I believe it works - I think that&#x27;s what matters. Will buy again and continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product is doing what it said it would do!</li>
    <li> Love these creams by reviva!</li>
    <li> ok so Im 63 and I used this and broke out with pimples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give me a break terrible I returned it along with the brown spot which does not work</li>
    <li> Use this in conjunction with their collagen cream- nightly- two weeks elastin, two weeks collagen. My skin is so smooth and younger looking. I also use in conjunction with a nightly glycolic acid cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves face grease free!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!! I can definitely see a difference in my skin!  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the mirror playing tricks on me or my eyes, but I actually think I look younger. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but I was starting to get laugh lines and this cream I definitely think has helped diminish those!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  I had been using Shiseido for decades but they decided to create a new formula that was supposed to be an improvement.  I have very dry skin  and did not like the new formula so I went on a hunt for a new moisturizer.  I tried every moisturizer I could find and nothing was as good as what I had been using.  I purchased Elastin &amp; DMAE night cream, not really expecting  much, but I am very pleased with the product.  It feels rich and my skin feels moisturized throughout the night (and day, since I use it in the morning too).  I would recommend this cream to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> i love it .my neck area has firmed up .I will order more</li>
    <li> Second time I ordered it can see a real difference in my face complexion brighter and fine line not so apparent.  I use the Day Cream also</li>
    <li> Great product!! Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer and skin tightener/lifter, depending on how much elasticity your skin still has.  I use it as a daycream also, but it does tend to pill with creamy makeup foundation.  Really nice product, one jar lasts a long time because it is a very rich cream, so affordable!</li>
    <li> Great cream. Wish it came in a bigger jar. Skin just feels good when you wake up the next day.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well</li>
    <li> Just another night cream that promises much but delivers little except for a nice moisturizing feeling.</li>
