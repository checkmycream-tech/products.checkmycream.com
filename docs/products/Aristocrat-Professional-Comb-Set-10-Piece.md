<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the variety but the quality of the combs isn&#x27;t great, they&#x27;re pretty thin. Would serve well for home use but not great for professional salon use...I&#x27;m thinking they&#x27;ll eventually get softened by regular Barbicide use.</li>
    <li> I bought these for use on my cats, my cat trees;  works better than the vacuum cleaner, combs the cat hair out better than anything I&#x27;ve used.  They are also great for cleaning the brush on the vacuum cleaner.  They Work great on my also.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect set.  Has every brush I need!</li>
    <li> I use oat least one of these combs everyday. Gives you lots of choices.</li>
    <li> I have a comb for whatever need!!! I like the plastic pouch they come in as well!!! They were better than I expected!!</li>
    <li> The plastic is a bit flimsy and I feel like they will snap when pulling them through my long, thick hair. I love the tool variety and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Cheap and resourceful.&lt;br /&gt;It has every piece you can possibly need to style your hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;I am African with relaxed hair and it is MORE than enough for me.</li>
    <li> The plastic is solid but they still look like they&#x27;re made in China on a boat. They had a weird smell (probably from the packaging they were in) but eventually the smell will go away. Over-all for the price you&#x27;re paying they are deffinetly worth having. Are they the best? Ofc not, but they&#x27;re affordable and mid quality I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. Price was on the high side but so far every type of comb I need I have found in this collection. Durability a plus.</li>
    <li> good quality hard plastic, should last awhile!</li>
    <li> For the cost of this item, you can hardly go wrong. Strong black plastic combs in various sizes to take care of most of your hair grooming needs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my cosmetology class and they have worked wonders. Now i no longer have to try and find any comb that I need they are all right there in reach and are separated into their own individual spots. Will be buying more products from this seller :).</li>
    <li> i used these combs while applying a keratin treatment and washed them afterwards for everyday use because they&#x27;re so versatile. Haven&#x27;t used every single one yet but i&#x27;m sure i will need to at some point. Carrying case is nice and simple, i added some of my other combs to it without a space issue.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> Great price for the product</li>
    <li> Who gets excited about combs?  I mean, they are combs, right?  I just love this set!!  There are combs for every type of hair/hairdo.  And, I love the fact that they come in a heavy duty plastic folding organizer.  The combs are not flimsy like some cheap plastic combs that I have purchased before.  For the money, this is a great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these combs. They are very sturdy and a great set. I use them to dry my hair and set it. I was very surprised at how well they are made. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> This is a lot of well made combs for a REALLY low price. I was impressed. I really only needed one wide tooth comb but the set cost less than the packages of one I found. Shipping took just a few days.</li>
    <li> I bought these to cute my daughters&#x27; hair at home. They are simple and work fine. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice set.  Very affordable too.  I&#x27;m not a hair stylist, just an every day woman that likes to do her hair.  I have fine hair and the combs run through my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> What can I say except they are combs! Good combs. Not those brittle, thin combs that break at the site of a good head of challenging hair! I must say, we all want more use from the products we pay for and this is one of those products.</li>
    <li> Sturdy plastic combs with many options, for a reasonable price. Was going to try the combs made from carbon, but these seem just fine. I purchased these to use for wig styling, and I&#x27;m not even sure what they are for. I like that the color is a dark navy, too.</li>
    <li> These are high quality. They fit well into the hand and are nice and sharp.  Also the shipping was lightning fast!</li>
    <li> I love this variety pack of combs. Pick whatever one to do what you need to your hair.</li>
    <li> I just got this product today, and used a couple of the combs already. I have to say that I like how sturdy the plastic is, they are nice and hard but not brittle and have a LITTLE flexibility if needed.&lt;br /&gt;I also like how some of the comes have the very thin metal tail on them as well for a bit more complicated styling. I also like the little plastic storage &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34; it came it. Roll it out then roll it back up and store.&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, the price for these was the BEST for all ten of these different combs. Everywhere else I look it&#x27;s about $5 just for ONE comb, so most definitely a GREAT buy.</li>
    <li> The quality is not so good.  They are too soft.  I don&#x27;t like them at all.</li>
    <li> All the types of combs you could ever hope to need</li>
    <li> This comb set is awesome! I haven&#x27;t found a use for all of them quite just yet, but I use them everyday and they are very high quality. Don&#x27;t really bend and are nice and stiff. The best combs I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> The points on the end of the fine tooth combs are not sharp or smooth enough to slip through my thick hair.  They both just sort of skim the top and if i force it through the tips scratch my scalp and hairs catch and get yanked out.</li>
    <li> Great collection at very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This comb set is a great value. I was looking for a set of combs to help with styling my natural hair, in particular a rat-tailed comb for making parts for braiding, and a wide-toothed comb for detangling my 3c/4a hair. This set filled both needs. It contains 3 rat-tailed combs,two wide-tooth combs, 3 pick/comb combinations, and finally two regular combs, 10 in all. If you want to save money and have a variety of combs for styling, this set will fill your needs.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. What you see is what you get. Very good deal I think, and they don&#x27;t look cheap at all. I&#x27;ve no Idea which comb is best for what as I&#x27;m a guy, but will figure it out someday probably lol. I keep switching between them but still don&#x27;t know which one to use. it&#x27;s great to have a collection though.</li>
    <li> The package came on time! All combs/picks shown in the display is what you get. I now have all the types in one place, no more rummaging through the draws to find that one particular pick to use for a style. I am thinking about buying another set to use for traveling only?!! Not that its an issue but I assumed the set was going to be Black, but its Dark Blue! Purchase it as you shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fairly cheap finish. But for the money, perfect for a student or home use.</li>
    <li> Love the package. I used it for a while and it is still working well!</li>
    <li> Good comb set. I&#x27;ll never use them all but nice to have.</li>
    <li> This is a great, economical collection of combs for the entire family.&lt;br /&gt;I priced just one teasing comb with the lift on the end for more than this&lt;br /&gt;whole collection!&lt;br /&gt;The wide-toothed combs are great to keep in the shower or by the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;No more tears from the kiddos as you comb out their wet hair!&lt;br /&gt;And they come in a fold-type holder that is great for travel or storage.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;And not unusual for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Just what everyone needs.. amazing how expensive combs have become.. these are right price</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy plastic combs. Nicely packaged in a carrying case. Definitely NOT unbreakable, but seem like they will make it just fine through regular use.</li>
    <li> My kids always steal my comes so I didn&#x27;t not one and I hid them.</li>
    <li> Great combs. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase of this great set of sturdy quality combs. It arrived quickly without any damage. It comes in a reusable vinyl &amp;#34;comb organizer case&amp;#34;. These combs have nice rounded &amp;#34;tips/teeth&amp;#34; and not sharp jagged pointy plastic tips that could tear the scalp and hair.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> Cheap made and will break with a quickness.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Made of cheap plastic the pulls hair.  I do not recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> Luv the variety of hair tools in this pack..............and more words and more words and more words and I&#x27;m done lol</li>
    <li> Great product. Awesome price! The price was unbelievable for this comb set. They are quality products. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I love this set.  I never knew how much of a difference that having different combs made for your ability to style your hair.  I guess that seems obvious now, but it seemed like such a revelation at the time.  Build of items is of good quality and they function well.  I have had issues in the past with combs scratching my scalp and causing discomfort.  These must be less pointy than other ones I have tried.  The price is good as well.</li>
    <li> These combs are awesome!! It has every kind of comb I need for my hair.  I recommend these combs to everyone</li>
    <li> good variety and great quality considering the price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best comb set I&#x27;ve come across. You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the combs hold up strong. The set is being used a lot, and is being used by multiple family members.</li>
    <li> Great variety of combs for the price! You have combs for all possible needs and I really like this set very much as it&#x27;s truly complete for all I need.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my granddaughter who is attending her 1st year of college @ Seattle Univ., and she was very happy when the suprised package arrived.  Said there were a lot of different sized combs and would work well for her in the condensed dorm room.  Order arrived very quickly and will do business with this vendor again.</li>
    <li> good variety at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this set perfect for doing my daughters hair</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for replacing the damaged product. I finally got the combs and I am very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> it was a gift and will be used by daughter&#x27;s family who has  3 daughters with great hair</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good product</li>
    <li> Would definitely be getting another set of combs in the future. I love them!</li>
    <li> A LITTLE WEAK BUT OKAY BUY</li>
