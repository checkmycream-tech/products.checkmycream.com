      <li>Keeps hair in place, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I found them easy to put in and they hold my fine hair quite well.</li>
      <li>hair clips are hair clips they work just fine.</li>
      <li>The clips are fine.  </li>
      <li>But these are my good old faithful, sturdy banana clips!</li>
      <li>It was cheap and did not work well at all with my hair.</li>
      <li>They provide a good, solid hold and give the &#x27;pony tail&#x27; an elegant look.</li>
      <li>These are my absolute favorite banana clips.</li>
      <li>They would be okay for someone with much thinner hair.  </li>
      <li>Love a good banana clip and hard to find at the stores</li>
      <li>I saw these a couple of times on amazon not realizing they were  &amp;#34;the ones&amp;#34;, so I just thought it was worth a try to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap, comes completely apart as you are trying to secure your hair.</li>

      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>When I found these Banana Clips online, I was pretty happy, as they are hard for me to find these days.</li>
      <li>I was hoping they&#x27;d be a bit shorter but they are certainly functional and do not show very much which I like.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I finally found these combs thanks Amazon for having them.</li>
      <li>Trying to grow hair longer and this product keeps it neat and tidy when it&#x27;s down</li>
      <li>Wow, Praise God!!!  </li>
      <li>and these are the perfect thing to hold my hair up during the muggy humid weather in New England.</li>
      <li>friend in high school.</li>
      <li>They have the new ones.  </li>
      <li>When I have time, every couple of months or so, I run through my past orders and leave feedback as appropriate.  </li>
      <li>love the banana clips, they are like a blast from the past.</li>
      <li>not very sturdy, but adequate.</li>
      <li>Wanted old style banana combs to add glitz to.</li>
      <li>These are good Banana Clips, but they are rather difficult to open &amp; close, especially when you&#x27;re doing your hair.</li>
      <li>great for bad hair day, may come apart if too heavy a clump of hair, but snap right back together, an hold well once installed</li>
      <li>Not the fault of Scunchi that my hair is so fine and thin</li>

    <li> The clips are fine.  Just what I was looking for.  But I do NOT appreciate getting spam in my email inbox a week later, essentially ordering me to leave seller feedback.  When I have time, every couple of months or so, I run through my past orders and leave feedback as appropriate.  When a seller sends me an email demanding that I do, I leave them the kind of feedback they deserve.  This kind.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and did not work well at all with my hair. I will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> Takes getting used to closing them, but they work</li>
    <li> When I found these Banana Clips online, I was pretty happy, as they are hard for me to find these days. The item arrived on time, &amp; the packaging/protection was good.

    <li> Theses were just whT I was looking for</li>
    <li> Love a good banana clip and hard to find at the stores</li>
    <li> Just too small. Fault of buyer rather than product.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of clips.  If you remember, your hair must be super feathered 90&#x27;s style for it to look good.  I&#x27;ll give them away.  I have very thin hair, and these did hold my hair.  If you have trouble opening them, just pull harder.</li>
    <li> great for bad hair day, may come apart if too heavy a clump of hair, but snap right back together, an hold well once installed</li>

    <li> They are not big enough for my hair</li>
    <li> not very sturdy, but adequate.</li>
    <li> Thought it was a hard plastic and these do not work with my hair.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work. They are to small. I don&#x27;t like them at all. I wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone about them. No</li>
    <li> These are my absolute favorite banana clips. I have a lot of hair and these are the only ones that work for me. It&#x27;s disappointing I can no longer find them locally but I am so glad they are available on amazon!</li>
    <li> One broke after about 3 weeks of use, but they are nice when they work.</li>

    <li> I have been looking for small banana clips like this for close to a year now.  I CANNOT for the life of me find them in stores.  They have the new ones.  But these are my good old faithful, sturdy banana clips! Yaaay!!! I saw these a couple of times on amazon not realizing they were  &amp;#34;the ones&amp;#34;, so I just thought it was worth a try to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are the ones!!! Wow, Praise God!!!  I may have to get a supply because I don&#x27;t ever want these to run out!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon, and Scunci International.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HalleluYah!  As you can see, I am very excited, and HE deserves the praise for all things!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ylg</li>
    <li> Just like I remembered them!  great price!</li>
    <li> Had these years ago, however gave them all away. Searched everywhere here locally and found just what I wanted at AMAZON. Keep up the good selection you provide. Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> As some other reviewers said, these banana clips are almost impossible to find in local stores.  Thank you, Scunci, for providing them on Amazon.  They provide a good, solid hold and give the &#x27;pony tail&#x27; an elegant look.</li>
    <li> Just OK I propbably could have gotten them at Target or CVS. I thought they looked different on the Amazon site. My bad</li>
    <li> Very cheap feeling.  Do not like</li>
    <li> I have too much hair...too thick.  They don&#x27;t look as good on me as I really thought they would.  They would be okay for someone with much thinner hair.  I didn&#x27;t think about that when I purchased them.</li>
    <li> They remind me of the fun I had with my&lt;br /&gt;Best friend in high school. What a blast from the past!!!</li>
    <li> hair clips are hair clips they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I am glad I finally found these combs thanks Amazon for having them. I used to wear these combs everyday and then I cut all my hair off, so when it grew back out I couldn&#x27;t find these combs anywhere. A friend of mine said look on Amazon and I was like oh yes! they should have them and y&#x27;all did. Thank you very much and I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon.</li>
    <li> Wanted old style banana combs to add glitz to. Not the fault of Scunchi that my hair is so fine and thin they won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered them in the 80&#x27;s. Trying to grow hair out and these are the perfect thing to hold my hair up during the muggy humid weather in New England.</li>
    <li> Meant for a little girl&#x27;s hair.  I wanted something smaller but this is frail.  The teeth are really small and would not grasp a quarter of my hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair in place, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> love this item .i used to wear them in the 90&#x27;s but waaaay to expensive. Sorry</li>
    <li> sturdy, hold up well.</li>
    <li> Cheap, comes completely apart as you are trying to secure your hair.</li>
    <li> love the banana clips, they are like a blast from the past. They work great and make it super easy to do my hair</li>
    <li> Trying to grow hair longer and this product keeps it neat and tidy when it&#x27;s down</li>
