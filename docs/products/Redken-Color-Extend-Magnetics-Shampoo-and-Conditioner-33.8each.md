      <li>love Redken products.</li>
      <li>Love the product.  </li>
      <li>Love how these smell.</li>
      <li>I love Redken products but</li>
      <li>The conditioner smells so strongly that I stopped using it.</li>
      <li>Packaging was fine..</li>
      <li>When Redken came out with the sulfate free (color saving) shampoo, I thought I would try it.</li>
      <li>Thanks !!!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and is great for my red hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s remarkable for retaining hair color, and I definitely noticed a difference when I started using it.</li>
      <li>Also, the breakage post shower is significantly reduced with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I never felt like my hair got clean with this product.</li>
      <li>My hair feels, looks, and smells incredible after using this shampoo for the past month.</li>
      <li>It was so easy to have it delivered to my front door ,thanks</li>
      <li>the line I was using before was drying my scalp out to much and this line has helped with that issue!!</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Seller was even nice enough to include 2 pumps at no charge!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</li>
      <li>My color stays so fresh and tonally correct with this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil products (which have a strong smell) and Kerastase (couldn&#x27;t easily get a brush through wet hair).</li>
      <li>I still prefer the Redken Clear Moisture unless I&#x27;ve had a hair treatment that requires the sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve paid a pretty price for them too</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>but I love getting the bigger bottles.</li>
      <li>every wash with astounding results; which is one of the most difficult colors in existence to maintain, mind you.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do too much to preserve the color though..</li>
      <li>I also highlight my hair, and the color really holds up well.</li>
      <li>My hair is not left feeling greasy as with many other sulfate free products.</li>
      <li>A rich lather, you only did a dab of the shampoo very concentrated.  </li>
      <li>But my hair is nice and shiny and easier to tame.</li>
      <li>Like Sulfate hair products but unlike other Sulfate-Free brands, it has astonishing lather - you wouldn&#x27;t even know it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m normally a slave to certain shampoo or conditioner brands that seem to work for me</li>
      <li>I wanted to try the sulfate free product to see if it would help my dry scalp and it has been.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Not to mention my hair does not feel clean and it is not soft!</li>
      <li>I paid full price plus shipping but my shampoo and conditioner bottles are only half full.</li>
      <li>Prior to using this product, L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free was the only shampoo I could use.</li>
      <li>Received product early!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with a sulfate issue (and for everyone in general).</li>
      <li>I cannot express enough how much I did not like this product.</li>
      <li>AND it came early.  </li>
      <li>I probably also have an unknown allergy to some other ingredient that is in many sulfate-free shampoos.</li>
      <li>This is the only shampoo that I have found that does not wash the red hair color out of my hair extremely fast!</li>
      <li>Will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need very much to do the job.  </li>
      <li>I swim laps at least 3 days a week and my hair is doing fine.</li>
      <li>It actually arrived early.</li>
      <li>When I soak my hair in this conditioner, it leaves it feeling ridiculously soft, and it&#x27;s the same when I let my hair soak in a blend of this conditioner along with my dye.</li>
      <li>Package arrived earlier than expected and exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>This is the closest I&#x27;ve found that suds up, feels like it actually washes hair clean without being too heavy and can get a brush through long, thick hair easily after shower.  </li>
      <li>My color has lasted much longer than any other shampoo.  </li>

    <li> I love this shampoo, great for my hair now that I get it colored every 6 weeks</li>
    <li> These items get a five star!</li>
    <li> Received product early!  As described.  Thanks!</li>

    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair smelling like heaven.</li>
    <li> Package arrived earlier than expected and exactly as advertised. Thanks !!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Seller was even nice enough to include 2 pumps at no charge! A+</li>
    <li> Love love this shampoo</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about 5 days ago and it came today the shipping was supposed to take another week but it came! I already used it, the smell of the shampoo and conditioner is amazing and it lathers up very good for a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner! I am very impressed with these items.</li>
    <li> I cannot express enough how much I did not like this product. It left my hair with a film. I never felt like my hair got clean with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, sulfate free!!</li>
    <li> If you want to look and feel like you walked out of the salon every day- who doesn&#x27;t?- this is for you. Keeps my color looking great. Smells amazing. And my hair has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel and look awesome... Didn&#x27;t really do too much to preserve the color though.. But my hair is nice and shiny and easier to tame.</li>
    <li> I love this and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner has changed my life. My color stays so fresh and tonally correct with this. It smells great as well. And this price could not be beat!</li>
    <li> Great I love the smell ,silk hair ,no complaints all. It&#x27;s great for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have an allergy to anything and everything with sulfa, sulfates, sulfites, etc. I probably also have an unknown allergy to some other ingredient that is in many sulfate-free shampoos. Prior to using this product, L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free was the only shampoo I could use. When Redken came out with the sulfate free (color saving) shampoo, I thought I would try it. This shampoo is the best sulfate free shampoo I have ever used. My hair is not left feeling greasy as with many other sulfate free products. Also, the breakage post shower is significantly reduced with this shampoo. I highly recommend it for anyone with a sulfate issue (and for everyone in general). It&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  No sulfates at all.  Other products that say for colored treated hair have sulfates in them.  My color has lasted much longer than any other shampoo.  Quite a bargain also.  I paid salon prices for the first purchase and this was an unbelievable bargain.  Will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need very much to do the job.  Buy this!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love how these smell. The shampoo and conditioner quality is excellent. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo/conditioner for color treated hair.  It adds shine and doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair, while avoiding stripping or fading color.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo for color treated hair.  A rich lather, you only did a dab of the shampoo very concentrated.  Seems to work better than others I&#x27;ve tried and of course I love Redken products!</li>
    <li> Only the shampoo arrived.  No conditioner.  Love the product.  Wish I had received the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works great but if you use the shampoo and conditioner together it makes my hair heavy.  I used just the conditioner one day and it was wonderful. Arrived on time and unbroken</li>
    <li> So far so good!!! I wanted to try the sulfate free product to see if it would help my dry scalp and it has been. I love Redken products but the line I was using before was drying my scalp out to much and this line has helped with that issue!!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that I have found that does not wash the red hair color out of my hair extremely fast! And it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I used to use these all the time, about 5 or 6 years ago. They have since changed the formula. It now makes my hair horribly dry and straw-like. It is not a rich, nurturing product. The conditioner has changed drastically and now I am stuck with two liters each of the shampoo and conditioner and I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> Best sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  I still prefer the Redken Clear Moisture unless I&#x27;ve had a hair treatment that requires the sulfate free shampoo.  This is the closest I&#x27;ve found that suds up, feels like it actually washes hair clean without being too heavy and can get a brush through long, thick hair easily after shower.  I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil products (which have a strong smell) and Kerastase (couldn&#x27;t easily get a brush through wet hair).</li>
    <li> my hair is already softer and feels cleaner.  It was so easy to have it delivered to my front door ,thanks</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairstylist and it transformed my dry and damaged hair. I was previously using dove. LOVE LOVE LOVE this!</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Packaging was fine..love Redken products.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is great for my red hair. It actually arrived early. I bought some previously at my salon but I love getting the bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I am still using the shampoo although I don&#x27;t notice any radical difference in my hair. The conditioner smells so strongly that I stopped using it. I&#x27;ll probably wait till the end of the bottle to decide whether I would order the shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo to use if you use Keratin treatments.  It leaves my hair soft and healthy.  I swim laps at least 3 days a week and my hair is doing fine.</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product AND it came early.  Very happy with my purchase.  :)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!  It leaves my hair so soft and smelling great!  The seller sent it out very quickly and I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally a slave to certain shampoo or conditioner brands that seem to work for me and I&#x27;ve paid a pretty price for them too but this shampoo and conditioner are amazing.  My hair feels great and I&#x27;ve even stopped using my It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in Plus Keratin so I&#x27;m saving even more money and have the best hair feel I&#x27;ve had in a LONG time!</li>
    <li> This was terrible. It smells like my grandmothers hairspray! I 100% regret buying this. I will switch back to Pureology! What a waste of money. Not to mention my hair does not feel clean and it is not soft! Thank goodness I have Aveda detangler to mask the smell and to get the brush through my hair. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. After doing an unbelievably profuse amount of research, I can promise you that this Sulfate-Free product doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural oils and top-layer cuticle; like common Sulfate Shampoos and Conditioners do. Like Sulfate hair products but unlike other Sulfate-Free brands, it has astonishing lather - you wouldn&#x27;t even know it. It&#x27;s remarkable for retaining hair color, and I definitely noticed a difference when I started using it. I put dye in the conditioner and use it to wash and condition my blue hair every wash with astounding results; which is one of the most difficult colors in existence to maintain, mind you. If you&#x27;re looking to maintain color, then know that I also use this alongside cold water and Apple Cider Vinegar to keep it vibrant and strong. When I soak my hair in this conditioner, it leaves it feeling ridiculously soft, and it&#x27;s the same when I let my hair soak in a blend of this conditioner along with my dye. Great stuff. Highly recommended. Just soak your hair in this product along with your dye, and you&#x27;ll never have to hand-dye your hair ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m livid. I paid full price plus shipping but my shampoo and conditioner bottles are only half full. I feel totally ripped off and want a refund!</li>
    <li> My hair feels, looks, and smells incredible after using this shampoo for the past month. I also highlight my hair, and the color really holds up well.</li>
