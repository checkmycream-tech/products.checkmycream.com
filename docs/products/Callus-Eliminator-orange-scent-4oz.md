      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>wish there was a really effective way to diminish the calluses faster and more permanently</li>
      <li>I did my own pedicure at home, first I soaked my feet in very warm water then</li>
      <li>My nail salon charges an extra 10 bucks for this treatment, so I was happy when I found this on Amazon!!  </li>
      <li>Any way this is an awesome product that I will be purchasing on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t try to stand in the tub or shower though with it on.</li>
      <li>so I was not even able to read the directions.</li>
      <li>but after 2 uses my feet look and feel so much better.</li>
      <li>This works almost as well as the product at my favorite salon.  </li>

      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
      <li>This worked okay.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I chose the mint scented one and was pleased that the medicinal scent wasn&#x27;t strong.</li>
      <li>so I used this before I go and just enjoy a foot soak, massage and manicured toes with cute polish.</li>
      <li>3-5 minutes and a light scrub with a pumice stone to remove the skin and</li>
      <li>Not as effective as I would have hoped, but does improve my feet with some intense scrubbing.</li>
      <li>your feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s booty.</li>
      <li>ok first i stand on my feet 90% of the day.</li>
      <li>I use the original unscented version.</li>
      <li>; which wasn&#x27;t part of the product description, and I can&#x27;t return it because it requires special handling.</li>
      <li>this Callus Eliminator is probably the best while most gentle instant fix of just the top dry layer.  </li>
      <li>Had similar results with a good lava pumice stone</li>
      <li>This stuff is a gel and goes on easily but leaves that slippery chemical residue, kind of like what is left after you use a depilitory cream.</li>
      <li>Soaked my feet in hot water for 5 minutes, generously applied this to the callus area on both feet and let it set for another 5 minutes, then scrubbed it all off!  </li>
      <li>This is good, but be careful and wear gloves when you apply it.</li>
      <li>I used th eproduct and was very satisfied that it softened the dry skin on my heels and made it therefore easier to scrub off.</li>
      <li>I took a nice long shower, then applied the Callus Eliminator and wrapped in plastic wrap for 4 minutes</li>
      <li>I was releived to find it at Amazon for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I did as the directions directed, and it did help remove some of the surface callus&#x27; but it wasn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;miraculous.&#x27;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really slippery!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same stuff</li>
      <li>after soaking in foot bath i applied some first its slippery.</li>
      <li>I used this once exactly as directed and noticed no change.</li>
      <li>This product works really well!  </li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>And most of the pressure goes to my left foot.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy a commercial size bottle at the beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>within 5 min it worked fine rinsed it off the peeled back some layers of the callus.</li>
      <li>really like does what it says</li>
      <li>This product when used correctly worked very well.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>and they have to scrub so much off my feet.</li>
      <li>It really works if you follow the directions to the letter.</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering this product.</li>
      <li>I spend so much every two weeks.</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>so I had high expectations.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My feet haven&#x27;t been this smooth in a very long time!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough, worked exactly as described!</li>
      <li>It works good, but makes my skin a little bit dry.</li>
      <li>Saves you money as you can easily do your pedicures at home and remove even the most thick and rough skin.</li>
      <li>Makes your feet very soft.</li>
      <li>You will have soft feet again!</li>
      <li>All I can say is that this product not only eliminated the callus, but it left my feet as soft and as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>My feet are baby soft</li>
      <li>I really had some buildup on my feet and finally gave this a try</li>
      <li>but that is a far cry better than any other instant method I&#x27;ve ever tried (from a spinning dremel grinder, to regular files, to microplane eggs).  </li>
      <li>I soak first, the rub it on heels, bottoms of feet and toes, wherever there is dry skin.  </li>
      <li>For those with extreme callus on your feet, it is best to soak properly but be very careful when applying if it gets on your skin, other than your feet, there will be some itching (sensitivity) and do wear gloves!!!!</li>
      <li>I tried to just scrape it but its much thicker than expected.</li>
      <li>I always ask the spa what do they use and they as if its top secret, now i know why.</li>
      <li>In contrast when I have filed that same area in a quick fix, that callus became tender and sometimes more prone to splitting than when it was left hard and thick</li>
      <li>The label (front and back) was completely dissolved in to tiny pieces from the product</li>
      <li>but my feet always seem to get very callussed on my last week before I&#x27;m due for a pedicure.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
      <li>this acted on both the dry layer that Callus took right off, as well as another layer or two of that heel callus deeper down.  </li>

<li> people beware the picture shows 1 large botal; and 1 small you will receive 2 the same when a placwe does this can not be trusted</li>
<li> all that said, that top dry layer was the most annoying because it was like little hooks that I could feel grabbing certain looped carpeting like little claws - or could feel scratchy of other feet/legs came into contact with it.&lt;br</li>
<li> It does remove the dead skin collecting at the heels, without removing any live skin.  </li>
<li> And don&#x27;t leave it on too long either.</li>
<li> the directions say use gloves wich i highly recommed rough hands are not cute.</li>
<li> The one longer acting method that did SOMETHING was Baby Foot - you soak in a booty for 3 hours, then 10 days later the outer few layers of skin peels off -</li>
<li> i.e moist or attached, I don&#x27;t know what - only the truly dry dead outer layer was removed.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like all the rough scrubbing and techniques used in salons</li>
<li> Product not what I expected it.</li>
<li> so be careful while pouring.</li>
<li> When I received this product the plastic bag it came in was all wet.</li>
<li> Only takes a few minutes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does what it claims to, but not perfect.</li>
    <li> My nail salon charges an extra 10 bucks for this treatment, so I was happy when I found this on Amazon!!  I&#x27;ve saved myself some serious  ca$h at the nail salon now :) The product works amazingly well!  I would reccommend wearing gloves as opposed to thoroughly washing hands afterwards. And don&#x27;t leave it on too long either. You will love the results!</li>
    <li> Makes your feet very soft. Just love it</li>
    <li> When I received this product the plastic bag it came in was all wet. The product had somehow came out of the bottle and it spilled in the bag. The label (front and back) was completely dissolved in to tiny pieces from the product so I was not even able to read the directions. Regardless, I decided to keep it and look on Amazon to figure out how to use it. I followed the instructions that I found and my feet didn&#x27;t change. I tried it again a couple of days later and still nothing. My feet are not so bad to begin with, just a bit rough on the bottom of my big toe and some roughness on the corners of my heels. Well, I saw no difference. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Had similar results with a good lava pumice stone</li>
    <li> This callus remover works great! Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I would have hoped, but does improve my feet with some intense scrubbing.</li>
    <li> It says &amp;#34;professional use only,&amp;#34; which wasn&#x27;t part of the product description, and I can&#x27;t return it because it requires special handling. So, I tried to use it and it&#x27;s just an awful, funky mess. I&#x27;m not impressed. It doesn&#x27;t work according to the instructions, and I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This is good, but be careful and wear gloves when you apply it. I did not and it sort of removed my fingerprints. It was like a layer of my skin on my hands came off. It will work on your feet well. If you have thick calluses, you may have to apply it and wait a little longer than the 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product for getting rid of calluses.  I soak first, the rub it on heels, bottoms of feet and toes, wherever there is dry skin.  Love this.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  Will purchase it again!!!</li>
    <li> This product when used correctly worked very well.  I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Best product for calluses I have ever used. Orange is good.  I would like to  see lemon too!</li>
    <li> I blight this bc I used pay extra $15 to have my callus removed w a pedicure. I use it on my husbands feet once every three months n he loves it n I love it bc it makes our heels look as a baby&#x27;s feet again!!!! N it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
    <li> This really removes all the dead skin from your feet. Saves you money as you can easily do your pedicures at home and remove even the most thick and rough skin.</li>
    <li> Tried it and it didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m on my feet a lot so I had high expectations. Went back to using lotion with glycolic acid in it, like Eucerin.</li>
    <li> It really works!  Of all the things I&#x27;ve tried, this works best.  Only takes a few minutes.  Will buy again.  Thanks for offering this product.</li>
    <li> This works great! I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same stuff my pedicurist charges me extra for. I did my own pedicure at home, first I soaked my feet in very warm water then after 10 minutes I applied this great smelling callus eliminator, waited 5 minutes, rinsed off and used a foot file. My feet are baby soft and I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune.</li>
    <li> It works good, but makes my skin a little bit dry. I would not use it too often.</li>
    <li> i had really bad feet then i gave this stuff a try and my feet are no longer like sand paper. and i do not feel shame in being barefoot. it&#x27;s not as instant as i thought but after 2 uses my feet look and feel so much better.</li>
    <li> Let it sit on your foot a little longer if you have extra tough calluses. I had cracked heals and I was afraid it would burn I  the places where the skin was cut open but I didn&#x27;t even feel a tingle. This stuff is a gel and goes on easily but leaves that slippery chemical residue, kind of like what is left after you use a depilitory cream. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it&#x27;s super easy to use. Make sure you don&#x27;t try to stand in the tub or shower though with it on. It&#x27;s really slippery!</li>
    <li> people beware the picture shows 1 large botal; and 1 small you will receive 2 the same when a placwe does this can not be trusted i would say in the store i bet you have to count your change disappointed  BEWARE</li>
    <li> Well my heels are still attached so the word eliminator is a bit of a stretch</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and was worried I would not like it but once i got it i loved it (&#x3D; I always ask the spa what do they use and they as if its top secret, now i know why. This will save me $$$$$$</li>
    <li> really like does what it says</li>
    <li> oooooommmmmmmGGG!!!! this stuff is a miracle in a bottle. 3-5 minutes and a light scrub with a pumice stone to remove the skin and your feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s booty. I don&#x27;t like all the rough scrubbing and techniques used in salons so I used this before I go and just enjoy a foot soak, massage and manicured toes with cute polish.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Callus Eliminator as a last result. I go to get a pedicure every two weeks but my feet always seem to get very callussed on my last week before I&#x27;m due for a pedicure. I&#x27;m always a little embarrassed when I go to get my feet done and they have to scrub so much off my feet. I wanted to try to find the callus solution that they use at the salon before I went to go get my feet done. All I can say is that this product not only eliminated the callus, but it left my feet as soft and as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Im seriously thinking of not going to go get my feet done at the nail salon and save me some money. I spend so much every two weeks. Any way this is an awesome product that I will be purchasing on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not worth the time or the money.  It did absolutely nothing.  I did it three times, back to back, with no results.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower with a pumice stone and it takes care of most of the problem areas on my feet.  I use the original unscented version.</li>
    <li> It does remove the dead skin collecting at the heels, without removing any live skin.  I took a nice long shower, then applied the Callus Eliminator and wrapped in plastic wrap for 4 minutes (so I could walk around), then washed off with soap.  All the little sharp rough edges of dead skin were rubbed away with a pumice stone after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I still have some areas of thick callus on my heels - apparently they are still somewhat &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; i.e moist or attached, I don&#x27;t know what - only the truly dry dead outer layer was removed.  but that is a far cry better than any other instant method I&#x27;ve ever tried (from a spinning dremel grinder, to regular files, to microplane eggs).  For me, the longer acting methods (foot creams, nightly urea spray, silicone foot/heel socks) did bubkus.  The one longer acting method that did SOMETHING was Baby Foot - you soak in a booty for 3 hours, then 10 days later the outer few layers of skin peels off - this acted on both the dry layer that Callus took right off, as well as another layer or two of that heel callus deeper down.  In contrast when I have filed that same area in a quick fix, that callus became tender and sometimes more prone to splitting than when it was left hard and thick (ouch!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, there is no quick fix - this Callus Eliminator is probably the best while most gentle instant fix of just the top dry layer.  for reaching further layers, you have to put in the time with Baby Foot, and allow for the week to 10 day period while the skin it affected grows out and then sloughs off - this never caused my heel callus to become painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, that top dry layer was the most annoying because it was like little hooks that I could feel grabbing certain looped carpeting like little claws - or could feel scratchy of other feet/legs came into contact with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a really effective way to diminish the calluses faster and more permanently but it seems the only thing to do is constant maintenance - between Callus Eliminator for the scratchy outer layer and Baby Foot for the longer deeper slough, that&#x27;s about the only two options I&#x27;ve found.ms the only thing to do is constant maintenance - between Callus Eliminator for the scratchy outer layer and Baby Foot for the longer deeper slough, that&#x27;s about the only two options I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Product not what I expected it. I dont see any difference at all!!!</li>
    <li> I used this once exactly as directed and noticed no change. The other products I bought did the job so I didn&#x27;t even try this again.</li>
    <li> This works almost as well as the product at my favorite salon.  I use it after soaking my feet in a foot bath followed by a PedEgg since I have extemely dry thick calluses that crack and hurt if I don&#x27;t keep them under control.  It doesn&#x27;t burn and smells nice.  I really like this product and glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy a commercial size bottle at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> This worked okay. I did as the directions directed, and it did help remove some of the surface callus&#x27; but it wasn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;miraculous.&#x27; I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle, but won&#x27;t be buying anymore.</li>
    <li> I learned about the Callus Eliminator at the Nail Salon where they were charging $20.00 a bottle. I was releived to find it at Amazon for a very reasonable price. I used th eproduct and was very satisfied that it softened the dry skin on my heels and made it therefore easier to scrub off. I chose the mint scented one and was pleased that the medicinal scent wasn&#x27;t strong. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this product with the Mr. Pumice. It does wonders.  I let it sit for 5- 8 minutes, I do not experience burning sensation if the product was place on my skin then my foot bottom. Its a great product and does wonders.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It really works if you follow the directions to the letter. I&#x27;ve used several different types of callus removers, but this one amazed me. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this item. You will have soft feet again!</li>
    <li> ok first i stand on my feet 90% of the day. And most of the pressure goes to my left foot. so the back heel is forming a callus. I tried to just scrape it but its much thicker than expected. so with a little research i came across this. the directions say use gloves wich i highly recommed rough hands are not cute. after soaking in foot bath i applied some first its slippery. so be careful while pouring. within 5 min it worked fine rinsed it off the peeled back some layers of the callus. so yes it did what i needed. i think with 2 more atempts it will be all gone.</li>
    <li> This product works really well!  I followed instructions, totally takes off all the calluses.</li>
    <li> It made me a believer after one use. For those with extreme callus on your feet, it is best to soak properly but be very careful when applying if it gets on your skin, other than your feet, there will be some itching (sensitivity) and do wear gloves!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really is amazing!  I haven&#x27;t had a pedicure in over 2 years, since I&#x27;ve been living overseas, and haven&#x27;t found a good place.  I really had some buildup on my feet and finally gave this a try (I think I&#x27;ve had it used on me in the salons stateside).  Soaked my feet in hot water for 5 minutes, generously applied this to the callus area on both feet and let it set for another 5 minutes, then scrubbed it all off!  My feet haven&#x27;t been this smooth in a very long time!  I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough, worked exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Product works as described.Its good to get rid of unwanted callises</li>
