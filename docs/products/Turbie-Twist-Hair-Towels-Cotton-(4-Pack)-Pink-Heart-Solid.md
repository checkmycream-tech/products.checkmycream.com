      <li>I ordered based on the positive reviews and I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Quality is thicker than expected, which was good.</li>
      <li>Fun colors.</li>
      <li>I have been using a microfiber towel for several years, and I am SO glad I took a chance on this one... soft, absorbent cotton.... cute colors...</li>

      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>: I thought it would be more absorbent than the microfiber one, but it&#x27;s about the same.  </li>

      <li>They are also easy to use and stay in place on the head even through the night if necessary.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought these were the original microfiber wraps, but they are closer to a terrycloth. They are very very cute though and each individual wrap is in a pink mesh bag in case you are splitting up for gifts!</li>
    <li> Wife loves these and they&#x27;re not the cheap polyester ones.</li>
    <li> My original Turbie Twists finally wore out after a good 15 years of use.  These are exactly the same as my originals.  Great colors!</li>
    <li> Much more absorbent than the micro fiber.</li>
    <li> Love these! So much easier than using a towel ands it&#x27;s more comfortable. I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic twist towels! I ordered based on the positive reviews and I am not disappointed. I will be purchasing more for my girls for christmas. I don&#x27;t know how they would do for super long hair, my hair is just below my shoulders. They work perfect for me!  I did not receive free or reduced price for review, this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Love them! They stay on your head.  Only towels I use for my hair.</li>
    <li> These are definitely an improvement over towel-wrapping, but I&#x27;m disappointed in their absorption capacity.  I have short hair and these can&#x27;t really do the job.  I&#x27;m making the concession since I&#x27;m too frugal to chuck &#x27;em.  Ah, well...</li>
    <li> Love these!!! Wish they came in a variety pack of various colors- turbie twist is the brand to get! I have tried other brands and they are cheap and terrible</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, love them.</li>
    <li> Thicker and bigger than the microfiber turbie twist.  Good for longer hair</li>
    <li> Terry is so much better than microfiber for these twists. They are lRge enough for long hair. Very pleased</li>
    <li> She said there the best so far,</li>
    <li> great hair towels  I just love them</li>
    <li> So much better than a bulky towel; after washing my hair; stays in place and I can use it comfortably when I want to do a leave-in treatment overnight as I can sleep in it easily and keep product off my pillow.</li>
    <li> Had some of these years ago and they were getting too stretch out.  Love these new bright colored ones.  So much better than having to wrap a towel around your hair after your shower.</li>
    <li> Much better then the micro-fiber material.</li>
    <li> Very well made and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Fabulous service and I really like the 100% cotton as opposed to micro fiber</li>
    <li> Have worn these for years.  Love them!</li>
    <li> these pack of 4 get an 100% rating absolutely love these for this price I am so satisfied! great seller</li>
    <li> Love it, love it,  Love it</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find the cotton version if the turbie twist, I don&#x27;t care for the micro fiber ones ...loving my turbies</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love these.They are very absorbent and aloy easier than having a towel wrapped around your head.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have been using a microfiber towel for several years, and I am SO glad I took a chance on this one... soft, absorbent cotton.... cute colors... you can&#x27;t go wrong.  These are packaged nicely for gift-giving presentation.  You will not be sad you got these!  Oh, and the loop system works beautifully as well!  Update:  These have been in use by two girls in our home for over two years and we still love them!</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s bigger than the other one I have, but it doesn&#x27;t dry nearly as good as the other one. This one is terry and the other is microfiber. The microfiber one sucks out more water faster than the terry. Love the designs.</li>
    <li> These are just what I was expecting. They are 100% cotton which is what I wanted, they come in cute girly colors, and work great.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great!</li>
    <li> one cloth got a hole in it from being in the washing machine</li>
    <li> Bought all three, gave to both my daughter in laws, kept one for myself! Works great at cutting down drying time</li>
    <li> I have looked all over for the cotton turbie twist.  I do not like the microfiber.  These are just what I wanted!!  Some say 100% cotton but are the microfiber.  So if you are looking for the terry cloth turbie twist, you found it!</li>
    <li> Great gift for all your GalPals.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have long hair and use these daily! We love them. I ordered on Amazon because they were such a good deal!</li>
    <li> Very thick Cotton, very nice and made good. My only complaint would be, should be a little longer so the tail goes back to the botten of my head and maybe a button instead of elastic. I cannot find all cotton anywhere in the stores, found one at Publix, but was very thin material.</li>
    <li> For my wife.  Loves them!</li>
    <li> Love my Turbie Twist. Can&#x27;t wash my hair without them.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Quality is thicker than expected, which was good.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! And such great quality! Anyone that has long hair cannot live without these!</li>
    <li> Love the towels,however when I opened a new package one of the towels had a 2 inch hole in the seam!  I easily sewed it shut, but wa a little disappointed that quality control did not catch it.  I will by the product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Turbie Twist.  It is perfect for your hair -- not to long, not to short, just the right size.  I can never go back to just using a small towel.  Once you have tried the Turbie Twist, there is no turning back.  I received my first Turbie Twist as a gift.  Sat in my closet for weeks before I used it.  Once I used it, that was it -- cannot turn back to regular towels now.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Love these!  If you&#x27;re looking for cotton buy these.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the microfiber ones.  Many say cotton but aren&#x27;t.  These are not the prints/colors I would&#x27;ve picked but these were the only cotton ones I could find.  Have been using turbie twist for years and these are awesome!</li>
    <li> Based on the glowing reviews, I was expecting these hair towels to be the bomb.  So far I have tried them twice, and I have not found them to be more absorbent than a regular bath towel.  In fact, I found them to be less absorbent.  Maybe I am doing something wrong?  I left the towels on for at least 20 minutes, and when I removed the towel, my hair was still quite wet.  Also, $20 for 4 towels is a lot, for a product that does not really work all that great.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Turbie Twist from QVC years ago and absolutely love it !!  I have given them to my daughters and granddaughter. So happy to be able to re-order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Always the best. Needless to waste your money on other brands. All 4 came individually wrapped in satin bags. So cute even for a gift. My friend already took 2 and I&#x27;m ready to order my second set soon.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product! It works great and I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Love love these. Especially when my daughter was a toddler she could still run around with towel on without wet hair getting p.j&#x27;s wet.</li>
    <li> I like these...and they are pink! :) They do help with my long, wild, wacky, thick curly hair, too. My hair can stay wet for 24 hours and this has helped reduce the drying time and I love that they are light and not top heavy like when you use a regular towel. I simply squeeze out my hair as best as I can and wrap it up, then leave it for as long as I want to. I usually leave it while I dress, do my make-up and sometimes sit and sip a coffee, too, and it stays solid and secure the entire time. I also use one of these over a shower cap for deep conditioning, often for several hours and it works equally as well. I even used one for an overnight conditioning and woke in the morning to it still being secure...granted I am not an acrobat during sleep but I do toss and turn some. I wish I had bought these a lot sooner!</li>
    <li> I put it in the laundry on gentle cycle and one came apart on the seem. Other than that, I love the texture and design.</li>
    <li> Turbie&#x27;s are thicker than those previously purchased.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love.  So much better than a towel.  Fun colors.</li>
    <li> Nice thick material. Love the colors</li>
    <li> awesome hair towel and love the fact they&#x27;re 100% cotton!</li>
    <li> I had some twists that were microfiber and they just didn&#x27;t absorb well with my long hair.  These are PERFECT - wash up fluffy and soft but absorbent!  I will purchase again or give as gifts.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and wash your hair at night and sometimes need to crash with wet hair, you need these turbans.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR!!  They ARE cotton, SUPER absorbent, and NO MICROFIBER!  I cannot have microfiber anywhere near my hands, as it catches all the dry skin and just rips them up.  These are beautiful, as well as functional!  I am going to buy another set in case I can&#x27;t find these again when I wear out the ones I&#x27;m using.  They come wrapped very nicely and would make a lovely gift for someone with long thick hair!</li>
    <li> Love them!  Terry ones are so much better than micro!</li>
    <li> I love these.  My hair is thick and curly, sometimes long and sometimes shorter.  I&#x27;ve used these for years.</li>
    <li> Wish I  would have known about these years ago! Great, fun and convenient. Even my husband was impressed with them.</li>
    <li> My hair dries quickly!!  I spend less time blow drying my thick hair and am able to leave earlier.  Love my turnies!!!</li>
    <li> Love these!  My 7 year old and I both use them!</li>
    <li> Love my cotton  turbies !  they are thick, absorbant and cute heart design.  I had purchased the microfiber turbie at a local store and just dont find it to be absorbant and dont like the way it feels.  What can i say I just love Cotton. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this.  I have been using a hair towel for about 5 years and my old microfiber one got stains on it in the wash so I looked to replace it because I thought this could be more absorbent as the name claims.  here are the pros and cons in my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**PRO**&lt;br /&gt;-DESIGN: the pink hearts are cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**CONS**&lt;br /&gt;- BAND INSTEAD OF BUTTON: my old towel had a button to secure and I prefer this.  it was fast and easy and no time was spent pulling and tucking into a band&lt;br /&gt;- NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR LONG HAIR: my hair is medium thick and down to my bra-line.  it fits in the towel initially, however, when I secure it by tucking it into the band in back, it&#x27;s too tight and in order to even tuck the towel into the band, it pulls the towel off of my hairline by my forehead a few inches.  if they had a version that were 3&amp;#34; longer for longer locks it could work.  but I prefer the button method regardless.&lt;br /&gt;- NOT THAT ABSORBENT: I thought it would be more absorbent than the microfiber one, but it&#x27;s about the same.  even after my hair is in it for 5 minutes, when I take it off, my hair still drips water down my back.</li>
    <li> Bought these as what is the new turbie appears to be microfiber.  I love the cotton ones.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughters can manage these on their own and I was so happy to see prints which make them more interesting for kids.</li>
    <li> These terry towel turbans are the best on the market.  They are super absorbent and fit nicely on any head.  My daughter is 9 and we swap ours constantly.  They are also easy to use and stay in place on the head even through the night if necessary.  They do not shrink a lot in the dryer and stay good - wash after wash.  I would recommend them to everyone.</li>
