<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this from &amp;#34;Beauty it is&amp;#34; and am almost 100% sure it is either old or fake. I have been using fake bake for a while now and have never had any issues. However, the bottle I received this time, the spray itself came out very speckly/spotty  and was hard to rub in evenly.  Additionally, the mitt itself shed horrible on my skin, messing up the tan. I had to use one of my older mitts, which worked just fine. I ended up jumping in the shower before it could process much on my skin because I was worried how it would look when it dried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fake Bake for a few years now, and finally tried the Flawless Darker product. For me the guide color IS darker than original Flawless, but when I shower off the guide color I get the same shade of tan as I did with the original. I actually paid less for this than for the original formula, so this was okay with me. Also, when I apply it in the morning after showering (and exfoliating), I do appear to have a darker tan due to the guide color for the rest of the day. One tip for a darker look is that I do not use the velvety mitt that comes with the product. I just spray directly onto my legs and rub in with a rubber gloved hand. I felt the mitt was soaking up too much of the product and not leaving enough on my skin. Still loving the Fake Bake! It really delivers and even, natural tan every time.</li>
    <li> Works really well and is not to dark on my fair skin. Easy to apply. Im a red head and it blended nicely</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely great.  The scent, application and formula is perfect.  I often mixed this with the original formula and light skin glows.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Color is great and no more taking time out of the day to go to a salon to spray and feel all sticky. Really great product.</li>
    <li> This is by far my absolute favorite self-tanner. I love it more than all others. It gives an even, natural, dark color to my fair-light skintone, and makes me look like less of a crazy person who sits in a basement all day without actually exposing me to harmful rays. It doesn&#x27;t streak, doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes (too much, that is. When you just apply it, it&#x27;s gonna be a little messy, as anything probably would, but that&#x27;s life for ya), and doesn&#x27;t smell bad or irritate my ultra-sensitive skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice brown tan and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Results are just as good and smooth as the regular (not-DARKER) version. I am a very fair redhead and was worried that this color might be too dark, but decided to try it anyway. I&#x27;m SO glad I did - the results as even, beautiful and natural as the regular version. And not too dark, but definitely a hint darker. I love this product. It&#x27;s saved me hundreds of dollars over getting spray-on tans at salons and is SO fast and easy to use. If it&#x27;s your first time, go on youtube and find people who demo how to use the product. :-)</li>
    <li> Very good product for needing a instant tan boost! BUT, I have the original fake bake flawless in the purple box and I have to say there is absolutely no difference in color :( all the fake bakes smell the same and it&#x27;s not a bad smell, I personally think it smells like Malibu rum.. I don&#x27;t recommend putting this on your legs it leaves red dots all over because it sinks in ur pores from shaving an just looks horrible like chicken pocks. I still think fake bake is the best self Tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried but don&#x27;t think ur getting more color for the price of this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best product by fake bake... It get you the darkest</li>
    <li> Product as described. Overall good experience so far.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply with beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Most natural self tanner I have found. Just wish it would stay as dark after you wash the color guard off. I will continue to buy this!</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner. The smell is nice, very tropical ( that does wear off after a few hours and smells much more chemically) but the color is nice and lasts about 5 days. I will definitely buy more when this runs out!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Smells good, dries instantly and no ;streaks.</li>
    <li> I loved how this is darker then the fake and bake original. It was a perfect step up for me. But... After a couple of days the color starts to fade/peel off. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about that. I looked like I had a skin condition whereas my skin was losing poignant in places.</li>
    <li> This had such great reviews, and with the price how could I pass it up?  I&#x27;m not a novice when it comes to self tanning, but this left me streaky, smelled funny and looked awful on my olive toned skin, I looked orange.  It also was terrible to apply and got everywhere.  I&#x27;m going to stick with my St. Tropez self tanner from now on.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Not too dark!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife,  she loves it so far.</li>
    <li> This is the first self tanner I have ever used that does not have the Orange undertone that most other self tanners have. This product looks like a natural beautiful tan, not orangey looking at all. It is super easy to apply and looks great by morning (I apply at night and shower in the morning).</li>
    <li> Nice dark color and streak free application (I used a sunless tanning mit for application) only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the nice color it leaves, about 80% washes off with a shower. Have to reapply daily to stay dark.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Looks great after one or two applications and lasts a couple of days.  Looks super natural as well.  I have a Pinkish tone skin which fair.  This gives me a little healthy looking glow !</li>
    <li> I love the color, I am already very tan. I use this to get darker before events like concerts and weddings. Anytime I want some extra color. I love fake bake and I will continue to buy Fake Bake products :)</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I am an avid self tanner and have been for 15 years.  This is hands-down, the best self tanner I have ever used.  No orange, no streaking, just beautiful golden color.  Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT !!!! I will buy this item again thank god I brought 2 of them cus I got them at a good price shipping was fast it feels like I order them yesturday that&#x27;s how fast I got them I love love love it ugh I want more already :)))))</li>
    <li> This is my favorite self tanner. I have tried most all on the market, this by far is the best</li>
    <li> I LOVE fake bake. I use this more during the winter when I&#x27;m not tanning and I always get compliments on my tan and questions on how I keep my tan. I am a natural olive tone, and I get a beautiful bronze color. Never had issues with orange color or streaking. I get best results when I exfoliate and moisturize the day before then applying this right after a shower the next day.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT recommend this product (or Fake Bake) to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a nice, dark color.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Basically all washes off in the shower after waiting 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-It rubs off on everything!&lt;br /&gt;-Even after exfoliating, the color is patchy.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Fake Bake regarding my concerns on a product. It took them over a month after my constant tries to contact them for me to even get a reply! Once I did get a reply, they were downright condescending and insulting. Based on my experience, I do not recommend Fake Bake as a company, and I do not recommend this product at all. I will take my hard-earned money to a company who deserves it and has better products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I got in contact with a Fake Bake representative (mary@fakebake.com) and she stated, and I quote,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;We do not sell to Amazon or support their website so your Amazon account would not be of any interest to us.  We will not back any product sold on their website or  E-Bay.&lt;br /&gt;Mary  Customer Service\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clearly says to me that these products could be fake! Beware! It says \\&quot;by Fake Bake\\&quot; but she refused to assist me with my issue because these are not their products.</li>
    <li> fantastic, not orange at all</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner that won&#x27;t make your skin turn orange. I get compliments all the time, and people are always surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s a self tanner. I have fair skin/red hair and it still looks very natural. I do however prefer the original though, solely because of the smell. While this smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some other self-tanners out there, it is much stronger than the original and lingers after a shower.</li>
    <li> Easiest way to get the suntanned look without sacrificing your skin.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be essentially the same as Fake Bake Flawless. It didn&#x27;t seem to make me any darker. It also may just be that the product is old, since that seems to be a common occurrence with self tanners that are sold on Amazon. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Easy applitcation (which i absolutely love) I do wish it was a little darker, but it still gives a very olive brown color. Not orange at all! Last about a week and a half, then starts to fade.&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m not sure if any one else had a problem with the pump on the bottle, but unfortunatly i did... so i had to poor the solution on to the mit and then rub it in....(which makes it a little messy)</li>
    <li> I LOVE fake bake flawless tan I will be ordering more when im almost out it is such a beautiful narural look for the price amd the MIT and rubber gloves that come with are wonderful that glove mixes it in my skin so beautiful thank you so much!!!!!</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve only had it since yesterday, and I&#x27;m darker than I&#x27;ve been all summer between Friday and Saturday afternoon.  I usually use Jergens Natural Glow- 3 Days to Glow, but I wanted to experiment.  This stuff is great.  I get an occasional faint whiff of that DHA, but not much.  The tropical scent it has lasts a day at least too.  It&#x27;s nice and brown, not a warm brown like other tanners.  I know they have a face-specific formula, but I really like it, so I might try it on my face, because you know.... YOLO.</li>
    <li> I will stick with original one. This isn&#x27;t the same nice color. It&#x27;s one of the worst self tanners I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used many!&lt;br /&gt; I also like Body Drench ( spray med dark) as my go to self tanner. Yes , it&#x27;s the messiest thing ever, BUT gives the most natural gorgeous color. So, this will get tossed, it&#x27;s that bad. I will use the Orginal FB flawless on &amp; off, just not this one.&lt;br /&gt;  Has an unnatural , splotchy color unlike the original.&lt;br /&gt;Jenn</li>
    <li> Great natural color. A reddish brown, very nice. I&#x27;ve always used Flawless and loved it but had an issue with the smell so I would only do about 2 applications a week. Darker smells soooooo much better. Not bad AT ALL. Application is easy, dries super fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting the flawless and wanting a darker tan. Works exactly the same for me. Still just average. I&#x27;d be better off paying for a spray tan</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars because it is amazing but it doesn&#x27;t last and if it rains or you get wet you get water marks</li>
    <li> I love Fake Bake. Most natural looking of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  Only thing better would be a natural tan and that is not happening for me.  If used properly!!!!! It works.</li>
    <li> I love this, the normal fake bake flawless was great too, but it didnt get me as dark as I wanted to be ,, so I got  this one , and it does the trick :)</li>
    <li> As someone with fair skin this was not that best choice for me as it did turn slightly orange after a few days. However, the smell is fabulous (unlike most other self tanners) and the application is a breeze. I will most likely try the original formula instead of this &amp;#34;Darker&amp;#34; version as I think it will flatter my skin tone more. I would definitely imagine this would work amazing on people who natural skin tone is slightly darker and are looking for that bronze look. For my fellow fair ladies  or gentleman I would skip this and purchase the original formula.</li>
    <li> Why have I been wasting so much time with lotions?? For self tanner this is the only way to go!</li>
    <li> i have used this stuff a couple times...just got it...im pretty happy with it.....everytime i put it on...i apply it better....make sense...it is simple to do...it dries instantly....the price is great......i think i will try extreme next.......</li>
    <li> Great color and easy application. Everyone thought I spent a lot of time in the sun, which is exactly what we are going for right? :-)</li>
    <li> This is hands down one of the best fake tans I&#x27;ve used. There&#x27;s virtually no smell even when it&#x27;s start to develop it&#x27;s barely noticeable. The guide color is beautiful and I even put it on in the morning and wear during the day because the guide color looks like a tan on its own. The mitt is really great in creating an even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still having some problems with putting this on my feet and hands (I&#x27;ve given up on my feet and use makeup to match the rest of the body, so much less hassle).</li>
    <li> Just the color I wanted when first applied but unhappy when I showered in the morning and saw most of the color go down the drain plus it felt very drying and uncomfortable during the night. I will return to Banana Boat Dark as I prefer the lotion feel.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite self tanner. I love the smell - pleasant - not the typical chicken teriyaki type smell you get with self tanning lotions. I use this in between using Vita Liberata which is nearly $40 per bottle at Sephora. I recommend wearing a glove under the mitt to prevent staining your hand. I spray directly on my skin and then smooth out over the area. I do this in my bathroom - usually standing in the shower area to prevent spraying my walls and just going everywhere. Do not get your skin wet after application. You will be streaky. Do this at night and then go to bed - let it develop on your skin overnight and shower as normal in the morning.</li>
    <li> I usually put it on at night before bed.. In the morning I jump in the shower to rinse off and when I get out the color is perfect.. I never see any streaks and because of the mitt u don&#x27;t have to worry about Orange hands. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, though I still like the original better.</li>
    <li> Awesome, works perfect, looks natural!</li>
    <li> I used this product multiple times in order to give it a shot. I have pretty fair skin, so any self tanner usually shows up. I got this darker formula after reading how dark the original Fake Bake Flawless was. However, this one didn&#x27;t give me ANY color at all. After 8 hours of leaving this product on, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I had a self tanner on. It did absolutely nothing. I&#x27;m really disappointed because I wanted to like this product and paid good money for it. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is because it comes with a mitt and gloves. This product failed to work so badly that I&#x27;m wondering if I received a defective or expired product. Really disappointed, I&#x27;ll probably just dump it down the sink.</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular Fake Bake Flawless and love it, so I decided to try this out to work on getting a darker tan.  It doesn&#x27;t really give you a darker tan, it just makes you look like you have a skin disorder.  It actually make me look really gross.  I think I will stick with the regular.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t wear off very well, gets pretty patchy around ankles, hands, and armpit/chest area. Not really any darker than the original. Gives good color but wears off so quickly. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great color but all seems to wash off in the shower.  😕</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to the regular Fake Bake after using this one.  I have been an avid self tanning user for over a decade and after reading so many great reviews I thought I would try this one out.  When I first applied it, it didn&#x27;t look bad but then an hour later I realized how blotchy and streaky it was even though I had showered, exfoliated and shaved like I always do before using one.  I also have to say that the color was more red toned than anything and almost looked like I had a burnt-tan going on which is not attractive.  Feel free to try it out but I will never purchase this tanner again.</li>
    <li> This goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have much smell, and the smell it does have isn&#x27;t the bad, tanning smell, but somewhat tropical, and doesn&#x27;t linger forever.  It doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, but rather a nice brown, but doesn&#x27;t get me quite as dark as I would have hoped, so I do have to apply it several times, but I will probably order it again.  Seems to last fairly well.</li>
    <li> It gives your skin a nice color. When you apply it it really has a nice tropical smell  but the next day it&#x27;s the same smell like any other self tanning lotion. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Love it, best so far. It is not streaky, color is just nice tan not orange. Simple application and a little goes a long way. I spray it on the MIT and not directly to my skin to avoid uneven color.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is - it does not wear off even, and need to be very gentle with application on your knees, elbows and ankles. I do not even use it on my knees, just very dry skin and because of that color gets super dark and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase again!!! 5 stars</li>
    <li> I love Fake Bake Flawless! I&#x27;ve used the regular Flawless a million times and it&#x27;s great! Beautiful color and easy application. There is no orange color and it is easy to apply without streaks or splotchy-ness. I got the Flawless Darker for my legs because I like them to be extra dark and they are always hard to keep tanned. This product is awesome! Same color just more intense, but definitely not too, crazy dark. Just perfect for my legs! I recommend both Flawless and Flawless Darker.</li>
    <li> By FAR the best tanning solution I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot). I am pale, (alabaster/fair skinned) and when I go in the sun, I tend to burn as most pale people do. When I have tried other sun-less tanning solutions I wound up orange, dirty looking or splotchy. This does NOT do those things. It is spot on to a natural tan and the color guide makes application easier than you can imagine. I will use this product every summer now without question. :D</li>
    <li> best sunless tanner ive ever used. ive been tanning for 12 years and this stuff is amazng. smells like coconut, dries super fast and coes on great!!!! im obsesssssssssed</li>
    <li> Great product, use it all the time, streak free, easy and fast application, dries instantly. Also has very natural color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item awhile back during the winter when I was not able to tan outside or get to the tanning salon. I am fair skinned so I was concerned about how this would turn out. I would definitely recommend this self tanner to others. It left me with a rich dark tan, no orange color. It came with a mitt, so you can apply evenly without streaks and without getting it all over your hands. Has a great fragrance and I&#x27;ve gotten many uses since you dont need very much product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click yes below:)</li>
    <li> great color but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I love it. It makes me look very dark and I have no streaks this product is wonderful and it was shipped in a timely manner great seller I would definitely recommend friends and family.</li>
    <li> Application couldn&#x27;t be easier, blends out flawlessly! This is the first self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am very fair so I will need to do another application but  I am happy with the bit of color that I got and how there is no streaks or blotches whatsoever. A+</li>
    <li> I have olive skin after applying once i loved the color showed up right away looks natural I also used it on a friend with lighter skin than me also looked very natural no orange residue I will buy this again worth the money fast and cheaper than spray tan (First photo was one application second was after twice same day after it dried)</li>
    <li> The item shipped fast and was as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend NOT applying before you go to bed, like many people suggest. When I used this before bed I would sweat or rub off the color before it could set, in places like the crook of my knees and elbows, and between my breasts.</li>
    <li> Good color pay off but doesn&#x27;t last more than about two days. Hard to work with at first but u get used to it after a few uses. I love it and will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> It took forever to get here but I love the product. Best self tanner I have ever used! It doesn&#x27;t smell awful like most self tanners do and it&#x27;s not orange at all.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. The second time I used the mitt, tiny brown spots would show up on my skin, but didn&#x27;t stay. I just scrape the mitt now after I&#x27;ve used it. Just keep moisturized and remember to remove excess color with exfoliator and it&#x27;s just about the best tanning product you can get!</li>
    <li> its too thin,get all over everything</li>
    <li> First time using this product and I love it! I had read some reviews that it rubbed off onto clothing or sheets even after drying but I did not have a problem with that.  I did have to do two applications to get the color that I wanted but it was streak free and looked natural.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fake tanning junkie - like I have tried everything on the market, St. Tropez extra dark, Million Dollar Tan, the regular color Fake Bake Flawless, all the L&#x27;Oreal sprays and all drugstore gels and lotions, and this is seriously the best. It&#x27;s by far the easiest to apply and you won&#x27;t get streaks, and when you wash off the color guard in the morning the entire tan doesn&#x27;t wash off (I&#x27;m talking to you St. Tropez). The color is almost the same color or darker as the color guide when you put it on the night before. I even go bold and use this on my face, but I&#x27;d only recommend that for seasoned fake tanners though. Seriously get this stuff, it&#x27;s way less expensive compared to most self-tanners but it&#x27;s easily the best.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of fake bake products!!! I started out with the regular fake bake flawless and I loved it!!! It made me look darker then going tanning!!! I wanted a little boost up so I bought this one and also purchased the fake bake oil lotion \\&quot;darker\\&quot;, and the fake bake air spray tan mist (gold bottle). These products have been a miracle!!! I am addicted to tanning and using these really helps my addiction! Lol! After applying I can notice a huge difference! Like I&#x27;ve been tanning for 2 weeks!!! No foul smell, I usually apply after my shower in the morning. I would recommend using lotion before you apply or else the color will soak into all your dry skin and leave you with blotches. If you don&#x27;t apply lotion regularly I would probably apply for a week before using this because one night isn&#x27;t going to take away dry skin. This product leaves a deep glowing color that is to die for!!! Looks so natural!! Everyone always asks me if I tan and I tell them I do self tanner instead and they can&#x27;t believe it! Truly amazing!!! No streaks and don&#x27;t go waste your money on a $45 bottle!!! This works and had absolutely no orange color!!! Definitely a buy!</li>
    <li> Tried it- finally, now that summers here. Couple things- VERY IMPORTANT- first, you have to exfoliate your skin first- take a bath, shower, shave, scrub etc. Then after drying off- put a thin layer of regular lotion on your elbows, knees, heels, around feet, tops of feet, hands and fingers- some on your neck too. If you don&#x27;t do this carefully first-  you will get streaks and unevenness- but, if you follow those steps you can spray multiple layers on and get a nice dark tan!</li>
    <li> Hands down the absolute best and most natural looking self tanner on the market.  Take it from someone who has tried it all!</li>
    <li> Dries fast, not sticky. Good color, looks natural. Fades away nicely, not patchy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Produces a deep, dark, rich natural bronze glow. I layered it. Washed it off every few hours and applied more. I did this about 3 or 4 times and it looks fantastic. I have tried all Fake Bake products and this one is my FAVORITE!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! So easy to use! No mess!</li>
    <li> Color is perfect. Very natural. Product is Very messy though. Also, I would not apply to my face with the mitt.  I would use a makeupbrush for a more natural look</li>
    <li> I really wanted this stuff to work. I read really good reviews about it but I look a mess right now. I researched so much to make sure I did everything right. I took a shower, exfoliated, and moisterized. I spraid on so many layers and I&#x27;m still the same color I was before. Except my face... So now I just look scary because my face is dark and my body is white. It looks even worse because around my eyes and mouth it&#x27;s white even though I made sure to get those areas. The smell is nice though. But it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I think it works best for people who are already tan. Why a spray tan wouldn&#x27;t work on a type of people it&#x27;s made for I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Love all Fake Bake products that I have tried.  I use Flawless and the original Lotion alternately and feel it gives me a great tan appearance and no orange.  The dark color makes applying evenly easy.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner hands down!</li>
    <li> Never been darker. I bathed really well and exfoliated, dried off and applied the Fake Bake to set in overnight and WOW!! I was very dark- I looked like I had just come back from an extended stay on the islands! No fading, no streaking! Loved this! And I still was tan for an entire week!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Does not make u look orange at all, gives you a nice tan  and makes you feel beautiful! Odor isn&#x27;t bad, the glove kinda falls apart  when using but I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m one of those people that, if I read a bad review, even several bad reviews lol I&#x27;ll still question what the product is really like, so I have to try it out myself! Got this about a month and a half ago and have been using it religiously, not because I love it, but I bought 2 bottles haha that&#x27;s how much I wanted to believe in this product. So for the product, it gives a great instant dark even tan, but beware, it washes off even after the 1st shower. I&#x27;ve even went a full day and showered the next night and still, it all washed off. The product does last long though which is an awesome thing, I&#x27;ve used it about 2- 3x a week for about a month and a half (full body) and still have about an inch or two left at the bottom of the bottle... Ugh still have one more bottle to go lol. I probably will NEVER buy this again. A full day after wearing this, my brothers dog licked my leg and completely took the tan off hahaha how EMBARRASSING... A huge light smeared patch on my leg! Or I&#x27;ll be washing my hands or dealing with water and a drop will like run down my arm, then I have instant &amp;#34;water lines&amp;#34; running down my arm lol. Anyway if your like me, you&#x27;ll read my comment because you don&#x27;t want to purchase a bad product but then you&#x27;ll try it because you need to see for yourself... Of course that&#x27;s up to you buttttt I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t try it!!!! It really does suck</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It lasts a long time. Never had any streaks and looks like a dark deep island tan. I wash the mitt after each use. It will prolong the life of the application mitt. My first bottle I didn&#x27;t do that and the mitt got nasty so I had to throw it away. This product goes on so easily and dries quickly with little to no smell</li>
    <li> I love this it&#x27;s the first tanner I&#x27;ve used. Since I&#x27;m a beginner I got a lot of streaks and dark spots that look like birthmarks but hopefully over continual use I&#x27;ll learn how to avoid that. It really helped that i had a base tan. It&#x27;s perfect for winter tanning without weird salons or the sun. Which ofc isn&#x27;t available all winter. In short I like it alot;)</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular fake bake for a long time, decided to try this. To me it was practically the same thing just the colour was a bit different. Good product but I will probably stick to the normal stuff from here on out.</li>
    <li> My holy grail tanning product!! I have been continually re-purchasing this product for years. I love that the price is WAY cheaper than buying directly from ultra. This product does not streak, but you must rub it in fast and watch for spray drops that miss your mitt on your feet lol, (whoops) I love the color this gives, very natural brown color not orange or red. Also, this last 5-7 days for me. I can get about 10 applications from one bottle.</li>
    <li> Always getting compliments on my tan!  Easy to use, no smell, dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Awesome! But I feel like it sits in my pores a bit.  It lasts about 3 days, but it looks great!</li>
    <li> Fake bake is my favorite self tanning product, but this particular version is misleading. The tan you get is not darker than with regular fake bake, but the color guide when you apply it appears darker. Once you wash it off, however, the results are the same.</li>
    <li> Good color but does not last long at all.</li>
    <li> Love! Closest thing to a salon spray tan I&#x27;ve tried. Goes on great. Non greesy. Good smell. Instantly  dries within few mins . Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> fast shipping! Fantastic product! No orange, No bad smell, just a nice deep dark tan!</li>
    <li> This product is great, Even tan no orange color at all. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Best self tanner I have ever used.  Went on smooth- no streaks. Application glove made it easy to use &amp; check coverage. No smell or sticky skin.  Just bought 2 more.</li>
    <li> Came fast in the mail. Dries fast, but do recommend washing up the next morning to get off that top layer. Definitely need to use every 2 days to maintain the color, but for the price is well worth it. I rotate this with St Tropez express mousse, sometimes together and get an awesome color. I put this on top for the fast drying effect. Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Ive tried every self tanner out there. Drug Store and high end. This is my absolute favorite! Great color. I use the darker for my body, and the orgignal color in the purple bottle for my face, hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Awesome color, deep brown for those of us with olive skin. It&#x27;s the most natural and deep tan I have ever been able to find through bottles,  lotions,  sprays or beds! And by far the easiest application ever! Follow the instructions and you are good to go, no fear tanning -  FINALLY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/29/15 - Still LOVING this Fake Bake Flawless Darker! My mom and sister now use it too. I love that I can use this on my face, wear it out and rinse it off at night, having a natural looking tan. It dries so quickly I have started using it as makeup instead of concealer on my face and decollete. And I can use it on my pasty white feet and instantly have a healthy looking tan from the sun. (I am one who believes sun-kissed is healthier looking than transparent ghostly white - my opinion only). BEFORE BEGINNING, DON&#x27;T FORGET TO SNIP THE BOTTOM OF THE SPRAY TUBING SO THAT IT JUST REACHES THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE.  Also, RINSE YOUR MITT AFTER EVERY USE. I use the kitchen sink sprayer so I don&#x27;t have to get my just-tanned hands wet.</li>
    <li> This product offers you a nice golden color, the only problem that I have with this product is I think its a bit messy..</li>
    <li> I have always been the type of person to throw caution to the breeze when it comes to my personal health. It seemed ludicrous to me that at 21 years old I could get skin cancer from a tanning bed, so I just didn&#x27;t worry too much about it. Then, I started reading articles written by people just like me who got skin cancer because they didn&#x27;t care enough not to and it was TERRIFYING. That&#x27;s when the Googling began. First, I tried a cheaper, Walmart self-tanner called Neutrogena Build-A-Tan and if you are like me (a broke college student), it will honestly work just fine. It is not horribly orange and it gives you a nice, even color. However, the fade on it is a little rough so you have to keep up on it diligently. Because I am in this for the long haul, I thought I should try to find a more long-term solution. That is when I started to read about Fake Bake Flawless Darker. Originally, I was going to buy it at Ulta, but the cost on Amazon is literally HALF THE PRICE. Beware of beauty store prices. Anyway, on to my actual experience with the product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING. My 60 year old coworker is buying it after seeing how great it looks. The color is perfectly brown, which makes the tan look completely natural. I honestly spend so much time just staring at my skin in complete awe. It is a very moisturizing product on its own and I haven&#x27;t even been exfoliating or moisturizing at all beforehand, so I have been really impressed with the coverage and how even the color is without. You do have to take your time applying, which I learned the hard way. The color guide is VERY helpful but if you just whip it on like you would a lotion, without paying much attention to where you have been, chances are you will miss some spots. I woke up the morning after applying with a few larger spots completely white next to my fake bake, but they evened out after another application that evening so it was not a total tragedy. But seriously - the color is perfect. I am ghost white so most self-tanners do end up a little yellow or orange on me but after two applications, I look like I just got back from a week long vacation in the Domincan and I did not have to risk getting sun cancer to do it! It is never too late to start caring about the health of your skin, and this product is proof that you can do it without sacrificing that beautiful, slimming bronze glow we are all chasing after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for the (very few) downsides of the product. Be VERY careful of what you wear / lay on after applying and even after you have rinsed the product off for the first time. The guide especially tends to transfer onto fabric but even after your first rinse of the guide, there can be trouble. For me, a big issue was a mix of the Fake Bake and my habit of sweating a lot in the summer heat while I sleep. The moisture combines with the color and just leaks all over. Worst part: I have totally white sheets! But the product seems to wash out of the fabric with relative ease so again, not a total tragedy. Other minor issues I have had are really more of my own inexperience / lack of common sense. I have to exfoliate every other day and of course, exfoliating does not help maintain a self-tan at all. My solution to this has been to buy the Fake Bake face tanning lotion so that I can apply it daily and still be able to exfoliate without worrying that I will look like a mime (although that one is currently in the mail, so do not quote me on its success). Also, shaving your legs peels some of the color off, but not so bad that you should absolutely avoid it. I shaved only my calves and it brought me down about half a shade, so my plan is to only shave weekly, right before I apply the Fake Bake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine a better self-tanner. I highly, highly recommend at least giving this one a shot. At less than $20 for 6 oz. that will honestly last quite a while, it is a total deal and you WILL NOT regret it.white so most self-tanners do end up a little yellow or orange on me but after two applications, I look like I just got back from a week long vacation in the Domincan and I did not have to risk getting sun cancer to do it!

    <li> Pretty good product!! It does tend to streak and look cheap after a little while of wearing it. Overall good!</li>
    <li> OK I literally have way too much to say about this stuff but SPOILER: you will buy this after you finish reading this. This stuff is incredible. Like I can&#x27;t even begin to explain. So I was online looking for a self tanner..came across a few &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; products then found this which I&#x27;ve never even heard of but the #of reviews and how every single one of them raved about it I was sold..in fact I bought the original and the darker version because I couldn&#x27;t decide. Right off the bat I&#x27;m going to say that I would recommened the darker one just because I am pretty pale and the darker one is just less time consuming for me. They literally are the same exact product I see 0 difference in any aspect of the product between the two besides it actually being darker. With the darker one I apply 1 coat and I&#x27;m good the original took about 2-3ish coats. You can always build on it either right after ur first application or the next day it still looks great! It has the most undetectable scent it&#x27;s like a mix of coconut and vanilla but I have to put my arm to my nose to get a good smell in lol. The color is incredible I feel like it&#x27;s tailored to my exact skin tone because I look the way I do after I&#x27;ve spent a week at the beach (without the sunburn) AND my teeth look SOOO white. After my first application I went downstairs without telling my mom that I tried out my new holy grail (we are beauty fanatics and bffs) I came outside and she sat up and said HOLY CRAP YOUR SKIN IS GLOWING IT LOOKS AMAZING AND YOUR TEETH...YOUR TEETH THEY LOOK AMAZING. Two minutes later it was on her and 5 minutes later she bought it lol. Seriously amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the mitt is also incredible. I&#x27;ve never had such an easy application and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hands looking rediculous.&lt;br /&gt;Like seriously why is there even any other tanning products out there? They should all be put to shame after seeing how this thing works... I honestly feel like it&#x27;s a steal the price is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Im not too sure what the gloves are for so they could be for this purpose but I will say it anyway. When I opened the box I literally threw the gloves to the side and didn&#x27;t give it a second thought. AFter the first application I wasn&#x27;t so quick to throw them out...the mitt moves around during application ..a lot. It&#x27;s a little annoying bc you have to go quick or else it will dry and be hard to blend. So the gloves create a nice friction that keep the mitt on pretty much completely throughout the process and it solved my problem&lt;br /&gt;If I were to really try to find a con the only possible thing that I could say is that the bottle could use a little updating. I&#x27;m not sure what is happening but it does leak on me and the spritzer could definetly be upgraded bc although the application process is simple and easy it is messy and if I applied it anywhere but my shower I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to write this review bc I would be dead due to the amount of stains this would put in my house. So DO IT IN THE SHOWER OR U WILL REGRET IT. But I do believe that is a bottle issue it just doesn&#x27;t always work out that great and it gets everywhere&lt;br /&gt;But all in all that doesn&#x27;t even phase me bc I seriously am head over heals for this product.

    <li> After doing a ton of research, I decided to purchase this and I&#x27;m so happy I did!  I&#x27;d been using Loreal&#x27;s Sublime gel tanner.  It worked alright but wasn&#x27;t as dark as I wanted and had a really bad odor to it.  I chose to purchase this because the reviews on YouTube said it worked well for medium skin and there was no smell.  I also liked that it had a built in bronzer so I could see where I was applying it.  I put 2 coats on the day I received it and 2 days later I still have an excellent brown &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  I even had people ask if I have been tanning!  It was not hard to apply and is not blotchy.  It comes with an applicator mitt.  This smells like tanning lotion, not the minerally metalic smell you get with drugstore brand self tanners.  I&#x27;m so happy I got this.  For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Gave me great color. No streaks. Doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes and stayed dark for a long time. Totally addicted to this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used every self tanner out there. I am not kidding from ones that are five dollars to those that are $100. Those coming directly from Australia and England as well. This one dries fast and smells good. It leaves you bronze and not orange. I do not use the spray bottle included. I dump the solution into a mousse bottle, which makes it come out as foam and makes it a lot less messy.</li>
    <li> I am as white a woman can be, with fair complex and freckles . I usually use the flawless regular (which I love) but since I am so pale it does not make me as sun kissed as I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this darker version despite some of  the complains about not been darker than the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;Well,  I  did not have high hopes but I figured  I will give it a try, i only applied to my legs last night and I woke up this morning sun kissed ,  my legs look darker  than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Love fake and bake products, I used to have the membership to the tanning salon (59.99 a month) but since I discovered fake and bake, I now get tan for a fraction of the $ and it smells better than the salon products too.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! Super dark tan on this pasty white girl! 2x&#x27;s/wk: I do two coats at night, shower in morning, follow with Loreal sublime glow moisturizer. MUST exfoliate before you begin! I&#x27;ve had tons of compliments on my tan!</li>
    <li> I love this tanner! It&#x27;s one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried so far. Took a bit of time to come in, but I would buy it from this seller again. It is the most natural looking self-tanner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> It does what is says, and says what it does. Personally, I should have ordered a lighter shade. But even the dark looked nice, just very dramatic for a ghost to become a tropical native</li>
    <li> My husband is glad I found this -- I can stop tanning now! He&#x27;s been bugging me about it for a couple of years but I just HATE being pale. There is nothing more to bust a woman&#x27;s confidence than a wonderful bronze glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-PRICE! I was paying $25/month for a tanning membership. Boom sauce.&lt;br /&gt;-Works quickly. I do it at night after my shower, wake up in the morning a quick rinse and I&#x27;m set (I never saw any product wash off in the AM)&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t smell that bad - it definitely has a scent. I dont particularity like smelly things - I dont like the smell, but I dont not like it.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Blends amazingly!!!!! This stuff works better than the professional Versa-Spa spray tanning beds I&#x27;ve used. No spotting, no weird marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t get that dark on the first application. Probably because i&#x27;m already pretty tan. Hopefully once I pale out I can use this and see more of a difference&lt;br /&gt;-Dried me out. BIG TIME! I was itchy all over because my legs got so dry. Even after lathering on a ton of lotion. Another downside of not tanning anymore :/&lt;br /&gt;-Mitt can shed IF you don&#x27;t wash it between uses. I tried to go a 2nd use without washing it - big mistake. WASH BETWEEN EVERY USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, EXCELLENT product that I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Better than Fake Bake Flawless, especially if you already have medium skin. I have medium skin and I had trouble seeing the color guide with the original Fake Bake Flawless, and it just didn&#x27;t make me that dark, but I loved how easy it was to apply. Enter Fake Bake Flawless DARKER. Amazing! Tried it last night and noticed an immediate difference from the first swipe. I look golden bronze already. Can&#x27;t wait to see how dark I can build up to with several applications. I would not recommend though if you have lighter skin, but for those with medium, this product is AWESOME</li>
    <li> such great color and not too dark on me.  And the best part of this tanner is it&#x27;s so easy to use, takes minutes to apply and DOESN&#x27;T STINK!</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a better self-tanner than Fake Bake Flawless! It always comes out even (and I am SUPER prone to drippy, splotchy tanner applications) and does not smell terrible afterwards. I am very fair and do not tan in the sun, so I would say Fake Bake Flawless Darker is definitely darker than its regular counterpart, but it might not be as dark as some people want it to be.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product i never tried any thing else befor and this ways my first and im ordering more it does work if you cant get to a tanning bed i comes out brown and stays tan a little washes off in shower but your still tan after it stays for a weeks time its my #1 product and its work on face all over body everywhere:)and dont peel off just fades away slowly vary nice indeed</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loved it, it does look good on her, I am not crazy about sprays, but she said it is not difficult to use</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have used fake bake beyond bronze and loved it so I purchased these one after reading the reviews.  I was a little concerned because it was clear like water when I opened it and had no smell.  Bottle says it gas a color guide but this was clear and I did not get tan at all. Is this supposed to go on brown like the other fake bake products? If so the bottle I received was not right.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I was super excited to purchase this self tanner, I have been using self tanner for years now, and saw really good reviews about this product. Let me also say this product left a strong enough impression that I am writing a review for it, which is a first time for me. So, I had been using the original fake bake flawless in the few months prior to darker&#x27;s release and was satisfied so I decided to give it a try. I exfoliated very well and moisturized before applying this. I don&#x27;t personally feel like it really went on too much darker than the original flawless, although I give it some points for it&#x27;s ease of application. Keep in mind I am fair skinned, not pasty or translucent, but fair. Anyway the next morning when I rinsed it off I had absolutely no color. I didn&#x27;t put the product on my feet so I could compare and there was absolutely no difference. I reapplied the next night and got the same result. the third morning I had horrible yellow splotches and regular white spots, it looked horrible! and the worst part was that I could not get this off. I tried every method imaginable from just exfoliated thoroughly, to rubbing a lemon slice on it, and it just gets splotchier and splotchier. will not be buying this, or any fake bake product again. very disappointed! Switched to St Moriz a few days ago and am much more satisfied.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!! The color is amazing and has no orange tint!</li>
    <li> I have used Fake Bake Flawless for about 2 years now. After the first time I ran out, I used a lot of the more expensive brands (St. Tropez, BondiSands) and I will say...I have never gotten more compliments than i have with Fake Bake!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is cheap and works wonders!!! I just got the Flawless Darker and within the first day of using it people were complimenting me on how tan I looked!! I&#x27;ve used it since then and it is seriously amazing. The color is SO beautiful and goes on nicely, no streaks for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do use a different mit that I got from St. Tropez that I have used with everything and just wash it after every use.&lt;br /&gt;If you do sweat or take a shower it will come off slighly, but not to much. You can always just re apply.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, GREAT tanning. I wouldn&#x27;t write a product review if I didnt love it :)</li>
    <li> Not bad, it does give a bit more color than the standard fake bake. It is a little drying though, and you can&#x27;t use moisturizer or it won&#x27;t work. The smell is so so and stains everything. This all sounds negative, but the color does come out okay in a natural looking tone.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Caucasian and have medium skin that tans easily. I used it on my face and hands, mainly, because the rest of me is already tanned (live in Florida). I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d use it everywhere. its a little hard to manage. The mitt that comes with it is kind of nice though. It helps even out the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Last critique is that the color does not last any longer than any of the other bake products, which in my opinion is like, a day.&lt;br /&gt;Again, the end result is a non orange color that matched my real tan perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have used A LOT of sunless tanner so I like to consider myself an expert on the subject mater. This is by far my favorite brand. It sound like I work for them or something, I really don&#x27;t, I just love this stuff. I use a few coats because I&#x27;m tanorexic and like to be very brown. Just put it on at night, shower in the morning and you&#x27;ll look amazing. As with all sunless tanners, it looks a little crazy until after you shower, and then it&#x27;s all even and lovely. I even use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t give me any breakouts or anything. The smell is fine, it&#x27;s nothing to whine about. It actually smells pretty good. The mitt will kind of start to ball up after quite a few uses, but just toss it in the wash and it will come out brand new.</li>
    <li> I have used many selfless tanner and this one is great doesn&#x27;t look fake or orange.  I get out of shower and then put lotion all over my skin and use my face moisturizer as well.  Use the mitt it gives you to apply and then apply slowly and I do not use that much, I then wash it off about a few hours later and then the next day to get a little more color I will use it again. If you put it on evenly and in two days it always looks natural and no orange color.  When putting it on it makes you look kind of weird but when washed off it looks great.  Best selfless tanner around I have pale skin and my red head friend has really white skin and it works great on both skin tones.  I also let my roommate wear it and she has dark skin and it really just smooths your skin tone out and you do not have to wear much makeup with some color on your face.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and was concerned that this might make me look &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; but it worked great!  It was so quick and easy to apply and looked natural...no orange!</li>
    <li> I have used every tanning product under the sun in an attempt to find an easy, fast, and preferably cheap way to get a super dark, natural looking tan (I&#x27;m an ex tanning bed addict). Before this product came out, I had settled between two tanners that were great in their own ways; The original Fake Bake Flawless spray and St. Moriz Dark Tanning Mousse. Fake Bake was generally lighter, but looked like a natural tan (no orangey color), went on super flawlessly, could easily be layered (or applied by someone tired and lazy :) ), and dried insanely fast. St. Moriz was waaay dark and although it took a while to dry, was occasionally worth the extra work for the darkness (with the drawback that it could easily be streaked with any sort of moisture). This tanning spray is like a combination of the two with all the pros and none of the cons! It goes on super easy, is super dark and natural, can be layered, if used two days in a row it stays super dark after showering, and dries crazy fast! It comes with a tanning mitt and disposable latex gloves to protect your hands from getting stained. First, clip the straw that dips into the solution so that it is the same length as the bottle (this way it will not bend at the bottom and will use all of the solution in the bottle). Screw on the spray lid. Spray about five sprays of the tanner onto the mitt and rub into an area of skin (upper arm, lower arm, etc. taking one area at a time). It spreads easily and immediately adds a lot of color to skin, almost like a lip stain lipstick only in tan color for skin. It takes me 5 minutes to do my entire body and then I rinse the mitt, sometimes with hand soap, sometimes just with water, squeeze it to dry it and brush the velvet in the smooth direction so it dries to a soft surface. By the time I&#x27;m done rinsing it (maybe takes a minute), my tan is dry enough that I can get dressed. It will come off a little with moisture (like if water splashes up on you while rinsing the mitt), but is not at all a dramatic splotch like St. Moriz tanner. It also seems to come off a little bit onto clothes/sheets before showering, but not unless you are sweaty, because it dries so well.&lt;br /&gt;Literally the only draw back to this was that as it wore off of my skin (started after about three days of not reapplying), it looked very splotchy and you could obviously tell I had fake tanner wearing off. I think in a way this is a good thing, because it shows how dark it gets compared to my skin (which is a medium tone to begin with). Other tanners I use fade each day and this one just seemed to wear off as my skin naturally exfoliated off, so- patchy looking. Hope that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I don&#x27;t see myself buying another tanning product unless someone has real rave reviews about something else being insanely dark. I get as dark as someone who regularly tans in beds after two consecutive days of use of this, and even after just one day I look very nicely tan. The convenience is the cherry on top of a super dark fake tanner. The mitt alone costs around $6 at Ulta, so the tanner itself is a great deal and lasts forever!! I highly recommend giving this a shot to anyone who wants a super dark, easy, fool proof tan!all a dramatic splotch like St. Moriz tanner.

    <li> Love this product!  Easy to apply and you can see where the product is going so no streaks.  Love the pro mitt for application.</li>
    <li> The tanner drips off during a sweaty run. Unsightly!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff , instant tan and I have a tanning bed but love this stuff better , so much faster and awesome color !!</li>
    <li> Great product thanks :)</li>
    <li> Maybe the company that I bought this from, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the original Flawless. It may be old or something as the gloves broke halfway through using the product. I use the regular Flawless 2X a week during the summer and people constantly remark about my natural tan. With the Darker, I don&#x27;t get any comments and it seems to come off in the shower much quicker. I am sad that I paid extra money for this when I should have just stuck with the original sold from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love all the fake bake products, this was no exception!</li>
    <li> It took longer than I expected, but they sent it over weekend. it was pretty sweet. Great Product and I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> I ran pretty well in general when it comes to the summer and I have an olive tone to my skin. I wanted to get this because we all the know the sun is very bad and while I&#x27;m only 19 years old, I have been in the sun most of my life already. I like this self tanner it is good, but I don&#x27;t think it produces a very dark formula. I still have to apply 2 applications to get the darkest color. The smell is okay, and the dha doesn&#x27;t produce a huge amount of that &amp;#34;self tanker smell&amp;#34; it&#x27;s very sutle. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is it is very very messy. When I mean messy I mean this will get on things if your not careful, some of it poured on my carpet and my wood bureau, however I cleaned it right away. So be careful because it will drip very easily. My next self tanner I wanna try is loving tan.</li>
    <li> Best sunless tanner I have used. It gives you a really dark tan that has all my friends asking if I have been on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Very real looking not at all orange. Have used both the regular  and darker version. Both are great depending on the results I want at the time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  It looks real!  My friends who know I never go in the actual sun were shocked to see me so tan (and not orange like I tended to get in the spray tan booths!).  I purchased this for the first time in May and wanted to gain some experience before writing a review.  I&#x27;ve used it at least once a week, and sometimes I&#x27;ve used it three times in a week, mostly to reapply it on my face where you tend to lose color the most due to washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it after taking a shower and I don&#x27;t apply any lotion until after the recommended drying time.  I use the gloves and the mitt (both provided).  As the directions will tell you, bend your arms and your knees.  I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s easy to apply it all the way up on my face and toward my ears.  I look in a full length mirror when I&#x27;ve finished to check for any spots I may have missed.  I go extremely lightly over my feet and hands.  My hands are the last thing I do after removing the gloves.  You can always add more color, but once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s a little harder to remove.  However, if you notice you got too much on some place, you can use the light colored side of the mitt to remove a lot of it.  It does wash down the drain in the shower, but I feel it stays on for at least a few days, even with daily showering.  The one thing that I find a little hard is the mitt is big for my small hands and I have to keep my fingers spread open very wide to use it.  Would be nice if the mitt fit more like a glove.  It also stretches out a little over time.  I&#x27;m ready to purchase my second bottle - love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2016:  For whatever bizarre reason, I have developed an allergy to this product!  I had to stop using it about 4 months after initially buying it.  My neck and upper arms broke out in itchy welts.  I thought it was something else because I had used this numerous times without an issue.  But, every time I tried if after that initial reaction the same thing happened.  I use it on my legs and still get a 1-2 welts on the inside of my knee, but it appears to be a less sensitive area than my face and upper arms.  I am SO extremely disappointed because this is such a great product and I was hooked!and still get a 1-2 welts on the inside of my knee, but it appears to be a less sensitive area than my face and upper arms.  I am SO extremely disappointed because this is such a great product and I was hooked!</li>
    <li> This self tanner is awesome!!! Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!!! I&#x27;m light skinned African-American, and I love tanning...this gives you such a dark drown color, you look sun kissed! Not orange at all! :-) :-) :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just had dry skin or what but this is NOT like fake bake flawless original. It made me orange and streaky :( I&#x27;ll be sticking to the original :)</li>
    <li> Very pleased!! I am obsessed with tanning booths..but it&#x27;s getting to be too much of a hassle to go all the way there and too expensive. Fake Bake helped me out. I exfoliate first, and then apply the spray, I&#x27;m so happy it comes with a glove also. I personally didn&#x27;t get streaking and it looked an amazingly natural  dark brown, not orange(I have light to medium skin tone: I&#x27;m Mexican and Irish). The only thing is that you have to make sure to apply to your hands underneath the glove so your arm doesn&#x27;t look tan and then your hand pale lol.&lt;br /&gt;But, overall probably the best self tanner I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried many drugstore and sally&#x27;s. Great quality and smell, lasted me about six months.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. this is an honest review and I purchased with my own money:)</li>
    <li> I have not even used the product yet. I&#x27;m almost afraid to. The package looked like it went through a war zone! Right off, my thoughts are..&amp;#34;is this product fake&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;was this a return&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;is it old and expired.&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is hugely important to me and it is looks as if this company didn&#x27;t give a rip how it arrived and they are unconcerned about me ever ordering from them. Guess what...I won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the original, just darker. I&#x27;m very fair and this still looks natural. I recommend this for people who like being really dark.</li>
    <li> Love the Flawless Darker. It is darker than the Flawless spray. Lasts the longest out of all the sprays I have tried. I have medium skin and this spray looks natural. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The color looks pretty dark and seems to lighten after a bit and it does not last , I&#x27;m sticking to the fake bake 60! The color doesn&#x27;t develop right away but it&#x27;s darker and doesn&#x27;t come off that easily so it lasts!  And not to mention it&#x27;s cheaper and comes in an 8oz bottle :)</li>
    <li> Love this product and your service as well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  No streaks and a very natural tan.  Beautiful!  Easy to apply too  I highly recommend it and will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, I will never use any other sunless tanning product.</li>
    <li> I love the Fake Bake products. I bought this one after using the standard Flawless for a few months and loving it. This one is just as easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t streak in water/rain, and gives a gorgeous natural color. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because unlike the standard flawless, this one shows a crease on the inside of my elbow in the antecubital portion of my arm after a few days. The regular version didn&#x27;t do this as noticeably. Overall though they&#x27;re my favorite self tanning products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Bought the darker to be a little darker than the regular fake bake flawless.  I was much darker but it lasted about 3 days. Faded pretty well though. I liked it.</li>
    <li> Worked just as expected easy to use I left it on overnight make sure you exfoliate nice color first time</li>
    <li> I decided to try flawless darker after using and loving the regular fake bake. It is darker than the regular fake bake, not a whole lot darker but darker. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s dark enough that I will continue to buy because I can get the regular for a cheaper price!!</li>
    <li> nice product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great color and the smell isn&#x27;t awful.</li>
    <li> Service was fine but this tanner has a very strong smell. I like the flawless 60 mins the best. I have tried all of the flawless tanners and just find the 60 min one less smelly</li>
    <li> The mitt makes application so easy!  THe color isn&#x27;t as dark as the gel I had previously but quick and easy is what I needed, so I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Most amazing stuff ever! I have pale skin and this stuff makes me look like I have an amazing tan! It doesn&#x27;t look streaky or orange like most self tanners I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Saw this product on youtube and sounded really good and was easy to apply but when coming off it was leaving tan spots all over....besides that it made me tan:)</li>
    <li> I have light skin (NW20 in MAC foundation) I used to bed tan often, but I wanted an alternative to the UV damage.  I&#x27;ve been self-tanning for years now and have tried pretty much every brand.  I LOVE FAKEBAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first fakebake product I used was the original lotion. It smells like butt, but for sure works the best for me - if I have patience and put it on before bed and have time to rinse it off in the morning. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and gives the deepest, olive-toned tan I have ever had from a self-tanner.  Its downfalls are that it takes forever to dry and smells terrible. I also wouldn&#x27;t wear it out before rinsing it off because it looks like you&#x27;ve rolled in mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I tried the regular Flawless spray and it smells so good that when I put it on before I go out, people comment on how good I smell.  The spray formula also dries fast, so you can put clothes on soon after it&#x27;s applied and wear it out.  The issue with the regular flawless spray is that the color isn&#x27;t as deep and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original lotion. Most of the color in the regular flawless spray seems to be the bronzer/color guide and not permanent (washes off in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flawless Darker spray is the best of both worlds!!  I can still put it on before I go out, as it dries quickly and the brozer/color guide looks great AND the color lasts through a few showers (as long as you keep your skin moisturized).  The color of the spray formulas are both more of a golden-brown (whereas the lotion is a bit more olive toned), but it never looks orange. The quality of the flawless darker spray is similar to when I get professionally airbrush tanned - yet it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost and a bottle lasts about 1-3 months when I use it regularly! It smells great and gives a nice deep, golden tan. I also use this on my face (my skin is pretty dry, so I use it with a thin moisturizer) and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> I would not have even given it one star. Did nothing. I went back and read the package because I thought maybe I bought a gradual tanning lotion.....nope, supposed to ne immediate results and nothing ! Not even a light tan ?? Complete runny liquid with a spray bottle....makes a mess because it is not like a lotion or gel. Bad buy! Cannot return it either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; fake bake. The Mitt is not a fake bake mitt that comes with the actual box. And fake bake says they don&#x27;t sell on Amazon BUT it smells, applies, and looks just like the real thing. Ive bought several bottles. It&#x27;s not too dark for my pale skin, looks like a decent color just for me to wear shorts. Not orange at all.</li>
    <li> Best ever tan in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Makes me look naturally tan. Easy to use. Good price</li>
    <li> This stuff really is amazing</li>
    <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t make you orange</li>
    <li> Beautiful golden color!</li>
    <li> Easy application, great natural color in one application! No need to wait and re apply for a nice tan.  Dries fast and Stays on for about week.  Smells really good, not like that awful smell of sunless tanners.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> Love my fake bake. Looks like a natural tan. Doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, very similar to the Fake Bake Flawless. The color guide is a little darker so it is very easy to see where it&#x27;s going. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because my tan wasn&#x27;t any darker than with the original Flawless. Everyone has different skin (I am pretty fair), so If you like the Flawless but would like to see if this develops darker on you, it&#x27;s worth a try. Since this was significantly more expensive with the same results I will go back to the original when I finish this bottle. I just have to do two applications to get a deeper tan.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to use. Looks natural!!!</li>
    <li> I usually use the regular Fake Bake but tried this to see how much darker I could get. It really is a lot darker &amp; seems to last a couple of days longer than the regular.</li>
    <li> It went on relatively easy and, it was super dark.  It didn&#x27;t go on as even as I hoped.  I sprayed the solution on the mit that is included in the packaging before rubbing it in quickly,  I did not spray it directly on my body.  Also, I am an extremely pale person.  I always wear the absolute lightest foundation that I can find.  Porcelain or pale ivory are my colors.  I don&#x27;t think this color of tanner was very believable on me.  I only applied this once.  I don&#x27;t like how it faded.  It wouldn&#x27;t seem to go away on some parts of my body more then others.  Also, it faded splotchy.  One other thing, but it seemed wherever my bra touched my body the tan wanted to stay darker.  It was especially noticeable where the center of my bra met my body and also, the straps.  Of course the only two people who would notice this would be me and my husband.  My husband didn&#x27;t seem to mind but, it bothered me.  I don&#x27;t think it is the miracle product everyone claims it to be.</li>
    <li> I am very very pale, like Casper... I have used the Fake Bake Flawless for a few months but I wanted to be a tad bit darker! This one is amazing! It&#x27;s a deep tan that looks like I&#x27;ve been in Hawaii for a few weeks! Since I can not tan (I just burn) this is the best thing ever! So easy to put on! The only thing that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of is when you sweat. I work as a waitress in a restaurant with no AC so cleavage sweat is the worst.. It does come off there but that&#x27;s it! Hope you enjoy it as much as I am!</li>
    <li> Just received my Fake Bake Flawless Darker in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. As soon as I applied the first coat, I was amazed! I have very fair skin and suffer from dryness, so most products don&#x27;t work on me or leave me looking blotchy. This product went on perfectly and smells amazing. It drys quickly which allows for easy application, especially if you want to do multiple coats. I found out that it works best if you exfoliate in the shower and dry off completely before moisturizing and applying the first coat. When this product says DARKER, it really means it. I love the color and love that I don&#x27;t have to damage my skin to have an amazing tan! Thanks Fake Bake!</li>
    <li> I am very pale skinned and have had horrible experience with many different fake tanners. But i am OBSESSED with this product! Goes on very smooth and the tan looks natural. I&#x27;ll be using this for life.💟</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, best self tanner by far - and I&#x27;ve tried many. Dries quick, doesn&#x27;t have that smell that most do, and is a beautiful brown NOT orange. Love it!</li>
    <li> Makes u so dark love it ! This product line I would highly recommend to anyone with a spray tan or looking for just some color :)</li>
    <li> FIrst of all, I am a HUGE fan of Fake Bake products. Only problem with the Fake Bake Flawless is it was a little unnatural on me (not oompa loompa orange, just a little too much orange undertones) and it didn&#x27;t work on some parts of my body - leaving no color, at all on my chest and stomach. I bought Darker in hopes it would solve that problem. I have only done one application so far of the Darker and I am really happy! With the Flawless I had to apply 2 - 3 times to get my preferred color (I think I&#x27;ll do 2 with Darker) because I am REALLY pale, with blue undertones (don&#x27;t tan whatsoever, just burn, thanks to my swedish bloodlines). Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure Darker was necessarily &amp;#34;Darker&amp;#34; compared to Flawless. Darker just has more green undertones leaving you with a nice deep brown tan, not bronze like Flawless. It has a slightly different scent to it (still smells great though!), goes on smooth and VERY easily, dries fast, lasts ATLEAST a week, and best of all...I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING THAT WORKS ON MY FACE!!!!! It gave me a nice brown tan on my face! Woo! SO SO SO Happy! Fake Bake will definitely, always be my go too!</li>
    <li> This product gives great color. The smell is pleasant but you may want to take a shower before bed because the smell starts to stink like the normal self tanners by the end of the day. The color will stay but the smell will not!</li>
    <li> After using it I realized there was alot of streaking. It was not as perfect as I thought it would be, made me rather orangish and reaked of fake tan smell. I&#x27;ll continue using it until my Million Dollar Tan arrives.</li>
    <li> Is darker than the original and I love it.  Works the same way with darker results.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Arrived on time and unopened.</li>
    <li> The original Fake Bake Flawless was darker on me. I am a pretty light skinned girl and this didn&#x27;t really do anything. The guide was darker that was about it.</li>
    <li> This takes  FOREVER to dry&lt;br /&gt; However,when it does it is beautiful!  And whoever says it &amp;#34;fades like a normal tan&amp;#34; um no. THIS is what it looks like when it &amp;#34;fades&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works great! My favorite self tanner.</li>
    <li> Great product! The color is natural looking, and no odor!!</li>
    <li> Love love this product definitely easy to use and lasts a good while.</li>
    <li> After trying OTC tanners, St. Moriz and some others, I bought the original Fake Bake. I really liked the color and the smell, though I did feel it didn&#x27;t give a ton of color especially after showering. I bought this Fake Bake darker and I don&#x27;t know honestly if it&#x27;s any darker, but it still smells good for a self tanner and I really like the color tones over anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t look fake or orange at all on me. I will try being more consistent with it and try doing a couple of coats as others have recommended to get the darker color I would like.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF SOOO MUCH! Will never switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I wanted something that would not streak and turn me orange. This product done exactly what I wanted it to. No streaks and no turning orange. It looks just as if I had been going to tanning bed for a few weeks. (I used to go to tanning bed at least 4-5 nights a week.) Fake Bake has saved me all that time of going to the tanning bed, plus it&#x27;s much cheaper. All you have to do is follow the directions and use the soft mitt to apply it. I use it on my face as well, and it does wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. No problem with the odor&lt;br /&gt;2. The application was pretty simple&lt;br /&gt;3. The color developed after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Drier skin (e.g. feet, elbows) &amp;#34;tanned&amp;#34; darker than less drier skin&lt;br /&gt;2. The color did not fade evenly&lt;br /&gt;3. The &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; faded to a yellowish/orangey color.</li>
    <li> Favorite so far.  Darker in one treatment.  Amazing and no smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love and recommend this product.  Gorgeous tan over night that lasts.</li>
    <li> I love the fake bake products. I just didn&#x27;t notice this one do anything different than the original one though. I got the same color payoff, but fake bake is still my go to self tanner!</li>
    <li> Best fake tanner for the price. I&#x27;d be willing to pay double if I had to. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of other tanners and while I do switch up what I&#x27;m using a lot, I always come back to the original fake bake or this one. The darker version for me is equivalent to applying two applications of the original formula.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Gives the best color ever.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of the Fake Bake line. This particular product with the applicator glove is my absolute favorite. It is so easy to apply with flawless results. I have even applied it in the morning and had no issues with any type of obnoxious odor developing during the day. After 2-3 applications you will look like you have spent a week on the beach. I would reccomend it for all ages.</li>
    <li> Love the Fake Bake Darker! Iv been usuing the regular Fake Bake for a long time because im VERY light skinned and I didnt want to go too dark, because im so fair skinned I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could really pull it off with a natural look. But one day I was almost out of the regular fake bake and needed to order more and just decided I wanted to try out the darker so I bought that instead and now I will never go back to the regular! The regular is great for someone who wants a regular every day tan, but the darker makes you looks like you&#x27;ve been out tanning in the sun for days. (in my opinion, the regular Fake Bake is a more orange sun kissed glow, as if you&#x27;ve been outside all day / And the Fake Bake Darker is a golden brown tan, as if you&#x27;ve been tanning for days and have that perfect dark brown tan.) Its all natural, it does not stain clothes/sheets and its affordable. I would recomend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this stuff. I am very very fair and sensitive skinned and I get PERFECTION out of this bottle. I am a licenced professional so I buy elsewhere normally but ordered from here when local store was out of stock. I always keep 2 bottles at home in case now. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> This takes a certain technique, but once you get it down, it gives a very realistic looking DARK tan.  Even though the instructions recommend using it at night, I prefer to use it in the morning.  I shower and exfoliate thoroughly at night before bed, apply a nice light moisturizing lotion, and the next morning my legs are ready for the tanning solution.  The moisturizer is important: applying on dry legs ends up being a nightmare - it soaks into the dry areas and makes you look splotchy and diseased.  The problem I encountered using it overnight were sheet marks in my tan and white areas where it had rubbed off - not very sexy at all. Also, my sheets looked disgusting the next morning. I won&#x27;t be doing that again... Very satisfied with the product, though, as long as I stick to the morning application routine.</li>
    <li> Works for me with no streak action! And will tan you very quickly without laying in the sun or tanning bed!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner. I like it more than the original flawless fake bake!</li>
    <li> It is darker then the original I did notice streaks when I went in the shower. It does however give u a nice tan until it starts to fade it&#x27;s uneven and the crease in the elbow fades quicker and it makes my arms look dirty like I didn&#x27;t wash</li>
    <li> Loved the color. Was afraid it may turn me a bit orange, but that was not the case at all. Only turn off was that this smells a lot more like self tanning lotion than the Flawless does. That smell kind of lingers.</li>
    <li> This is HG I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve repurchased any product as much as this, so much cheaper to buy on amazon than ulta I believe it&#x27;s about $10 more! Great color, lasts a week and fades very well as long as you moisturize</li>
    <li> Awful. I thought I&#x27;d try this and get darker in 1 coat vs 2-3 with the reg FB flawless. This is blotchy, color is horrible. This is nothing like the original. I have that on monthly sub &amp; save . I actually prefer my fav which is the Body Drench spray/mist , it&#x27;s the BEST in true color I&#x27;ve found in 20 years! A red brown glow of a real tan. But... It makes an awful mess . So I sometimes use the FB Flawless , yet it seems to wash off when I shower? It&#x27;s good, easy application, but as soon as you shower, it&#x27;s gone. I thought maybe this would be darker or last thru 1 shower? But, it&#x27;s just awful. I gave it a 2nd try &amp; it was as bad as the 1st. I will never buy this again, I wouldn&#x27;t use it again free! I will stick with Body Drench ( FAV!!! ) &amp; the ORIG. FLAWLESS.&lt;br /&gt; Save your money girls ... Get the original or anything else, it will be better than this .&lt;br /&gt; 👎&lt;br /&gt;JENN~</li>
    <li> I Love the way Fake Bake looks!  This is the best self-tanning product out there!</li>
    <li> Gives you a natural, dark tan that lasts me about a week. The application is very easy. I tan at night and sleep in it then shower the next day. It does smell bad by the morning but once you shower the smell is gone. I love this more than the original fake bake flawless.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I have used almost every tanning product out there and nothing has gone on so easily and streak-free. Such a pretty color too! I will definitely be reordering! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I like regular fake bake better. I don&#x27;t feel this gets me any darker than the original.</li>
    <li> I consider myself a self tan junkie. I have tried alot from jergens to banana boat to aqua tan. I read several great reviews on this product but for me it didn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;m fair skinned but tan well in the summer. I found it more difficult to apply since its a spray and not a lotion. It dried quick and was hard to spread around evenly before it dried. I also have dry skin so I felt even drier after using it. I applied in the evening and showered in the morning. Most of the color guard washed off and left me with very little color. The next couple of days my skin looked blotchy and uneven. I have to say it didn&#x27;t leave me orange and the smell wasn&#x27;t terrible. I paid $30 for it. I think I will stick to st moriz for half the price and a better lasting tan.</li>
    <li> isnt really much darker at all than the regular</li>
    <li> Been looking for a good self tanner for years.  Only think I don&#x27;t like is having to wash the mitt after each use (takes tanner off hands then) and that it makes dark spots really dark.  I remove the tanner from the spots after applying all over.</li>
    <li> this product could have been better if i was  like 3 shades lighter, i have dark olive skin tone and i really didn&#x27;t get the darkness i wanted.  This tanner works for light skin people though</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Has NO self tanner smell at all!!  Applies easily and dries VERY quickly.  Looks extremely natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller is excellent, no need to contact, product arrived quickly without issues!</li>
    <li> As a ginger- I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.  Fabulous color, and it is absolutely fail proof!  Exfoliate, shave, glove your hands and buff it in using the mitt included.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I can not say good enough things about this self-tanning product.  The color looks so natural, natural as in if I were to get a tan from the sun, this is what my skin would look like after.  It dries almost instantly, by the time I am done applying to my whole body it is dry and I can put on clothes.  This is a huge plus because SO many other self-tanners I have tried, I had to walk around the house and air-dry for a long time.  The smell is pleasant and is not overly strong.  The mitt that comes with the self-tanner works great, just make sure to rinse after each time so that it lasts longer.  I initially didn&#x27;t do this to the my first mitt from Fake Bake and it caked together after many uses and was harder to fix by then.  Great product, will only buy this product from now on.  Also you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> The best stuff. no-brainer. I am on my 2-nd bottle. You just can&#x27;t screw your tan up - it always comes out flawless, and has no disgusting fake tan smell. Love this product. And definitely buy it here, in Ulta it costs 32$</li>
    <li> This self tan is awesome it makes be the perfect tan I love it sometimes leave me a little splotchy but when I get in the shower to wash the color guard off it goes away it&#x27;s worth the money try it</li>
    <li> Great sunless tanner. The guide color makes this product super easy to use and looks very natural. If you intend on using this on your face, I&#x27;d suggest you apply product the night before and rinse off in the shower the next morning. Good product for guys.</li>
    <li> Buy this even if you don&#x27;t want to be super dark, you can wipe off the excess or add lotion to it and that way it lasts longer and you don&#x27;t have to buy as often. People constantly ask me what I use because this looks the most natural and smells so good! Love that it comes with a mitt so no streaks and the gloves really help so my palms aren&#x27;t stained. I also spray it on the backs of my hands but make sure you wipe it off your nails so they don&#x27;t get stained.</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan of the original Fake Bake Flawless for months now. It&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY fantastic. Seriously the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. HOWEVER, this has now take over the top spot. This definitely gives you a richer tan. If you want to look naturally dark, this is the self tanner for you. There&#x27;s no orange to it whatsoever. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! It has a color guard to it, so as you apply it you can see where it&#x27;s going, leading to little to no streaks. This also came with a mit and gloves, which leads to PERFECT application. Seriously, if you self tan, use this.</li>
    <li> this is awesoneness in a bottle a must have summer item esp for those that burn or dont tan easy</li>
    <li> This Fake Bake is great but I kinda like the original better because it gets a little too dark with my fair skin.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product and even more excited to try it. When I got it I put it on that night and then another coat the next night and was very impressed with the the color and the easiness of application, but once I took a shower I noticed it all come off. My whole shower floor was the color of the tanning product and I was splotchy from where it had come off and where it hadn&#x27;t all come off. Not only did it come off in the shower, but it came off in the pool as well. That&#x27;s the main place I wanted to be able to wear it and it all came off in the pool. I was very excited only to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lore this stuff! Super fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> This was my 1st time for this product. Have used other Fake Bake products. This tans darker, dries faster, less residue on shower, Very easy to apply. I&#x27;ll be purchasing much more.</li>
    <li> love this tanning spray. it looks so natural and I get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> By far the BEST self tanner i ever used. Will def. purchase more soon!!! I love that it has a pink, brown red color as it develops in your skin. I find those types of self tanners work the best on my skin tone. I promise you can not get a better darker more natural self tan with any other product!! This is by far the best self tanner i have ever used. And i tried just about all of them!!</li>
    <li> Prettier, but a tiny bit smellier than the original product. I seriously can&#x27;t decide which one I like best. As always, Fake BAke has THE BEST color of any self-tanner out there. I actually ran out and used a more generic product from the drug store, and totally diva&#x27;d out! It was sticky and icky! There is NO COMPARISON to Fake BAke!!! But I thyink my next purchase will be for the original formula because I got a little sun this summer. Again, this one is beautiful, and darker, it&#x27;s just that i did notice a tiny smell if I sweat at all. :)</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite self tanner!  It looks and smells amazing...super easy to apply and lasts a long time...LOVE, LOVE, LOVE</li>
    <li> Love Fake Bake! First time buying it. Was suggested by an esthetician and she knew what she was talking about! I had been getting spray tans but this is so much more convenient and easy to use</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff and have been using it for a few months now. I have a light/medium skin tone, I originally started with the fake bake flawless but had to keep reapply to try and reach the color I wanted, it took a lot of work. Now with this one I only have to apple once to reach the perfect tan color, it&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Not good.  No color.  Takes so much.  I stick to st Tropez which I give  5 stars.  More money but only use a little and great color!</li>
    <li> love this stuff, not smelly, goes on easy.  It does dry out your skin a little</li>
    <li> I have used Fake Bake for about 5 years now &amp; I love how each year seems to bring an even more amazing product than the last!  The Fake Back Flawless was great...but I had to make several applications to achieve the results I wanted.  I used the Fake Bake 60 minute tan and wasn&#x27;t impressed, it didn&#x27;t tan any differently than Flawless in my opinion.  Fake Bake Flawless DARKER is the BEST as of yet!! I just got it in &amp; I&#x27;m seriously contemplating purchasing a case of it due to all of the compliments I&#x27;ve received after only one application!! By the way, I have naturally fair skin - like you can see my blood vessels, that&#x27;s how white I am...this stuff makes me look like I just got back from a month long tropical vacation!! Never been happier with a product!!</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Easy to apply and looks amazing!! EVERYONE asks where I was on vacation to have such a nice tan ;)</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m the whitest chick in Florida and this gives me a nice tan. So easy and lasts about a week. Smells awesome.</li>
    <li> I use a squirt with a wad of skin lotion in my hand, rub and apply to face, every day. No need to exfoliate, it just blends in. Looks like a mild tan with little work. If you try this, do a test patch first, one never knows what happens when you mix 2 products together. Only negative is the odor, which smells like suntan lotion.</li>
    <li> This gives the most amazing color. I like to use it  once a week just to keep a little color going and twice a week if I want to look really tan (like tanning bed tan).</li>
    <li> Best self tanner every</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great color,  not orange at all and streak free.  I will definitely be buying get more when I run out!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Don&#x27;t buy it . Stick to Tan Physics</li>
    <li> Item came fast and I love it.  I can spray it on in the morning if I decide I want to wear a dress or something and I have any instant tan.  I looks natural too.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Easy application and great color!  I am dark complected, very olive, so it took 3 applications to get the color I wanted but the color looks natural!  It looks every bit as good or better than a spray tan. I recommend watching some tutorials on how to apply and doing some research before you buy but it is WELL worth the money!  Love tht it never touches your palms so no orange hands!  Tht picture is after 3 applications. Only takes about 5 min to put it on, 5 or 10 min to dry and your done. Smell is not bad at all!  Just love it!  I am very picky, don&#x27;t like anything to look fake or cheap and this is GREAT!</li>
    <li> Tanned legs all year.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used. It blends in easily and gives a natural color. The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the applicator is not that durable. The glove worked great for the first few applications but then the material lost its softness. With an extra application glove or two, this product would be golden!</li>
    <li> Ok I have tried almost every self tanning product out there.  I used to be a tanning bed addict until my mother in law was diagnosed and eventually passed away from melanoma.  I have used the Fake Bake Flawless product since last summer and found it to be the easiest application I&#x27;ve ever used.  This product is just like that but darker, hence the name.  It comes with gloves and the best part is the application mitt which makes applying the product super easy...it goes on even and streak free and it dries very quickly.  The color is great...not orange at all!  Here is the thing that you need to know b/c I saw someone else&#x27;s review and it was obvious that they either didn&#x27;t read the instructions or they chose to ignore them.  This product is in a manual pump spray bottle and basically looks like and is the consistency of dark brown water.  It has the color in it so you can see where it&#x27;s being applied.  When you put it on, that is when you are going to look the darkest b/c the color indicator is still sitting on the surface of your skin.  If you choose to apply this and then go about your day, you need to be certain that you won&#x27;t be getting wet b/c it will run down your arms/legs which is not cute.  The best thing to do is apply it at night after a shower with fresh shaved legs and exfoliated skin then go to bed and then rinse off in the morning...this will get rid of anything that didn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin overnight.  That being said, I have put this on and gone out b/c I either forgot or was too lazy to put it on the night before or I wanted some extra color or I had something come up unexpectedly and my legs were ghost white that I needed to put some color on them quick or else risk the chance of blinding the innocent with my whiteness.  I&#x27;ve gotten away with it before and not gotten wet and looked fab, but I&#x27;ve been burned before with a light rain or a spilled drink and then looked like a hot mess.  If it does run, and you&#x27;re not soaked or anything, then you can sometimes just rub it back in real quick with your hands or a towel or something.  Like I said, the BEST thing to do is put it on at night and go to bed and rinse off in the morning.  I highly recommend this product!  This didn&#x27;t ship from Amazon but I still got it in timely manner.you can sometimes just rub it back in real quick with your hands or a towel or something.

    <li> Great did everything they said it would. The color is awesome no streaks flawless.</li>
    <li> My order came in only 4 days! super fast shipping and this product is amazing! I instantly look like I went on vacation, literally that&#x27;s how good the tan is. it&#x27;s a perfect natural tan color not orange at all it&#x27;s just the right amount of brown and my skin looks perfectly sun kissed ! somehow it has an almost pinky tint to it as well which is how my face normally tans with a little tint of pink to it. I used the original fake bake flawless and loved it too but this formula by far is the best! amazing supplier and product will be purchasing again. recommend to everybody!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Fake Bake spray just like this one but a shade lighter. They both work very well! They don&#x27;t leave u orange and both apply evenly and effortlessly. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the color payoff on the lighter version was the same as this &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; one. However, both lasted the same amount of time (about 1 and half weeks). The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all. Almost a cocoa butter scent. It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing or fabric. Overall, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product like this under the sun.  The color looks real and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.  The application mitt is awkward and after about a month, it grew what appeared to be some sort of mold on it.  I wish the application was a lot smoother and that the color lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the best self tanner I have used. Reasonable price, good even dark-looking tan, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; smells great and dries fast. Golden tan - no orange. Shipped fast too!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. I have tried several self tanners but this one is hands down the BEST on the market.</li>
    <li> The product leaves you with a very nice dark color, but fades very splotchy!! :(</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this bc I didn&#x27;t want orange, streaky legs. But it was so cheap I figured I&#x27;d try it and not lose out on much if it didn&#x27;t work. The mitt makes application seamless and this product provides a GORGEOUS, golden color without the damage of the sun. After I did my left leg and compared it to my right leg...I became a fan for life. It has a light &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; scent of that makes any sense. Amazing value for an amazing product!!</li>
    <li> The best self tanner! Always looks natural, no streaks, and doesn&#x27;t stink like most.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner I have found, and I have tried dozens. The instant color it gives is natural enough to go out in during the day, and the color that stays after you shower is really natural as well. This also has the most pleasant smell. Yes, it still has an odor, but it is more tropical than the tell tale sunless tanner smell most give off. Also, my skin is so fair it is pretty much see through, and both the Darker and original Flawless make me look like I have spent time in the sun. I really like the mitt that comes with it as well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and the latex glove and mitt are perfect to use with this spray, which arrived on time as advertised by the Seller.</li>
    <li> This is better than the original. Darker and lasts longer. I&#x27;m veryyyy light skinned and this doesn&#x27;t look weird on me so it&#x27;s great for light to medium skin types. Goes on very easily. Lasts about 2-3 showers.</li>
    <li> Once you apply it looks really dark.  I usually sleep in it and after I shower A LOT of it washes off. I have to spray myself again 2 days later.  The color is perfect for a few days though.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s mess free, easy to use, streak free, and best of all it gives you an amazing color!!! I have used several different products and this beats them all by far!!!! I will definatly be buying more bottles!!</li>
    <li> Great item and absolutely fast delivery. Ordering again!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite self tanner. I have been bronzing for years on my fair complextion. I gave up cancer beds and starting to take care of my skin and this product looks amazingly natural and does not smell. The color does not smudge and fades well. The only downfall is i have to apply nealry every night and the mitt it comes with doesnt last long, but luckily wal mart now carries one similiar so it can be replaced. I will definaltely continue to use this product..well done.</li>
    <li> By far the best self tanner EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been self tanning for so long, I don&#x27;t care to say how many years! I&#x27;ve tried so many self tanners and usually there&#x27;s something about them I don&#x27;t like. They either don&#x27;t have the best natural looking color, or they smell a little weird, or they take forever to dry, or they don&#x27;t last long on my skin...Something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not with this stuff. All of the above mentioned is just what you would want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-FANTASTIC natural looking tan! The best color out of a bottle I&#x27;ve ever seen. No way anyone guesses that it&#x27;s not real.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice smell out of the bottle and on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Dries super fast. You put it on, and in just a couple of minutes feel free to get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;-Feet &amp; Hands? No problem. Just do your body, don&#x27;t spray more on the mitt-there&#x27;s enough there to rub into your feet and hands so they don&#x27;t stand out as white compared to your body and it doesn&#x27;t do that horrible stain thing with your skin in those areas. I&#x27;ve had such horrible experiences, especially on my feet. I don&#x27;t even use lotion on my feet, elbows or knees with this stuff, just lightly go over them and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;-Face? No problem. And this is BIG. I have an acne problem and most self tanners make me break out horribly. Not this stuff. LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;-It lasts. Do it at night and in the morning the first time around, then maintain once or twice a week depending on how often you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love spray tanning (Mystic, Veranda) but don&#x27;t have a salon in my area that offers reasonably priced spray tans.  Mid-winter my olive skin starts to look pale.  I decided to try this after reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed.  The formula goes on smoothly and is easy to blend.  The solution comes with two gloves and a mitten to spread the solution.  Simply shower and exfoliate before bed, apply the self tanner to your body, and go to bed.  You will wake up with a natural looking medium tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution smells like coconut for an hour or so, but you will wake up smelling like DHA haha.  This is to be expected with any self tanner and the smell goes away after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with the results-will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used several self tanners and this one is my favorite! It is such a great price and comes with everything you need to get a great self tan! Because of the mitt, it really does give you a flawless color and tan! It also has the best smell out of any self tanner I have used! It gives you a great bronze color and dries fast! This is a GREAT product!!!</li>
    <li> The fake bake sunless tanners work great.  This is a little darker than the original.  I prefer the tan tropez mitt, but the mitt provided does last a couple applications</li>
    <li> This gives you a flawless tan!</li>
    <li> Works great! best tanner i have found yet.</li>
    <li> This gives a rich brown tan that makes your skin illuminate. No orange color at all. The velvet mitt really blends the tan very well no streaks and it smells like tropical fruity coconut. This is the best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super pale this gave me a nice tan with just one coat. I&#x27;m glad I got the darker version. Application on hands and feet is tricky but with practice its got to get better.</li>
    <li> Although this is an amazing product and I recommend, it is not THAT dark. Initially, after application of the guide (which washes off) it looks really great and deep. After washing the guide off it leaves you with a suntanned stain which is nice but not as dark. Although I love this product, I recommend Tan towels over this. Pros- smells nothing like typical self-tanner cons-not nearly as dark as I feel I like to be after using fake tanner.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunless tanner so far I love the color it is easy to tell how much you want for your desired color &amp;; it still doesn&#x27;t look fake or to dark I just look like I&#x27;ve been tanning every day! I&#x27;ve tried sun Labs, banana boat, the off brand of St tropez, the loreal brands, the jergens this is the best for smell, color,  longevity of the color, and it&#x27;s affordable!  :)</li>
    <li> I love the original flawless, but it was very light even on my fair skin. I&#x27;d usually have to do a coat, dry, and do another. (Or, for a serious tan, get a spray tan in a booth and then do a layer of flawless the next day for amazing color). So I thought I&#x27;d bite the bullet and try darker. It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s like two coats in one. I&#x27;m sure if I did two coats of this I&#x27;d get a really nice deep tan. It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the original... And does have some DHA smell after you shower but not as bad as other products, and not as minimally as the original (I never have a smell with the original). But great color, and best part is it fades so nice! Sometimes with two or more coats of the original I&#x27;d get bad peeling in the cleavage region due to friction. But I didn&#x27;t get that at all with this... Not even on the inside of my elbows. Beautiful, even fool proof tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimine:&lt;br /&gt;Dry brush before shower, then shave and do another quick round of exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow skin to dry a few minutes, and apply a lotion to my hands, toes, elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to town with the product on my mitt, starting from the bottom up. I use the majority of the product on my leg, and then the leftover on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;m done with the majority that I can reach, I slip the mitt onto a wide flat hairbrush if my husband isn&#x27;t around to help to get that area on my back that I can&#x27;t reach. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash my hands, and use the leftover from the mitt to go lightly over my hands and wrists to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes about 10-12 minutes, and is dry immediately. Washes out of sheets. I never feel sticky or gross like other tanners. Amazing! Highly recommend. You cannot mess this one up!</li>
    <li> Definitely the BEST self tanner I have ever tried. 100% recommend.</li>
    <li> BEST SELF TANNER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used to work in a tanning salon and let me just say... You want natural, dark brown color NOTHING compares to this product. I have tried: Mystic, Top of the line tanning beds, Natures Gate Tanner, Sun Laboratories Tanner and all the drugstore crap. This is the BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!! Not only is the color instant but it lasts, smells great like a tropical small with ZERO self tanner smell. My Mom and Sis are self tanner snobs like me too and didn&#x27;t believe it until I gave them both a makeover using this and now we all fight to use my bottle haha... If you are sick of crap tanners that don&#x27;t make you DARK then look no further, this product will NOT disappoint!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Better than the regular Fake Bake!!!</li>
    <li> gives a great dark color. but the only think i don&#x27;t like is when you take a shower, most of it comes off right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid self-tanner, and this one takes the cake. Not only is it easy to apply with the mitt that it comes with, but the color you get from it is very natural. No orangey tones to be found. Definitely repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Good product. Easy to apply. Has a pretty deep color.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin look dirty. I tan regularly so I know the difference between a good real tan and a fake tan and this was for sure nasty.</li>
    <li> Love all these products makes u tan quick and dark fast. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> purched for a friend she sayes it is the real deal loves it she recommend it.</li>
    <li> Darker than their original product and just as great as an application!</li>
    <li> Works better than anything else ive tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The tan is dark but natural looking and I have EXTREMELY dry skin. Before applying, I exfoliate and moisturize and it applies great! I like how you spray it into the glove and apply from there too. After you let is dry and set, it&#x27;s beautiful! I get compliments all the time from my friends! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect. The scent is great until it developes only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it fades unevenly and fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale and I have used drugstore self tanners for years. I can&#x27;t tan naturally in the sun but I love being bronze. I decided to try out a high end self tanner and saw how cheap this one was on amazon, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up! No streaks! Stays on for days! It&#x27;s very dark and I love it. It smells tropical.</li>
    <li> Where do I even begin? Seriously... This product is amazing. Like others, I started out with the original Fake Bake and I was hooked. Like the original, this dries almost instantly, is ridiculously easy to apply, does not turn you orange, does not streak, smells great... but this one... is DARKER!!! Who doesn&#x27;t want to be darker right? I feel like I look ten years younger when I use this product. I use it on my face as well and it really hides all the fine lines and imperfections as well as make my blue eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;! I use a Japanese wash cloth every night as my wash cloth so I am always well-exfoliated. Make sure you use something to slough off all those dead skin cells before using this. It will last longer and won&#x27;t end up splotchy. Make sure you moisturize as this will help the magic potion last longer hahaha. I really do LOVE THIS PRODUCT. This is great for people who cannot tan and also those who have tried self-tanners but ended up looking like some sort of citrus fruit. I promise you will not end up streaked or orange. This product does come out very dark so you have a great guide to tell you exactly where you&#x27;re applying it. Stop tanning and use this product!</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this product and I am in love!! After years of tanning I decided it was time for a change, or some salvation for my skin!! lol It&#x27;s so natural, golden brown, not hot orange like the others.  No streaks and it even gives you the pop of color on the face that is so hard to achieve. This is an amazing product, and so easy to apply.  The kit does come with gloves and a mitt, although not pictured.  I didn&#x27;t realize and bought a mitt, just a heads up for others!  Not disappointed one bit!! If your fearful, don&#x27;t be this product and it&#x27;s amazing reviews speak volumes! Try it!!</li>
    <li> I am rather disappointed in this product. I had used the Fake Bake Mousse before and  loved it and went with this one this time based on the recommendations and reviews but, in my opinion, it does not work nearly as well as the Mousse. I tan easily naturally and my skin is not fair. I have medium skin so this should give me a better looking tan. And you seem to have to put a lot on in order for it to show and the main places it shows up is where you don&#x27;t want it to (like ankles, heels, etc...) I am going to order the Mousse I used to use and not use this one anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the best self Tanner EVER I absolutely love it!!!I would add a photo for proof but it won&#x27;t let me</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I can&#x27;t get enough. It shows up dark when applied and has a great color. I am a flawless darker addict!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s darker instantly, I believe application is all about the Mit and exfoliation. The new Mit makes it go on SMOOTH and evenly. I exfoliate with baking soda, after Im done rinsing conditioner out of hair completely.  The smell is nice and the tan is beautiful!!! I recommend this because it&#x27;s affordable and truly is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Well, all I can say is WOW. I will never use any other tanner. This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> No streaks, no chemical smell, dries really quickly (Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes), and its not sticky. Instant difference without any sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This bottle will last me at least until next summer.</li>
    <li> This stuff rules. I&#x27;m naturally tan already but my face is never as dark as my body. So I use this on my face. The color this gives me matches the rest of my tan. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like how this product goes onto the skin, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other products. However, I&#x27;ve seen video reviews that say if you&#x27;ll apply multiple times before fully washing it off then it&#x27;ll last longer. Other than that, great product. No streaking, very natural color, and affordable. Will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Being about as pale as it&#x27;s possible to be, I&#x27;ve used lots of sunless tanners. This is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s tinted, making it easier to see where you&#x27;re applying it and giving instant gratification. I&#x27;ve found that the color lasts 3 to 4 days, a bit longer if I apply if a few days in a row to make it darker. I was able to use it on my body and on my face with no issues. It provided a nice, natural looking color. It was easy to apply, too. It comes with protective gloves, an application mitt, and a spray bottle of the product. You simply put on the gloves, put the mitt on one hand, spray product onto the mitt, and in a circular motion apply it to your skin. You&#x27;ll want to exfoliate your skin first for the best results. I find it helpful to lightly moisturize the knees, elbows, ankles, and between the toes. Those areas tend to absorb more of the product and pre-moisturizing them helps keep them from getting too dark. I&#x27;ll most certainly be purchasing this again and I&#x27;m very happy that I&#x27;ll be able to wear my shorts and swim suit on vacation without looking like a white corpse!</li>
    <li> I have previously bought this product from my salon for almost triple the price before finding it here. Love it! Goes on easy, with no streaking. I am super pale and it gives me a nice &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;. Product lasts through many applications. Quick ship and great price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great natural color - however there were streaks - dries before it can be blended well . The color can&#x27;t be beat though !</li>
    <li> Love it... I like this formulation the best!!</li>
    <li> fast shiping great product</li>
    <li> Love the application &amp; the color it gives!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of self tanners before, but this is probably my favorite by far. It instantly bronzes you and leaves a completely streak free, natural looking, smooth tan. I wish it was a little darker, but it still looks really nice. It gave me a medium tan and left my skin extremely soft. Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> Fake Bake is definitely my favorite tanning product.  It is extremely easy to use, gives a glorious tan, and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky all over the place.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of self tanning. I have tried: St. Tropez (original mousse), Xen Tan (deep bronze luxe and gradual tanner), Fake Bake Original, Fake Bake Flawless, Tanceuticals (dark and light), Faux Tan Body, St. Moritz, Tarte Brazilliance, Hemp gradual tanner, Jergen&#x27;s natural glow gradual tanner. (I find it&#x27;s useful to know what the reviewer is comparing to). They are all great tanners - but I&#x27;m interested in the subtle differences. Fake Bake is certainly a top choice, especially for a beach vacation or night out. Its guide color (and therefore some residual tone it leaves after the first shower), is really just BROWN. Some like St. Tropez lean green and some like Xen Tan lean yellow (on my skin). Fake Bake was a &amp;#34;not too much of anything&amp;#34; plain brown, which is really what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is great, and my #1 priority. This product also has a bonus in that it&#x27;s super affordable in the land of self tanners, lasts long (I can keep it for about a week), has a great color payoff (maybe more than you would get from one sit in the tanning bed, but subtle enough and well toned that pale folks look natural). It&#x27;s also easy to apply (of course, with proper exfoliation, a mitt, and moisturizer, etc.). Because it&#x27;s a liquid, it&#x27;s easy to spread around evenly and (also due to the guide color) avoid streaks. It doesn&#x27;t dry too fast (which would leave streaks) or slow. It dries just slow enough that it&#x27;s easy to blend any mistakes you&#x27;ve made and take some time to blend. The smell is pleasant and there is no nasty DHA smell. Let me know if you have a question about it. Love!</li>
    <li> I thought I found my favorite self-tanner when I tried the Fake Bake Flawless but then I tried this Darker version and I love it even more! I wish the Darker one was available as an Amazon subscription like the regular Fake Bake Flawless because I definitely purchase this regularly. It has great color that is obviously slightly darker than the original, but I think my skin seems to retain the tan longer than the original formula - stays on through showers, etc. Like all the other reviews mentioned though, definitely wash your hands IMMEDIATELY after applying - I&#x27;ve tried rubbing a little baking soda on my hands when washing them and it really helps to keep from staining them.</li>
    <li> I use to get the fake and bake flawless and then discovered this! The Darker the better!</li>
    <li> I am very surprised at how well this worked. I have tried a self tanner before a long time ago, from walmart. It was a cheap one and it turned me orange. I swore I&#x27;d never try self tanners again. But lately, I have really been trying to quit tanning. I can&#x27;t stand being pale, looks bad on me! So I decided to give self tanners another shot. I read reviews and saw before and after photos of this product. They all looked amazing. So I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. I am so mad at myself for not doing this sooner!!! I&#x27;ve been damaging my skin with tanning beds to get a tan, and I could have been using this all along with no damage to my skin. This self tanner gave me the confidence to quit using tanning beds for good. The color isn&#x27;t orange at all! It seriously looks like I&#x27;ve been on a beach vacation. The color is deep and gorgeous. I had thought all self tanners make you orange, but this one really doesn&#x27;t. It also smells pleasant. It has a light coconut scent. Nothing too strong. I was worried it would smell like a spray tan. Spray tans are too strong for me, I can&#x27;t sleep with the smell of them. But this self tanner is a much more manageable fragrance. If you&#x27;re considering it, it&#x27;s worth a shot. My first application was pretty easy. No streaks, only a few dark areas on my knuckles. I should have used more lotion. But it still doesn&#x27;t look bad. I am very happy with my purchase and will be buying this probably for the rest of my life! :-)</li>
    <li> Really good stuff.. The odor not so much, it&#x27;s a chemical kind of odor.. But overall, the product is very good and the color on my skin looks like a real tan, no orange color. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Most natural looking self tanner available!</li>
    <li> I use this for bodybuilding competition, won&#x27;t dry your skin out and the color is great, I start using a few days before with heaving overnight coats along with Dream tan the day of.</li>
    <li> As a ginger, I can&#x27;t even tell y&#x27;all how much I love this stuff! I actually CAN get a tan, it just takes all summer to do it naturally. When I started working a 9-5 job and especially after having a baby, I realized very quickly that I had no time to get a tan the regular way. I can honest say that this stuff works like you&#x27;d never believe! It doesn&#x27;t look fake, smells great and lasts for several days. Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take longer than 20 minutes from start to finish. And best of all... No sunburn or skin cancer. I&#x27;m obsessed with Fake Bake products!</li>
    <li> Like the natural color I get. Purchased the Fake Bake Darker...Can apply and get dressed quickly thereafter...Fast drying. No streaking. No weird &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; color or smell. Applicator glove is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s really &amp;#34;staining/ coloring&amp;#34; my skin though as much as I&#x27;d like...I&#x27;m a medium skin tone...Like to add little color on my legs and arms during the winter months and really don&#x27;t need to be &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; during the summer at my age (54). So this is a great alternative. I do notice a lot of color washing off in the shower, even though it&#x27;s been on my skin overnight most times. I usually need to do 2 passes on legs and arms to achieve the desired color. Would have given it 5 stars, if the color I got was just a little darker at initial application. I read the other reviews and ordered the Fake Bake DARKER. I would like to see just a little deeper color, since it&#x27;s the Darker version. Maybe they need to come out with a Fake Bake MAX Darker!?! ;)  Other than that...Really good product. Looks very natural. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I love the color it gives... people ask me all the time where I tan &amp; when I tell them its sunless tanner they cant believe it. Only down fall is its a lot darker when you first apply it but after you shower it mostly washes off. I would give 5 stars if the color would last an not wash off</li>
    <li> Awesome product !! I will be buying again. One happy customer!</li>
