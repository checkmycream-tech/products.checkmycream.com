    <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
    <li> I wonder if there is a guy named Hugo and if this is what he smells like?  Perhaps to be witty he would reply \\&quot;Yes, this is what I smell like when I wear this.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> A scent that both men and women can use. I am a woman and love the scent because it is clean, fresh and doesn&#x27;t over power.</li>
    <li> When My boyfriend and I met in March, 2011, one of the things I remember most about our first meeting was his smell. Over the next month or so when we began dating, I finally asked him was that AMAZING cologne was. And it was, of course, Hugo Boss. He has since then run out of it, and I&#x27;m dying to get it back on him. It will be in his stocking on Christmas morning :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Xmas. He loves this brand of clothes and this fragrance smells really nice. I hope he likes it.</li>
    <li> hello fine fine the proces and buy il like a model for empled fine fine fine fine fine it likd</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas to keep in his car for touch ups whenever needed.  Cute little bottle, true to the smell of the original.</li>
