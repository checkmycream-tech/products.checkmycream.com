      <li>Good product; the large size is best, it lathers better than most shaving soaps, fragrance is pleasant, would like it if they used almond in addition to rum.</li>

      <li>Great product ,great price, Very Fast and reasonable shipping</li>
      <li>and they do work better, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat Col. Conk.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m definitely more of a fan of the Amber.  </li>

      <li>Simply the best shave balm out there.</li>
      <li>I used this puck a couple of times and I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the lather, scent, or the overall consistency of this soap.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>lathers real well for shaving, good stuff</li>
      <li>Let it cool before using as most of it liquifies.</li>
      <li>The shaves that I get are newborn baby bottom smooth and the hand razor cleans up easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those don&#x27;t sound like ingredients that I want on my face.</li>
      <li>but I had to cut it to make it fit in my ceramic cup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving soaps and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>But makes shaving smooth.</li>
      <li>The description said it woul fit.</li>
      <li>had to microwave it for a bit to get it to fit in my soap mug</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t really linger after the shave.  </li>
      <li>The product seemed and felt cheap, but the ingredients confirmed my thoughts.</li>
      <li>Lathers up well, helping get that close shave comfortably.  </li>
      <li>The soap itself works great, but the super size doesn&#x27;t quite fit an average mug.  </li>
      <li>this going in so that is why I also purchased the Colonel Conk Model 129 Super Shave Mug with Soap( soap with this mug came in almond).</li>
      <li>Another plus is that the super size version fits nicely in my super size COL Conk shave mug.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Tried a number of different ones, but Conk lathers well, smells nice, and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>Seems to be lasting a long time and after some experimentation I&#x27;ve found a good amount of water to get a nice lather out of it.</li>
      <li>The soap produces a great lather which last for a fairly long time, and provides a smooth comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Also noticed more razor burn on the neck, recognizing I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The most important part of a shave is a sharp blade.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have much to say about this, other than it smells good and gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>These soaps last a very long time for me, and they&#x27;re quite affordable, puts up a great lather and fits just right in my soap dish.  </li>
      <li>The lather is exactly what you would expect from Colonel Conk.</li>
      <li>The scent is enough to be interesting without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>Will be getting more Col Conk when my soap supply gets low</li>
      <li>If you like the scent of bay rum, if you like the feel of hot, soapy caresses on your face in the morning, if you have a big mug, you will love this shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Usual softness, pleasant aroma,lasting lather</li>
      <li>When I bought it I was new to wetshaving (the soap actually arrived before the brush and razor) and didn&#x27;t know how to use it quite right, but once you get the hang of getting a good lather, you won&#x27;t go back to disposable razors.  </li>
      <li>The large Bar lasts 3 months while a can of shave cream is gone in two weeks.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really like this shave soap.</li>
      <li>The lather is extremely soft and buttery, and the classic bay rum fragrance is light and lingers after the shave is complete.</li>
      <li>It has held up better than other shaving soaps in my brush cup.  </li>
      <li>Several other soap options were more suitable to me such as  Henry Cavendish Himalaya Soap and Art of Shaving.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Wish the scent was a little more robust.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers noted they had to modify the cake to fit their mug/bowl, me too.</li>
      <li>I new</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rating this product so low because I feel this is an inferior product and also because there isn&#x27;t an ingredient list available to the public.</li>
      <li>I have very very sensitive skin on my face.</li>
      <li>There are much better shave soaps out there, so I suggest spending a little extra.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Bay Rum and Amber scents so far</li>
      <li>Overall, I think the price is well worth it as this soap should last quite a while.</li>
      <li>I have use a lot of shaving soaps the last few years and Colonol Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum soap definitely makes for an enjoyable shave.</li>
      <li>I actually threw the Colonel Conk away way after three shaves, in which I used new blades for each shave.</li>
      <li>You can microwave it in the clamshell, but be very careful pouring it into your mug, it is hot and waxy and will burn you.</li>
      <li>These shaving soaps are larger than my standard Williams shave soap and will not fit into the mug that my Williams shave soaps fit.</li>
      <li>That would be fine for one or two items, but shipping almost doubles the price, and they ship in a small USPS  flat rate box, and don&#x27;t prorate the shipping for a larger order.</li>
      <li>A little harder to work into a lather &amp; tend to dry quicker, but a decent shave &amp; reasonably priced, The large size fits larger bowls &amp; mugs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product ,great price, Very Fast and reasonable shipping</li>
    <li> Great soap but I had to cut it to make it fit in my ceramic cup. The description said it woul fit. Otherwise a bargain on good shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Just a med lather. But makes shaving smooth. Last a long time. Don&#x27;t waste money on the expensive creams.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the shaving soap. It arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> COL Conk makes a good shave soap.  Another plus is that the super size version fits nicely in my super size COL Conk shave mug.  I&#x27;ve tried the Bay Rum and Amber scents so far and I&#x27;m definitely more of a fan of the Amber.  They typically last me a couple of months with daily, three pass shaves.</li>
    <li> The soap arrived 5 days before the estimate and works great.  When I bought it I was new to wetshaving (the soap actually arrived before the brush and razor) and didn&#x27;t know how to use it quite right, but once you get the hang of getting a good lather, you won&#x27;t go back to disposable razors.  I&#x27;ve since started using other creams like Prorasso and they do work better, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat Col. Conk.</li>
    <li> Bay Ram and Amber are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Good product; the large size is best, it lathers better than most shaving soaps, fragrance is pleasant, would like it if they used almond in addition to rum.</li>
    <li> husband loves this stuff.  Great soap for a close shave.</li>
    <li> If you like the scent of bay rum, if you like the feel of hot, soapy caresses on your face in the morning, if you have a big mug, you will love this shaving soap. A cake lasts me about two months, so I buy a years supply at one shopping. That&#x27;s the good.  The seller, a dealer who sells through Amazon, charges shipping on each cake. That would be fine for one or two items, but shipping almost doubles the price, and they ship in a small USPS  flat rate box, and don&#x27;t prorate the shipping for a larger order. That&#x27;s the bad.  P.S. Other reviewers noted they had to modify the cake to fit their mug/bowl, me too. It&#x27;s simple, I pop the cake out of its plastic clamshell and into my home turned spalted maple shaving bowl, 20 seconds in the microwave, voilà! Let it cool before using as most of it liquifies. You can microwave it in the clamshell, but be very careful pouring it into your mug, it is hot and waxy and will burn you.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave soap I have ever used. I have very very sensitive skin on my face. So much so that I usually just keep a beard. This allows me to shave every day. No cream or other soap compares.</li>
    <li> It does a nice job.  Not a lot of lather compared to other products. The most important part of a shave is a sharp blade.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have much to say about this, other than it smells good and gets the job done.  It has held up better than other shaving soaps in my brush cup.  But I mean, really, soap is soap.</li>
    <li> This thing takes forever to run out of, I mean....it really really last a loooooooong time. I feel like one of these should have you set for about 3 - 4.5 years. And I mean that.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth purchase of this product.  Lathers up well, helping get that close shave comfortably.  Beats shave cream hands down.</li>
    <li> Usual softness, pleasant aroma,lasting lather</li>
    <li> The best shaving soap that I have used. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and makes a good lather.  Very happy with my purchase, and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this soap quite a lot. So far I&#x27;ve not encountered anything particularly bad about it. While it is just soap, it has a very nice scent to it that makes shaving with it very enjoyable. The scent even fills the air just by being in the bowl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers real nice, it loads my brush quickly and fits my bowl fine. Overall, I think the price is well worth it as this soap should last quite a while. 5 stars for this soap.</li>
    <li> Great produce that should last quite a while and smells great!</li>
    <li> I like Col. Conk Soaps. A little harder to work into a lather &amp; tend to dry quicker, but a decent shave &amp; reasonably priced, The large size fits larger bowls &amp; mugs.</li>
    <li> lathers real well for shaving, good stuff just not a real rum bay scent it works tho order it and use it</li>
    <li> Is a good soap for shaving. Gave it four stars because the smell can improve and because I think that it is a little but overprice. But maybe its just a thing of personal preference and me being a frugal person.</li>
    <li> Great scent, good lather. Switched over from Proraso; both good products.</li>
    <li> Fragrance was modest as previously cited, but lather was less than expectations.  The soap dried out during the shave (for downward stroke as well as upward stroke, although I relathered between shaving directions).  Also noticed more razor burn on the neck, recognizing I have sensitive skin.  Several other soap options were more suitable to me such as  Henry Cavendish Himalaya Soap and Art of Shaving.  I actually threw the Colonel Conk away way after three shaves, in which I used new blades for each shave.</li>
    <li> great lather. excellent smell. whats not to like. Will be getting more Col Conk when my soap supply gets low</li>
    <li> Colonel Conk is always the best</li>
    <li> The soap itself works great, but the super size doesn&#x27;t quite fit an average mug.  Had to trim it down a little.  If you&#x27;ve got a bigger shaving mug, this won&#x27;t be a problem.  Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I have used Colonel Conk&#x27;s Shaving soap for approximately 10 years.  The soap produces a great lather which last for a fairly long time, and provides a smooth comfortable shave.  Both my wife and like scent.  I have tried several other shaving soaps but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> The scent is enough to be interesting without being overpowering. The soap lathers well and provides the lubrication required to shave properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving soaps and this one is by far the best. The scent of the Bay Rum is great and even the wife likes it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> In my + - 50 years of shaving I can not remember using a shaving soap disk that puts out a thick lather other than the canned variety. As I said, the lather is hey thick and creamy. The shaves that I get are newborn baby bottom smooth and the hand razor cleans up easily. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I always come back to this soap due to the cost. It seems to be the best bang for the buck. The lather is okay, not too thick, not too thin. It has a pleasant aroma also.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shave balm out there. Tried a number of different ones, but Conk lathers well, smells nice, and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> This is great shaving soap.  Got great results with a Boar Brush and Mug.  The scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t really linger after the shave.  If you wet shave, give the Col. a try.</li>
    <li> Throw away your cans of Shaving cream. Buy a brush, bowl and the colonel and save money on shaving. The large Bar lasts 3 months while a can of shave cream is gone in two weeks.</li>
    <li> These soaps last a very long time for me, and they&#x27;re quite affordable, puts up a great lather and fits just right in my soap dish.  Love the bay rum scent, makes me think of the islands in the Caribbean.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and it lathers up nicely.  Definitely gonna buy again.</li>
    <li> These shaving soaps are larger than my standard Williams shave soap and will not fit into the mug that my Williams shave soaps fit. I new this going in so that is why I also purchased the Colonel Conk Model 129 Super Shave Mug with Soap( soap with this mug came in almond). The Soap smells great and it lathers up great.</li>
    <li> I have use a lot of shaving soaps the last few years and Colonol Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum soap definitely makes for an enjoyable shave. The lather is extremely soft and buttery, and the classic bay rum fragrance is light and lingers after the shave is complete. This soap is best used with a badger hair brush and really lathers up nicely if you know what you&#x27;re doing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you do not have a brush or know how to bring a soap to lather - a lot of reviewers seem to have that problem.</li>
    <li> I really like this shave soap. The oversize bar lasts a long time. Good lather and fragrance.</li>
    <li> This soap works well.  It smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to microwave it for a bit to get it to fit in my soap mug but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as expected</li>
    <li> This has worked out really nicely.  Seems to be lasting a long time and after some experimentation I&#x27;ve found a good amount of water to get a nice lather out of it.</li>
    <li> I used this puck a couple of times and I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the lather, scent, or the overall consistency of this soap. The smell is extremely faint, and I don&#x27;t really smell the bay rum. I&#x27;m a fan of bay rum, but the scent left me feeling extremely disappointed. I&#x27;m rating this product so low because I feel this is an inferior product and also because there isn&#x27;t an ingredient list available to the public. I had to send an email to info@colconkproducts.com just to get an ingredient list. Below are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;SLES (a variation of sodium Laureth Sulfite)&lt;br /&gt;DI Water&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol&lt;br /&gt;Soap Flakes&lt;br /&gt;Stearic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Tatrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate-20&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those don&#x27;t sound like ingredients that I want on my face. The product seemed and felt cheap, but the ingredients confirmed my thoughts. There are much better shave soaps out there, so I suggest spending a little extra. In the future, I hope that Colonel Conk re-formulates and puts the ingredient list somewhere on their packaging.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap.  Wish the scent was a little more robust. The lather is exactly what you would expect from Colonel Conk. This size is a little big for your average shaving mug however. Personally I&#x27;ll be sticking with the smaller size for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Conk&#x27;s shaving soap for 20 yrs with my brush. Great product. good service too</li>
</ol>
