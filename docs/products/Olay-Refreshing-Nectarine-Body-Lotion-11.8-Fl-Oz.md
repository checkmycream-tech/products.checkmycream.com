      <li>To be honest I purchased this item for a friend who enjoys lotions that smell like &amp;#34;tangerines&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;oranges&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and not over powering at all.</li>

      <li>I use this almost everyday :)</li>
      <li>and it sinks in super fast.</li>
      <li>it makes your skin soft</li>
      <li>Makes skin soft but not oily.</li>
      <li>but I was hoping for both....good smell and soft skin.</li>
      <li>I usually only use this during the summer months when it gets very humid and the last thing you want is to be covered in sticky lotion.</li>
      <li>If you have normal skin or maybe slightly dry skin, this will work well.</li>

    <li> The best smelling moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It leaves my body well moisturized and it sinks in super fast. I usually only use this during the summer months when it gets very humid and the last thing you want is to be covered in sticky lotion. The scent it also really summer and quite lovely. Overall, a good lotion, but I would say not of super dry skin. If you have normal skin or maybe slightly dry skin, this will work well. It&#x27;s not enough for my winter skin, but I still swear by it during the summer.</li>
    <li> Love this body lotion!</li>
    <li> I looked a couple of places and couldn&#x27;t find this.  The service was great and I really appreciate being able to get it sent right to my door.</li>
    <li> I love it, it smells so good. Last all day&lt;br /&gt;I recommend everyone use tries it at least once. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this cream AAA seller</li>
    <li> This smells SOOOO good it makes your skin soft and I love it and the scent last. I will order this again</li>
    <li> The scent is not pleasant, but vaguely true to life.  Thankfully, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  Good moisturizer, though.</li>
    <li> My favorite every day lotion, light, non greasy with a wonderful peachy smell. I even use it on my face.  Glad to find it on Amazon, could find in local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes skin soft but not oily. Can use it everyday and have no build up.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay skincare products for my face..I have been using them since the 1990&#x27;s. To my surprise I found their lotion for the body on amazon as well. The scent is very light and not over powering at all. To be honest I purchased this item for a friend who enjoys lotions that smell like &amp;#34;tangerines&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;oranges&amp;#34;. I would recommend this lotion ...</li>
    <li> This lotion moisturizes very well. I love the scent when I wear it people often tell me I smell really good. What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
    <li> I love Olay body products, so I was not disappointed with this one. I ordered it because I didn&#x27;t see this sent in the stores on the self, and id you ladies go into the stores looking for either the one in the pink, purple, or blue bottles, they are never there.</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday :) It has a very nice smell that stays on my hands for long time- even after I wash my hands. Though, I must say that this lotion has a more of a apricot smell. Very good deal for an Olay brand :)</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with the fragrance of this lotion. I know scents work different on people but I found that this starts out great but as you apply, it seems to lose it&#x27;s fragrance. The lotion does soften the skin well but I was hoping for both....good smell and soft skin.</li>
    <li> Love it,smell good, let me feel fresh,good choice</li>
    <li> Yet another one of olays excellent creams.</li>
