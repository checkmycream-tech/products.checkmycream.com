      <li>Gelish&#x27;s \\&quot;Vegas Nights\\&quot; is a perfect dupe of China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Fairy Dust\\&quot; (regular polish, not a gel/Gelish) - if you love sparkle and glitter and want it in your Gelish, this is the polish for you!</li>

      <li>Fast shipping, great product</li>

      <li>I love how this looks over color or even by itself.</li>
      <li>but love it over every color I have.  </li>
      <li>The sparkle is most noticeable up close and has a prism effect that makes the sparkles show up as every color of the rainbow without being \\&quot;in</li>
      <li>Love this polish.</li>
      <li>I love wearing this glitter with no color</li>
      <li>I saw it on Adrea&#x27;s Chickettes website and was convinced I&#x27;d love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I love the glitter in this.</li>
      <li>I imagine with two coats you could build it up for more flash.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this polish...</li>
      <li>And in the light or sun, its even better.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite sparkle ever it is so light</li>
      <li>Love it when the light catches it -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t show if your nail grows in-between manicures (because it&#x27;s clear).</li>
      <li>I just love the way it glitters in the light.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like to use this on my other colors as a top coat. Gives it Sparkle and dresses it up.</li>
    <li> Makes a nice addition over a fun bright color. Beware, this doesn&#x27;t look great on it&#x27;s own, much better on top of a bright color.</li>
    <li> Vegas Nights features a universe of colors of micro size shimmer (glitter) suspended in a clear polish. It is perfect to layer on almost any other color to spark it up. The sparkle is most noticeable up close and has a prism effect that makes the sparkles show up as every color of the rainbow without being \\&quot;in your face\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish polishes come in a few different types of glitter types. This one is a \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; - the smallest size glitter bits you can imagine. It is very easy to evenly distribute the shimmer over other colors with no bare spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful over a Gelish French Manicure for some pizazz. I&#x27;ll post a picture of it over a few different Gelish colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only have a few Gelish colors you want this one!</li>
    <li> Gelish&#x27;s \\&quot;Vegas Nights\\&quot; is a perfect dupe of China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Fairy Dust\\&quot; (regular polish, not a gel/Gelish) - if you love sparkle and glitter and want it in your Gelish, this is the polish for you! Vibrant and sparkly, it&#x27;s gorgeous over Gelish&#x27;s clear \\&quot;Simple Sheer\\&quot; or just about any solid-color Gelish.</li>
    <li> I really love Gelish products and the glitter in Vegas Nights is just what i as looking for! The main reason for my purchase was I wanted something to go over my pink &amp; whites and this looks yellow when i put it on? When i opened it and saw the yellow i thought it would bake clear, but that hasnt been the case. It looks amazing over bright colors and i wear it on my toes ALL the time. But I really wanted something sparkly to put on white tips and this doesnt seem to be it :( did I get a bad one? The decription and all reviews say \\&quot;clear\\&quot;..  Star Rating *3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;So after continued experimentation I decided to give this another shot on my pink and whites with a different clear top coat and vuah-la no yellowing! I have been using CND and Gelish Top it Off for my clear coat and just swtiched to iBD Xtreme French in clear (which has a slight purple/blue tint) and it took the yellow-look completely out of my glitter! I am stoked to say the least becuase i LOVE how tiny the sparkles are in this gel, looks so classy. Im now giving this a 4 rating only because it took using another brand top coat to get the results i think it should have been able to deliver using all Gelish products...</li>
    <li> loves this color and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
    <li> Very nice sparkly gloss.  Looks good over soft colors without being too over the top.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on solid colors yet, but so far I am enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Have used Vegas nights gelish many times, love it!  A great addition to any gelish color.  Must have for your collection of colors.</li>
    <li> This is a really impressive \\&quot;color\\&quot;.  The sparkles are subtle, but come to vibrant life in the sun and in direct light - a photo does not do it justice.  A great top layer over a solid color base.  I ordered mine from Direct Nail Supply, arrived super-quick, in 2 days.  Packaging was minimal.</li>
    <li> The color shown and any pictures that I have taken do not do this color justice.  I love this color by itself, but am finding it hard not to layer it over my other colors as well!  Definitely a must have for the gel polish lover!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite glitter from gelish.  It is very glittery and multicolored and is great for a top coat.  I don&#x27;t think it would be good by itself unless you put a lot of coats on.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! Lots of sparkle. But, wait until you go out in the sun, it comes to life. It shines with lots of colors but, not too much, just right. It&#x27;s gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> I have recently became a HUGE Gelish fan and will NEVER go back to regular nail polish. Will last until it grows out! This color may be best for OVER another color, but can be work alone and wouldnt be too little kid-ish.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best glitter polish that Gelish offers. I love it so much! The sparkles are tiny and reflect a lot of light. I have put it over a few colors but my favorite so far is on top of black. It gets a ton of compliments. I definitely recommend this. But be warned, you&#x27;ll be back to buy another bottle!</li>
    <li> Love this Gelish color - adds just the right touch to a French manicure!  I used two coats in my picture.  Love it when the light catches it - it is dazzling and yet it looks office appropriate!  :)</li>
    <li> Love this polish. It offers a clear, glossy nail cover with bits of silver glitter. It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t show if your nail grows in-between manicures (because it&#x27;s clear).</li>
    <li> I love the glitter in this. It looks great over any color. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! It gives a little extra spunk and glamour to any color in your collection :)</li>
    <li> this sparkles beyond belief. It&#x27;s hard to keep my eyes off of my nails when I&#x27;m wearing this! The glitter is multi-colored and is gorgeous even with one layer. Pretty alone or over any color.</li>
    <li> This is great to put on top of any color. It has so much sparkle (the photo does not show how it actually looks). one coat is enough.</li>
    <li> This polish is super pretty over just about any gelish color.  It adds just the right touch of bling to my nails.  Cant wait to try it on more colors!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish... I looks good over any other color and really dresses up the look... I have used this and reordered it since I first tried it.</li>
    <li> Vegas Nights is a color that I think everyone needs to have.  You can layer it over any other color, even one you may not like otherwise.  It brightens the color up and gives it some additional sparkle.  It also works well on it&#x27;s own, although I personally apply 4 coats of color if I am wearing this by itself, just to get the full sparkle effect.  Love Gelish!</li>
    <li> This is the best glitter topper I&#x27;ve seen.  Very classy, gown-up way to wear glitter without looking like a teenager.  I&#x27;ve worn June Bride before, which is really beautiful, but definitely pink and which has a few bigger holographic flakes in it, so it can look a bit over the top out in the daylight.  Vegas Nights is more subtle, yet very beautiful.  The multicolored glitter particles are very small, but you get enough coverage with just one coat, then you can double that if you want a more noticeable sparkle.  A must-have for enhancing dark or light colors.</li>
    <li> Very nice with any color.  I add it with the color to my toes since I work in a conservative office.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this addition to my color collection.  It adds that little extra sparkle to any color.  Love it!</li>
    <li> First off, I was shocked at how big the bottle is!!:-) ! I never seen a gelish in full size, so that was great. Then I used it, and just like all the other reviews, yes, yes, yes... It is just beautiful! Tiny specks of iridescent colors in a clear gel, not like that cheap glitter stuff. And in the light or sun, its even better. Love it! I wish I could find a wall paint exactly like it for my bedroom!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t like sparkle overkill/explosion. This is very small sparkles, faint but enough to catch the light. I imagine with two coats you could build it up for more flash. I love this. I use the Melody Suzie 12W LED dryer and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This has micro, holo glitters in a clear base.  It looks beautiful over any color!  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite to add a little sparkle to any color... because really in what world is there no glitter.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to when doing my nails. I love the look it gives as a top coat!</li>
    <li> I dont know what to say.. I love the cosmos of colors in this polish, but you must understand that the base is NOT clear. Its got a light yellowy tinge to it, which after searching the internet seems to just be the way this color is, not that I got an old bottle. I really wanted to use this on top of my Arctic Freeze white to get that cute white glitter look, but it turned all my nails dingy yellow. It&#x27;s less noticeable on darker colors.</li>
    <li> As you can can tell by now I,m crazy about all the colors of Gelish nail polish I have purchased.  After I have tried all the colors I purchased, June Bride seems to be my go to for the summer.  I just love the way it glitters in the light.</li>
    <li> I love Vegas Nights and it is one of my favorite &amp;#34;toppers&amp;#34;.  I saw it on Adrea&#x27;s Chickettes website and was convinced I&#x27;d love it.  It&#x27;s a sheer glitter base and could almost take up to 3 coats to make it noticeable.  In my opinion it works best on top of opaque and/or darker colors.  I would seriously not recommend it alone on bare nails.  That is just my opinion.  The glitter is sparse and you kind of have to fish for the sparkles since shaking the bottle is highly discourage.  If I had to compare it to Waterfield...Waterfield winds &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; (no pun) but I&#x27;m not going to shy away from categorizing Vegas Nights as one of my top 5 favorites.  PS:  It arrived before I even had time to question where it could be in its journey to me.  Great vendor!</li>
    <li> It was all right, a nice silver glitter, small in size. Gives a nice sparkle to any color. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not sure if  I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s supposed to be used but this gel polish just takes for ever to dry.</li>
    <li> Great glitter polish that isn&#x27;t over powering on the glitter, it is small pieces of glitter, and i like to wear this over basic colors to give it  a little extra.</li>
    <li> My favorite!! I&#x27;ve used this as a top coat for years, it has JUST enough shimmer to not be too much, yet add that little extra.</li>
    <li> Love this polish and the brand.  Makes any color pop with just one coat.  Definitely recommend for glitter fans! Will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> Goes great over lots of colors--has a  gold tint to it! Love putting it just on the ring fingers over any colors!</li>
    <li> Its a strange color in the bottle &amp; once it cures it has a yellow tint to it, with the sparkles. Makes your nails look strange. Very high odour as well...so I cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> Gave 4 stars cause it wasn&#x27;t quite the color I was expecting. Is a multi colored sparkle. I was expecting just silver specks not multi but maybe I should&#x27;ve known better. Great product tho. Love gelish!</li>
    <li> Great color to be used alone (which would take several coats) or over any color you prefer. I was surprised to see that the base color of this has a light green tint. But when placed over other colors it&#x27;s fine. Lots and lots of shimmer for this color. It pops in the sunlight. Great for summer and popular with my clients. Along with water field and June bride!!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite sparkle ever it is so light it just gives your nails a little extra shine My favorite polish of all time</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to add another glitter to my collection. That being said, I ordered it based on the amazing reviews. I love a glitter and almost always have some kind on my nails. I am a nurse and want interesting nails without it being too much, and without looking childish (I want to be taken seriously)! Vegas Nights is perfect! I often do a simple french using Little Princess and Sheek White with Vegas Nights over just the white tips. It is my favorite! From a distance clean and neat looking but with the fun of a little shimmer. I love that it is not just one color glitter but a whole rainbow of colors. Looks great over every other color. I mean it, you need this polish!</li>
    <li> Update 8/25 - throwing the whole prior review out. When I had this color put on at the salon it had a tan base to it, which I loved on its own. I bought a bottle through Amazon and it&#x27;s a colorless base! This explains why some people complain of it being yellow and others find it too clear. I still like the glitter, but will use it over another color.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading it looks good on top if dark colors as a 3rd coat. I&#x27;m sad that I left the cap partially unscrewed and it leaked everywhere. Had to toss, but want more. Great on top of black, and during the holidays on top of red!</li>
    <li> This is the prettiest little touch of glitter.  It really adds a little something special to your manicure,  Even if I do a french mani, I always like a bit of the glitter on the tips to accent it.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says!  As other have noted, this last more than 2 weeks and is worth every dollar.  I am happy to know that someone thought of a way to bring more versatility to nail care.</li>
    <li> great polish over dark colors. it adds an extra something.super fine pwder glitter in clear polish. it floats on nail.</li>
    <li> Buy it! I adds the perfect sparkle to any color. So far i have tried it on pink and its super pretty.  It took a bit longer to get this one but it came close to the day they said it would.</li>
    <li> Perfect sparkle without looking juvenile. Not crazy about it alone but love it over every color I have.  This is a must have color</li>
    <li> I used this to put over some of my colored polish and everytime I do it i get a million compliments.</li>
    <li> This color seems a little dull- almost made my nails look dirty. Will have to try it again another time to give it a second shot. It was one of my first times doing my own gel nail polish...</li>
    <li> I have my own gel manicure kit. This polish is great for an accent nail or jazzes up a basic color.</li>
    <li> I like the sparkles, but after about a week I notice it starts to flake, not sure if I am doing it right.</li>
    <li> I have put this over top of some of my other colors and it just pops!!  The picture makes it look like just silver, but it all sorts of colors very delicate so can cover over top of pretty much any color to change the look.</li>
    <li> I love this over any color, it may take a few layers but thin layers the glitter in it looks amazing</li>
    <li> You can add the sparkles to colored Gelish nail polish or have it alone.  It looks good any way.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Orderd this color and received a completely different pickish color. Not happy at all. Also pprefer shellac over gelish. it last way longer. don&#x27;t understand how they claim that this nail gel color last three weeks. The most it has lasted is 5 days and i follow all the instructions perfectly. Also damages my nails everysingle time i take it off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves it. I&#x27;ll be buying more colors.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors! Great product!</li>
    <li> This polish was a gift. It is beautiful as on it&#x27;s own or as a coat over another color to make it glitter.</li>
    <li> Great product! It shipped quickly and was good quality. No issues and I loved the color. It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of gelish polishes and this is one of my favorites.  I love it over bright colors, dark colors, as well as semi sheer colors (like little princess...another staple) and it always looks gorgeous. Sometimes I prefer matte colors but when I want a subtle sparkle, I use Vegas nights.  Love it!</li>
    <li> You will get lots of compliments with this one. I love how it masks any manicure imperfections with sparkles. It seems to make the gel manicure last much longer too. Maybe that is just because of having an extra layer?</li>
    <li> love this color!  This is the only color I wear because it&#x27;s goes from daytime to evening and even to black tie so well.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t tell in the picture, but these sparkles are holographic! I love this polish and will be buying it over and over!</li>
    <li> Beautiful glitter. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Clear gel suspension fluid with silver holographic - glitter (dust).&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for that shimmery accent without large chunks of glitter to leave your nails bumpy then this one is for you.&lt;br /&gt; - Gratuitous plug to Payless Nail Supply is amazingly quick with their shipments; I ordered late night on 12/29/12 and received them on 1/2/13.&lt;br /&gt;When searching for a nail product, I check with the Payless Nail Supply store first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with gel polish and I think Gelish products are fantastic. Vegas Nights is a great topper with a multitude of colors rather then just gold sparkles or silver sparkles. Really enhances base colors!</li>
    <li> Like it... don&#x27;t love it... very nice little sparkle, just what I was looking for. SHAKE VERY WELL. and shake again by the 3rd nail.</li>
    <li> This is a clear polish with tiny little flecks in it.  Most flecks you get are silver or gold.&lt;br /&gt;This has rainbow flecks; but it isn&#x27;t too obvious or over-done..  It&#x27;s the perfect topping for something&lt;br /&gt;you want to add a little zing!</li>
    <li> I put this shimmer on over every color I have - it goes with anything, and makes them look amazing. It also looks great over a french tip. It&#x27;s definitely not ment to go on solid, but it is one of the most useful gelish colors I&#x27;ve got, because it can change the look of any of the other colors. Absolutely beautiful. Shimmers all different colors, not just silver as it looks in the pic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still perfecting my gel polish techniques- not only does vegas nights have a great amount of sparkle- not too much, but definitely there, but if you put on the polish a little uneven, the sparkle in vegas nights really helps to hide the unevenness.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty multicolored glitter!! I bought this clear glitter polish to cover some of my other non-glitter colors. Such a fine glitter without looking to \\&quot;tween\\&quot;. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This color is very light and hard to see if it&#x27;s used alone. I would recommend using over another color.</li>
    <li> This is a cute simple glitter gel. Its multi color glitter and very small sparkles. I love wearing this glitter with no color</li>
    <li> This is the best sparkle next to water field. I love how this looks over color or even by itself. Tons of sparkle specks.</li>
