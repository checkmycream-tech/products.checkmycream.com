      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>

      <li>sure to read online about the diff versions of Pola.  </li>
      <li>I love this version of Pola whitening products.  </li>
      <li>love this product, it&#x27;s ease of use, results, and simplicity.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, do not use it more than once in a 24-48 hour period depending on your sensitivity level.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you follow instructions or could damage enamel.</li>
      <li>It seems like this product is old and did not work that great at all.  </li>
      <li>and it was going great, till she went back to smoking.  </li>
      <li>But Love how fast it works!</li>
      <li>I will save the remainder after the first tube is gone for more times when drastic and rapid results are desired.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Have fun!</li>
      <li>They make the process so much easier compared to the cheap ones at drugstores and you get better results as well.</li>
      <li>I use it once or twice between cleanings and have bright white teeth.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t overdo it, this stuff is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>I am going to find something new and better.....</li>
      <li>Fast shipment and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I am not going to order it anymore because I do not feel it was worth my money I paid.  </li>
      <li>I had used this product in the past, years ago and it was really great.  </li>
      <li>i would love, but so far they have gotten much brighter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m faithfully using this product once a day for 30 minutes in a custom tray, &amp; I&#x27;m starting with the top teeth first for comparison</li>
      <li>I recommend the ACT restoring mouthwash used daily while whitening to help avoid this too.  :)</li>
      <li>I did first for 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, no surprises or disappointments.</li>
      <li>At 62 this is a real accomplishment!  </li>
      <li>He gave me these exact tubes</li>
      <li>Plus the packaging works well and keeps the unused gels ready to go.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m beginning to think that perhaps, this really isn&#x27;t 35% peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;Tell</li>
      <li>This really does whiten your teeth about 3-4 shades in one use.</li>
      <li>A good rule of thumb is your teeth should never be whiter than the whites of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, while doing sessions be very careful to check your teeth daily by &amp;#34;tapping&amp;#34; your fingernail to the enamel.</li>
      <li>Better than the Pola product I received from the dentist--and cost a lot less.</li>
      <li>So far, after 4 days, I really don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anybody looking to whiten their teeth on a budget.</li>
      <li>Live and learn.  </li>
      <li>used half a syringe for 30 min and notice a HUGE difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
      <li>it arrived early</li>
      <li>and my teeth are not even that sensitive.</li>
      <li>My kit had no directions as far as timing or duration of treatment.</li>
      <li>Did a second treatment the next day, then waited two more days, then did back to back days for closer to 45 minutes to hour.  </li>
      <li>Have been using this product for several years but getting it from my dentist and paying 4 times as much for it.  </li>
      <li>Be careful not to go TOO strong or your teeth take on a strange &amp;#34;bluish&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t hear the solid &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34; sound that means the enamel could be softening due to the strength of the gel.  </li>
      <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Make sure when you screw the thin applicator tip on this tube, hold your finger over the hole before you push the plunger down for the first time.</li>
      <li>It sort of pops the first time and you could end up forcing out as much as half the gel on accident.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this version of Pola whitening products.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;jump starter&amp;#34; for me.  I have a silicone all in one tray that you bite or chew on instead of a custome made (more cost effective and better if your teeth shift over time).  I will save the remainder after the first tube is gone for more times when drastic and rapid results are desired.&lt;br /&gt;I used half a syringe for 30 min and notice a HUGE difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read online about the diff versions of Pola.  This is just a kick starter meant to be used no more than 30 min max, recommended 15 max for first session to gauge sensitivity and potential results.&lt;br /&gt;PolaDay is one style of gel meant to be used 30min/day in one sitting, or 2 15min sessions.&lt;br /&gt;PolaNight can be put in a tray and worn while sleeping.  The versions are made different and have different viscosity.  Also come in diff strengths.  Be careful not to go TOO strong or your teeth take on a strange &amp;#34;bluish&amp;#34; hue.  A good rule of thumb is your teeth should never be whiter than the whites of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, while doing sessions be very careful to check your teeth daily by &amp;#34;tapping&amp;#34; your fingernail to the enamel. If you don&#x27;t hear the solid &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34; sound that means the enamel could be softening due to the strength of the gel.  If that happens, stop for a while or you&#x27;ll be very unhappy!!!!  I recommend the ACT restoring mouthwash used daily while whitening to help avoid this too.  :)&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, it&#x27;s ease of use, results, and simplicity.  Recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: do not drink coffee, dark sodas, or smoke while treatment cycle is going with any Pola product.  I have one friend that had done several days and it was going great, till she went back to smoking.  It was HORRIBLE and stained almost immediately and worse than before she started.  We never have gotten them back to what we were headed for.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Just make sure you follow instructions or could damage enamel. But Love how fast it works! 15 minutes!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years but getting it from my dentist and paying 4 times as much for it.  I could kick myself for not checking for it on line sooner!  I use it once or twice between cleanings and have bright white teeth.  At 62 this is a real accomplishment!  My dental hygienist always comments on how white my teeth are.  The supplier delivered on time and the product works great.</li>
    <li> This really does whiten your teeth about 3-4 shades in one use. Great even, consistent results too. I actually do an hour though but that&#x27;s because my teeth are not very sensitive. HOWEVER, do not use it more than once in a 24-48 hour period depending on your sensitivity level. I used it twice within a 36 hour period and had to go buy medicine to dumb down the sensitivity in my teeth after. I couldn&#x27;t even open my mouth without it being painful and my teeth are not even that sensitive. That was my fault though. This is really a great product, just be smart when using it. Oh, and buy some quality teeth trays (preferably custom trays). They make the process so much easier compared to the cheap ones at drugstores and you get better results as well.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and highly recommend it. My teeth look great and my teeth cleanings go much faster! Plus the packaging works well and keeps the unused gels ready to go.</li>
    <li> Wish it was a little stronger and thicker</li>
    <li> Better than the Pola product I received from the dentist--and cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> Well, don&#x27;t i feel like a fool!  I just spent $110 at my dentist for this product.  never thought about Amazon until AFTER I had the trays made and paid the dentist.  Live and learn.  I will buy the refills online through AMAZON!!! There is definitely a noticeable difference in my teeth after four treatments. I did first for 30 minutes.  Ouch--lots of sensitivity on gums, not necessarily teeth.  Did a second treatment the next day, then waited two more days, then did back to back days for closer to 45 minutes to hour.  My kit had no directions as far as timing or duration of treatment. My teeth are not naturally a super white, so they will never get to the white i would love, but so far they have gotten much brighter.  You need very little gel in the teeth tray; if it displaces too much, your gums will burn.  You should get two treatments (top and bottom) out of each syringe.  I think I will try the 22% next time.</li>
    <li> Great product and will continue to use. Fast shipment and easy to use. Highly recommend for anybody looking to whiten their teeth on a budget.</li>
    <li> I went to the dentist and purchased a whitening. He gave me these exact tubes but of course at a \\&quot;mark up\\&quot;. I got the dental trays made and tried them out. They worked wonders on my teeth. I am a coffee drinker and ex-smoker. I got a porcelain crown a couple of years ago and got it one of the lightest shades they had because I had planned to keep whitening. I hoped this brand would get them as white because other whiteners had not and my crown stuck out. Well after the second whitening session my other teeth got even whiter than the crown so I stopped. The effect lasted for me about 3 months. But I have three tubes left in this pack. So I would say it&#x27;s a bargain. If you don&#x27;t have trays order some on Amazon. I lost mine and had to order a kit. I got the Watt&#x27;s super thin kit. It worked great. Make sure when you screw the thin applicator tip on this tube, hold your finger over the hole before you push the plunger down for the first time. It sort of pops the first time and you could end up forcing out as much as half the gel on accident. You will see what I mean. You only need to apply a tiny blob to each tooth. Don&#x27;t overdo it, this stuff is pretty strong. Make sure to have some q tips. They are perfect for wiping the gumline if you get some there. Have fun!</li>
    <li> As with any other whitening product you will have some sensitivity.  However, I had my dentist make my trays and after whitening I used Sensidyne or Prevident in the trays for 35 minutes and it reduced the sensitivity quite a lot.  I got great whitening with just 2 whitenings twice a day for just 30 minutes at a time.  Great product</li>
    <li> a great product and it arrived early</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m faithfully using this product once a day for 30 minutes in a custom tray, &amp; I&#x27;m starting with the top teeth first for comparison&lt;br /&gt;purposes. So far, after 4 days, I really don&#x27;t see much difference. And my teeth are not that yellow to begin with, &amp; used to be&lt;br /&gt;brilliant white. So, I&#x27;m beginning to think that perhaps, this really isn&#x27;t 35% peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;Tell me where I&#x27;m going wrong?</li>
    <li> This was not as whitening as Crest Strips! I did not notice any whitening at all!  It seemed like it had been sitting on a shelf a lonog time, and was outdated!  Don&#x27;t waist your money.  Unfortunately I threw the packaging away and the receipt.  Buyer&#x27;s remorse!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, no surprises or disappointments. Product is in perfect shape does the job intended to do. Happy!</li>
    <li> I had used this product in the past, years ago and it was really great.  But his batch did NOT work!  I was told by the seller to put in a return request from Amazon but then they denied it.  What&#x27;s with that?!  I would not purchase from these seller again.  It may be a bad batch, but they are not clear on what they are doing.  Wasted money as I cannot use the product, it is worthless.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product before and it has worked great.  It seems like this product is old and did not work that great at all.  I am not going to order it anymore because I do not feel it was worth my money I paid.  I am going to find something new and better.....sorry.</li>
    <li> I think one of the four tubes had air pockets in it which did not please me.  Otherwise I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and like it.</li>
    <li> Does work, only use a very small amount as it will burn your gums.</li>
    <li> The tubes don&#x27;t last very long but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
