<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I decided to give this brand a try, and it has its ups and downs.  First and foremost, this toothpaste truly works, and makes my teeth feel clean.  On the adverse side, the cinnamon flavor is either too mild, or just outright bad.  The biggest complaint is the tubes themselves.  They always keep their full shape, so unlike most tubes that are easy to empty brush by brush, I find myself frequently rolling and folding the tube to fill my brush.  Earthpaste is a good brand with promise, but their containers need to be reworked.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, funny color but I know its made from stuff that is totally natural! Works really well and tastes great!</li>
    <li> We really love this toothpaste!  My son loves the lemon one!</li>
    <li> Best natural toothpaste ever!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste and have gone through at least 10 tubes, but it goes really fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Got this for my whole family. I have been reading that toothpaste is bad for you to use so I did some research and found this. It does not foam up like toothpaste so make sure you are prepared for that. I like it. My whole family likes them all. I will stay buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> Quad pack to try all flavors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish these become prime soon so I can set up a subscription&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. buy these.. you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> This is a strange toothpaste. If you&#x27;re used to conventional brands than this may take some getting used to. It does not foam but it also doesn&#x27;t contain the chemical to do so. Three or four ingredients is something I really like! The LEMON is the most unique. There is nothing like it. I recommend these highly. I&#x27;ve even given them as gifts...Yeah, I know toothpaste as a gift? I just have to share this product :D</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, love love love!! I will now be buying this toothpaste instead of the other holistic brands. My dentist said my teeth are cleaner, less plaque. And it tastes amazing.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, my family has ALL jumped on the natural bandwagon. My picky son LOVES the lemon. Of all the flavours, I have to agree the Lemon is the best. Next is Peppermint, then Wintergreen and lastly, Cinnamon. (Cinnamon is a bit harsh for me and my son, but, we&#x27;re not fans of cinnamon gum either) I&#x27;m really surprised that we have adopted this new toothpaste. It&#x27;s not gritty at all. I&#x27;m really surprised. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Love it, especially the lemon!</li>
    <li> This is a great introduction to Earth Paste. 4 flavors and it lasts long enough for you to get an idea of how well the product works for you. For me? This is FANTASTIC! I use this in conjunction with my sonicare and my teeth have never felt cleaner. The lead in this product is such a minute amount that there is no reason to panic. Surprisingly, lemon, which i anticipated would be my least favorite, was my favorite of the bunch. Cinnamon takes last place for me but it&#x27;s fine, just nothing I&#x27;m excite about (you know, like lemon. I actually looked forward to brushing my teeth with the lemon flavor). A few weeks after I started using Earth Paste, several people asked what I was using to whiten my teeth- you really could see a difference.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!! A natural toothpaste that I can get behind! This is a different consistency than most are used to, but with a regular toothbrush and some good brushing, it does the trick. The toothpaste is a grayish-brown color due to the clay. It leaves my teeth feeling very clean and makes me feel a lot better about dental hygiene knowing it&#x27;s safe!</li>
    <li> It is not clear on amazon but this toothpaste has lead in it (according to my internet research 5x more than what is allowed in water) and is inappropriate for pregnant women and children. When I attempted to return this toothpaste after reading the label, I was told it was not returnable. 20$ wasted</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the winter mint. Taste pretty good- doesn&#x27;t lather like normal toothpaste because it isn&#x27;t full of crap- only natural ingredients. I feel better know my teeth can do there job without being coated with nonsense from typical toothpaste</li>
    <li> Took me a while to like this. Makes my teeth really clean &amp; shinny. Like I just had them cleaned.</li>
    <li> Great price for great toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is the best all natural toothpaste that I have tried.  Especially the cinnamon.  My teeth come out perfectly clean and there are no harsh chemicals or aftertaste.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Probably it&#x27;s only me who doesn&#x27;t like this toothpaste much. Since it doesn&#x27;t have all those chemicals, not much foam is created and so you have to use a lot of paste in order to brush. BTW, I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month. The teeth (at least in my case) don&#x27;t appear to be squeaky clean. I&#x27;ll update my review if I find it to do a better job.</li>
    <li> Love these.  My kids love the Lemon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to toothpastes that froth. These do not froth at all, which I&#x27;ve come to love! It took some getting used to, but didn&#x27;t take very long. The flavors are great so far. Haven&#x27;t tried the cinnamon yet though. I&#x27;m just glad to be using a more earth friendly toothpaste without all the chemicals.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as it doesn&#x27;t give me feel of enough freshness</li>
    <li> I feel deceived by this company. Only on the back of the box (in tiny print) does it say anything about containing lead and the back of the box is not displayed on their advertisement. I was in a hurry when I ordered this and simply clicked directly to the reviews. The product is highly rated by most people and that was enough to convince me to buy it. Unfortunately, by only reading the some of the reviews, I bypassed the questions and answers section where users have revealed that the product contains lead. It&#x27;s my fault entirely for missing this, but if I had seen the questions and answers, I never would have ordered this product. In my opinion, the company should have disclosed this more actively by at least posting a photo of the back of the box.  As of now, anyone who has a thyroid or other endocrine disorder should be warned about this product. Lead is a heavy metal endocrine disruptor, in the same category as arsenic, cadmium and mercury. I&#x27;m hoping that by reviewing the product it will alert others. But, for me, I guess I can use my 4-pack of earthpaste as a doorstop. It&#x27;s not going in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I try to stay natural as much as possible, but brushing my teeth with dirt is pushing the limits a bit</li>
    <li> I like these toothpastes for the time being. Plan on making my own in the near future.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a toothpaste that would be a healthier alternative to some of the mainstream toothpastes. We tried all the flavors of Earth Paste and mainly are disappointed in the product&#x27;s breath freshening ability.</li>
    <li> The flavors are great. But it doesn&#x27;t leave you with any type of clean feel. I also felt like my gums were dirty. This product came highly recommended from a lot of earthy friends... but it mus not be for me. My 2 young boys love the lemon flavor and never complain about a feel... but they are little.</li>
    <li> It is good stuff with a good flavor if you don&#x27;t mind not having any lather. Which, apparently, I really like. So, while I recommend it, I won&#x27;t buy it again because I need bubbles. Hopefully Redmon hears me and makes something safe and bubbly &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Husband is not a fan, but daughter and I have moved over completely to our new toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ever. You could eat it if you want! I use the various mint flavors in morning but before bed the leon flavored is so soothing and relaxing for sleep. Using this daily and augmenting with Dr. Christopher&#x27;s tooth powder has gave me my best dental checkups in my life. Please read up on the chemicals added to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste and see if you want those poisons in your mouth.      I almost forgot. Purchase some of those big black and chrome spring clips (about 2 1/2 inches wide), you get a box of 4 at Walmart for about 3 bucks, As you use the toothpaste the clips will keep all the paste ready to come out, otherwise you will get sputtering as you use the paste up. The clips keep the toothpaste coming out like a new tube all the way till it is all gone.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  Of course, it&#x27;s not going to save you from cavities if you keep a regular diet of greasy fast foods and candy, but with a healthy diet, we have seen it improve our dental issues.  There&#x27;s no replacement for a good tooth cleaning though.  And floss.</li>
    <li> Lead risk warning on the side of the tube.</li>
    <li> My story began last May 2014 during a visit to my dentist when I was told that I had 4 cavities in all four of my wisdom teeth. Of course this came as a shock to me as I have always been borderline obsessed with my oral hygiene. After asking him what I could do to heal my teeth, his only advice to me was that since wisdom teeth are difficult to care for in preventing cavities, my only options were to have them removed or fill my cavities as a temporary fix. I&#x27;ve always been a firm believer in that there are natural ways our bodies can heal themselves. So it made no sense to me that the same did not apply to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 6 months later and none of the natural toothpastes I was using were working and my teeth and gums were so sensitive that eating had become torture. After extensive research I stumbled upon a blog post about Earthpaste. After reading overwhelmingly positive reviews regarding the product I figured I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for the past 6 months and &amp;#34;OMG&amp;#34; after my first use I knew immediately that this product is the real deal. My teeth have never felt so clean. Since I&#x27;ve been using Earthpaste these past 6 months all the discomfort I was feeling before has completely gone away. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave that overwhelming after taste that you normally do from conventional toothpastes. But I must say that the one thing that takes some getting used to is the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have put together a tooth care regimen that seems to be working perfectly for me&lt;br /&gt;Brush daily twice a day with Earthpaste and floss with Desert Essence floss&lt;br /&gt;Oil pulling with coconut oil 2 to 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;Brushing with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide once a week&lt;br /&gt;Drink a glass of goat milk (whenever I can) for calcium to ensure strong bones and teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had a visit to my dentist a week and half ago and he genuinely seemed shocked by the healthy condition of my teeth. I tried explaining to him what I&#x27;ve been doing but he seemed doubtful. Oh well, all I can say is that I firmly stand behind this product and I&#x27;m so beyond grateful to have found it. I can&#x27;t even imagine the amount of money, pain and discomfort I&#x27;ve been spared had I gone ahead and removed my wisdom teeth. If you&#x27;re thinking about giving this product a try give it a shot I swear you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> These are great. I mostly got them for my kids because they&#x27;re not good at spitting out toothpaste, and these actually *improve* your health if you swallow them. I was making my own tooth powder for my family, but I bought these because my family wanted the traditional feel of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste, but I wanted something safer.&lt;br /&gt;I use these in nontraditional ways, too: face masks, boo-boos, etc. I trust this company and this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this multipack because each of my children wanted a different flavor of toothpaste to try out.  I have brushed my teeth with all of the falvors in this pack; lemon, cinnamon, wintergreen, and peppermint; I loved them all.  My teeth feel so clean and I feel great knowing that there are no unwanted chemicals going down my throat or soaking into my skin.  I highly recommend this earthpaste to anyone, even babies.  It says this can be eaten!</li>
    <li> Not terribly fond of this toothpaste.  While my teeth feel clean after using it, that clean feeling doesn&#x27;t last all day.  I&#x27;ve also found that it dries out my lips far too much.  I&#x27;ve used much better..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try the Redmon Eartpaste Natural Toothpaste - 4 pack. It gave me and my family a chance to try each flavor. I like the cinnamon and my daughter likes the spearmint. I also like how it makes my teeth feel clean - like going to the dentist. Particularly when I use an electric toothbrush. The next time, I&#x27;ll probably just buy the spearmint. Although if I do decide to buy another 4 pack, I can use the other flavors in the guest and powder bathrooms.</li>
    <li> Love it. My teeth feel cleaner and they feel clean all day. The toothpaste looks gross but tastes good. Love the cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this toothpaste. I love it&#x27;s all natural approach. I even love the name! Unfortunately for me I don&#x27;t feel that it cleaned well enough. I have a partially erupted wisdom tooth and the gums around it began getting infected frequently. I had to use antibiotics and/or lots of peroxyl mouth wash frequently. I didn&#x27;t realize it was the toothpaste until I started getting infections every month on the roof of my mouth in the exact same spot for about 3 months. As an experiment I changed toothpaste and within two days the infection started to clear up. I&#x27;ve used and loved Earthpaste for about 1 1/2 years and I regret not being able to use it but it&#x27;s clear, for me, it&#x27;s effectively failing at its sole purpose.</li>
    <li> We really like this product.  I like the fact that it does not foam in my mouth.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> Brush your teeth with this and DO NOT use a fluoride toothpaste EVER again. I am really not sure what fluoride does to the body but if HITLER used it then I don&#x27;t want near my mouth. Amen. Spiritu Sancti……..</li>
    <li> Love it!  Limited ingredients, no chemicals and it seems to make our teeth whiter than regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Read the fine print before u buy. Contains small amount of lead. Now I have 4 tubes of this toothpaste and don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it or letting my children use it. I&#x27;ve done my homework about this product and the lead warning but I still don&#x27;t have peace of mind.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> BEWARE this product contains LEAD!!!!! We had a shipment that did not have the &amp;#34;California lead warning&amp;#34; so my 8yr old used the product regularly for almost a year. *********SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR LEAD!********* It negatively affected her spleen, it&#x27;s taking 3 months to detox her. I was able to link her tests to this product only because the 2nd shipment had the new warnings on the label!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the lemon one! My daughter actually likes to brush her teeth now, no more fighting! My favorite will always be peppermint but the cinnamon flavor is good too. It isn&#x27;t spicy or hot like i expected. I&#x27;ve been waiting to finish up the cinnamon paste before I try the wintergreen flavor. i love having a bunch of different flavors to choose from every morning &amp; night!</li>
    <li> I am never going back to regular toothpaste again. I instantly noticed a difference in cleanliness. I initially bought this to re-mineralize my teeth but after reading more about how unhealthy the toothpastes I&#x27;ve been using all of my life were, I only want to use all natural ingredients. I wasn&#x27;t worried about the taste or the consistency and really didn&#x27;t have to, Earthpaste is awesome. My gums are looking healthier after only a few days of use and I no longer gag from all of the foaming agents added to my former paste. Seriously, I am telling everyone I know about Earthpaste, yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey but compared to what you save in the health of your teeth and gums, I&#x27;m willing to pay that. I highly recommend this product and have no doubt that this product is truly improving my oral health  :D</li>
    <li> Well I sure was hoping this would work due to the fact it being all natural.  But my experience was just after a few times using it, the back of my front teeth ,uppers and lowers felt gritty , like tarter was building up.  After clearing it up with toothpaste,  I tried a few more times and ended up with the same results.  I guess everybody is different because some people seem to like it, but I wonder what time will tell us. Will your next dentist visit end up with more plaque than normal?</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste to use ever! Less sensitive teeth and no worries when my kids ingest the lemon toothpaste! Cinnamon is not my favorite but I still love the product.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great. However, the packaging is clunky and it&#x27;s annoying to try to screw the huge caps back on. Also the spearmint has a weird plastic aftertaste like maybe the bottle wasn&#x27;t washed all the way before it was filled. Because of this I am not sure if I will reorder from this company before looking into other clay toothpaste brands.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works great &amp; i recommend to use this toothpaste with a nimbus toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Well, I just got these in this week and have gave them all a try, and well as my granddaughters. I, myself, like them all just fine, but the granddaughters weren&#x27;t to big on it, but did prefer the lemon. I will buy more in the future for it being organic...good stuff!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this, and I&#x27;ve tried it before, my whole family now uses it, second pack is now bought, also really like the Redmond Clay!</li>
    <li> I am worried that it has been making my teeth sensitive. I noticed that there had abrasions on a gum after use, once stopped the abrasions left. I may use the toothpaste again, however; I hope that it does not cause any damage to my teeth. Apart form that problem which could be a figment of my imagination, it really does leave your teeth clean!</li>
    <li> Teeth nice and clean gums feel great, have only tried the wintergreen and lemon both have good flavors, in sure kids would especially like the lemon,will never use any othet type of toothpaste</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great product I can&#x27;t wait to purchase again. I love earth paste. I love the earth and you should too. Don&#x27;t put fluoride in your mouth it is very toxic and very bad for you.</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural toothpastes and toothsoap, and this is my favorite. It really helps to whiten the teeth due to the clay and at my last dentist appointment, I had better dental health than previously when I was not yet using it. It also makes my teeth feel clean. Finally, I also found a flavor of toothpaste my son enjoys, Lemon!</li>
    <li> the wife bought a tube of this stuff somewhere, possibly Amazon, loves it so much that is now being forced on me. so obviously it must be good because she is now buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t have enough breath freshening action. I need mouthwash after I use it, which isn&#x27;t necessary with most other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> My husband and I like it and my 2-1/2 year old great granddaughter uses it when she comes to visit.  Safe to swallow.  No glycerin, no fluoride, no artificial color.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Read about it and seems like a healthier alternative to traditional toothpaste and decided to try it. Doesn&#x27;t foam so was initially a little surprised by it, but the whole family was used to it within a day. Even my VERY picky 11 year old uses it. I think it encourages softer brushing since it doesn&#x27;t foam, which is good for me because I have made my gums recede from hard brushing over the years. Leaves teeth feeling and tasting fresh and clean. Highly reccommend. Good price for four bottles too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m concerned about the lead in this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My kids love it too!  Had no problems at all adjusting to &amp;#34;no foaming&amp;#34; and it tastes great.  The only adjustment for me was that my teeth feel really clean but I don&#x27;t get that cold, fresh mouth feel after brushing like I did with regular toothpaste so I&#x27;m much more apt to use mouthwash now than I was before.</li>
    <li> The taste takes some getting used to but its all organic so its worth it</li>
    <li> We have been using this for the past 4 months or so.  We love it!  Definitely not like normal toothpaste, so it does feel strange at first, but the results are hard to argue with!</li>
    <li> I love it and was surprised it is brown and not white. Love the ingredients or lack thereof, none of the bad stuff and all of the good. I bought 4 flavored but have only used the lemon so far. I am sure I will love the others as well....</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be buying again only liked the lemon one</li>
    <li> Very happy to find this toothpaste. Searched high and low for toothpaste free of glycerin and it&#x27;s properties of blocking remineralization of teeth. So far the only glycerin-free toothpaste we could find was liquid and messy to use. Not any more! The paste in this product has a very good consistency. Plus, no fluoride.  My favorite flavor is the lemon but they are all good.  The health food store has just started carrying these, too, but at a much higher price.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, they are the most natural and healthy that i have found till now.&lt;br /&gt;i do recommended it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think about this product. Subjectively it seems great. But I have concerns about lead. I&#x27;ve found two different blogs that make the best case for and against. I think you should read both and decide for yourself:  The case against:  http://leadsafeamerica.org/earthpaste/  The case for:  http://ecofriendlymamausa.com/2014/05/15/lead-in-bentonite-clay-based-toothpaste-is-any-amount-safe/  Again, my subjective experience with this toothpaste is that it&#x27;s great. But I can&#x27;t endorse it wholeheartedly because I don&#x27;t have a conclusive opinion about the lead issue.  If I could bypass leaving a certain number of stars, I would. IMO this toothpaste is either great OR it&#x27;s terrible. And I&#x27;m not sure which it is. But I think anyone purchasing this product should consider this issue before choosing to use it.</li>
    <li> We just switched over to Earthpaste and even my 2 year old likes it. We&#x27;ve tried Wintergreen and Lemon Twist so far, and both are terrific. It actually encourages me to brush more because it makes your mouth feel clean and fresh, but doesn&#x27;t have that lingering effect of traditional toothpastes where you can&#x27;t eat directly afterward. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a toothpaste like this and I really like them.  I tried the cinnamon, lemon, and peppermint so far but not the wintergreen.  I like the peppermint and lemon the best.  I&#x27;m going to use them for a while before I decide if this is the new toothpaste for me, but so far I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> This product may benefit you since you will not ingest fluorure but  its way too expensive compared to other similar products,&lt;br /&gt;you have to use double amount to cover the toothbrush and will not lats much.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it s overpriced</li>
    <li> Love the paste and love the flavors. Great natural product!</li>
    <li> Just started using; seems fine</li>
    <li> love this toothpaste! I&#x27;m very into natural and organic products and this was my favorite toothpaste without fluoride that i had found. tastes awesome and i buy this pack from amazon because it beats my local stores price.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural toothpaste I have ever tried,  I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Not sure about this yet.  Found buying the variety was more cost effective than the singles.  Liked the idea of the lemon but it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling clean or fresh.  Do not care for mint so not much left for choice.</li>
    <li> Have only used one so far, it&#x27;s a lot of toothpaste for the cost!  So far, I like it.</li>
    <li> I used the wintergreen one day and it left my front teeth sore, so I decided to use the peppermint and it made the soreness worse. I think the idea is great if it actually helped my teeth. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an all-natural toothpaste that actually works and doesn&#x27;t taste like butts. This is it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much creamier and smoother than I expected, and the lemon flavor is surprisingly awesome! They&#x27;re all flavored with a natural sweetener that is actually good for your teeth, so they all taste pretty awesome, and clean my teeth well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Earthpaste order and I will definitely order this set again!</li>
    <li> The best thing. I have ordered for my son. He swallows it sometimes but I am not too worried about it ))</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner and less plague build up (I learned from another Amazon customer that other toothpastes have glycerin that coats your teeth - guess that&#x27;s why my teeth always felt sticky even after brushing).  So far I love this paste, seems like my gums are less irritated when I floss.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Prompt shipping!</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this item quite by mistake, and decided to try it. The toothpaste is slightly gritty, but not unpleasant. I have only tried the lemon flavor so far and like it very much. You can purchase the different flavors individually which is good if you decide on a favorite. Would love to see this available in travel size tubes as well.</li>
    <li> It took a few days to get used to.  I missed the fresh strong minty taste that I would get the Tom&#x27;s toothpaste.  It&#x27;s been several weeks since I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s and decided to try it again.  YEEECH!  It all of a sudden was just waaaay toooooo sweeeeet!!!!  Went back to my natural toothpaste and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;m on the peppermint right now, it&#x27;ll be a while before I get to the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to normal toothpaste again</li>
    <li> Love the multi-pack. Our children love these and we use them in combination with Orawellness HealThy Mouth tooth cleanser. Highly recommend if you want cleansing that lasts without all the awful chemicals in conventional products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what the picture shows. And I can&#x27;t find a link to notify the seller 😢</li>
    <li> The toothpaste was strange at first being brown, but I have came to enjoy it, I have tried the cinnamon and now I am using the peppermint, I like the peppermint best so far, I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Good product, recommend this for people.</li>
    <li> Have to use it for a while to really know.  Tastes great; smooth toothpaste.  My sister has an autistic son and uses this all the time; no fluoride, so if he swallows it, it won&#x27;t harm him.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both enjoy using this toothpaste line.  As long as you know that there will be no foaming action, there is nothing to adjust to versus the conventional toothpastes.  Also, we don&#x27;t feel the need to followup with mouthwash after brushing our teeth.  I&#x27;ve already ordered more Earthpaste so we definitely intend on sticking with this brand.</li>
    <li> It has lead in it. Higher levels Than are recommended for human consumption in fact. Hense the warning on it saying it&#x27;s unsafe. Please be smart and use a different brand. These people should not be trusted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got everyone in the family switched over to Earthpaste. There&#x27;s a flavor for everyone and I love that it&#x27;s safe to swallow!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam since there s no foaming agent  in it but it still is great!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! If you&#x27;re looking to go flouride free, look no further. My kids love the lemon flavor and wintergreen is my favorite!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s a nice change from making my own bentonite paste. My daughter loves the lemon flavor, it sounds weird but it&#x27;s pretty tasty. Anyway- good product, I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is very simple and natural, and I actually know what all of the ingredients are! AMAZING! I usually make my own toothpaste, but its nice to have some in a tube for traveling or for if I run out and don&#x27;t have time to make my own. I thought that the lemon flavor might be weird, but it turns out that it is my favorite one! I would reccomend this toothpaste to any crunchy person out there! If you are making the switch to a crunchy life and have never had a natural toothpaste before, I will warn you that toothpastes like these do not have a foaming agent which means they will not make a bunch of foamy bubbles in your mouth like you are use to, but don&#x27;t worry, it will clean your teeth just fine. If you feel a gritty earthy feeling in your mouth after, just rinse your mouth out or do some oil pulling and it will take away that gritty texture. I usually alternate between coconut oil based toothpaste and this for a balanced clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Still on the first tube, but my teeth feel cleaner. I love the lack of lather, but I&#x27;m probably in the minority. Haven&#x27;t been to the dentist since starting this new regime so I cannot attest to its real effectiveness. I would still recommend this paste.</li>
    <li> Our family of 4 has been using this toothpaste for months now and overall we&#x27;re really pleased. It takes some getting used to, switching from conventional toothpaste, but it&#x27;s so worth it. The ingredients are about as clean as you can ask for. The flavors are decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides are that you absolutely must put the cap on tightly or it will dry out, and that it kind of gunks up our electric toothbrushes. We&#x27;ve found we have to take them apart and clean them about every three days or they really start to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we&#x27;ll continue using because we&#x27;re tired of the junk that&#x27;s in conventional products.</li>
    <li> The taste is fine but it seems like creme and not paste. There isn&#x27;t really a lot of abrasive feel to it. We will not buy again. Maybe if it had some baking soda in it it would be better.</li>
    <li> Great kid friendly product no chemicals or harsh abrasives. Great for sensative teeth and allergy friendly. You&#x27;ll be happy too</li>
    <li> It took a few uses to get used to the &amp;#34;no foaming&amp;#34; but I like it. It does leave a clean feeling. I prefer wintergreen but my picky children will use the lemon! I love the simple, natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  It cleans my teeth and keeps my breath fresh longer than other toothpastes.  I like the mild flavors, too. (Cinnamon was the strongest, put not overpowering.) Because there is no fluoride, Earthpaste is safe to swallow...and you don&#x27;t need water to rinse.  (Running late for school or work? You can brush in the car!  Going camping?  On a recon mission?  Carry Earthpaste in your cargo pocket!) Earthpaste won&#x27;t stain your clothes the way other toothpastes do, so the kiddos can brush teeth with their good clothes on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing preventing a &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34; review is that Earthpaste does not keep my teeth white.  I still have to use a diluted peroxide rinse.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE(2/17/17) The recipe has changed in the paste has more water.  It is easier to squeeze but the tube does not last as long.</li>
    <li> my wife loves these, i think the mint is where it&#x27;s at as far as freshest breath goes.</li>
    <li> As a pregnant and nursing Mom, I was looking for a non toxic alternative to traditional toothpaste, ordered this, was about to put it on my toothbrush, then luckily saw the warning label.  I&#x27;m not willing to exposure myself to even a small amount of lead knowingly, so I sent this back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Though we each have our favorite flavor, my husband and I much prefer this paste to the typical stuff we have used our entire lives.  Earthpaste leaves the teeth feeling clean, not slimy.  The paste can be swallowed without being toxic, unlike regular paste.  It is brown- which takes some getting used to, and it has a different texture at first.  Once we got used to it, we both found we preferred it.  It does not have fluoride, but our water has TONS of it- we don&#x27;t feel we are missing out on any fluoride.</li>
    <li> Apart from the expected gritty texture, and the plastic container which is an annoying juggle to squeeze when extracting the paste at the end, I like the the fact that I&#x27;m not putting heavy industrial chemicals (that you&#x27;re warned not to swallow!) in my mouth.  It isn&#x27;t foamy like regular toothpaste, yet my teeth feel quite clean.  I tend to brush rather harshly, but I have not had issues with gum bleeding as with industrial paste.  Neither have I had to use extra elbow grease to remove plaster-like residue from my sink surface!  The lemon flavor is my favorite; the peppermint was tame, and I thought I&#x27;d hate the cinnamon flavor like I did with industrial paste, but to my amazement, I liked it almost as much as the lemon.</li>
    <li> Lemon flavor is definitely the best for kids.</li>
    <li> I returned the toothpaste...advertising did not state it had lead in it.  My granddaughter refused to use it and I could not fathom using toothpaste with lead....it also was had a strange, unpleasant consistency....sorry, wanted to love it...but NOT</li>
    <li> Excellent price for this all-natural brand of toothpaste.  At home I usually use a homemade blend of coconut oil and baking soda, but this brand is a great price and also much simpler for when I have to travel.  I still use my homemade toothpaste every morning, but I use this brand as my evening toothpaste and its just great.</li>
    <li> Seemed a little strange at first to use mud to clean my teeth but I just love the stuff! It helps to keep my mouth feeling fresher throughout the day and it also seems to be helping with my gums where I was seeing some receding. It doesn&#x27;t foam at all so it seems like there&#x27;s not much in your mouth but you only need to put a small amount on your toothbrush to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I like it…my kids not so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fanatic about my teeth feeling clean and avoiding harmful chemicals, pesticides and antibiotics.  I appreciate that Redmon Earthpaste contains no harmful ingredients.  It took a few weeks to get used to the texture and the lack of foam but, I after seeing the results I would never go back to traditional toothpastes, most especially those with Flouride.  While Flouride has NEVER been proven to fight cavities in adults, it HAS been proven to be harmful to us.  Earthpaste is totally non-toxic and my teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> texture is too gritty, not good for sensitive teeth AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I have pretty weak teeth, and am constantly feeling like I&#x27;m getting cavities, or soft spots. This didn&#x27;t used to be the case. I went 26 years without a single cavity. Not sure what changed, but when I hit 26, my teeth got weak, sensitive, and were unable to heal themselves. I started doing research, as I didn&#x27;t want to believe that painful and expensive dental procedures were my fate. I heard about toothpaste recipes that would help restore your teeth&#x27;s enamel, and strengthen them in the process. Before making my own, however, I tried to find an alternative that would save me the step (What if I hated it? Yikes!). I found the Earthpaste website through a Google search, looking for glycerin and fluoride free toothpastes, and the other reviews were what got me to try this four pack (I&#x27;m nothing if not frugal, and $5 and change each for good-sized tubes seemed like a great deal!). They arrived yesterday, and I first tried the Wintergreen. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a taste, but I did notice a clean feeling, as well as my mouth not being overly dry, like with most commercial toothpastes. Before bed, I tried the cinnamon, which had a bit of a watery consistency, but it still worked, and wasn&#x27;t over powering (cinnamon can burn). I brought the Lemon Twist with me to work today, and plan to keep that one here to brush after lunch, and if it&#x27;s as great as the reviews say, I&#x27;m probably going to be a Mud Mouth for life. Here&#x27;s hoping my teeth can start to heal themselves naturally, with a combination of Earthpaste and Oil Pulling with Virgin Coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  I like all the flavors (lemon is a little weird because it just isn&#x27;t the typical &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; flavor, but it still works great).  I like that if you swallow it accidentally, it is not harmful to your body.  My teeth feel clean and shiny after using it.  Also, I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave the white film in my mouth that typical tooth paste does.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  Yes, it&#x27;s brown, yes, it&#x27;s non-foaming, yes, it leaves my mouth clean and fresh!  I&#x27;ve tried all the flavors, my favorite is the wintergreen.  I have re-ordered and found I can just purchase the wintergreen - yay!  I have seen the negative reviews, most are concerned with the trace amounts of lead - I get that, still lead is found in so many things, even water.  This paste is not meant to eat.  I&#x27;d much rather have a trace amount of lead than flouride, or many other chemicals that are put in food.  This is my go-to toothpaste.  Thanks Earthpaste for a great product!</li>
    <li> We have tried many natural toothpastes and rinses.  This is the only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t make my husband&#x27;s tongue feel burnt.  (not sure what causes this)  But we love this brand.  Lemon is my favorite so far and Wintergreen is my husband&#x27;s.  Haven&#x27;t tried the others yet, but that&#x27;s why I bought the variety pack to see which one we liked the best.</li>
    <li> We were very happy with the first use of this product. This is our second order for the family, so we have been using this for about 2-3 months.  Our gums are suddenly very sensitive, bleeding, and receding.  It is not due to our nutrition or lack of the proper vitamins. This may just not be the right product for us.  Was happy to find a natural, fluoride-free toothpaste. Spry worked for a while then we had tartar problems.  We&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste. I recommend using this brand over the toxic common toothpaste companies.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like at all such a nasty taste and I feel like my teeth aren&#x27;t clean after brushing won&#x27;t order this again!!!</li>
    <li> Love Earth toothpaste. First tried lemon. Was great tasting and loved how it made my mouth feel. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> so far so good, only tried peppermint thus far but it&#x27;s a nice taste.... definitely you have to get used to the no foam factor, but that&#x27;s a good thing! great product, nothing bad....teeth still feel clean!</li>
    <li> I thought it&#x27;d be nasty but my husband and I have been very convicted lately about how we care for our body. We recently made the switch to all &amp;#34;real food&amp;#34; and shampoo &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and now earthpaste (baking soda was just too weird to us). This stuff is all natural. The &amp;#34;trace amounts of metal&amp;#34; post here on amazon made me hesitant. But there are trace amounts of metal in the clay that is used to make this toothpaste. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s benonite clay. Super great detoxer! Anyhow, our toddler enjoys the lemon (kid safe!), and we enjoy the wintergreen the most. I just ordered two more of the wintergreen. The cinnamon doesn&#x27;t feel as refreshing as the wintergreen to us. None of them are nasty though. We&#x27;re sold, and we&#x27;ll be stocking up on these for years to come. :)</li>
    <li> I am an earthpaste convert! My favorite is the cinnamon but the rest of my family likes the mints better.</li>
    <li> I love love this toothpaste. I was just doing baking soda along with lemon and got tired of doing that. I love the natural ingredients in this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Excellent! We all love it, the lemon is yummy!</li>
    <li> The thing I can&#x27;t get used to is the lack of foaming, and lack of freshness. We&#x27;ve gone through six tubes, probably. Finally convinced the wife to go back to Tom&#x27;s, or something.</li>
    <li> Tastes good, works good, and better for the environment. All around good deal. I highly recommend this toothpaste. Cinnamon flavor is not too spicy. I was worried it may be.</li>
    <li> Immediately loved this toothpaste. Teeth feel much cleaner and for longer. Minimal ingredient list was a plus. Great flavor and texture. Loved that the EWG Skin Deep database ranked this a zero.</li>
    <li> I love it that it&#x27;s all natural and not harmful. I was afraid it will taste weird, but it doesn&#x27;t taste weird at all. It was a very natural transition. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; yet, but I definitely don&#x27;t have any problem. Ever since using Sensodyne sensitive, I couldn&#x27;t switch to any other tooth paste. I was afraid I would have a problem with this. But I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitive to hot or cold drinks/food.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve gone through one tube and am happy.  My most recent dentist visit was about 3 weeks after starting on this paste and I noticed much less scraping being done by the hygienist. I feel it&#x27;s doing a much better job of cleaning my teeth.  I do wish that it had a stronger flavor though.  I find myself missing the minty feeling in my mouth after brushing.  My teeth feel clean after brushing though so no complaint there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a product with good natural ingredients. Thanks. This has good flavors also. Thanks for having such great products.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste as it is free of toxic junk. That is important to me. Also, there is very little taste. The only thing that I don&#x27;t really care for is that it is a bit thin so it falls off my toothbrush before I can actually get it into my mouth. Also, it tends to splatter more than others.  Other than that, its nice stuff.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot). It leaves my teeth and mouth feeling very clean and healthy for much longer than even regular toothpaste.  The flavors are all very pleasant (aside from peppermint,  but it&#x27;s not the toothpaste&#x27;s fault-- I just dislike peppermint in general). I highly recommend this.  Be prepared if it&#x27;s your first time using SLS-free toothpaste,  though-- it doesn&#x27;t foam at all.</li>
    <li> Had I known about the lead in this toothpaste, I never would have bought it. Fortunately, my toddler refused to use it. Guess she is smarter than me.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re really happy with this toothpaste, especially the lemon flavor. It doesn&#x27;t foam up and get bubbly like conventional toothpaste, but I&#x27;m really happy with the fact that there is no glycerine to prevent the topical reminerlization of the teeth from the consumption of raw milk, bone broth, and fermented cod liver oil. And it tastes MUCH better than tooth powders.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste definitely cleans your teeth well. It makes them feel like they were polished. However, the texture and look is disgusting. I&#x27;m not a fan of the cinnamon flavor at allll. The other flavors are good. You have to use a good amount to feel like it&#x27;s actually clean good enough. Overall, the toothpaste works but I will not be buying it again. Just not a fan of it at all. I would rather use Tom&#x27;s or Honest Brand toothpaste. It has more of a toothpaste texture, taste, smell, etc</li>
    <li> How I love the fast of all their flavors! The lemon flavor is so delicious, I want to actually eat it like candy. It&#x27;s a shame to have to spit it out! Recommend this toothpaste to anyone and everyone that brushes their teeth. Its not foamy like the traditional toothpaste but it is just as effective. It leaves a wonderful clean feeling in the mouth.</li>
    <li> the thing about this toothpaste you kinda run out fast, but it is really good. Natural, Simple, No chemicals and bull s*** additives! this is the real deal!</li>
    <li> I love this clay based toothpaste. Very natural - nice subtle flavor and teeth feel clean not washed with chemicals.</li>
    <li> tastes great, my teeth feel polished and clean.  t takes a few brushing to get used to the lack of foam like other toothpastes have but now i do not miss it at all.</li>
    <li> I use this with an electric toothbrush and love it. It&#x27;s gentle, simple and effective. I&#x27;m a fruitarian and other natural toothpastes can be very harsh. Not this product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my mouth and does a great job. I brush twice and find that the second time around provides a nice whitening effect too!</li>
    <li> I like it, but don&#x27;t expect it to foam up like regular toothpaste. That took some getting used to, but you&#x27;ll find even without the foaming, your mouth will still feel clean after you brush.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit skeptical and also procrastinated for a long time due to the price. However, I received this exactly as described and it works awesome. I especially like how my teeth feel clean and the taste afterward is pleasant and not over powering like most tooth pastes. I also feel infinitely better letting my two year old brush his teeth now. This is a fantastic product and like mentioned several times before a little bit of earth paste goes a LONG way. I am very confident that though the price is a bit high this is going to last a long time and be a lot better for my family.</li>
    <li> Love love love this toothpaste. Lemon is definetly the family favorite!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever.  Leaves teeth feeling hygienist clean. Wish they had a choice of purchasing a set of only one flavor.  Cinnamon being the favorite here.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this toothpaste, but it just didn&#x27;t do us any good.  Didn&#x27;t help with gum problems.  Maybe it&#x27;s just for people with normal, fairly healthy teeth.  I applaud the company&#x27;s efforts in making an all-natural toothpaste, but it just didn&#x27;t work for us.  If you want to try it, I recommend the wintergreen and peppermint flavors.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave your breath very fresh...the lemon is just gross. The others I like okay, but never feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after use. Also the hole on the top of the tube is way too small for paste to flow and it&#x27;s a bit clunky (as it&#x27;s mud) and usually splatters all over the wall and yes, it&#x27;s dirt colored. I wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> THIS toothpaste gets your teeth CLEAN! plus it is one of the very cleanest toothpastes on the market. No crap or poisons in it.</li>
    <li> Read the package it contains trace amounts of lead, I&#x27;ll pass on this product</li>
    <li> Our new favorite toothhpaste... now all we use.  Safe and healthy for the family.  No worries when the 3 year  old eats it.</li>
    <li> From the ratings of others I was expecting more. The taste is fine, the texture is fine but there just wasnt the wow impact I was wanting. Doesnt leave your mouth fresh feeling but it does feel clean. Knowing that is healthier than other brands is the reason for the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Such a great Deal!!! And the variety rocks! I use the mint one, hubby uses cinnamon, and I use the Lemon on my son. Win win Win!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low to find a great natural toothpaste and I think I have succeeded with Earthpaste!  Not to mention, it has been a hit with our 2 and 4 year old!</li>
    <li> I like that these are natural toothpastes without colors, additives, glycerine, etc and without it tasting like candy. Even if my 2yr old does want to eat it, I know that&#x27;s ok! She likes the yellow one and we use the others.</li>
    <li> My family and I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s so amazing to have a toothpaste out there with minimal ingredients and that is good for you. The flavors are nice and not overpowering and it&#x27;s so safe, you can even swallow it and it won&#x27;t hurt you like ordinary toothpaste can. I only wish they had a pet version without the xylitol and flavorings, but it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to mix a batch of my own with their Redmond Clay for internal use. Great product and the multipack is an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Love the taste, consistency and fresh feel this leaves in my mouth!</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of the usual toothpaste it took a moment to get used to the earth paste. I love that it doesn&#x27;t burn like the usual brands, but my teeth and mouth feel clean and healthy. My favorite is the lemon taste.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste.  The one and only I was able to find without glycerin.  Makes all the difference.  I hope they will keep making it.</li>
    <li> the kids love using this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. All the hoopla about the lead is ridiculous. You can get more lead in your body by breathing the air in an urban environment.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say that I love it, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t taste like minty chemicals. Not sure that I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Contains trace amounts of lead.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste - taste is subtle but my teeth feel clean. I am glad not to have all the additives that commercial toothpastes have.</li>
    <li> i just dont buy regular tooth paste after finding this one. better than commercial brands not to mention that the commercial ones have chemicals .</li>
    <li> Gave it a try and settled to never go back to standard toothpaste again. It does take getting used to considering no foam or ultra sweet taste. After a month of use, I do not have any regrets. I glad I gave it a chance.</li>
    <li> LEAD WARNING!!! ??? No where does it say on here there&#x27;s a warning on both the box and the tube about this product containing lead!!! It&#x27;s supposed to be very little however..... I decided to switch back to my other all natural toothpaste that does not contain any lead :)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an all natural, glycerin and fluoride free toothpaste, look no further!  My teeth are very sensitive but I don&#x27;t have any with this toothpaste.  My 5 yr old son loves the lemon flavor.  The peppermint is a little strong for children, but wintergreen is a nice subtle flavor.  Personally I LOVE the cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Teeth feel great after brushing.  Had to use traditional toothpaste while on vacation.  It made me sick.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to have my EarthPaste back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed. No chemicals and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes fantastic but turns to water consistency as soon as you put it in your mouth.  I don&#x27;t like this.  Also it seems to be irritating my gums so I&#x27;ve had to discontinue use.  My partner likes it though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brand of toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been feeling rebellious against the mainstream personal care product offerings. I&#x27;m tired of being exposed to chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce and don&#x27;t understand, and fluoride, which is of questionable safety. My favorite flavor is lemon. I didn&#x27;t expect to like a non-minty flavor, but I think it&#x27;s great. My second favorite is the (blue) mint one, followed by cinnamon and then wintergreen (not a fan of wintergreen in any case). The paste leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, but also &amp;#34;neutral,&amp;#34; for lack of a better word -- it doesn&#x27;t leave any particular flavor or chemical aftertaste like I think most mainstream pastes do. I also feel good that it is edible, since I have small children. Earthpaste is a unique and feel-good alternative.</li>
    <li> Works great! Removes tea stains.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Okay&amp;#34; Because it does contain lead! The taste is great, cleans well and is a good alternative to the chemical store bought ones. It looks like mud, does not foam up (which is fine with me, our homemade paste also did not foam) Foam does not mean it is not cleaning! The only downside to it is the lead, which disappoints me very much. We will be finishing this product off while a research another toothpaste like this minus the lead. REDMON PLEASE MAKE THIS LEAD-FREE!!</li>
    <li> wonderful products thank you</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> Very valuable product for someone that hates fluor.</li>
    <li> Super fast service. Love the toothpaste too!!</li>
    <li> http://www.earthpaste.com/prop65/</li>
    <li> Wow ! I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to use another kind of toothpaste again ! My teeth feel so clean and they feel polished too-! I read the pro 65 warning statement on the companies website and feel very comfortable using this product - even as a pregnant woman. Oh and by the way - my kids love the lemon.</li>
    <li> I love being a mud mouth and my 1 year old daughter LOVES to brush her teeth with the lemon flavor!</li>
    <li> My son loves this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars but it makes a mess when you get to the end of the tube.</li>
    <li> Tried this toothpaste to help with our oral and dental health.  Am very happy with results so far.  This toothpaste is not gritty or bad tasting and I am fine with no bubbles when I brush.  I am glad I purchased all four varieties, giving me a chance to try them all.  I can honestly say they are all pleasing to use.  The lemon is the one I could see children being happy with.  So far so good.  Will be interested to see what my dentist has to say on my next cleaning!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this toothpaste....doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a fresh feel in your mouth</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these due to all the rave reviews. I just could not get used to them and they squirt out all over the place and THAT just made me mad. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> LOOOOVE Earthpaste. This bundle is a great value.</li>
    <li> So far good. Trying peppermint now. I like it.</li>
    <li> The best family toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I have begun using essential oils and learned that Wintergreen essential oil is toxic even at small amounts. It is not recommended to ingest even by the FDA. I talked to an employee of Native American Nutritionals asking if it is safe since the toothpaste clearly states on the container that it is safe to eat. They and more sources recommend not to. So although I like the toothpastes overall, the wintergreen flavored toothpaste is NOT safe to eat, since on the ingredient list it clearly states wintergreen essential oil. They need to take the \\&quot;safe to eat\\&quot; statement off for those who are unaware and who trust this company like I did. Especially if given to children since they like to swallow the toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their response to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says Wintergreen Essential oil and not Wintergreen food grade oil? If it&#x27;s the essential oil, don&#x27;t swallow it. Wintergreen flavoring is okay to swallow. And food grade oils are different than essential oils. -- Shannon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the statement from Native American Nutritionals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are certain oils you should never ingest -- and this is industry wide, not just with us. They are Eucalyptus Globulus, Eucalyptus Radiata, Wintergreen, Birch Bark, Artemesia, and Pennyroyal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest thing to do is follow the FDA&#x27;s GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) list, as well. We indicate in the product descriptions which oils are GRAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though topical and aroma are still the best methods of application. -- Shannon</li>
    <li> So prefer this to commercial, fluoride toothpaste! My sensitivity is gone and my teeth look great since switching.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  Haven&#x27;t tried the lemon yet, but I&#x27;ve heard good things about it.  Love the flavor of the mints and the cinnamon already.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is awesome.  I am fully switched over to it with no regrets.  It tastes great and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I mixed it with toothpowder, it works fine on its own, and accepts the mix well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It really gets your teeth clean.  I like that it does not have the unnecessary ingredients like glycerin and fluoride which are not helpful to oral health and can even be toxic.  So far I have only used the peppermint (minty!) and the lemon.  Both are good.  Who needs foam anyway?  This is a good, healthy, and effective toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product! I usually make my own tooth powder, so I was glad to see a product that had similar ingredients but all natural. Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the lead warning on the packaging. It&#x27;s pretty standard out in CA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the company website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spend much time in California, you’re probably getting used to seeing warning signs about Proposition 65. They’re on display at restaurants, banks, gas stations, grocery stores, even Disneyland. But why is there a proposition 65 warning on Earthpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prop 65 lists of over 900 substances, including lead, that businesses are required to warn consumers about. Lead is a natural element in soil, so it can be found in trace amounts in anything that is grown or drawn from the earth — including fruits, vegetables, and, of course, Earthpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since our bodies can’t absorb naturally occurring lead in many natural products, like Bentonite clay, proposition 65 allows exemptions for natural products like mixed nuts and brussels sprouts that would otherwise have to claim lead levels many times more than the limit imposed by the legislation.  We believe Earthpaste falls under the exempted products definition, but we’re pretty cautious around here, and not terribly interested in defending civil action by prop 65 watchdogs hoping for a settlement or share of daily fines. So we updated our packaging to avoid the kind of mess that would be hard for a company our size to weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The irony of guarding against proposition 65 is that some of the most pure, natural products we’ve ever seen are the ones sporting a warning on the box! You naturally wouldn’t expect any other answer from us, but we love Earthpaste — we use it, our families use it, our toddlers and babies use it. The amount of lead in a brushing with Earthpaste is much less than what you’d find in organic produce. Even in larger portions, your body can’t absorb the naturally occurring lead in Bentonite clay to begin with.  We simply wouldn’t sell it if we had any doubts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know it’s unsettling to see a prop 65 lead warning on a healthful product like Earthpaste, and we know some consumers won’t buy our products with a warning on the package. But we believe in our products, and in our customers, and we hope we’ve helped you understand what the warning is all about. We have more information on our Redmond Trading site, and of course, if we left anything out we hope you’ll get in touch!</li>
    <li> Terrible tasting toothpaste and suspect of recent problems I&#x27;ve had with my implants. After switching over to a different product my problems went away.</li>
    <li> Does not leave the mouth fresh, but considering the ingredients, it seems satisfying that we are not putting unnecessary chemicals in the mouth. Though I do need to understand the lead factor in the 3 flavors (The kid&#x27;s lemon flavor does not have lead warning)</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and the fact that it&#x27;s completely natural. I love the flavors, too.</li>
    <li> My kids love the lemon flavor and I love the Wintergreen.  Takes a bit to get used to though since it doesn&#x27;t foam like normal toothpaste.  Other than that this stuff works great.  My kids teeth look so much better since we&#x27;ve switched them over from regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Ingredients listed online do NOT match ingredients on tube.  This is NOT toxic-free, therefore NOT good for kids</li>
    <li> My children love the lemon, my husband loves the peppermint and I love the cinnamon!  This is a great product with no artificial ingredients to worry about!</li>
    <li> We love Earthpaste.  Even my 3 and 5 yr olds like it. Cleans our teeth very well.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like God paste, the only issue we&#x27;ve noticed, is we really have to clean out brushes it, otherwise gunk gets collected at the bottom of the bristles.</li>
    <li> Peppermint is the best, and the only one that tastes good, but my teeth feel super clean!</li>
    <li> This garbage clogged my sink, it dries to what feels like wax and is very difficult to clean.  As far as brushing its very runny, tastes ok, pretty neutral.</li>
    <li> Sorry, didn&#x27;t like this product, but...I use this when I brush the pets teeth.  Not impressed with it at all.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Nice flavor, a texture like pudding. I&#x27;d like it if my teeth were not turning a disgusting shade of beige. I look like a smoker. Now I&#x27;m off to buy a whitening kit.</li>
    <li> For this particular 4 pack, it&#x27;s a great price and variety, but it would be cool to choose your own flavors or have different options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the product itself: The packaging is nice looking but not functional. You have to screw the dang cap a zillion times to open or close, and it retains its shape which is annoying when you&#x27;re at the end of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon flavor has been inconsistent tube to tube, the other flavors are kind of bland and not long lasting or very effective at breath control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to brush much more diligently behind my front teeth to avoid buildup, otherwise I like how my teeth feel with this paste. Have yet to see a dentist since making the switch but my teeth feel pretty good I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the minimal ingredients but I feel a little xanthan gum (or something like that?) would help the consistency, since I&#x27;ve found I really have to shake and knead the tubes well before using them to mix the liquids and solids back into a manageable paste. Also, better packaging would help prevent the air pocket fueled explosions that happen pretty often.</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for a safe, natural, good quality toothpaste for years.  Finally found one that my whole family likes.  I really like the lemon (surprisingly!).  It&#x27;s nice not to have to worry about my 2 year old eating the toothpaste.  ;)</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this paste.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff.  Love the flavors and knowing that it is as healthy as possible.  Constantly stocked in my pantry. :-)</li>
    <li> My favorite is the cinnamon, but I really enjoyed the lemon.</li>
    <li> This was a good way to try four of the flavors.  I have not been disappointed in the quality or the flavors.</li>
    <li> Love it. My mouth feels clean afterward. A bit pricy but if you buy in groups it&#x27;s okay. The lemon flavor is nice.</li>
    <li> Best natural no chemical toothpaste you can find!</li>
    <li> Waited to review until after using for 6+ weeks. Love how clean my teeth feel! The clay and salt give teeth a good scrub and you feel like you just left the dentist. However, because it is so abrasive, our teeth have become very sensitive, and my tongue is constantly sore, as if I burned it on something hot. We will be searching for a different natural paste. Just wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the 4 pack...</li>
    <li> I did not really like this toothpaste, though a friend I gave it to really did. I just did not feel like it cleaned my teeth very well, and I did not like all the flavors.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste but found it&#x27;d really quite pricey compared to making it at home.</li>
    <li> tastes great. kids do indeed love the lemon</li>
    <li> Picked this earth paste from [...], NO CHEMICALS (cinnamon).  Tried the cinnamon flavor first, then tried this Quick Pack, even our 3 year niece loved the lemon flavor for kids.</li>
    <li> The lemon is our favorite!</li>
    <li> Its ok.  Seems really light and fluffy so I can&#x27;t get enough on my toothbrush to give me the mouth full of paste I am used to.  It&#x27;s like cheap ice cream, full of air.  Maybe if they burped the air out so we got more paste for the money. I will consider other things before buying this again but if there is nothing else, it will do.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  No fluoride, what could be better.  It stimulates your gums and really cleans your teeth.  Sometimes I put it on  my teeth after brushing just to draw any left-over impurities.  I have all of my grand-kids using it now!!  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Earthpaste for years and love it. The product is excellent and I emphatically suggest you make the switch if you haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this review is intended more as a \\&quot;heads up\\&quot; that the items you receive differ slightly from the description. This \\&quot;quad pack\\&quot; is said to contain 4 tubes of Earthpaste: 1 Lemon Twist, 1 Wintergreen, 1 Cinnamon, 1 Peppermint. The pack does contain 4 tubes of Earthpaste, but there are instead 1 Cinnamon, 1 Lemon Twist, and 2 Peppermint. No Wintergreen. This actually worked out in my favor, because I didn&#x27;t really want a Wintergreen, and I quite like the Peppermint (though, Lemon Twist is the best IMO). Still, some people may be looking for a tube of Wintergreen Earthpaste, and I think Avatar-RAW should update their item description just in case. :)</li>
    <li> Once they got past the fact that the new toothpaste looked a bit like &amp;#34;pooh&amp;#34; (their words not mine), both my kids gave this product two thumbs up (well, one gave 3, but we won&#x27;t discuss that).  In specific, they prefer the lemon flavored over all the others (go figure).  Personally, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by our results so far - whiter teeth (somewhat), fresher breath &amp; less complaining at bed time (thank you, (fill in preferred deity here)).  The only concern we&#x27;ve had to date was the little blurb about trace levels of lead appearing in clay.  Not thrilled about that, given that we decided to try Earthpaste due to a desire to move away from aluminum byproducts (frying pan; fire?).  In any event, we&#x27;re on the look for alternatives which don&#x27;t contain any heavy metals due to health concerns (as minute as those traces may be).  Not a reflection on the product, I suppose, and I only have mother nature to blame for the lead; however, it sure would be nice to find a base that didn&#x27;t have any trace amounts of lead when formulating a product for those who are concerned about their health.  Just my two cents. Take it with a grain of salt (Redmond Real Salt®, in fact).  ;)</li>
    <li> I tried the peppermint and I love the stuff so far (it&#x27;ll be awhile before I get to the other flavors).  The non-foaming (non)action took a bit to get used to.  I had to make sure I had enough on my brush and got toothpaste to all parts of my teeth, and also not to scrub too hard (a tendency if you can&#x27;t feel it foaming, be careful because salts are very abrasive).  I didn&#x27;t find the taste offensive at all, and I was not offput by the color of the paste.  If others hadn&#x27;t pointed it out (paste color and/or spit color), I probably would have been oblivious and shrugged to both.  My teeth feel very clean, dentist clean, or as clean as they do when I sit down with my mirror and dental pick and clean my teeth myself (which, sadly, is better than the dental hygienist does, this is often after I get home from seeing one and can still feel a bit of tartar with my tongue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My significant other, on the other hand, hated it.  He said the lack of foaming was &amp;#34;nasty&amp;#34; and it &amp;#34;felt like he wasn&#x27;t using toothpaste at all&amp;#34;.  He also didn&#x27;t see the point of having a toothpaste with no fluoride, and that was a mark against it for him.</li>
    <li> I love the selection in this toothpaste set. Lemon is my favorite, though I had to get use to the fact that it does&#x27;t contain a foaming agent, which I know you are suppose to avoid.I all the Redmond clay products I just recently started trying.</li>
    <li> It works. Nice after taste and natural. I will keep ordering it. I am in the look out for discounts.</li>
    <li> These are great!  No junk in them, and the price for a four pack is nice.  I like the wintergreen - it reminds me of my childhood favorite flavor Necco Wafer.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothpaste for several months now after looking for some time for a natural toothpaste and am very happy with my purchase. I have tried all but the lemon so far and have enjoyed each flavor. My mouth feels quite clean after every brushing session and after one gets used to the look and texture I think they will notice the same. I am looking forward to what my dentist has to say the next time I go in for a cleaning!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  My only gripe is I wish they would redesign the tube.  It&#x27;s OK when you first use it but about halfway the toothpaste gets hard to squeeze out.  I have arthritis in my hands so it is an issue.  Other than that this is the best healthy toothpaste I have found to date.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. tends to squirt out as it has air pockets. I learned to &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34; it on the brush, otherwise it comes out too thin of a string. Great taste. No aftertaste. Not as grainy and thick as homemade. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful toothpaste. I even got a good laugh when I heard this coming from my husband in the bathroom, &amp;#34;Man, this Earthpaste is just plain weeeird!&amp;#34; I looked just in time to see him put down a tube of Butt Paste!&amp;#34; My kids love the Cinnamon and Lemon. That&#x27;s the only ones I give them since I heard that they shouldn&#x27;t have Peppermint. They swallow it, Does anyone know if it&#x27;s safe to swallow a little Tea Tree Oil? That&#x27;s my only question.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s healthier than traditional toothpaste. I was rather surprised that it tasted pretty good. Often times, I find that &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; products are often lacking in taste, texture, color, etc. This was not bad at all. The color is brownish/grayish, which at first seems odd. But when you consider the health benefits, you too will quickly get over the color. The taste is actually surprisingly pleasant. I like all flavors and I seem to reach for the spearmint and lemon more often. I believe we all should be exploring healthier options and this one fits perfectly in my efforts to use products that doesn&#x27;t have synthetic ingredients that are linked to health issues. I am so glad that there are companies out there whose mission is to provide consumers with healthier options.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product and timely delivery. Always happy to busy a high qualit, natural product.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack for the lemon flavor because I couldn&#x27;t find it by itself.  I really liked the toothpaste, and I have 1 more tub left.  The cinnamon flavor is kinda spicy.  The wintergreen is my least favorite of the flavors.  It leaves a nasty taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great and so, so natural. It&#x27;s worth the price. It&#x27;s the next best thing to making your own.</li>
    <li> Of any tootpaste I have tried, this one gets rid of stains after the first brushing. As a coffee addict, my front teeth always have some kind of stains on them that I struggle to get off. My teeth were noticeably whiter after one brushing...people noticed! Tastes great although I&#x27;m thirstier afterwards which I think is due to the natural salts.</li>
    <li> No as good of a toothpaste as the other reviews state.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product as it came across as the most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. I have three little one under three and the description states it&#x27;s safe to swallow right? Wrong! As a california resident, per prop 65, 3 out of 4 bottles had disclaimers stating it contained LEAD- which is unsafe to swallow and can cause birth defects as well as fertility problems. Very misleading!! Do not buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;A* holes!</li>
    <li> i use this and squigle sensitive intermittently and my teeth are happy :)</li>
    <li> This toothpastes texture is a bit different than one is used too. Yet it gets your teeth super .clean</li>
    <li> really gross flavors and the paste is brown which really make me ill.</li>
    <li> takes a little getting use to but teeth feel great</li>
    <li> Just received this a few days ago, so am trying them out one by one.  Love it that there are NO chemicals in this paste and it doesn&#x27;t foam up when using it.  It just leaves such a nice clean feel in your mouth.  Will definitely buy more when I use up these 4 tubes.  I am using the lemon one now and it definitely had a nice lemony flavor to it.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve always had good teeth. Never had s cavity, my teeth were always naturally white and strong. I started to drink a lot of grapefruit juice and I happen to love tea. Out of no where my teeth became extremely sensitive and I started to develop craze lines. I also noticed that they were getting yellow and I really didn&#x27;t want to go through a whitening process since I know that makes your teeth even more sensitive. I have been using Redmond clay tooth paste for a week and the two extremely notice crazelines on my front teeth are COMPLETELY gone. My teeth have returned to their natural whiteness in less than a week. I have never experienced any Thing like this and I use a lot of natural products/alternative health and beauty care. I wS even making my own tooth paste for a while and then switched over to living libations products buT their stuff is just too expensive and really does not compare to Redmond in terms of results.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of Fluoride free flavored toothpaste.  I really wanted to like this, but none of us in the family did.  We prefer Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now on the second bottle I loved the lemon flavor and wintergreen is just as refreshing. I pair this toothpaste with an ultrasonic toothbrush cleaner and found that stains that had been on my teeth before the sonic and this toothpaste are now gone.</li>
    <li> Great delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is pretty amazing.  A friend told me about how well this works - this stuff leaves you with the feeling like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentists office - no joke!  There is a warning that trace amounts of lead are present (via clay), that fact turned me off a little.  To counter that warning, I do not swallow, make sure I rinse thoroughly and use it once a day, regular toothpaste the other times.  I have only tried the peppermint and cinnamon thus far.  There is no foaming agent, so it seems a little weird at first.  However, the end results will let you know that it is indeed working!  Can&#x27;t wait to try the lemon!</li>
    <li> Product came in a timely way and as described. Was looking for a non flouride option my kids would like. Its a hit!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is GREAT! I really love the lemon one ^.^ even though it says &amp;#34;for kids&amp;#34;. I wanted to get away from toothpaste that had fluoride and other crap in it and I was extremely happy with this one. I tried a few other natural toothpastes but this one has been my favorite and it&#x27;s the only one I use now. This is my 2nd time to have ordered it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff, little on the unusual side but not bad just not what you expect.  Does great on the teeth, i would prefer one SUPER MINT variety because i want that killer mint coolness but all are ok.  Cinnamon is the best i think.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS CHEMICAL FREE TOOTHPASTE BECAUSE IT IS SAFE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO USE AND IT TASTES GREAT AS WELL!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I did need to get used to the color of it.  I just closed my eyes, but now I am used to it.  My favorite is the peppermint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned after receiving this product with a warning on the label about lead exposure that was no where in product description.  I&#x27;m pregnant and I also planned to use with my toddler.</li>
    <li> we decided to stay away from fluoride AND SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) because we believe they&#x27;ll do more harm than good. Earthpaste was recommended by many and so far our whole family enjoys it. The kids LOVE the lemon, although my oldest claims it makes his mouth itchy while he&#x27;s brushing but then he&#x27;s fine when he&#x27;s done. I think he&#x27;s just not used to it yet as we&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks. I love the cinnamon! Reminds me of Cinnamon Trident gum. :-)  Hubby&#x27;s been using the peppermint and I have tried the wintergreen. They&#x27;re all great flavors.</li>
    <li> kids seem to like this...love that it is not full of toxic stuff.</li>
    <li> All natural! BEST TOOTHPASTE! In the near future I will get a paste of baking soda prepared and mix the toothpaste with it so as to make it last a long time as well as increase the scrubbing/whitening power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff tastes great, kind of plain, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t deposit sugar all over your mouth so you can get more cavities and pay the dentists (lol). It cleans better than regular toothpaste. Often regular stuff will have sodium laurel sulfate and other stuff, and this will make my mouth basically break out with sticky saliva and a nasty unclean feeling that turns into horrible bad breath and a gunky/phlegmy throat. Obviously those ingredients are nasty chemicals and are not supposed to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has none of that and it cleans better, tastes better and is one of the ONLY brands out there like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BUY A BUNCH SO THE COMPANY EXPANDS AND SENDS THIS TOOTHPASTE OUT TO LOCAL ORGANIC STORES!!!</li>
    <li> My children love the lemon and do not like the peppermint. I have gotten use to different tasting toothpaste. It really has no taste, however it&#x27;s not gritty which is a plus. I found a different brand that I am testing out, but this is definitely a great Natural back up plan and the one our Holistic Dentist recommends.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lead poisoning (also known as plumbism, colica pictorum, saturnism, Devon colic, or painter&#x27;s colic) is a medical condition in humans and other vertebrates caused by increased levels of the heavy metal lead in the body. Lead interferes with a variety of body processes and is toxic to many organs and tissues including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive and nervous systems. It interferes with the development of the nervous system and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning and behavior disorders. Symptoms include abdominal pain, confusion, headache, anemia, irritability, and in severe cases seizures, coma, and death.</li>
    <li> Its ok in a pinch. It is clay, not much else. Comes in a four pack. Texture is gritty feeling. Does not last more than a few seconds in mouth. If I have to use it I will but I would rather use jason.</li>
    <li> Clay-based toothpastes are being touted as a natural alternative to the chemical-laden pastes, and I wanted to give them a try.  Since I couldn&#x27;t decide on a flavor, I got the 4-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty much exactly what I expected.  All-natural, lightly flavored, stays together while you wet your brush, then dissolves easily while brushing.  My family is a bit more skeptical because it strays from the norm.  The biggest obstacle to their acceptance is that it&#x27;s brown.  Hello?  It&#x27;s clay-based!  And they think it&#x27;s weird that it doesn&#x27;t foam, which has absolutely no impact on it&#x27;s effectiveness.  But they were brave and tried each of the flavors.  They each have a different favorite - which is why it&#x27;s a good idea to get the 4-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, you have to kind of load up your toothbrush, so will run through your supply pretty quick.  Another reason to get the 4-pack.  :)</li>
    <li> good stuff, safe to eat and my teeth are much cleaner....dental hygenist even told me cleanest she has seen since she has known me...which is like 5 years.  she asked what have i changed....toothpaste....thats it...switched to redmon earthpaste.  working so well i bought this 4pack so i never run out.</li>
    <li> Had I know there is lead in the ingredients I would have never purchased. I plan on returning immediately</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothpaste. It&#x27;s by far the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps my teeth white and clean - the texture and taste is ideal. HOWEVER, for those of us that live in California, there is a label on ours that says the product contains lead. If you are not comfortable using a product with lead, then you should not purchase it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is wonderful and really cleans our teeth. The taste is different from regular toothpaste because this is different from regular toothpaste. But it doesn&#x27;t taste bad. My kids love it, too. This 4 pack is a great deal. You get all the flavors for the price of a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Definitely takes some getting used to...it&#x27;s so different than regular toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t foam up (which is good-it means it doesn&#x27;t have all those bad chemicals!) I like it...my husband likes it OK...some of my children like it, some don&#x27;t. The wintergreen flavor is what I got this pack for (we love us some wintergreen here!), but that ended up being the worst flavor - you can hardly even taste it! The peppermint and cinnamon is good, and the lemon is OK (but that&#x27;s just my opinion and not worth arguing over, as I tell my children over and over, when they argue which is better - mayo or ketchup...) Another plus is, my gums have stopped bleeding when I brush (I know that wasn&#x27;t a good thing!), and my teeth don&#x27;t feel as sensitive (they weren&#x27;t real bad before). I believe I&#x27;ve found a keeper, but I&#x27;ll see if I can convince my young&#x27;uns to use them!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!Will never go back to fluoride again! Very tasty and my kids love it too! I love the peppermint!</li>
    <li> This is on my favorites list. I think I bought it at Whole Foods for the first time for around $10, so $6ish with with 4 pack is a great deal, and it&#x27;s the only toothpaste that I have found that doesn&#x27;t at least gave vegetable glycerine in it, which I have paid attention to ever since someone once said that even that isn&#x27;t great to ingest.  Since it doesn&#x27;t foam or anything I find I do have to use close to a full toothbrush&#x27;s-length if it to feel I have enough, but it really leaves my teeth and mouth feeling incredibly clean.</li>
    <li> I really, really dig this toothpaste. I was using Sensodyne for a while for my weirdly sensitive to EVERYTHING teeth, and this stuff feels GREAT on them. In true alternative-health fashion, I follow this up with a swish of a couple drops of doterra On guard essential oil with water, and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret trying this stuff! It&#x27;s not as tough to get used to as you&#x27;d think, either.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the lemon flavor, but I like the taste-like lemon cookies-and it seems to work really well at leaving the teeth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d previously bought the peppermint one, which to me isn&#x27;t strongly flavoured and was curious about the other three flavours. I thought I&#x27;d prefer the lemon, since I like lemon, but surprise surprise, my favourite&#x27;s the cinnamon,  a taste I&#x27;m normally just okay with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering if you should at least try this toothpaste - yes. It&#x27;s natural and deep cleans without irritation or stratching so you can use a &#x27;&#x27;regular&#x27;&#x27; toothbrush. The oils have germ-killing properties too (so keep the cover on between uses!). The xylitol reduces sensitivity to sweets, helps keep bacteria away and helps with remineralization (look it up!). And the manufacturer says not to worry about the low lead content.</li>
    <li> The price of this multipack is good and the flavor variety is great. I forgot how amazing the cinnamon tastes because I have been using the lemon for awhile. This brand is quality and I use Redmond clay to make my facial masks, my own toothpaste version of their&#x27;s but never comes out as good and the capsules to detox. A tube lasts awhile but u do have to really squeeze as the tube gets low in product. But it&#x27;s worth it. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff. It&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s got a mild sweetness to it, and a single tube has lasted me about a year. The clay in it, if you accidentally swallow it, can actually pull heavy metals out of your system. The salt in the formula gives it the grit to get that plaque off, so you can forget those weird oxides and heavy metals that cause all sorts of ailments like cancer. The essential oils in it are so pleasant! As a tip for anyone looking to whiten teeth, those stains are actually fats. And the way to break down those surface fat stains are with more fat (lipids). Oils and oil pulling (with coconut oil-- look it up) will whiten your teeth so you can also ditch that bleaching chloride crud (a freaking carcinogen) on your pearly whites and keep your teeth healthy for longer. Don&#x27;t waste your money for some unnatural procedure, this will do the trick. And of course for anyone looking to ditch fluoride (yuck to infinity), this is absolutely the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly, highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I believe I am going to enjoy using these products.....but wondering why they have &#x27;lead&#x27; in them.  I had to detox from it and other heavy metals a few years back.  I am still dealing with inflammation from all that.  Wondering just how much is in each tube and why!!  Thank you...DonnieJean Cook</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much, but decided to try anyway. Great tasting toothpaste that is low on ingredients. I just had my dental exam and they said my home care routine has kept my teeth in great condition and without stains.</li>
    <li> love this, kids love the lemon</li>
    <li> My teeth feel clean and less sensitivity after few weeks of use. My son liked the peppermint.</li>
    <li> Because my family&#x27;s well-being is extremely important to me, I read every single label of everything I purchase, especially if it is going to go in, or on, our bodies.  When I first bought this toothpaste, I was a bit apprehensive after reading the Proposition 65 warning label regarding lead in the product.  So, I called the company to inquire about this and the lady who answered the phone was so sweet and helpful in explaining to me that any mineral (from the earth) will have at least a trace of lead in it.  I then did a bit of research for myself and found out that the fruits and vegetables we buy from the grocery store, even the organic ones, have about 100 times more lead in the soil they are grown in than a tube of Earthpaste.  But, I am sure that is just another tactic of the FDA to confuse consumers into thinking what&#x27;s best for us is actually not the best.  I absolutely love this toothpaste, especially the lemon twist; it is one of the only truly natural toothpastes on the market that keeps my breath fresh all day.  I can feel the difference immediately after brushing.  Not to mention, my 14-month old son loves it as well.  Kudos to Earthpaste!  This is definitely a &#x60;must have&#x27; on my list of things to reorder!  &#x3D;)    P.S.  The Cinnamon didn&#x27;t work as well as the others for my family and I.</li>
    <li> Our whole family loves this toothpaste. All the flavors are good, but each of us has their favorite so I get the variety pack.  My five year old really likes the lemon flavor.  I like that the ingredients list is short and wholesome.</li>
    <li> Never ever use another toothpaste again. It totally got rid of my tooth sensitivity</li>
    <li> Delicious flavors are the only thing I can say good about this particular brand. My daughter enjoys the lemon flavor and unconventional color and texture. However, the clean mouth feeling is just not there. I regret buying the four pack I will not be purchasing this product ever again. Good taste, bad breath.</li>
    <li> Yummy :) These taste great and clean wonderfully! My teeth still feel shiny and smooth at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Taste like paper, my kids will not use it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the lemon, but I personally think it tastes the way Pledge smells. My husband and I finished off the peppermint, and now we&#x27;re trying to get through the cinnamon. Bleh. I could do without the cinnamon flavor. I haven&#x27;t tried the wintergreen. In the future I don&#x27;t think we will be buying this 4 pack. I have my own recipe for this and bought these tubes because of all of the travel we were doing. I may resort to making my own again.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste brand!! Amazing ingredients and flavor. My favorites are definitely the mints.</li>
    <li> Yes they contain lead but so do many lipsticks. If you are concerned about the lead only get the lemon one it does not have any lead.</li>
    <li> This absolutely the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong taste. It&#x27;s very mild in flavor. I have been using it for a little over a week now and my teeth have gotten much whiter and feel as clean as they do after a dental cleaning every time I brush. My kids love using it as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Over the past year or two I have been trying to convert all of my toiletries/body care products to natural, chemical-free alternatives.  For a while I used baking soda and water to brush my teeth.  I also tried castile soap (DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!).  Now, I have been known to subject myself to a lot of &amp;#34;less than pleasant&amp;#34; tastes in the name of health (cod liver oil anyone?) but considering that tooth brushing is a daily activity, which hopefully lasts at least 2 minutes if I&#x27;m not running too late, I thought it might be worth investing in something a little less disgusting than baking soda.  First I tried the Wintergreen, and while I&#x27;m not a big mint person, it tasted so much better than the baking soda (and so much closer to normal toothpaste) that I was very happy and satisfied.  Next I tried the lemon, which is probably my favorite.  To me, it is reminiscent of Fruit Loops.  Fall was rolling around just as I was running out of lemon and I opened the Cinnamon, which was perfect and reminds me of mulling spices.  I am now on the peppermint and it tastes just as I would expect peppermint to taste.  All in all I am VERY happy with these flavors and will buy these again and again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it has traces of lead, but yet it calls its product natural. Really?!</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Love all the flavors, and our 6 year old daughter loves the lemon! Will never use conventional toothpaste again!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m using the peppermint one and leaves a very pleasant after taste and a very cool and refreshing feel after brushing.</li>
    <li> Love it for our whole family! It really works.</li>
    <li> My new toothpaste for life! Great stuff plus its weird but I i have only been using this stuff for a week and it seems as if my teeth are &#x27;thicker&#x27; or whiter, as if my teeth are remineralizing.  I&#x27;m hoping it will work for my cavities too - after a month I will update this and let you know.  But for now I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS toothpaste.  The lemon tastes like lemonade and just makes me want to smile more.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST toothpaste I&#x27;ve found YET!! Totally naturally, you can EAT IT!! No foaming chemicals, tastes wonderful, fresh breath , clean teeth!!  Love all the FLAVORS, lemon is a bit better for the kids. Will def be buying from now on!! Great!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Jenn Reedy</li>
    <li> Good flavor, interesting consistency, but teeth did not feel as clean as with glycerin based toothpaste.  Had to brush longer and use more product to remove plaque.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about something called Earthpaste, however after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. I found the toothpaste to be the best I have ever used &amp; I have used a lot of toothpaste. I always hated the foamy sweet flavor from other commercial brands. This leaves my teeth feeling clean even in the morning, I get up &amp; I don&#x27;t have that fuzzy teeth feeling. They still feel smooth and even feel stronger. I know that sounds strange but try it &amp; you will know what I mean. I use about the same amount of my toothbrush as I did with commercial toothpaste. I can&#x27;t even imagine going back to another toothpaste. Will see how it is doing when I go back to the dentist in October.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a natural toothpaste but it is a little thin and has issues staying on the toothbrush.  It also seems to take more than it does with most toothpastes</li>
    <li> Love how this tooth paste cleans and leaves my mouth feeling great. I like the wintergreen best, but I love how natural and safe they are as well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, natural product that has been serving our family well for years.  My teeth are whiter since the switch to Earthpaste without the use of any whitening ritual in my oral care. And no cavities here! Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m particularly fond of the Wintergreen and my children enjoy the Lemon. This paste doesn&#x27;t foam like typical paste. It tastes pleasant, not overwhelmingly artificial.  Best of all, simple and very few ingredients - you can even swallow Earthpaste!  Read Earthpastes website if you have concerns about the lead claims -- it is a clay based mineral toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Obviously results will vary*</li>
    <li> Our whole family loves this toothpaste. The kids like the flavor of the lemon and I like the rest of the flavors. You get the same clean teeth, gums, and tongue with this paste as you do with other brands. However, with Earthpaste you do not have the weird chemicals that coat your mouth. I have found that over the month I have been using this paste I have less tooth sensitivity, no more gum sensitivity, my teeth have lost some of the staining I had from coffee, and I have less plaque and tartar. I am a busy Mom with two children and I do not always brush twice a day and floss. But still I am seeing an improvement with this paste. I am also not afraid that my children are going to swallow this paste, all the ingredients are safe to eat!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this variety pack as it allowed me to sample all the flavors.  The cinnamon one was hot.  The spearmint I am not a huge fan of.  I really like the peppermint.  My kids use the lemon. I didm&#x27;t care for the lemon as it was spicy at times, though the kids don&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste, different than normal toothpaste for sure, no sudsing.</li>
    <li> organic  and no non- edible ingredients, Cleans teeth well and leaves my mouth feeling very clean and fresh no after taste.</li>
    <li> It has few ingredients and does the job.</li>
    <li> I normally make my own toothpaste but I thought I should try the Earthpaste brand at least once. It&#x27;s great to have for the days where I need to make more toothpaste but am too lazy. lol.  It tastes great and leaves my teeth feeling clean. I don&#x27;t like commercial toothpaste. I feel like they don&#x27;t clean my teeth well and I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a muddy mouth and my dentist was impressed. Said she was going to look into it.</li>
    <li> I love the Redmon Earthpaste Natural Toothpaste! My mouth feels clean, and my gums look a lot better. My favorite flavor is the lemon one, and I just ordered three more of that one. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Its ok dries up too fast</li>
    <li> When I first received this toothpaste it looked like nothing I used before. Frankly, it looked like clay. Took me awhile to get used to it and now I can say I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the lemon twist one and looking forward to trying the other flavors. My teeth and mouth feel clean after using this and I love the lemon flavor that lingers for awhile. It does not foam up like tradition pastes but it keeps my teeth nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;It was important to me to find a non-fluoride toothpaste and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> contains lead.  beware.  they don&#x27;t mention that in ad but its on the container.</li>
    <li> Whole family is using it! Wish it was cheaper though :/ but I love it.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is brown, looks like mud and has the consistency of mud. Despite the many flavors, this was NOT pleasant to use at all. There are enough alternatives out there that are much more pleasant to use (Himalayan). Would have also been nice if they offered a less pricey smaller sample size. I ended up throwing these away. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Obviously you do not get the strong, minty flavor with this as you do with regular toothpaste but once you get used to that you realize it really does a good job in cleaning your teeth and keeping your mouth fresh.  I love the packaging also.  I have only tried Lemon as yet but looking forward to trying the other flavors.</li>
    <li> Reviewed by myself and my 3 year old on youtube.  http://youtu.be/m7GBUqfxquM</li>
    <li> Just had a dental appt. to confirm the Earth Paste is making an positive  impact on my check ups.  They were somewhat surprised to learn I was using a non- floride product with such success.  My husband I  brush with only one tube at a time, but have enjoyed the one we have used so far.  Looking forward to trying the other flavors, too.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We love the Earthpaste! My husband and I, especially love the cinnamon and our kids love the lemon flavor. Looking forward to trying the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to address the Lead warning, its still saver then all the harmful chemicals in your everyday toothpaste. I hope it doesn&#x27;t scare you away from trying something that comes from the Earth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Redmond products contain lead? (Prop 65 Warning)&lt;br /&gt;Peaches, pears, brussels sprouts, nuts, spinach–and dozens of other natural products, including Redmond Clay–contain the tiniest bit of naturally-occurring lead, which is on the prop 65 list. Like these and other natural products, we believe Redmond Clay falls under the exempted products definition, but we’re pretty cautious around here, and not terribly interested in defending civil action by prop 65 watchdogs hoping for a settlement or share of daily fines. So we changed some packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know the language on proposition 65 warnings is pretty heavy, but we wouldn’t sell any product if we weren’t completely satisfied by its safety. Like so many other companies, we’ve decided it’s simpler to change our packaging than worry about possible complications down the line. Fortunately, like so many other customers, you probably see so many prop 65 warning labels that you already understand our reasons. If you didn’t, we hope you do now!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe the absolute ignorance about this product.  It has clay people!  What do you think is in clay?  Anyway, I have the cinnamon and LOVE it.  I love that there&#x27;s no foaming, one of my issues with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste, not to mention all the other crap that is in &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve ordered the 4 pack and just can&#x27;t wait to try the rest.</li>
    <li> Decent, but not better than coconut oil and baking soda. You have to use a ton of this and doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste isn&#x27;t cloyingly sweet like some other brands. I like the flavors, especially the lemon and cinnamon, and also like the fact that they use detoxifying clay as the base. It&#x27;s a refreshing and healthy alternative to other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say and I don&#x27;t, I do not like to complain truly I don&#x27;t but this product it&#x27;s for me my girlfriend and my two children and nobody is using it and I kept using it cuz I bought it and I&#x27;m throwing it away sorry very sorry but this is truth</li>
    <li> Awesome product. We love this toothpaste!!!</li>
    <li> It takes a bit to get used to the idea of brushing your teeth with toothpaste that is not white, but aside from that, this is the best toothpaste out there. I like all the minty flavors and my mouth feels very clean. The best part is the great list of ingredients with no extra chemicals or stuff you don&#x27;t need. I took my time and did a lot of research to find the right toothpaste. I have been using Earthpaste now for months and at my last cleaning, the  hygienist said my teeth are very clean.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but my teeth have gotten whiter! So have my husband&#x27;s. The wintergreen is my favorite, followed by cinnamon, lemon, then peppermint. None of them are bad at all, the peppermint tastes exactly like traditional toothpaste. So happy to have an alternative that works and tastes great!</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have found this toothpaste.  I have used several natural brands but this seems the best and we all loved the flavours.  I actually thought the Lemon was great and that is a flavour I have not seen elsewhere.  Our teeth are looking great and we know that we are not putting bad chemicals into our mouth. The bathroom sink always seems to need an extra swish of water to rinse but the toothpaste is worth it.</li>
    <li> Cool flavors, leaves great taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Good but it does take a bit of getting Jesper to having brown toothpaste. And it can be runny and can splatter when squeezed...it&#x27;s just an adjustment, he taste is fine, just the brown runny dirt mouth may be a challenge to overcome.  I am working on it, but I am not sure my head can over ride my healthy decision to use a more natural solution to normal toothpaste.</li>
