      <li>I like the fact that they separate so you can use as much as you need and also great for masks.</li>

      <li>they&#x27;re light and don&#x27;t add to luggage weight.</li>
      <li>I just got this product today and the facial puffs are great and soft….. not just that</li>
      <li>3 to 5 minutes - remove and skin is moist and smooth -</li>
      <li>Lint free.</li>
      <li>They are not as soft as Cle De Peau&#x27;s or Shiseido&#x27;s but for the price they are good.</li>
      <li>As she says these are great for a lotion mask; I pull the cotton puff apart into 5 sheets while it is still dry</li>
      <li>such as how to use the products, can really tell the seller is very care about their customers, they are not just selling, they are selling with heart and love, when I got my package I am so happy and surprise</li>
      <li>Breaks apart too quickly if using for toner application</li>
      <li>I did my first lotion mask with heritage store&#x27;s Rosewater &amp;Glycerine face lotion and it was fun and relaxing!</li>
      <li>i love japanese cotton puffs, they&#x27;re superior to american brand ones in every way.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not endorsed, I swear, I just love soft things.</li>
      <li>They are lint free.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;Selena brand&amp;#34; so far is my favorites cotton Puff :)</li>
      <li>They are soft and love the fact you can customize thickness of sheets.</li>
      <li>Look out when pulling out the first couple of pads if you open the top of the box not the side!</li>
      <li>very soft and easy to use.</li>
      <li>oh that little flower design is so cute embedded on these are so cute</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t even waste another second researching for cotton pad brands -- this one is the best.</li>
      <li>price is very reasonable compared to onlin Asia makeup store.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I really like these pads!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my first time to find and use &amp;#34;multi-layer cotton puffs&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this brand.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>However, it is nice to just lie down and relax.  </li>
      <li>super soft, does its job.</li>
      <li>The Mask keeps the cotton very damp</li>
      <li>, these don&#x27;t soak up as much because I can divide it</li>
      <li>I prefer to use it with the cheaper lotions because I feel like I am wasting so much with the Skii.</li>
      <li>soaks up too much product at once.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
      <li>Which I really didn&#x27;t need or want.  </li>
      <li>The milk brightens up my face pretty nicely and helps to fade some small imperfections.</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t go back to the american drugstore kind.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like comparing walmart brand tissue paper to Charmin ultra strong or Northern Quilted Ultra Plush Toilet Paper (which is THE BOMB by the way.</li>
      <li>the pieces are easy to separate apart when they are wet.</li>
      <li>I like them in that they are bigger and cover much more of my face and neck when applying the Japanese style lotion mask.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it for masks.</li>
      <li>One pad can be easy peeled into 5 thin layers, each one strong enough to withhold the Lotion Mask Technique: 1) wet pads in warm water, 2)squeeze pads of excess water, 3) peel and re-saturate with lotion.  </li>
      <li>I normally use two layers for make-up removal, and sometimes one layer for cleansing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to separate into individual layers when you want to use it as tiny masks soaked with your choice of toner</li>
      <li>The typical US kind feels like sand paper in comparison, and this is a really easy way to pamper your skin for a little extra money per box.</li>
      <li>Since these are thin, they won&#x27;t absorb much product ( which is a plus, you will save money on toners and acetone) but are just as effective.</li>
      <li>but they are so soft!</li>
      <li>Veryyyyyy soft, my face deserved it!</li>
      <li>I guess I can use them for applying toner, but I&#x27;m ordering an actual full sized compressed cotton mask, since that was what I actually wanted.</li>
      <li>and if you press lightly on it, the liquid from the cotton pads will squish out a little onto the parts of your face not covered by the cotton sheets.  </li>
      <li>they are so soft and 100% lint free!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>Five layers of cotton is enough to cover up your whole face.</li>
      <li>It takes off make up, really soft, not abrasive, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting product.</li>
      <li>The reason that I liked about it is that it stays as one pad after I wipe it on my face,  some of the other pads will end up with small cotton threads&lt;br</li>
      <li>Later, as I run out of Sephora cotton rounds, and don&#x27;t want to use too many thick Shiseido cotton puffs, I use this one for eye make-up remover (use with Lancôme or Clinique eye make-up remover) and cleaning (use with Biotherma cleaning water for face make-up removal or morning cleansing), and it works well.</li>
      <li>They work great plus you can choose how thick or thin you want the pads to be when using to apply toner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> japanese cotton pads are the best. I use this with hado labo for lotion masks or to remove makeup and nail polish.</li>
    <li> Great cotton pad! It has so many layers lol.</li>
    <li> I bought these after much consideration and was happy to have these!!! They work great plus you can choose how thick or thin you want the pads to be when using to apply toner.</li>
    <li> Two layers is perfect for using Bioderma to clean my face. It takes off make up, really soft, not abrasive, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting product.</li>
    <li> They are not as soft as Cle De Peau&#x27;s or Shiseido&#x27;s but for the price they are good. I love them.</li>
    <li> Although you can split 1 into 4 pieces. You cannot only use the 1/4 piece because it will split immediately when you swipe it on your face</li>
    <li> Great to use with the hada labo lotion for a mask.  Each cotton pad is 5-ply and can be separated into thin sheets.  I just use one pad every week since I only do the mask once weekly. Quite pricey but will last a long time for me since I am only using it for this purpose. Took a star off because I think the sheets are too flimsy once separated.</li>
    <li> I did my first lotion mask with heritage store&#x27;s Rosewater &amp;Glycerine face lotion and it was fun and relaxing! I really like these pads! Look out when pulling out the first couple of pads if you open the top of the box not the side! I separated a pad next to the one I was pulling out..&lt;br /&gt;Fun product!!!!</li>
    <li> These things last a long time. Great for cosmetic use.</li>
    <li> Veryyyyyy soft, my face deserved it!</li>
    <li> it stretches  nicely and makes a good face lotion mask! yey!</li>
    <li> 1. i love japanese cotton puffs, they&#x27;re superior to american brand ones in every way.&lt;br /&gt;2. super soft, does its job. i tried the water mask thing, and it worked well. separated easily.&lt;br /&gt;3. kinda bad if you want to use it for regular everyday toner use - cuz it pills(?) up? like how toilet paper or paper towels get all ruddy after you rubbed it on carpet?&lt;br /&gt;4. does the job!</li>
    <li> Nice product. I mainly use it for masks. Anything else, like cleansing, will leave pieces of the product stuck to your skin.</li>
    <li> Good quality work great!!  and you can choose how thick or thin for the  pads to be. They are lint free.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;Selena brand&amp;#34; so far is my favorites cotton Puff :)</li>
    <li> It has five-layers.  I usually use 3-layer for makeup removal and 2-layer for toner.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I separate the puffs - dampen and add facial lotion.  Place on my face like a mask and leave on for 3 to 5 minutes - remove and skin is moist and smooth -</li>
    <li> This works well as an acne/rejuvenation mask, here is how:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Separate each sheet, as seen on the box (the sheerer the cotton, the less product is wasted)&lt;br /&gt;* Wet the thin sheet with serum of your choice&lt;br /&gt;* Apply sheet to your face/neck/area needing treatment&lt;br /&gt;* Set timer for 15 minutes and relax/take a nap&lt;br /&gt;* When timer is done, remove sheet and pat the remaining serum into skin</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. Really good size. They are soft and love the fact you can customize thickness of sheets. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I just got this product today and the facial puffs are great and soft….. not just that, The seller True Renu is awesome! When I got package there is a &amp;#34;Thank you&amp;#34; sticker on it and inside have some skin care sample, tea and candy sample with info. such as how to use the products, can really tell the seller is very care about their customers, they are not just selling, they are selling with heart and love, when I got my package I am so happy and surprise, I have been shop at Amazon so long this seller is the 1st and only one got my heart, the info I got have so many wonderful items and tell very clear how to use it… I strongly recommend this seller and store, I will keep shopping with them.</li>
    <li> Translations in English, please.</li>
    <li> Use with \\&quot;Daiso Japan Reusable Silicon Mask Cover for Sheet Mask\\&quot; for Best Results!  [[ASIN:B00JIN8BTW Daiso Japan Reusable Silicon Mask Cover for Sheet Mask - Prevent Evaporation]]Thanks to NYC_girl for all her helpful tips and information about what types of lotion or toner to use for a Chizu Saeki lotion mask.  As she says these are great for a lotion mask; I pull the cotton puff apart into 5 sheets while it is still dry then re-stack it so the edges are fanned out like a deck of cards--I find it easier to separate the layers while they are dry.  I then dampen them with warm water and then put the lotion on and kind of squeeze it around into the cotton.  Then I stretch each piece of cotton, which you do by gently pulling on the narrow side, not the wide side--they only stretch in one direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then place one piece on my forehead, nose, each cheek and chin.  Next I cover my face with the Silicon Mask, which holds all the cotton pieces in place.  You can walk around and basically do whatever you want as the Mask holds the cotton in place.  However, it is nice to just lie down and relax.  The Mask keeps the cotton very damp and if you press lightly on it, the liquid from the cotton pads will squish out a little onto the parts of your face not covered by the cotton sheets.  Also, the cotton sheets are so damp when you remove them that you can massage them onto your hands and your hands get the benefit of the lotion, too!</li>
    <li> Arrived well, a joy to use, excellent quality! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand. I like them in that they are bigger and cover much more of my face and neck when applying the Japanese style lotion mask. At the beginning, it was a bit hard to pull the layers apart; I also noticed that they are not as thick as the ones I was using before, but I am kind of leaning towards this brand now... I guess that says something :)</li>
    <li> DR:TL - very soft, great for masks, layers peel apart very easily, great quality, no lint, highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great. I purchased them to make my own masks. Some great ones to try are to dip them in milk or lemon juice (or milk and lemon juice). Also you can use with any Asian lotion (toner). I just purchased these so have only tried with 3, my Hada Labo gokujyun (moisturizing) and shirojyun (whitening) and my SKii facial treatment essence. I prefer to use it with the cheaper lotions because I feel like I am wasting so much with the Skii. I soak in water, squeeze out, then soak in the lotion/milk/etc, peel apart the 5 layers, stretch them out (they stretch VERY nicely) and place the around my face. I only need to use one pad (5 layers). I leave this on my face until it starts to dry out (up to an hour). You can also do this in the morning and/or night for a few minutes every day to maximize the efficacy of your lotions.</li>
    <li> Great! Works at advertised.</li>
    <li> Love these puffs. Great for liquid face masks, as I love DIY, freshly made face masks. A must have, and I use the silicone mask over them, to keep them moist while infusing my skin!</li>
    <li> good customer service! Good product! just a little expensive</li>
    <li> I have always been using the Shiseido cotton pads&lt;br /&gt;with my bioderma and although the Shiseido one is great,&lt;br /&gt;is soaks up too much product at once.&lt;br /&gt;However, these don&#x27;t soak up as much because I can divide it&lt;br /&gt;and they are so soft and 100% lint free!&lt;br /&gt;Even if they couldn&#x27;t be divided, I would still say these are better&lt;br /&gt;than the shiseido ones.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like the softest cotton ever</li>
    <li> very soft and easy to use. i can use the cotton puff to do facial mask and put lotion after washing my face. One box can be use for a long time. will order it again.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to arrive (still sooner than the estimated time of arrival)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first time to find and use &amp;#34;multi-layer cotton puffs&amp;#34;, and I bought it with the thick lotion. It works well as facial masks. Later, as I run out of Sephora cotton rounds, and don&#x27;t want to use too many thick Shiseido cotton puffs, I use this one for eye make-up remover (use with Lancôme or Clinique eye make-up remover) and cleaning (use with Biotherma cleaning water for face make-up removal or morning cleansing), and it works well. I normally use two layers for make-up removal, and sometimes one layer for cleansing. I also figured that any thin cotton puff would do the work (as facial mask or cleansing/ make-up remover). Just take five thin cotton puffs, and it will reach the same results</li>
    <li> Very handy for a quick toner mask.&lt;br /&gt;The material is in good quality that thick enough hold the water but thin enough to save your lotion/toner.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave cotton residues on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the pieces are easy to separate apart when they are wet. Great for some pricey toner when apply instead using the whole face pressed mask. I usually cut one piece for chin and nose, 2 for forehead, 2 for each cheek. Sometimes use with daiso silicon mask over it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable compared to onlin Asia makeup store.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So you read Chizu Saeki&#x27;s book. And you bought the cult-status Hada Labo fluid. Now what? well, you need peel-able cotton pads that can be separated to make \\&quot;lotion masks\\&quot; that are the secret to dewy-plump, cherubic-ly moist skin.    Don&#x27;t even waste another second researching for cotton pad brands -- this one is the best. Of all the cotton pad brands, Selena brand is larger than standard peel-apart brands (and i&#x27;ve tried many--most are too small and not made for peeling apart).    One pad can be easy peeled into 5 thin layers, each one strong enough to withhold the Lotion Mask Technique: 1) wet pads in warm water, 2)squeeze pads of excess water, 3) peel and re-saturate with lotion.  Leave on face for 3-5 minutes and BOOM --- magically dewy and plump skin practically drunk with moisture. Seal in all that wonderful hydration with your fave night cream or facial oil.    i personally use 2 pads for lotion masks,  which gives me 10 layers: 2 for the forehead, 2 for undereyes, 1 for chin, 2 for cheeks, and 1 leftover for the nose area. I give a good shake of [[ASIN:B000FQUGXA Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion (Moist) - 170ml]] to each one.  Other brands dont peel apart as easily, or are too small to cover the face. Oh, the frustration!    Tip: Selena Pad pricing is 50% cheaper in Japanese supermarkets or in Asia, about $3.00 a box, give or take. When travelling, i stock up b/c they&#x27;re light and don&#x27;t add to luggage weight.</li>
    <li> The best! It stretches pretty nicely and doesn&#x27;t tear up that easily (unless you break it). Five layers of cotton is enough to cover up your whole face. Also, it&#x27;s pretty affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tips: If you are a beginner I suggest you to watch a youtube video from Chizu Saeki (as mentioned from other reviewers), Michelle Phan, or others. They explain how to use it and what products you can use with the cotton mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use this to do my DIY milk mask.  Just soak the cotton into milk (preferably organic milk) and set the layers on your face. The milk brightens up my face pretty nicely and helps to fade some small imperfections. Other than my DIY mask, I put on some watery facial lotion from Naruko or other lotion with similar consistency.</li>
    <li> Biggest issue for me is trying to get them out of the box one at a time! Weirdly hard. But good quality.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. They stretch much more than I&#x27;d anticipated-- which is awesome for DIY lotion masks. Great for removing eye makeup, too.</li>
    <li> The best cotton puffs for a quick face mask made by your lotions.</li>
    <li> oh that little flower design is so cute embedded on these are so cute and these are a great size to use for masks or I just grab 2 thin little layers from a bunched sheet of 5 and use that as a regular cotton pad for nail polish or makeup remover. Since these are thin, they won&#x27;t absorb much product ( which is a plus, you will save money on toners and acetone) but are just as effective. Not only that, but they are so soft! Once you switch to brand name puffs like these you can&#x27;t go back to the american drugstore kind. The typical US kind feels like sand paper in comparison, and this is a really easy way to pamper your skin for a little extra money per box. It&#x27;s like comparing walmart brand tissue paper to Charmin ultra strong or Northern Quilted Ultra Plush Toilet Paper (which is THE BOMB by the way. If you haven&#x27;t used it, you should try it!) I&#x27;m not endorsed, I swear, I just love soft things.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past 3 years.  The reason that I liked about it is that it stays as one pad after I wipe it on my face,  some of the other pads will end up with small cotton threads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s easy to separate into individual layers when you want to use it as tiny masks soaked with your choice of toner</li>
    <li> kind of a pain to peel apart but it&#x27;s okay. wouldn&#x27;t reorder</li>
    <li> Works well and item arrived before the estimated date. Will order from the co again.</li>
    <li> This is the best cotton pad I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s soft and I can choose however thin or thick I want to use, without the cotton coming apart. And this seller also has the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever encountered, there was a thank you note and a little gift included in the package.</li>
    <li> Breaks apart too quickly if using for toner application</li>
    <li> Would purchase again.  Lint free. I like the fact that they separate so you can use as much as you need and also great for masks.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have paid closer attention when I ordered these but I was reading the reviews and saw it described as a &amp;#34;concentrated sheet mask,&amp;#34; which I assumed was a mask big enough for my entire face.  Now, just looking at the picture on the box, I feel really stupid as this is obviously just a bunch of cotton squares.  Which I really didn&#x27;t need or want.  I tried to make a mask out of them anyway since I&#x27;d already ripped open the box but as soon as I wet the sheets and stuck them on my face they just sort of slid/fell off my skin.  I had to lay down to keep them on my face.  I guess I can use them for applying toner, but I&#x27;m ordering an actual full sized compressed cotton mask, since that was what I actually wanted.</li>
