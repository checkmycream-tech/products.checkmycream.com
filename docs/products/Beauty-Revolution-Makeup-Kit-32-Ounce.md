      <li>The colors are great but a few of them came broken, I don&#x27;t know if the ups man threw the box</li>
      <li>The only thing I got out of it was a mess to clean up and throw away.</li>
      <li>You need to open it completely to use anything.</li>
      <li>When I recieved my Shany All-In-One Makeup Kit, it was all broken up in pieces,and I was looking forward to using it, but I can&#x27;t, because of it being in so many pieces...</li>
      <li>And the eyeliner and mascara is a bit low quality, other than that I really do like this product and can deal with the cons.</li>

    <li> THIS PALETTE IS AMAZING!!!  I LOVE THAT IT HAS EVERYTHING INSIDE LIPGLOSSES, LIPSTICKS, EYELINERS AND MORE.  THE COLORS ARE GREAT AND EASY PALETTE TO TAKE WITH U AND VERY PRETTY COLORS.</li>
    <li> There were things I liked about this make up kit and things I didn&#x27;t. I bought it because I wanted to try various shades of eye shadow and lip colors without paying for each individually.  For this purpose it worked pretty well.  The shadow is decent quality and the lip gloss comes in good colors. However the eye liner and mascara are very poor quality.  Also the box is not easily accessible. You need to open it completely to use anything. The box actually broke the first time I opened it, so I guess its pretty cheap. So its fun for trying new things and lasts for a few hours but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as your sole make up source.</li>
    <li> I bought the product for my daughter as a christmas gift thank goodness I checked it first or she would have been very disappointed the slide out makeup drawers were broken. The make up was all broken and disgusting.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for her birthday. It was not worth the 40 bucks! The colors look nothing like they do in the photo (they are much darker). The eyeliner isn&#x27;t creamy and you had to press hard to get it on. The box was a much lighter color than in the photo. My daughter actually thought we had gotten her another makeup set instead of this one! The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it arrived unharmed and quickly. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought for gifts. The make up kit was very well received, but I think the unit is pretty cheap. It can be difficult to open or close this thing up. This is a good make up kit, but I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as portable.</li>
    <li> What to say! I just loved it! Plenty of colors and very well organized. I&#x27;d certainly recommend it. It&#x27;s worthy</li>
    <li> During shipping, the air bags in the box popped causing the makeup box move around. I ordered 2. one of them had cracked powder, and on both of them the one of the sliding eye shadow didn&#x27;t slide. i like the product, but very poor shipping. keep it to where the product doesn&#x27;t crack or break.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. Quality is not up to the mark. I won&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I would order this again, just what I wanted, fast shipping, Great company, very satisfied with my order, I thought there was more to it..</li>
    <li> Spent $35 dollars on this product and all I got were missing pieces, a broken mirror, and eyeshadow power everywhere in the box. None of the kit was usable so it had to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Sister and she loves it. It was a surprise gift to her so I am happy that she likes it.</li>
    <li> This kit is wonderful. It has everything you need in a nice compact area. The shadows are very nice and I especially love the mascara.</li>
    <li> When I recieved my Shany All-In-One Makeup Kit, it was all broken up in pieces,and I was looking forward to using it, but I can&#x27;t, because of it being in so many pieces...So was I pleased, not in the least...</li>
    <li> It comes with the right side broken ... and i was need to fix it before gift</li>
    <li> Nothing was usable. All of the piece in this kit came broken when it arrived at the post office. The only thing I got out of it was a mess to clean up and throw away. Definitely not worth $35.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a crossdresser friend and jeezzzzz... is this junk. I mean garbage. It is from some third world country. It probably took one little, third world country kid about 2 minutes to make, and costs a little less than a buck to build.</li>
    <li> The colors are great but a few of them came broken, I don&#x27;t know if the ups man threw the box and that&#x27;s why some colors fell out but I do enjoy is kit.</li>
    <li> great colors for people who want a step up doing their makeup, there are lots of colors and but the lip glosses were thick otherwise great product</li>
    <li> This is so compact with a palette of beautiful colors to dazzle the special man in your life. I bought another for my daughter and she loves it .</li>
    <li> This product looks great but it came broken. I returned it and ordered again for a higher price because my daughter loved the physical appearance but it came broken again. After dealing directly with the company, they understood and refunded me the money without any problems. I am still looking for a set that looks like this one but have not been successful.</li>
    <li> I have ordered 2 pieces of the makeup kit. One piece is totally defective. I just opened the box and found that the trays for eyeshadows and blush colors for Right side are not in place and are not attached to the kit. I am very much disappointed with the product as I was about to gift the product to my friend on thanks giving and now I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows were very nice, but the case is hard to open. And the eyeliner and mascara is a bit low quality, other than that I really do like this product and can deal with the cons.</li>
