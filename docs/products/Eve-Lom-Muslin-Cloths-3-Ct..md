      <li>These muslin cloths used with Eve Lom&#x27;s cleanser or any great cleanser are a great way to wash and gently exfoliate your face.</li>
      <li>I use a Clarisonic most of the time, but when I&#x27;m in a hurry, these cloths are a great quick alternative!  </li>

      <li>I was so glad to be able to find these.  </li>
      <li>I also like to be able to reuse my cloth more than once.  </li>

      <li>Love the cloths and do just what described.</li>
      <li>If you love the cleanser, you learn to love the cloths too--there&#x27;s something soothing abut the ritual of having a dedicated cloth that requires hand washing that feels more respectful to your skin.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cloth, before i started using it</li>
      <li>The price might be a wee bit more than others, but the difference is the quality.  </li>
      <li>It is a uniquely weaved muslin cotton cloth that exfoliates nicely when used with a cleanser.  </li>
      <li>They do a wonderful job of a light exfoliation and leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the muslin cloth with anything other than the Eve Lom cleanser, but I am remarkably impressed with these products.</li>
      <li>I bought these because wash clothes get mildewed in my house so easily.</li>
      <li>These cloths are worth every penny, have tried many others which some were okay-</li>
      <li>These three cloths are HUGE.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a treat for light body exfoliating, too.</li>
      <li>Feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
      <li>I had purchased another brand prior to these that I thought were great.</li>
      <li>I throw mine in the gentle cycle with warm water</li>
      <li>I have ordered several muslin cloths and by far the Eve Lom cloths are the best.  </li>
      <li>The muslin cloth provides noticeable exfoliation and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>so they are more sanitary and safe for sensitive skin than wash clothes.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.  </li>
      <li>It would be a good investment with or without eve Lom facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>It ships fairly quickly</li>
      <li>Love the softness and high quality of the Eve Lom Muslin cloth.</li>
      <li>My first Eve Lom Muslin Cloth came along with a free sample of the cleanser.</li>
      <li>It removed more makeup than my normal washcloth.  </li>
      <li>This is totally worth the price, although I know there are cheaper muslin cloths</li>
      <li>I will admit its a bit pricey, but so worth it when you consider how visible your face is.  </li>
      <li>This cloth is worth buying.  </li>
      <li>and I kind of prefer that to these really big cloths.</li>
      <li>They are worth the money.</li>
      <li>Now, is it worth this price - still thinking about that.</li>
      <li>These muslin cloths have changed the look and feel of my skin with very gentle exfoliation that is actually more effective than the harsh stuff.</li>
      <li>I bought these even thought I would normally have thought it was a lot more than necessary for 3 cloths for washing your face, but I really like the weight of these and how easy they are to clean.</li>
      <li>I originally got them with my purchase of Eve Lom cleanser and have purchased the extra cloths because I love using them so much.</li>
      <li>These are light weight and dry easily overnight</li>
      <li>BUT I would prefer to have more cloths that are smaller.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been about a month now since my first order</li>
      <li>I would buy these again, they are very soft and make my face feel very clean and soft.</li>
      <li>The cloths are a very generous large size!  </li>
      <li>My face feels so clean and soft when I&#x27;m done cleansing my face.</li>
      <li>After purchasing the cloths, a couple of days later &amp;#34;buyers remorse&amp;#34; set in while thinking there are several perfectly good light-weight face cloths in the linen cabinet.  </li>
      <li>They dry quickly overnight and wash out easily.</li>
      <li>THE ONLY WAY TO GET YOUR FACE REALLY CLEAN!</li>
      <li>The quality is great, though, and these cloths have changed my face-washing game.</li>
      <li>and they work very well for acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey for what they are really</li>
      <li>The whole point of face washing is to minimize bacteria.  </li>
      <li>An affordable alternative to the Liz Earle Muslin clothes, I like them so much I bought another pack.</li>
      <li>I always use these for removing treatment masks, as they remove all product and offer some gentle exfoliating as well.</li>
      <li>Pamper yourselves with these, you really won&#x27;t regret purchasing these Eve Lom Muslin cloths.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cloth is worth buying.  It is a uniquely weaved muslin cotton cloth that exfoliates nicely when used with a cleanser.  I will never be without it.  I have oily skin, and I use it in place of my regular scrub 2x a week.  I used to use a natural sea sponge, but this cloth exfoliates just like a scrub, but without the the&lt;br /&gt;harmful scratching.&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily,sensitive skin that is prone to break-outs.  So, I need to exfoliate daily. Scrubs can tear the capillaries.  I highly recommend this cloth for facial cleansing.  You can use it with ANY cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cloth.</li>
    <li> I know these are pricey but they are wonderful cloths. My face feels so clean and soft when I&#x27;m done cleansing my face. I can not tell you how they work but they just do. My husband even likes them.</li>
    <li> An affordable alternative to the Liz Earle Muslin clothes, I like them so much I bought another pack. They wash, dry and fold very nicely, unlike other muslin clothes. They are larger in size than a typical wash cloth but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> These were a gift and don&#x27;t look like much, but they&#x27;re actually perfect. I use them with a creamy cleanser and a light touch to gently exfoliate my dry, sensitive skin. Love them!</li>
    <li> great product and seller</li>
    <li> I really like these cloths. BUT I would prefer to have more cloths that are smaller. These three cloths are HUGE. I reuse because I don&#x27;t want to run out and have to wash them every three days (or buy another pack at the steep price). The quality is great, though, and these cloths have changed my face-washing game. They&#x27;re a treat for light body exfoliating, too.</li>
    <li> It works great. One thing I would love to mention is that it works perfectly for those who get peeled lips. Simply rub it on the lips after shower, then the dead skin is gone, thoroughly. It would be a good investment with or without eve Lom facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> These are great cloths for my skin. Makeup is removed easily and effectively, no tugging and pulling. The miracle is there are no makeup stains left behind on these washcloths to be used as cleaning cloths. I bought 2 packs for myself and 2 packs for friends. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> THE BEST! These cloths are worth every penny, have tried many others which some were okay- none compare in my opinion. They launder wonderful! You will not be disappointed. A++++</li>
    <li> THE ONLY WAY TO GET YOUR FACE REALLY CLEAN!</li>
    <li> I would buy these again, they are very soft and make my face feel very clean and soft. They are worth the money.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the cloths, a couple of days later &amp;#34;buyers remorse&amp;#34; set in while thinking there are several perfectly good light-weight face cloths in the linen cabinet.  Then upon using one, it was lovely!  Perfect weight, size and texture and it feels luxurious on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this again!!!</li>
    <li> A bit pricey for what they are really it is just a cloth. They are nice quality but still just a cloth.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect touch for cleaning the skin.  I received one with a sample amount of the cleanser.  The cleanser was okay - but I don&#x27;t like a heavy oily cleanser for my skin.  I then used the cloth with my normal cleanser and it worked beautifully.  It removed more makeup than my normal washcloth.  Since it is thin, I can control it better than my fluffy cotton cloths.  Now, is it worth this price - still thinking about that.</li>
    <li> Non irritating. Replacing other that are very old.</li>
    <li> These cloths are well made. The edges are sewn well and the cloth is high quality muslin. I originally got them with my purchase of Eve Lom cleanser and have purchased the extra cloths because I love using them so much. They dry quickly overnight and wash out easily.</li>
    <li> My first Eve Lom Muslin Cloth came along with a free sample of the cleanser. It was 1/4 of the size of these and I kind of prefer that to these really big cloths. I&#x27;ve been using them with the Eve Lom Morning Cleanser and they give a little extra gentle exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I love these cloths.  They are just coarse enough to naturally exfoliated your face with soap and wash washing.  You don&#x27;t need to use harsh particles in exfoliating products.  You don&#x27;t need to waste $$ on exfoliating  products at all.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years and do not intend to use anything else..thank you, thank you, thank you, very nice</li>
    <li> Very nice muslins cloths and they are about twice the size of regular face cloths.  The price might be a wee bit more than others, but the difference is the quality.  Besides, how can you put a number on taking care of your face!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> These clothes are as described.  They are great quality muslin clothes.  They wash off all your makeup without stripping your face.  It&#x27;s soft when wet and will not harm your skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are good to use no matter what, lifts makeup and excess dirt to get pores clean. Glad I purchased additional as I use these all the time. Not sure how I went so long, they are what I call a FAB FIND</li>
    <li> I had some muslin face cloths years ago and loved them and when they wore out, I never could find them again, until now.  I was so glad to be able to find these.  I would recommend them if you like to use a cloth when you wash your face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay- but for $20 for 3 little pieces of thin fabric I would have expected more noticeable results.... I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the muslin cloth with anything other than the Eve Lom cleanser, but I am remarkably impressed with these products. The muslin cloth provides noticeable exfoliation and rinses clean. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Use these with the balm.</li>
    <li> excellent cloths to be used with cleanser</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cloth, before i started using it I had really bad breakouts and dry skin around my mouth area. I started using this cloth in conjunction with the Clinique 3-step system and they both made a huge difference, the next day most of the dry skin was gone and the second day it was completely clear. I normally put the cleanser on the cloth, rub it a little bit to get it to foam up, and lightly buff my entire face in a circular motion. It&#x27;s been about a month now since my first order and I just re-purchased just so I have a ton of reserves. This is totally worth the price, although I know there are cheaper muslin cloths but I haven&#x27;t tried them. It ships fairly quickly, I got them within 5 days of purchase on standard shipping. If you have dry skin I definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several muslin cloths and by far the Eve Lom cloths are the best.  The texture is gentle, yet also provides great exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I bought these even thought I would normally have thought it was a lot more than necessary for 3 cloths for washing your face, but I really like the weight of these and how easy they are to clean.</li>
    <li> Great for face cleansing and it dries quickly. Love the softness and high quality of the Eve Lom Muslin cloth.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  So expensive for few pieces of cloth.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money at all. Feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
    <li> I like a separate cloth for my face and my body.  I also like to be able to reuse my cloth more than once.  THese are perfect.  First of all, they&#x27;re soft.  THey feel wonderful.  They&#x27;re thin, but not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; thin, just thin to be able to maneuver and wash your face.  Thick cloths make face washing hard, and they also are hard to wring out and dry, which breeds smells and bacteria.  The whole point of face washing is to minimize bacteria.  These wring out easily, dry easily and can be reused numerous times.  I throw mine in the gentle cycle with warm water and they come out great.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I like it!</li>
    <li> I love these cloths!  I use a Clarisonic most of the time, but when I&#x27;m in a hurry, these cloths are a great quick alternative!  They do a wonderful job of a light exfoliation and leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.  The cloths are a very generous large size!  The first one I have cut in half and the next one I will probably cut in thirds.  Doing this makes the set extremely affordable.  I had purchased another brand prior to these that I thought were great. But in comparing the two these are much thicker and last much longer. Every few uses I wash them by hand with some antibiotic hand soap and let them air dry as usual.  I can&#x27;t rave about these enough!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use any chemical exfoliaters. These muslin cloths have changed the look and feel of my skin with very gentle exfoliation that is actually more effective than the harsh stuff. Love them!!</li>
    <li> These muslin cloths used with Eve Lom&#x27;s cleanser or any great cleanser are a great way to wash and gently exfoliate your face.</li>
    <li> Product as described!!</li>
    <li> I like these cloths. They are perfect when I am cleansing my face. They seem to be average muslin cloths. They aren&#x27;t amazing. I think the price is a little high.</li>
    <li> These work really well. Great quality and hold up through many washings.</li>
    <li> I always use these for removing treatment masks, as they remove all product and offer some gentle exfoliating as well. They wash well and I hang them to dry. Love!</li>
    <li> These are simple but effective in cleansing the skin gently without harsh exfoliation. I use these without the Eve Lom cleanser, and just with my other cleansers and they work very well for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> When I bought the Eve Lom cleanser, it was mostly out of curiosity. After a week, I was convinced that it&#x27;s my new go-to product. If you love the cleanser, you learn to love the cloths too--there&#x27;s something soothing abut the ritual of having a dedicated cloth that requires hand washing that feels more respectful to your skin. I&#x27;ve used a Clairsonic for two years, and I would trade it in for these any day: the cloths are gentle exfoliants, and light enough that you don&#x27;t feel claustrophobic when you&#x27;re steaming your pores. Before you judge it, try them.</li>
    <li> Hmm it was almost like a normal wash cloth at triple the price 👎</li>
    <li> Pricey but good cloths.</li>
    <li> These are the very best things to clean your face with at night.  I have the wonderful Eve Lom cleanser that I use 3x per week and all other days I use a different cleanser with these cloths.  They are really great at helping to remove makeup and feel great when I get it very hot and cover my face with it.</li>
    <li> Great for removing makeup.</li>
    <li> Love the cloths and do just what described.</li>
    <li> wow~~~really really good quality</li>
    <li> I bought these muslin cloths because I needed a facial cloth and I read good reviews about them. They are great even if I don&#x27;t use them with a Eve Lom cleanser. They exfoliate softly and it&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use cleansers on my face but use warm water and a cloth nightly to take off make up, dirt and oil. I bought these because wash clothes get mildewed in my house so easily. These are light weight and dry easily overnight so they are more sanitary and safe for sensitive skin than wash clothes. I have very very sensitive skin though and I have to use these with lots of water or else they are a little too scratchy. They do a really good job of exfoliating without adding product on your skin. I say, when it comes to sensitive skin care, less is more (and costs less).</li>
    <li> I bought this in the nick of time, I was having some dry flaky areas on my face that even my Mia Clairsonic couldn&#x27;t buff away.  After using these cloths for 3-4 days the dry flakiness dissappeared.  I&#x27;m forever grateful for ordering these Muslin cloths.  It gently buffs away dry skin to reveal a much brighter complection.  I will admit its a bit pricey, but so worth it when you consider how visible your face is.  These cloths are very large and it feels like great quality Muslin.  Pamper yourselves with these, you really won&#x27;t regret purchasing these Eve Lom Muslin cloths.</li>
