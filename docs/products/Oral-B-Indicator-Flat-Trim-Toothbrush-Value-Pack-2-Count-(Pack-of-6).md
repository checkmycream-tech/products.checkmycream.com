      <li>These are my all time favorite toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>So, put it all together and this package seems like the right thing and a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary</li>
      <li>Good dental hygiene is one of the keys to good health, especially heart health.</li>
      <li>These soft brushes are great to keep your mouth healthy.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush can reach many area in your mouth, because the small size of the head, the stick has the good support of the head make cleaning, brushing easy, a very good toothbrush</li>
      <li>These were the old style toothbrushes from Oral-B which I greatly prefer over the newer &amp;#34;high tech&amp;#34; models.  </li>
      <li>Why not make your mouth happy with these soft bristle brushes.</li>
      <li>ONCE IS EASY</li>
      <li>I already new the product was good when I purchased it.</li>
      <li>The Oral-B rep confirmed for me that the toothbrushes I received were indeed the Compact 35&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find them in a multi-pack since I can rarely find them in area stores.</li>
      <li>These do a great job and they last.</li>
      <li>They are just a plain toothbrush with no frills and they are perfect.</li>
      <li>, I will buy more and the most interesting thing is Amazon is the only place you can find them in bulk.  </li>
      <li>It has a small head which is perfect for &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; mouths.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Indicator Contour Clean</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended them and once I got past &#x27;hey, this is a kid&#x27;s toothbrush&#x27;, I found they work great and have never found anything that works better since.</li>
      <li>I got a really good deal on this big pack of brand name tooth brushes.</li>
      <li>THE FLAT TRIM SOFT TOOTHBRUSHES ARE GREAT FOR OUR FAMILY AND TO BE ABLE TO BUY ALOT OF THEM</li>
      <li>I have always been loyal to Oral B.  </li>
      <li>What a deal. . . .and for my favorite toothbrushes, too.  Toothbrush manufactures are always creating new designs, but this one stands the test of time.  </li>
      <li>I had been using the medium, but she said the soft cleaned best around the gum line and over half of my teeth have been capped.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Oral-b Indicator compact size, soft toothbrush for many years now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon still offers them.  </li>
      <li>My husband is very particular about his toothbrush and he really loves this particular kind.  </li>
      <li>A long time favorite and highly recommended by most dentists.  </li>
      <li>These are the kind that I&#x27;ve been searching all over for a LONG time and you don&#x27;t see anything even close at any stores.</li>
      <li>Cleans teeth so much better than brushes with different lengths.</li>
      <li>More on this later.</li>
      <li>Toothbrush is exactly that.</li>
      <li>Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush Twin Pack, 2 Count (Pack of 6)]].</li>
      <li>B00HZ6UXYK Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush, 4 Count]], also in a value pack [[ASIN:B001FWXTH8</li>
      <li>The bristles clean deeper than the ones that are bevel cut and with the package that Amazon offers, they are about 1.50 a brush compared to the &amp;#34;high tech&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I really want.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I waited too long because some of the bristles were curved, a sure sign of overuse.</li>
      <li>With subscribe and save, you can change the month easily, and only get them when you need them.</li>
      <li>but thanks to amazon, i now have a lifetime supply.  </li>
      <li>I like that this toothbrush comes in a pack of twelve, so there&#x27;s always one at the ready, until it&#x27;s time to buy another pack.</li>
      <li>What I actually received was &#x27;Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They have changed toothbrushes so much, I was having trouble finding a really good basic toothbrush.</li>
      <li>these in particular seem to have been passed into the ether, as i can no longer find them in the store.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Wish they had extra soft, yet soft works fine.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Preserve soft toothbrushes and they were softer and much nicer.</li>
      <li>Cannot find normal toothbrushes in store.</li>
      <li>I need something with a smaller head, and in the past, the best I could find (also here in Amazon, after extensive search) was similar</li>
      <li>Great, long lasting brushes for everyday cleaning.</li>
      <li>a new order with 12 would be sent.  </li>
      <li>And find a new brand of toothbrush.</li>
      <li>(I subscribe to it) is that when I tried the new toothbrush, even though the package clearly printed \\&quot;Soft\\&quot;, it really doesn&#x27;t feel like the soft toothbrushes I have always been using.</li>
      <li>These have the same &#x27;Indicator Contour Clean&#x27; name as the ones I just received, but have wavy bristles and a larger head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The one line summary description for this item is currently &#x27;Oral-B Indicator Flat Trim Toothbrush&#x27;, and this is consistent with the first of the three product images posted by Amazon.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt my gums, and substantial enough so as to get my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;like a 30 or young child&#x27;s size.  </li>
      <li>, I know these (from this shipment) aren&#x27;t soft.</li>
      <li>I always got a soft Oral B tooth brush from my dentist after a check up</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using soft toothbrushes from Oral-B for ages</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to floss and gargle daily in addition to brushing your entire mouth, gums, tongue, roof of your mouth, and inside your cheeks at least once a day.</li>
      <li>With the curvy brushes, I am hitting and missing teeth, so some get clean and others do not.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been searching for and said the name had changed from &#x27;Flat Trim&#x27; to &#x27;Contour Clean&#x27; due to a change in the curvature of the handle.</li>
      <li>The new order again only had 2 total.  </li>
      <li>She also informed me that the &#x27;S&#x27; in the upper right corner (under &#x27;Soft&#x27; and the horizontal bar) indicates a small, AKA compact, head.</li>
      <li>complete this absurdly long review and investment of my time in toothbrush research, here is the history of name changes:&lt;br /&gt;Compact</li>
      <li>The head is not too big and not too small - it fits just right in my mouth.</li>
      <li>They are rated as soft but I think there a little firmer than soft which I like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price and quanity of Oral B toothbrushes.  A long time favorite and highly recommended by most dentists.  Cost saving deal in these times of escalating prices.</li>
    <li> I got a really good deal on this big pack of brand name tooth brushes. I won&#x27;t have to buy more for years (since I also get them at the dentist&#x27;s office). &#x27;nuf said!</li>
    <li> THE FLAT TRIM SOFT TOOTHBRUSHES ARE GREAT FOR OUR FAMILY AND TO BE ABLE TO BUY ALOT OF THEM AT ONCE IS EASY ON THE BUDGET!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I like the small brush head.  However, they&#x27;re not soft at all.  Even after using a toothbrush for a couple of months, the brush is still stiff, and I don&#x27;t like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m outside of the return window, I guess I&#x27;ll give the rest of the brushes to the local food pantry.  And find a new brand of toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This type, size 30, medium, flat top, none of the silly special effects, is very difficult to find in the stores.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon still offers them.  Price was good as well.</li>
    <li> I like the size and feel of these brushes.  They are rated as soft but I think there a little firmer than soft which I like.</li>
    <li> These are my all time favorite toothbrushes. I like a straight-forward, not too hard toothbrush that does the job. None of my local stores carry these. So thankful to be able to order them!</li>
    <li> I already new the product was good when I purchased it. But the price is what sold me.  I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> My dentist always gives me that type of toothbrush after my rdv but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. It has a small head which is perfect for &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; mouths.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great value pack, with shipping, it costs me 2$/toothbush! It&#x27;s a great barging! I now have toothbrushes for 2 years in advance at a great price!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  Have been buying it for years.  No longer sold in stores!  I hand them out to my grandchildren.  Cleans teeth so much better than brushes with different lengths.</li>
    <li> i have used these exact toothbrushes for at least 10 years now. i would always buy a few at the drugstore when i saw them there.  these in particular seem to have been passed into the ether, as i can no longer find them in the store.  but thanks to amazon, i now have a lifetime supply.  they are really great!</li>
    <li> These were the old style toothbrushes from Oral-B which I greatly prefer over the newer &amp;#34;high tech&amp;#34; models.  The bristles clean deeper than the ones that are bevel cut and with the package that Amazon offers, they are about 1.50 a brush compared to the &amp;#34;high tech&amp;#34; more costlier ones.  I just like their simplicity and good quality, I will buy more and the most interesting thing is Amazon is the only place you can find them in bulk.  They are also stocked at Walmart but they are hidden usually on the lowest shelf and guess what, they are usually sold out as well.  So Amazon makes it easier for me to get them when I need them.</li>
    <li> What a deal. . . .and for my favorite toothbrushes, too.  Toothbrush manufactures are always creating new designs, but this one stands the test of time.  I was so glad to find them in a multi-pack since I can rarely find them in area stores.</li>
    <li> I still have my wisdom teeth molars, so the space inside mouth is tight. These brushes are the ticket. Big man sized handle compact head.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and this model and they are difficult to find on store shelves</li>
    <li> Glad to purchase the 12 brushes at once with subscribe and save. Wish they had extra soft, yet soft works fine. Variety of colors and arrived perfectly sealed. These soft brushes are great to keep your mouth healthy. It&#x27;s good to floss and gargle daily in addition to brushing your entire mouth, gums, tongue, roof of your mouth, and inside your cheeks at least once a day. The other brushing during the day might not need to be so thorough. Good dental hygiene is one of the keys to good health, especially heart health. Why not make your mouth happy with these soft bristle brushes. Small enough for children, too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just like every reputable dentist recommends, this is the best toothbrush there is.  It&#x27;s a crime that the only way to buy it is online through Amazon.com.  It should be on sale on the toothbrush aisle of every store in America!</li>
    <li> I ordered Oral-b Indicator Flat Trim Value Pack Toothbrush, 2-Count (Pack of 6).  Expected to receive 12, but only got 2 total.  Called Amazon support, who said to return the 2 and a new order with 12 would be sent.  The new order again only had 2 total.  Called Amazon support again, and was told that I would get a refund for the order.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is what I wanted, but about $20 is too expensive for 2 toothbrushes of this type.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see the refund soon.</li>
    <li> I always got a soft Oral B tooth brush from my dentist after a check up but these were not the same. They are way too hard and I can&#x27;t use them as they make my gums hurt. I purchased the Preserve soft toothbrushes and they were softer and much nicer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the same as the Oral B Indicator #35 compact that I had ordered in the past and as far as I can tell, they look identical.  My husband is very particular about his toothbrush and he really loves this particular kind.  We&#x27;re very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was specifically looking for a toothbrush with a smaller head than what they sell in stores.&lt;br /&gt;This Toothbrush is exactly that. It has 30 Tufts of bristles which make it a lot smaller than the same model they sell in stores. If you have a smaller mouth that needs a smaller toothbrush to get into the hard to reach places. And you don&#x27;t want to buy dora the explorer this toothbrush is your answer!</li>
    <li> Cannot find normal toothbrushes in store. Glad to find here. Great, long lasting brushes for everyday cleaning. Nothing fancy just a great brush.</li>
    <li> The blue indicator bristles said it&#x27;s time to change the toothbrush. Maybe I waited too long because some of the bristles were curved, a sure sign of overuse. In any case, my cleaning lady suggested that Oral-B was probably the best brand of brush. She also indicated that the soft bristle was best for my gums. I had been using the medium, but she said the soft cleaned best around the gum line and over half of my teeth have been capped. So, put it all together and this package seems like the right thing and a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oral-b Indicator compact size, soft toothbrush for many years now. I have tried other brushes and other brands and keep coming back to this one. It doesn&#x27;t say it on the package, or in the description of it, but it is the compact sized one.  Buying these from Amazon, with the value pack, 2-count, and the pack of 6, is a great deal and  very convenient. With subscribe and save, you can change the month easily, and only get them when you need them. I like to change my toothbrush every month, so this is really the best way to have plenty on hand.</li>
    <li> They have changed toothbrushes so much, I was having trouble finding a really good basic toothbrush. This is it! I bought 6, so they will last me for a while. They are becoming very difficult to find.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush I use.</li>
    <li> Disappointed asI thought the brushing head surface would have been much larger.  I usually use 60 rated head, theses were more&lt;br /&gt;like a 30 or young child&#x27;s size.  I was going to return, but by time I paid shipping and return charge administered by Amazon, I decided it was too expensive to return.</li>
    <li> I recommend this toothbrush for anyone with teeth. I&#x27;ve been buying it for several years now. The handle fits well in my hand. It is flat so I can get a better grip, and it has a place I can rest my thumb to help maneuver the toothbrush. (I have found that toothbrushes with round handles are difficult to grip, especially once they get wet.) The head is not too big and not too small - it fits just right in my mouth. The bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt my gums, and substantial enough so as to get my teeth clean. I don&#x27;t pay attention to the blue indicator bristles - I know when it&#x27;s time to change the brush. I like that this toothbrush comes in a pack of twelve, so there&#x27;s always one at the ready, until it&#x27;s time to buy another pack.</li>
    <li> These do a great job and they last.</li>
    <li> Oral-b has always been the choice of my family even before I was born. You really feel the benefit of the round edges.</li>
    <li> I like a simple no-gimmick toothbrush and they have gotten really hard to find.  I found these on Amazon, and they are just what I was looking for, so I bought a year&#x27;s supply.  They are just a plain toothbrush with no frills and they are perfect.</li>
    <li> These are the best - the only ones my family likes!!</li>
    <li> Just received my order and I can&#x27;t be happier!  These are the kind that I&#x27;ve been searching all over for a LONG time and you don&#x27;t see anything even close at any stores. All you see is those with \\&quot;monster head\\&quot; that looks like something for a gorilla or for someone who must have teeth made with metal!  I need something with a smaller head, and in the past, the best I could find (also here in Amazon, after extensive search) was similar but it&#x27;s Oral-B 40. These came and I realized that they are Oral-B 30, it&#x27;s an even smaller head than 40 and that&#x27;s exactly what I really want.  I&#x27;m going to stock up on these -- ordering more soon just in case Amazon stops carrying them in the future. Thank you, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update 9/22/2013&lt;br /&gt;The only one strange thing that happened with this shipment (I subscribe to it) is that when I tried the new toothbrush, even though the package clearly printed \\&quot;Soft\\&quot;, it really doesn&#x27;t feel like the soft toothbrushes I have always been using. I think they might have mislabeled or mis-packaged the \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; ones with the \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; labeling.  I&#x27;ve been using soft toothbrushes from Oral-B for ages, I know these (from this shipment) aren&#x27;t soft. However, the ones I received in previous shipment a few months ago were indeed soft.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush can reach many area in your mouth, because the small size of the head, the stick has the good support of the head make cleaning, brushing easy, a very good toothbrush</li>
    <li> I can reach further to the back of my mouth to brush with a flat brush than a curvy one.  I can feel which teeth and gums I&#x27;ve brushed.  With the curvy brushes, I am hitting and missing teeth, so some get clean and others do not.  I now have 48 brushes, which should last me awhile ..... about 16 years at 3 a year!  I&#x27;m happy I found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Compact 35 toothbrushes for a very long time. My dentist recommended them and once I got past &#x27;hey, this is a kid&#x27;s toothbrush&#x27;, I found they work great and have never found anything that works better since. Unfortunately, Oral-B product management has not made it easy to find them with name changes presenting a moving target. It was confusing enough that I actually took the time to call Oral-B and am now taking time to write a review for, yes, a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one line summary description for this item is currently &#x27;Oral-B Indicator Flat Trim Toothbrush&#x27;, and this is consistent with the first of the three product images posted by Amazon. The third image shows simply &#x27;Oral-B Indicator&#x27; as the name. More on this later. What I actually received was &#x27;Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the phone call. The Oral-B rep confirmed for me that the toothbrushes I received were indeed the Compact 35&#x27;s I&#x27;d been searching for and said the name had changed from &#x27;Flat Trim&#x27; to &#x27;Contour Clean&#x27; due to a change in the curvature of the handle. She also informed me that the &#x27;S&#x27; in the upper right corner (under &#x27;Soft&#x27; and the horizontal bar) indicates a small, AKA compact, head. So for those of you who can&#x27;t get past the &#x27;kid&#x27;s toothbrush&#x27; thing, perhaps try a larger head size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to post this review, I recalled having purchased another Oral-B toothbrush. I dug up that purchase and found that it&#x27;s still sold on Amazon [[ASIN:B00HZ6UXYK Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush, 4 Count]], also in a value pack [[ASIN:B001FWXTH8 Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush Twin Pack, 2 Count (Pack of 6)]]. These have the same &#x27;Indicator Contour Clean&#x27; name as the ones I just received, but have wavy bristles and a larger head. I posted pictures of both. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complete this absurdly long review and investment of my time in toothbrush research, here is the history of name changes:&lt;br /&gt;Compact 35 -&gt; Advantage Compact 35 -&gt; Indicator Compact 35 -&gt; Indicator -&gt; Indicator Flat Trim -&gt; Indicator Contour Clean</li>
    <li> Supposed to have 35 bristles. Only has 30. I don&#x27;t think this a mistake. Clearly an example of false advertisting. Shame on amazon for backing a company like this.</li>
    <li> Great, consistent quality and great, reliable service, always delivered correctly and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always been loyal to Oral B.  I like softer brushes for my kids so they don&#x27;t damage their gums with rushed brushing habits.  I gave this a lower rating due to the packaging - I only received 5 packs in the box.</li>
