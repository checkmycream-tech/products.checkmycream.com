      <li>I find it pleasant</li>
      <li>so I thought this would be a good moisturizer.</li>

      <li>It feels good.  </li>
      <li>I now use Eclos and Sante skin care products with good results and no breakouts or irritation.</li>
      <li>Any good dermatologist I have ever visited has recommended this brand.  </li>
      <li>This feels good on, gives my skin much-needed moisture without acne, and prevents the drying flakes</li>

      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>A good product good value.  </li>
      <li>Although I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, it works good as a moisturizer.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice to use at bedtime, too.</li>
      <li>Nice moisturizer, under makeup, I also use Olay regerist serum, underneath the cream.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Abolutely the best product for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from many skin allergies with creams that contain perfume and/or have any kind of sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>if you are expecting \\&quot;plastic surgery\\&quot; like results then forget it, but it is the best cream out there that I have tried (although I steer clear of creams costing anything more than $20).</li>
      <li>Do this consistently and the results are great.</li>
      <li>I use this under my eyes and its works better than most eye cream yet its great for the whole face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As a woman in her 70&#x27;s, my skin has become quite dry.  My face cream i&#x27;ve used for some years was discontinued &amp; it took some time to find a good rich-enough cream for sensitive skin...&amp; was totally unsuccessful til I tried this Eucerin facial cream.  It&#x27;s a definite winner for me!!!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin so I thought this would be a good moisturizer. Because it was so heavy, I only used it at night. I still got black heads everywhere, mostly around my cheeks and jawline. I stopped using it and after a few days, my skin cleared up. A few months later, I convinced myself that maybe I had a reaction because I was using it in the summertime and my oily skin is worse in the summer. So, I started using it again in colder weather and only at night. Same thing happened. I was so disappointed because I really like the cream otherwise. Even though my skin is oily, it can get really dry during the winter and this did a good job of keeping my face moisturized. It still sits in my  medicine cabinet because I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw it away. I am still trying to think of some way I can use it without causing a breakout. I now use Eclos and Sante skin care products with good results and no breakouts or irritation.</li>
    <li> This feels good on, gives my skin much-needed moisture without acne, and prevents the drying flakes I&#x27;m proned toward.  But it seems to do nothing for reversing fine lines or improving skin tone, a bummer, because it is the only skin product that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  If it actually did the whole &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle&amp;#34; part, I&#x27;d boost my rating to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought the Q10 anti-wrinkle cream from this site and was really disappointed on how my skin changed. I started using this cream for more than one year now, but I used to buy it in store. Lately the store went out on this cream that is why I ordered it online. I was not sure why the cream was that strange, so I went to Walgreens Pharmacy and bought another one in store. when I compare the two creams, there was really a big difference. the cream I bought on amazon was thicker and more like a paste, the texture was not right, the one from Walgreens Pharmacy was lighter and creamier. I am definitely sure there is a difference. So to let you guys know.</li>
    <li> I have super dry, sensitive skin and have trouble finding a product that is moisturizing enough to quench it. I have tried numerous products that claim to be for severely dry skin, and none of them left my skin as soft and moisturized as this product. At the same time, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all after I apply it. I have used it for a few months now and have found no reason not to love it. I am so happy I found a product that works this well and fits within my budget!</li>
    <li> The only con to this is that it does not contain any SPF otherwise it is great and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive facial skin.  The slightest fragrance or unassuming offending chemical can cause rashes, stinging and all sorts of unpleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many products. From high end premium brands to drugstore brands. I have found some high end brands that are truly great, but also very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So based on reviews her on Amazon, and the reasonable price,  I decided to try Eucerin Q10. I have been using it for five days, and I love it. It is a thick, rich cream  goes on smoothly and is absorbed rapidly. Skin feels really moisturized after application. I use it in the morning before makeup application and again at night before bed. Smooth skin and no irritations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it will deliver on promise to reduce facial line. I&#x27;ll let you know in six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are paraben sensitive, this creme does contain parabens. The creme is also a yellow color, which the box describes as being the intended color (result of natural ingredients).</li>
    <li> This cream is just too thick for my face and I am using it on my hands.  I tried it around my eyes and on my neck and it just started falling off in gobs when I rubbed my neck.  Gross.  I will not put it on my face again and will just use it up as hand cream.  I might mention that I am a 65-year-old boomer babe with oily skin still and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet and didn&#x27;t want to get them.  I would rather get wrinkles than have this thick stuff or the greasy lotion on my face.  Both are good for the hands though and people can tell your age from your wrinkled hands too.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for your face before bed. None of my friends or family know I use skin products but what guy this day and age doesn&#x27;t?    The scent is ambiguous and not perfume-y like some creams. Keeps my face hydrated at night in the dry Colorado air.     Great product with Q10!</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream (including many, many very expensive ones) that works well for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin. After two weeks, my skin feels very soft and my crows feet are less visible. This is a must try product. It&#x27;s inexpensive and yet it works. I highly recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This has the exact consistency, color, and smell as room temperature butter. It is moisturizing but it doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin since it makes me break out. Plus, it made me feel like I was smearing butter all over my face, which turned me off to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this at night, and it is just great.  Lightweight, slight vanilla smell which goes away.  Works wonders.  I am 52 and have been told I look like I am in my early 40&#x27;s....which I attribute to this cream.  I also use the  other lotion which has SPF in it under my makeup during the day, so I have full CoQ10 coverage.  Strongly recommend!!</li>
    <li> We can no longer find the Eucerin anti-wrinkle cream locally, but enjoy it so much that I pay the postage to get it via Amazon!  We also love that it smells like butter when you apply it, but you never notice that again -- kind of fun!</li>
    <li> I have been using  Q10 Eucerin anti wrinkle cream for almost over a year. I am in my early thirties and switched to an anti wrinkle cream as a preventative measure. I was looking for something that was good and affordable at the same time. I have extremely dry skin and go through the jar pretty quicklIy - I use it both before bed and as a day cream. I love this cream as it moisturizes my skin really well and I wake up with such a soft face. However, I do believe that it may not be well suited for people with oily or combination skin. I have also recently become sensitive to perfumed lotions so I love that this is fragrance free. I haven&#x27;t seen it any stores and order it from amazon. In short if you have dry skin like mine, and use a lot of cream this is the awesome! I am quite grumpy when I run out so I always try to order in advance.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom &amp; she loves it.  She says she loves it cause it&#x27;s not greasy, heavy, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you gotta reapply it either.  I personally use the redness relief for myself since I have rosacea.  I&#x27;m pleased with Eucerin&#x27;s creams so far.  I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s also slightly cheaper on here than in the store.</li>
    <li> I suffer from many skin allergies with creams that contain perfume and/or have any kind of sunscreen.  All creams except for this one will cause symptoms like breaking out, rashes, severe dryness associated   with itching with them. Since I have been using the Q10 for years now and my skin always feels so fresh   and well nurtured. I absolutely love it!!!!!  Believe me, I have been spending so much money on expensive creams, creams that proclaim to be just for  sensitive skin, and creams that claims to be dermatologically tested, yet the only one that I do not have  any skin problems with is this Eucerin Q10.</li>
    <li> This facial moisturizer is one of the very few that I have tried that I like. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, or a acid like serum texture. It is thin and light yellow almost like butter. It doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply. It starts working right away and absorbs fast. I can basically put a whole lot onto my skin especially problem areas, and I really don&#x27;t look greasy. After years of using this product the fine lines and wrinkles have stopped appearing. I get some many people telling me I have great skin. I hear that I look young, and good for my age. This is great for a guy and I am glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Q10 is the only face cream I use.  I like that it makes my skin feel soft and moist without the fragrances in most lotions that make my eyes water</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old &amp; was looking for a cream for my face. Now that I am 40+ I understand the true need for something to moisturize my skin, especially around the eyes. My problem has always been creams that were too oily, created the white bumps under my eyes, caused itching &amp; redness, or simply didn&#x27;t do the job. This is the first cream that feels so good on my skin. I use it 2 times a day (AM before makeup application &amp; PM before bed). It it not a miracle worker, so if you are expecting \\&quot;plastic surgery\\&quot; like results then forget it, but it is the best cream out there that I have tried (although I steer clear of creams costing anything more than $20). There has been mention on other reviews I have seen regarding the cream having an unpleasant smell, but if you want a fragrance-free product you can&#x27;t expect a \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; result. It smells benign to me. The best thing is that it feels so light, does not leave an oily residue on my Bare Minerals brushes when applying makeup, &amp; my skin looks smooother. Great stuff!    I purchased mine at Ulta since that was the only local store which I found this cream ($10.99 + tax, but you can usually find a coupon for this store).  I see that the price is just as good, if not slightly cheaper,on Amazon when you buy the \\&quot;2 for\\&quot; option so I will definitely consider that for my next purchase (I skipped this option the first time I bought it since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would end up liking it).</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cream forever and I love it!  Several years ago they stopped selling this particular one in stores so I have been ordering it online.  I think it&#x27;s for the better because the prices on Amazon are awesome!</li>
    <li> I used this all over my face before bed and woke up to redness and inflammation all around my eyes.  I called Eucerin and they said this product is not \\&quot;opthamologist tested\\&quot;.  Well, I don&#x27;t see why it is for sensitive skin and also DERMATOLOGIST RECOMMENDED if you shouldn&#x27;t use it anywhere near the fine lines around your eyes--the reason many of us buy wrinkle creams.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I have used it for over 2 years and it keeps my face soft like nothing else.  I have sensitive skin and it never bothers it.  The automatic shipments make this an even better price!</li>
    <li> if you buy with eSource Wellness never regret I love their customer service everything they sell is good and cheap, I love the technical support for client were always given me any problems and if ahy they resolve without any inconvenience</li>
    <li> Eucerin Q10 is great for my ultra sensitive skin and helps to keep my face looking young.  I have been using it consistently for several months now and have not developed a sensitivity to it!  A big achievement for me and my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and with it being winter, it has gotten drier.  I also recently moved to a home that has well water, which has further impacted my skin (dry, red patches).  For years, I used Clinique 3-step with good results, but I was looking to save money.  After a few false starts with drugstore products, I stumbled on this cream and decided to give it a try.  It is wonderful! It is thick but absorbs quickly.  Absolutely fragrance-free.  The redness is gone and it just feels that my skin has calmed down.  Now that I am in my 30&#x27;s, the anti-wrinkle aspect is great, too.  When summer comes, I may switch to the lotion version if this is too thick.  Meanwhile, I love this and love the fact that it is available on Amazon prime!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, very sensitive skin. This is the only product I have found that works well for me. It is truly fragrance free. I have rosacea and I am allergic to fragrance. So many cremes that say they do not contain any fragrance have essential oils or other products with strong scents that I react to. This product doesn&#x27;t have anything that I react to at all. A miracle! And as a bonus it doesn&#x27;t smell icky either. A lot of fragrance-free products have an unpleasant non-smell to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin also makes a formula for redness in your skin. I thought this would be good for the rosecea. It is NOT. This Q10 formula is the BEST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and creamy. If you have oily skin at all this is not the right product for you. For those with dry skin or who need additional moisture at night this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was horrified when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer. Thank goodness I can still get it here!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;The above review was written for this product on a page that would not let me update. It must have been the single jar section before I signed up for the double order....anyway here is my update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 years and I still use this product daily. I have never had any allergic reactions to this creme. That may not sound like much but for me it really is. Over time I have had reactions to quite a few products that are advertised for people with sensitive skin. Some have even taken a few months before I to react to them. This creme is still the best thing I have found for really dry, really sensitive skin. Even on my worst day when everything feels hurtful to my skin this creme does not. I rarely wear make up any longer, never wear mascara, can only find one or two products I can use on my lips. I can&#x27;t imagine what I will do if they ever stop making this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick. If your skin is mildly dry then perhaps it would be best for a night creme only. I use it day and night but my skin is really very dry. I have used products that cost 6 times as much that didn&#x27;t do what this one does for me. Even the most expensive sensitive skin creams do not work as well as this one. ...for me. As for the creme&#x27;s anti-wrinkle properties, I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems with wrinkles. I am not sure if it is genetics or using this creme for 2 years or both. Either way I&#x27;m not complaining. ;-)</li>
    <li> Ive tried everything out there for dry skin. this works! not expensive so I dont have to skimp.. i apply it 2 times a day.. sometimes 3.. and my dry sundamaged skin  looks supple and  smooth.</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviewers of this cream on here, I also have super sensitive dry skin &amp; Rosacea. Thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl based on such good reviews &amp; I can&#x27;t fathom what people see in this cream. It is SO thick, greasy, &amp; clumpy with the consistency of \\&quot;butter\\&quot; (even looks &amp; kind of smells like it). It does work for super dry skin if you enjoy your face feeling like you have rubbed Vaseline all over it &amp; having your face stick to your pillow at night..YUK..My Dermatologist recommended CeraVe cream to me which is also quite heavy but nowhere near as bad as this cream. I&#x27;ve used a few other Eucerin products &amp; they were all like this. Guess I should have known better. I really disliked like product.**Just a little update here**-I&#x27;ve read some people use this as a hand cream (I guess due to it being quite thick) so I gave that a whirl &amp; it does work great for dry/cracked hands &amp; I now use it for this only, just wanted to add something positive!</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry skin and this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. It is pretty thick and particularly good for nighttime but I actually use it in the day as well. It is slightly greasy but not really noticeable. Most importantly it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried. Oh and guys, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like anything so don&#x27;t worry about walking around smelling like roses or an old lady. I don&#x27;t really know if it does anything for wrinkles but that&#x27;s mainly because I just got it for moisturizing so I never paid much attention. Also I have very sensitive skin and have had no reaction at all.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Q-10 is a 5 star plus in my opinion. I have been using it for 4 to 5 yrs on my face and neck. Even my crows feet around my eyes have disappeared. I used to be a smoker, so my lines around my mouth are visable. It has helped diminish most of my surface wrinkles. It is the best for the money. In the summer I use the lotion with SPF15 in the AM and then the Q-10 at bedtime. My neighbor is 74 yrs. old and she started using it and she looks 10 yrs. younger after only 3 yrs. of use. Thank you Eucerin and Amazon for having it available to buy.    Marie</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for about 6 months, and I have noticed a big difference. I am always a bit skeptical of reviews for creams and items of a similar (subjective) nature, but I have no doubt that consistent use has really lessened the wrinkles around my eyes. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Though the texture is a little bit sticky and it is absorbed quite slow, it make my skin feel softer!   I can&#x27;t tell the result for anti-Wrinkle yet since I just start using it, but with this price ($11), it&#x27;s a good cream to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product because I wanted to work on my under the eye wrinkle lines. Although I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, it works good as a moisturizer. I used to use Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Difference and this product is way better and half the price. I would continue using this product, hopefully it will work longterm on my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream for sensitive skin.  I have trouble finding face cream that doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  This is wonderful cream.  I use other eucerin lotions so expected good things from this cream as well.  It is yellow in color as other reviews have stated and also a buttery smell.  I find it pleasant and it is not an overpowering smell. So far I&#x27;m pleased with the cream and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and breaks out easily. I&#x27;ve been using this cream every night for about for a month. It doesn&#x27;t make my face shinier in the morning, instead it makes my skin on my face and neck plumper &amp; firmer.</li>
    <li> Many buy expensive creams ..they think because it is expensive it must be better..it always the opposite  ..just marketing.. this is the BEST PRODUCT I EVER USED.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a month ago for my fine lines,  I st ill have fine lines maybe a little softer.The cream  is very heavy and does not smooth well with make up.  Good for a night cream only as I have dry skin and it  is still too heavy for daytime usage</li>
    <li> I have many skin allergies and I can seldom use skin products, especially those available over the counter. This product is great and never bothers my face. I have used it for several years with no bad results. I finally have a product I can use without fear of a break out.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin plus I live in a dry climate. I&#x27;ve worked in cosmetics for 13 years and have always had to buy expensive creams, until I discovered Eucerin anti wrinkle. I exfoliate and put this on pre makeup and it hydrates me as well as some of the pricey creams. I don&#x27;t know how strong or effective the anti aging benefit is, but as far as hydration. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really likeing the eucerin face cream. I&#x27;ve tried many different creams and washes and they all make my face have a rash or burning. This is great for me I also use the eucerin face wash for sensitive skin I still have a little problems with acne but it&#x27;s not mixed with a rash (so that&#x27;s better)cause this stuff is not harsh at all on my face. Will stick with this for a while longer ,best I&#x27;ve found yet that I can afford. Would recomend for sensitive skin. Not sure about temples I don&#x27;t have much yet but sure it&#x27;s better than nothing. My face does feel good most of the time though.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea so it is very difficult for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t make my skin burn &amp; turn red...this product has been great so far!</li>
    <li> This face cream is apparently from the same manufacturer that markets the Nivea Visage line of face creams. For some reason, Nivea is no longer available in the USA. I bought the Eucerin cream to to replace the Nivea Anti-Wrinkle/Toning cream that is no longer available. It doesn&#x27;t even come close. Nivea was smooth and packed with moisturizers. The Eucerin is more pasty (not creamy) in texture and comes in a less than attractive yellow color. It does not moisturize as well. Why Nivea is gone and this is still here is puzzling.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had previously used this, and it was good for my sensitive skin, not oily, not clogging the pores, and best of all, it has Q10 which I like. Thank you Amazon for bring a great price on great products!!!</li>
    <li> Good product and well priced.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all! No scent. Thank God. Goes on easily and absorbs just as easily. Last long, too. good night cream. Or day. But I used at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream based on the excellent reviews. The price was right, and I was looking for a replacement for a q10 face cream I liked that was discontinued.  Since I started using this cream, my acne breakouts have stopped completely. At first, I did not see any effect on my wrinkles, but after a few weeks of consistently using the product day and night, I saw an improvement. This product works well for the dreaded \\&quot;tear trough\\&quot; wrinkles under the eyes. Just slather this product there after using an eye cream. Do this consistently and the results are great. The cream also moisturizes the skin well and brings about a clear, glowing complexion. The only drawback I can think of is that it does have the appearance, consistency, and smell of butter (but it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and it&#x27;s great for the skin). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This cream does not break me out.  I have very sensitive fair and over 50 year old skin!  It was recommended by a dermatologist in a book.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  It&#x27;s the only creme I would use on my face. I&#x27;ve tried other products on my face but nothing comes close to Eucerin Q10!</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this--creamy and rich, but not greasy. It feels expensive, and there is no fragrance--and no gluish smell like some &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; products have. I think good skin is about being consistent and minimal, and this makes it easy to be both.</li>
    <li> It is a nice moisturizing cream. As far wrinkles are concerned I don&#x27; t think there is any wrinkle cream that works as my husband say ( not as a his dandy but as a Doctor).</li>
    <li> I have been buying this cream for years now.&lt;br /&gt;Out of curiosity I try to find something to substitute it but fail time after time.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell (yes it is buttery - but I do love butter :), consistency is thick and luxurious, keeps my skin moisturized all night long.&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of compliments on my skin and questions on products I use. Answer - Murad for day, Eucerin for night - nothing else.</li>
    <li> This creme is priced well, very hydrating, is not perfumey, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It won&#x27;t make old wrinkles disappear, but since it&#x27;s so hydrating I do notice my wrinkles stand out a lot more when I don&#x27;t use it. Whether or not it prevents new wrinkles, I don&#x27;t know; but, I do get told frequently I look much younger than I am. As a side note, I think it feels very nice and refreshing on the skin.</li>
    <li> good product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream. I actually noticed that the wrinkles around my neck diminished but you do need to use it every morning and night, religiously for a few months to see a difference. Just stay consistent.</li>
    <li> Compares very well to high end lotions. I used to use a Peter Thomas Roth mega rich lotion that is no longer made. I bought this to use until I found a comparable product to the PTR. I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin  q10 for a month now and am no longer  looking for another product.</li>
    <li> USED IT FOR A LONG TIME.  LIKE THE BENEFITS, MY SKIN IS DRY!</li>
    <li> I had to return the product because I found out my dermatologist gave me medicine that reacted negatively with it. I didn&#x27;t have any bad experiences with customer service and the return was handled excellently.</li>
    <li> too early to tell much about this product, but i just wanted to say i LOVE how it feels on my skin. its not gooey, or sticky, greasy. its very silky. let you know more when i know more!!</li>
    <li> Very nice and creamy, but after about 5 days of use my skin became itchy, will have to give it a rest and try again</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so Eucerin is right for me.  The price is right at amazon, and thank you for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she loves it. Only has to use  small amount to get the job done. What job that is I&#x27;m not sure but it makes her happy.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive allergy skin that tends to be dry.  I use this cream as an all over moisturizer after I wash my face.  It keeps my skin smooth and not dry without making it oily.  I have never broken out from it.  As for the anti-wrinkle part, I have no clue.  I am 34 and have the typical wrinkles for my age.  Who knows if you can really prevent that!  It does not have a strong smell and I can use it close to my eyes without irritating them.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use everyday under my foundation makeup.  It certainly reduces the wrinkles, even after you soap your face and view it without creams, lotions or makeup.</li>
    <li> For dry skin, this is great cream!  I use it both morning and night and it is easy to apply makeup over it.  It isn&#x27;t as available in my local drugstore anymore, so I am glad Amazon stocks it, and at a reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as any of the higher orice moistrurizers I&#x27;ve used. It is a bit heavy, so I just use it at night, with a lighter one for AM.</li>
    <li> Works well to help heal rosacea on dry and oily skin. Not sure if helps with wrinkles though. Who has time to worry about that?!</li>
    <li> Eucerin is the cream I like the best.  It doesn&#x27;t smell; it isn&#x27;t greasy; I don&#x27;t get a rash from it.  It works well for super dry skin.  It&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to find, so I was pleased Amazon carried it.</li>
    <li> Abolutely the best product for sensitive skin.  I use it on my entire face at night and around my eyes in the daytime.</li>
    <li> i have oily and acne prone skin. this is the only moisturizer that doesnt make me break out. i hope eucerin never stops making this!</li>
    <li> Nivea makes classy products, despite their lack of slick marketing.  This is the one face cream that I can rub over my eyes without a sting, and besides it truly makes a difference.  I use it daily, and if I forget it when I travel, I go buy it!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years.  Works well with my skin and keeps it moisturized.  Use as both day and night moisturizer, as I live in a very dry climate with low humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they  had an eye cream!</li>
    <li> I love it. This is my favorite creme. Going to buy day line with SPF. Read the reviews for far they are good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It disappears right away, leaves even your lips and&lt;br /&gt;nose membranes soft.  People have asked me, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re HOW old?  But where are  your wrinkles?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I just like it because it feels good on my skin -- use it on your cuticles also --  it really helps&lt;br /&gt; prevent those awful hangnails.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years and I still love it. Would recommend it - great product and great value.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and chemical sensitive.  This product is wonderful for the face and around the eyes!  I highly recommend it!  My Determologist recommend this brand and she was accurate on how effective it is.</li>
    <li> very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very goodI love this powder!! I agree it smells heavenly, a subtle floral without being overbearing. Baby Bee (I love the name, it&#x27;s so cute) goes with any fragrance I want to wear or is just delightful all by itself. It&#x27;s nicely absorbant and because it doesn&#x27;t have talc it doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes. I use it all day when I want to feel a little lift because it just smells so good. It&#x27;s nice to use at bedtime, too. Although I don&#x27;t have a baby, I can&#x27;t imagine a nicer powder to use on a little one. I think a basket of Baby Bee things would be the loveliest baby shower gift. I also like that it comes in a shaker container so I can take it with me as well as put it in a powder jar. The best puff to use is the big fluffy lambswool puff made by Caswell Massey that I got on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for over 11 years. Have tried many others but this is 100%. It is rice and creamy..no harsh perfume..leaves my sking feel well mosturized with that greasy feeling. Can&#x27;t find it in the stores around here any more..Thank goodness it&#x27;s still online. I buy several jars at a time just in case it dissapears altogether. SIGH don&#x27;t know what I would do then.  Great product..  lew</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this 1-2 times daily for over a month or so with no noticeable change in my wrinkles, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as other moisturizers tend to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading all the great review for sensitive skin- but this product made my skin itchy and reddish pumpy.. I had to throw it away after 1-2 use. It still has pretty strong smell for sensitive cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eucerin Q10 Skin Creme for perhaps 10 years. It has an excellent texture,is very effective against wrinkles, is quickly absorbed, is hypo allergenic and very inexpensive.I have given up all expensive skin products in favor of Eucerin Q10. Because it is no longer available in local stores, I was on an automatic program with Amazon,(2 jars every three months) and always ended up with more than I could use. I often gave the extras away to friends and family and thereby converted them to be Eucerin devotees. I recently moved to a new address and when the programmed package of 2 jars arrived at my old address it seems as though the new owners opened it and decided to keep the jars of Eucerin Q10. I can only hope that they enjoyed the product as much as I, my friends and family do.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding for sensative skin, I love it I&#x27;m 36 yrs old and wrinkles are very important for me to avoid as much as I can.</li>
    <li> I use this under my eyes and its works better than most eye cream yet its great for the whole face.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensive skin.  Sometimes hard to find in stores.  Does not irritate sensitive skin, can be worn over Retin A or similar products.  Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but after a couple of weeks, I really started noticing an improvement in my sun damaged over-50 skin!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very nice cream, and does just as well as face creams that are much more expensive.  it makes me cringe to think of all the money i have wasted in the past!</li>
    <li> This night cream equals or exceeds others(In performance, texture, comfort) I&#x27;ve purchased From department stores that cost five times more.</li>
    <li> It is good for my skin with less winkles.  I use this products for many years, and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> ****UPDATE*****04/18/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received two more boxes and it seems like they changed the formula. The very faint smell of vanilla icing/frosting is gone and the product feels a tiny bit different. I still like it, but think I prefer the old formula better. I am definitely not one for fragrance, yet the slight smell before was relaxing at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the lotion during the day, and the creme at night. Fantastic products that are fairly priced! My skin is sensitive and still prone to breakouts (in my 40s!). This is the only product I have found that works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Plus, the creme smells faintly of cake icing.</li>
    <li> Just a skin cream, didn&#x27;t do anything for the wrinkles. Maybe my wrinkles are resistant, but in any case, I ended up giving the cream (I ordered two) to an acquaintance. I see her occasionally, and her wrinkles haven&#x27;t changed much either. Maybe wrinkles require high power products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elinor</li>
    <li> First off, I do have slightly oily skin, so people with normal or dry skin would probably have a better time with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this pretty cheap, so for the price I can&#x27;t complain much. I wanted to try it and now I have, and for me at least, it was just &#x27;okay&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I found the cream a little too thick, and it felt a little greasy after use. It was okay for using at night, but I want a cream I can use before I put my makeup on too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will say that it is indeed good for sensitive skin. I never experienced any redness or itchiness like with some products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but have been having difficulty finding it in the stores, always seem to be out.  I have used much more expensive products that do not seem to be any better.  I do not like the perfume products (which are much more expensive) so this is perfect for me.  The lotion is OK but this is much better and the price is reasonable so you can use it on face and neck twice a day.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers thought this cream was too heavy. I use it as a night cream (my day cream needs to have an SPF), and I found the texture to be perfect. There&#x27;s no scent, which was my husband&#x27;s complaint with my previous night cream, and it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now, and my skin looks and feels soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> very good product, and the estimated transfer passed off without inconvenience. fully recommend buying through this company, very responsible ..</li>
    <li> When I was going through breast cancer treatment, my skin changed dramatically - it looked like I had aged years and years (I&#x27;m in my forties).  I took a chance on this product (love that it&#x27;s for sensitive skin and fragrance free - so hard to find in products!!) and absolutely love it - my skin plumped up, became smoother, lost a lot of the deeper lines and definitely made the smaller lines less noticeable.  I find that it&#x27;s slightly too heavy for me during the summer (I use it at night) but then I just switch to the lotion instead ;)  When I stopped using it once, my skin went right back to where it was before - dry, deeper lines, etc. etc., just nasty.  I love this product and always stock up.  Great price!!</li>
    <li> After trying other creams for my face I found this one.It works nicely on  my dry and sensitive skin, love it</li>
    <li> Used for about 2 months.  Did seem to help soften the wrinkles that I had started to notice.  Product absorbs quite well and isn&#x27;t overly greasy although consistency is rather thick.  I have acne prone skin and dry skin areas and while it did not aggravate my acne it didn&#x27;t really help the dry areas either (surprising considering the consistency).  I hate strong perfume-y night cream on my face when I&#x27;m trying to sleep (which is one of the reasons I don&#x27;t care for olay products) and this product could pass exactly for a tub of margarine or butter for color, smell, and texture.  It was better than perfume but I didn&#x27;t exactly love it, either.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me, and I have used this product now for five years.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!  I am pretty vain, so I use this in addition to prescription retinoids from the dermatologist to reduce the signs of aging.  This product is ideal for those with sensitive skin - even Aveeno can have scents that cause irritation.      I want to liberally apply a cream at night, and I find that the $45 night creams are so pricey that I use them sparingly.  At this price I can use enough for my face and neck and be generous with the application.  As other reviewers have commented, it is butter colored and has a thicker consistency than some creams - many other brands are lighter, with a more whipped feel, so if that is important to you, consider that in your purchase.</li>
    <li> I used this as replacement for the redness relief cream.  I still cannot tell the difference between this product and redness relief cream.  Anyway, I used this product primarily for preventing eczema breakout on the cheeks, when Amazon did not have redness relief cream.  It worked just as well as the redness relief cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple months ago from Fred Meyers as a night cream (Olay Sensitive Skin SPF30 during the day, and I try to stay out of the sun for extended periods of time), and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it doesn&#x27;t have a weird consistency (it&#x27;s a bit like butter in colour and consistency, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a tint and it absorbs in the skin as you massage it in), and it doesn&#x27;t give me acne. My mother thought it a little weird that I&#x27;m using it because I&#x27;m only 20, but I believe that it&#x27;s important to start taking care of skin and body at a young age with a proper beauty/wellness regime, clean diet, and regular exercise. I would recommend trying this for a month or two to people with sensitive skin like myself because overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this Face Cream! I use it every night.. I never believe all the silly claims made about creams to make &amp;#34; wrinkles  go away..That is not going to happen with any face cream no matter the expensive price..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just a really good good Face Cream.. I have very pale delicate skin, this cream applied each night before bedtime, keeps my 75 year old skin really soft and keeps the dry tight feeling away..I really do feel that it truly helps smooth the skin so wrinkles are not as noticeable!&lt;br /&gt; also the price is really great..</li>
    <li> A good product good value.  It works as well as some of the really high priced department store brands.  I would recomend this for night time and day time use.</li>
    <li> Another great  Eucerin skin care product.  This is a light facial cream but yet very effective.  Makes your face look and feel good and lessens the look of aging and wrinkles.  As well, it is not oily.  I especially like using this on a daily basis during the spring, summer and fall.  The fragrance of this cream is negligible so won&#x27;t effect sensitive sinuses.  A must-have product in my supply of skin care necessities.  Unfortunately it is not available in Canada.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eucerin Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Creme  for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results of this creme.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is also a customer of Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy D.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sister. She asked me and she is very happy with this product. And you can buy two for the price of one product. Nice. Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures, I recommend it to all</li>
    <li> [UPDATE] It looks like Eucerin has changed the formula of this cream, and it no longer contains parabens. Thank you, Eucerin! I will try it again and re-review it. My previous review is for informational purposes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use this cream, and I looooved it. It smells nice, and glides onto your face like frosting. Your skin feels luxurious afterwards. Then, I read an article about the potential dangers of parabens in skin cream and checked the label. Low and behold, I was very sad to see that Eucerin Q10 Anti-wrinkle cream contains lots of parabens. While we don&#x27;t know for sure that parabens are bad for us, it sounds like a pretty good bet. Like BPA, parabens mimic estrogen and may lead to breast cancer, premature puberty in girls, and studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UVB leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage. I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s more a combination of skin creams, BPA, birth control, deodorant, and all the other chemicals we&#x27;re exposed to on a daily basis that may be correlated to breast cancer, but why risk it. There are lots of other paraben free options, and Eucerin should really figure out a recipe for this cream that uses less controversial ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full ingredients list from the Eucerin website: Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Stearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Tocopheryl Acetate, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Ubiquinone, Tridecyl Stearate, Tridecyl Trimelitate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Biotin, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil (Corn), Beta-Carotene, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/Hexacaprate, Carbomer, Titanium Dioxide, Alumina, Silica, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate).</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple years now. Love the product. Even used it as a cleansing cream when I ran out of the product I usually use for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local store that used to sell it does not seem to carry it anymore and it doe not sell at most stores anymore. I don&#x27;t know why but I am very happy to find it on Amazon especially at the price this seller is offering it for.</li>
    <li> I am always confident when buying Eucerin products.  Any good dermatologist I have ever visited has recommended this brand.  As for this product&#x27;s anti-wrinkle ability, it would be hard for me to judge since I am fortunate to come from a family which has had few problems with wrinkles at any age.  The few areas where I have noticed wrinkling (such as just above my upper lip), the skin has become somewhat smoother.  My biggest plus, however, goes to this cream&#x27;s ability to provide a good moisturizer without causing oiliness.  It absorbs quickly and does it job well.  I have bought several jars of the product and plan to continue using it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is one face cream that I&#x27;m not allergic to.  No scent.  Nice and creamy. Not oily.  Just right!  I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cashier at Rite aid, and this guy came to my check stand and bought 2 of the Eucerin Q10 cremes. I asked him if it worked well, and his answer was pretty much \\&quot;it&#x27;s amazing and only rite aid sells it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;So since it was buy one get the second one 50 % off I decided to get the Q10 and the night creme.&lt;br /&gt;I get very dry skin, def when the whether is cold. It gets peely and red and it&#x27;s awful to deal with. Also, I tend to break out with this whether. I opened the container and I was happy that is was truly fragrance free (my skin will break out with fragrances). The yellow color is from all the natural ingredients, it&#x27;s not bad at all. It&#x27;s a thicker cream, but when I apply it in the morning I can put make up over it and work all day and everything is good! My dry, red skin is gone too. This creme is amazing. :)</li>
    <li> I have used this as my night cream for years now and have been happy with it.  I have sensitive, dry skin and I am 57.</li>
    <li> I have been using this crème for about 4 weeks and I really haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference! I hope to see better results in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for some time now. This is perfect for winter skin as it has a nice rich texture. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I wish it had sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This cream soaks in immediately and leaves no sticky or gummy residue.  I break out quite easily and this cream has been great for my skin.  I was feeling a bit depressed about my skin at 60 because I was breaking out. . .with this cream my skin is much better.  GREAT CREAM!!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I am over 70 years old, but many things irritate my skin or even make it break out.  This comfortable cream absorbs right in.  It feels good.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t see much difference in things like lip lines, but not much affects that.  In the winter time I can feel my skin dehydrating, and this stops the dehydration.</li>
    <li> Finally found a moisturizer that is creamy enough for my extremely dry and sensitive skin. Does not feel oily at all. Perfect for dry weather in the winter.</li>
    <li> Strangers say I look less than 50 years old...but I&#x27;m actually near 70 and in the Airizona sun.  Product works for me &amp; I love it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for sensitive and dry skin.but i can&#x27;t see any improvements after using up 3 jars.it doesn&#x27;t reduce my wrinkle.and i have to aply a lot on skin during winter time.</li>
    <li> I am a 60-yr. old woman, just looking for something to keep my face and neck soft.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really an anti-aging or anti-wrinkle cream, just a very effective moisturizer.  Some reviewers have complained about the texture, but I use just a small amount, and it&#x27;s very easy to rub in.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now, and probably will for the foreseeable future.  A BIG improvement (for me, anyway) over any Oil of Olay products, though this is probably more highly priced.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me as a nighttime cream.  My face felt dry and kind of scaly when I woke up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t like cosmetics much... a bottle of cologne could conceivably out live me! My face is very sensitive to even regular daily washing. To some, this product may seem a bit pricy but all it takes is a small dab to cover my face. I have tried many other products but this is by far the best... rich and creamy, not greasy, that absorbs into the skin quicly and easily. I purchased 2 jars in July 2012 and still have half of the second jar left.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream to use before bedtime which softens your skin and fades away wrinkles.  A lot better than many expensive creams sold by cosmetic companies.  Eucerin is a very reliable brand, as far as I have been able to prove.</li>
    <li> Just like the lotion, I use this cream every night, the price is right and the product excellent, I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I live in the heat from Arizona and have so sensitive skin BUT NOW I did try this cream , well the first hour was fine and I did think go and order more but when it did start burning like fire with my sensitive skin , I guess I will not more order this cream for me ...:-) so lets search more for sensitive skin until I will find the right one ... I did use Dr. Grandel timeless and it is heaven ... but sadly not cheap ....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  I have sensitive skin.  I love it.  It&#x27;s convenient to order it as I sometimes have trouble finding it in the stores.</li>
    <li> This cream feels great on the skin.  I am not expecting any miracles, but it feels great.  The price is right too!</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer, under makeup, I also use Olay regerist serum, underneath the cream. It works well, and has SPF too.</li>
    <li> It really softens out the skin. Makes it silky and very soft.  perfect for wearing under makeup!,  i love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It moisturizes my skin but is not too heavy or greasy.</li>
