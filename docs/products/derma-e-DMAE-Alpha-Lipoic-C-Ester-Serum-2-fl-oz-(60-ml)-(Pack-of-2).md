      <li>I&#x27;m glad I risked an economical 2-pack to try this product.</li>
      <li>It is a light firming cream with not harmful</li>
      <li>It does not smell loud and it is so nice to have something fragrance free. :)</li>
      <li>I have used this serum for the past year and it has made a wonderful difference in my skin......noticeably visible to friends and family in just a month.</li>
      <li>It seemed ok  but didnt really notice any huge change or anything...</li>
      <li>So far, I love it!</li>
      <li>I was just hoping it would help the lines around my mouth and eyes more, but I really don&#x27;t believe in miracle products anyway, and will continue to use this.</li>
      <li>I use it after my shower and before bed, and I think it really helps make my skin look more youthful.</li>
      <li>Great for healing, and fast acting.  </li>
      <li>My crow&#x27;s feet seem better, but my main concern is the frown lines around my mouth.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m not usually the one that goes out and buys the latest wrinkle cream.</li>
      <li>This light weight silky serum goes on easily and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>If he uses it with real patients in his practice, then it&#x27;s good enough for me to give it a</li>
      <li>Was excited to get this face cream, but was very dissappointed when I tried it.</li>
      <li>It is light, has a lovely scent, makes my oily, sensitive skin feel very soft and nourished.  </li>
      <li>I only buy what has been proven by science to be effective and backed up by case-studies on real people.</li>
      <li>my skin is sensitive to anti-aging products and i wanted to see how the alpha lipoic would work on the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>sure you guys are wondering by now if it actually works.</li>
      <li>First off may I say I am a liscensed Aestitician.</li>
      <li>this product is not expensive.  </li>
      <li>Especially for a serum wich is more concentrated.</li>
      <li>All this instantly makes me love them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>2 bottles came for the price &amp; it was less than the price of 1 bottle elsewhere!This feels light &amp; nice &amp; I can wear under my makeup without adding any heavyness or oily feeling - plus it really has helped some of my finer line wrinkles, can&#x27;t tell much difference on the heavier wrinkles but didn&#x27;t expect to really.</li>
      <li>Maybe in the long run I will see more results.</li>
      <li>Tried several other brands, but believe this helps with firming better than the others -- and at a more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>But certainly whatever I&#x27;m doing is working.</li>
      <li>I will certainly be repurchasing.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say for certain.</li>
      <li>But certainly whatever I&#x27;m doing is working.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Used this product as directed and really didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
      <li>Their skin is much smoother they say.</li>
      <li>I plan to keep buying this serum as long as they make it (which I hope is at least 30 more years). :-)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is not irritating to sensitive skin and it has gone miles in helping assuage the ravages of sun exposure.</li>
      <li>My skin looks brighter and my pores are more refined after just a few days use.</li>

    <li> This light weight silky serum goes on easily and is not heavy or greasy. After using it for a few weeks I feel like my skin is smoother.  It has a very light scent which is not overwhelming.  Best of all I can apply it and put a moisturizer over it and not feel like I have product caked on my skin.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Ran into a friend a couple of months ago who looked great and she told me she was using derma e DMAE products, so I ordered the eye cream, Alpha Lipoic C-Ester Serum, the Day Creme and the Night Creme and I love the way my skin looks and feels.  The cost also fits into my budget.  You don&#x27;t have to pay hundreds of dollars for great products. Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be pretty good, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I use this daily to keep my skin moist and soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 3 weeks and I have seen an improvement in my skin. I have dark spots and blemishes and this serum has help me to tone and evenout my skin. I will definetely will continue using it to keep the great results.</li>
    <li> This cream is light and silky. It feels very good on the skin. My skin feels a little tighter after using it and there is no irritation or breakout. I have already ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> Helps give face a lift and gives it a glow</li>
    <li> Amazing, it arrived on time. 18$ for the two bottles is simply a steal, and this is great stuff, I&#x27;m sold! I will certainly be repurchasing.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every fancy/expensive skin care line out there.... this line and this product is my mainstay and can&#x27;t live without it.  Never have a problem and it does a good job and must make a difference as folks ask me what I use as I am OLD!  But, skin still is about 15 years behind my true age... so this serum and the eye cream that I use twice day must be doing a good job!  (Very sensitive, fair skin that reacts to strong chemicals and perfumes/soaps/etc.  This line eye cream is the only one I have found I can wear at night... and not wake up with puffy/allergic eyes... yes, the price fluctuates, but look at how expensive all the other skin care products are!!)</li>
    <li> Used this product as directed and really didn&#x27;t see a difference. It was cheaper than other products with the DMAE in it so maybe you get what you pay for but really couldn&#x27;t see where my skin was any softer nor less wrinkled.</li>
    <li> Good product, I like the fact that it is natural and this brand is a good one. It is not irritating to sensitive skin and it has gone miles in helping assuage the ravages of sun exposure.</li>
    <li> I use the firming serum twice a day before I put my moisturiser on.  It is a light firming cream with not harmful&lt;br /&gt;ingredients in it.  I really like it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> My wife and mother is law both use it. It is a great product. Price vs. value is excellent. Their skin is much smoother they say. Will continue buying from here.</li>
    <li> My skin is tighter , smoother, smaller pores and brighter. I am so much younger looking. I am overjoyed. I will buy some more. It does not smell loud and it is so nice to have something fragrance free. :)</li>
    <li> I was buying this at my local farmers market, and they charge about $20 per bottle of it.  Which is fairly pricey.  Though even with daily applications they last quite a while, so that&#x27;s not too bad.  I was getting fine wrinkles around my eyes.  I find even using this less than the recommended twice daily, after daily use for 45 days, I saw a dramatic decrease in fine lines around my eyes.  As long as I use this on a semi-regular basis, the wrinkles are kept at bay.</li>
    <li> It seemed ok  but didnt really notice any huge change or anything...I got the yellow ones...used them both up already not an earthshaking result...</li>
    <li> Tried several other brands, but believe this helps with firming better than the others -- and at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Not sure this works well for the wrinkles and fine lines, but have only been using it for about a month now.  It feels ok going on, not oily, mosturizers well enough I guess.  Feels almost dry after I put it on, but just think I was used to the moisturizing cream I used to use, which was a little oily. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which is good.  I was just hoping it would help the lines around my mouth and eyes more, but I really don&#x27;t believe in miracle products anyway, and will continue to use this. Maybe in the long run I will see more results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I risked an economical 2-pack to try this product. It&#x27;s been less than a week and my skin feels smoother and firmer and my pores are smaller. It smells fine, spreads easily, and two pumps of lotion cover my face and neck. Now I&#x27;m going to buy derma e&#x27;s body lotion with DMAE, so the rest of my skin can look and feel this good.</li>
    <li> I have used many derma-e products, and love them all, but this may be the best yet. It rates well as a non-toxic cosmetic, is reasonably priced, smells great, and seems to work wonders for the softness and tone of my skin. A little goes a long way. This is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I just bought it and have only used it about three times and I can already see a difference in the color of my skin.  I also have rosacea and it took the redness away virtually overnight.  I don&#x27;t if it will keep it up, but if it does I&#x27;ll continue to buy this as long as I can.  So far, I love it!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful serum/moisturizer.  Has saved my acne prone skin and improved the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  It is light, has a lovely scent, makes my oily, sensitive skin feel very soft and nourished.  I love that I can order it via Amazon and get two day shipping through Prime.</li>
    <li> Good buy! 2 bottles came for the price &amp; it was less than the price of 1 bottle elsewhere!This feels light &amp; nice &amp; I can wear under my makeup without adding any heavyness or oily feeling - plus it really has helped some of my finer line wrinkles, can&#x27;t tell much difference on the heavier wrinkles but didn&#x27;t expect to really.</li>
    <li> First off may I say I am a liscensed Aestitician. DMAE is a substance found in oily fish (Mostly Sardines) That gives and instant effect of tightening and moisture to the skin. It is usually very expensive this is an exception! I use it during the day before makeup, and with the vitamin C this is a great moisturiser for just about anyone! It has a lifting and tightening effect short term and an all day moisturiser effect. This is a great deal! Especially for a serum wich is more concentrated. I recomend it! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Texture is nice &amp; silky but smell is bad. I&#x27;m hoping it will repel mosquitoes &amp; bugs.  No way I can use this on my face but I can stand it on my legs. Not oily, absorbs quickly, skin feels good. Too bad about the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and I love this product.  I use it after my shower and before bed, and I think it really helps make my skin look more youthful. I still have a bit of an oily T-zone, and this serum is not heavy or greasy, so it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me!  Yay! My crow&#x27;s feet seem better, but my main concern is the frown lines around my mouth.  (Yuck!)  This seems to help those, too. I have tried other products, but now I&#x27;m planning on sticking with this one, at least for a while.  You get two bottles, 2 ounces each, and you can&#x27;t beat that deal. Also, the scent is light so it&#x27;s not going to overwhelm your senses or give you a headache.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  There are better products and I would order this again  Look up Illuminesce DMAE on amazon.</li>
    <li> developed pimples at age 60 years of age after using this!  Can not use it after trying it 3x</li>
    <li> This C serum is great!  My skin looks brighter and dark spots are faded.  Highly recommend!  I like many of the products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in 3 weeks</li>
    <li> For the first few seconds when I&#x27;m applying the serum, it almost feels too watery (how could it be doing anything?), but my skin immediately feels that it&#x27;s being moisturized. After two weeks of use, my skin had a subtle but noticeable smoother texture. I plan to keep buying this serum as long as they make it (which I hope is at least 30 more years). :-)</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate it until I stopped using it. It subtly improves the appearance of your skin. It smells great. It&#x27;s very light (which is good in hot Arizona). It did not bother my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> So you may have heard of the famous Dr. Nicholas Perricone and his slew of popular books for anti-aging, health, and beauty. Well I was reading in his book &amp;#34;The Wrinkle Cure&amp;#34; about the many benefits of Alpha Lipoic Acid, DMAE, and Vitamin C-Ester. That&#x27;s when I knew I had to try it out for myself to see if it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not usually the one that goes out and buys the latest wrinkle cream. It&#x27;s quite the opposite really. I&#x27;m selective when it comes to these things. Not only do I have a tight budget, but I also don&#x27;t want to irritate my face with harsh ingredients. I only buy what has been proven by science to be effective and backed up by case-studies on real people. If he uses it with real patients in his practice, then it&#x27;s good enough for me to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I then went to Amazon to look for the Perricone brand of products that contain these 3 ingredients, and to read reviews from people who&#x27;ve tried the products out. Well as it turns out most of what he sells only contains 1 ingredient at a time and it sells for roughly $80 a bottle!!! GEEZ-LOUISE I can&#x27;t afford that! BUT... I did happen upon this product that so happened to get great reviews and was a fraction of the cost of Perricone&#x27;s precious elixirs of youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later (prime delivery) I got it and it was in perfect condition. I was pleasantly surprised to see it labeled as natural, cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, and a family owned and operated company. It also says: &amp;#34;Never any harmful parabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl sulfate, petrolatum, mineral oil, artificial color or GMOs. All this instantly makes me love them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you guys are wondering by now if it actually works. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days so I can&#x27;t say for certain. I can say that feels great on my skin and is not irritating at all. My pores seem to be a tad bit smaller and there&#x27;s a healthy glow to my skin, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cream or the Tria Age-Defying Laser I&#x27;m using or the Alpha-Lipoic Acid supplement capsule I broke apart and mixed with the cream or even the DPL red LED &amp; infrared device I use for skin tightening or the Retin-A micro that&#x27;s doing the job. But certainly whatever I&#x27;m doing is working. My skin looks brighter and my pores are more refined after just a few days use. All in all I&#x27;d recommend this product to my friends.g Laser I&#x27;m using or the Alpha-Lipoic Acid supplement capsule I broke apart and mixed with the cream or even the DPL red LED &amp; infrared device I use for skin tightening or the Retin-A micro that&#x27;s doing the job.

    <li> I have used this serum for the past year and it has made a wonderful difference in my skin......noticeably visible to friends and family in just a month. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out like many of the things on the market today.  I highly recommend this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was excited to get this face cream, but was very dissappointed when I tried it. Thought is was very drying, for my skin, and unfortunately, I had to purchase two bottles, and only used one bottle two times.</li>
    <li> This is the worst cosmetics experience I have ever had. Lucky I only tried it on a small area of skin - but even that is itchy to painful for 2 days now, red, swollen and all in all looking like damaged skin despite some anti histamine I applied on the area.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second product by this company I have tried. Unfortunately. The other one didn&#x27;t have this bad an allergic reaction but another damaging effect. And also very unfortunate that I fell for the double package. So lots of $$ now in the bin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be happy if I could get refunded...</li>
    <li> Love all the Derma e line. Same ingredients as more expensive products but at a much better price. Love the feel. absorbs into the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the combination of DMAE Alpha Lipoic and C is just what my over 60 skin demands!</li>
    <li> as an aesthetician, i love playing around with products.  And, understand the quest for something that does an amazing job, but is less expensive.  this unfortunately, was not it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to test, i stopped using my favorite eye cream.  my skin is sensitive to anti-aging products and i wanted to see how the alpha lipoic would work on the fine lines around my eyes.  with the additional C, I eased into the product to avoid any reaction.  I started applying nights only, after 1 week I added every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after one month, I realized there were no visible results.  this product is not expensive.  but it is not effective:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, at least, I would reason that you could spend a bit more money on a different product and get visible results.</li>
    <li> I love the way it helps absorb moisture, I always use it in combination with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love derma e products, period!</li>
    <li> I love this product, for many years I used Reviva, great products also.  Thought I would try something new.  After using only three days, my friend made a comment on my skin, asking what was I using. I noticed my lines around my eyes were less noticeable, not a miracle cream, but close to it.  I like the cream it is very light, no smell to it, and soaks in great.  Also love the derma e tee tree oil cream. Great for healing, and fast acting.  My brother in law came to visit and had a large cut on his leg from the day before, he put some on that evening and the next day he said he noticed it was healing.  I used it for a skin disorder and in three days it was healed as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
