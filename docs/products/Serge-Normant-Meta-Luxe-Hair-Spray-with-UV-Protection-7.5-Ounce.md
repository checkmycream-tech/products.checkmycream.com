    <li> My go to hairspray - not sticky at all!</li>

    <li> Awesome hairspray! It has a great workable hold.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest smelling hairsprays I have EVER used! Holds well and sprays evenly. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this product</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I love how it feels when it goes on and I love the scent it puts out.  When this can is out I will def be buying another!  One of my favorite hairsprays ever.  It reminds me of a Loreal Hairspray that I cant find anymore.  But for me the best part is how it smells.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this through birch box and fell in love with it. It holds hair piece by piece instead of a clump. It&#x27;s light, but still keeps hair in place and if you need to brush it out to restyle, you can!</li>
    <li> I truly love the Serge Normant Meta Luxe Hair Spray.  It has hold power without drying out my hair, plus the smell is SUPERB.  I highly recommend this hair spray.</li>
    <li> Great hair spray. I recommend  it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray.  Good for fine hair as it&#x27;s lightweight.  Has a great smell.  I got it as a sample in Birch Box and have purchased it again from both Amazon &amp; Birch Box.  Advantage to Amazon as it arrives quicker!</li>
