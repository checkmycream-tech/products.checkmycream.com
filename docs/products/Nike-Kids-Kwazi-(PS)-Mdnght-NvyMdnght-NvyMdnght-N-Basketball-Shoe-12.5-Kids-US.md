      <li>If KMF fixes this, the soap (and bottle) would be about as perfect as I could hope for, and I could return this review to its previous 5 star rating.</li>

      <li>but my hands feel clean and it rinses off well.</li>
      <li>It clarified my hair and my hair felt clean but not stripped with that matted feel.</li>
      <li>I use Odo-Ban to clean the cage</li>
      <li>My hands feel clean after I use it though</li>
      <li>great soap, pure and simple</li>
      <li>All I know is that it is WAY strong (not bad, just really strong), and I don&#x27;t know how this achieved with anything natural.</li>
      <li>NICE TEXTURE  - LAST TIME</li>
      <li>but I like this soap, using it makes me smile.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to rely on standard soap anymore.  </li>
      <li>The Peace Soaps are pretty harmless re:</li>
      <li>:) Well it was actually purchased for me from my bestie!</li>
      <li>Very few ingredients, amazing scent, vegan, biodegradable, huge bottle.</li>
      <li>pomegranate acai smell is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>A little will clean your hands just as effectively and will wash off easier.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; &amp;#62; Particularly if you have kids you might consider diluting the soap half-and-half with water, so that it will &amp;</li>
      <li>I use it for so many purposes and it seems to lasts me so long.</li>
      <li>The consistency takes a little getting used to, but love that it is environmentally and human-friendly!</li>
      <li>maybe I like how gentle it feels in my skin, or how I can use it to wash my baby&#x27;s hands too.</li>
      <li>Bottom line is that this is a gentle product for skin as well as hair.</li>
      <li>; is really detergent.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>So, I try to use real soap on my hands, face, and body, when I can get</li>
      <li>I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
      <li>My only problem is that it takes SO much of the liquid to get a good lather....which I believe is due to</li>
      <li>There are, of course, special products for hand cleaning such as mechanic&#x27;s goop</li>
      <li>But, I can live with that!</li>
      <li>Most people these days have grown up with various products called &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; which are actually detergent.  </li>
      <li>It is very thick and rich so it can be diluted to make it go further which makes it even more economical and the fragrance is refreshing and not strong.</li>
      <li>Not a huge deal for me, since I have the time and inclination to funnel it into our decorative pumps, but most people will (understandably) just toss the bottle, leftover soap and all.</li>
      <li>Although the soap is great, there are no large container refills available except in the fragrance free variety, which seems disappointingly inconsistent with the products idealistic presentation!</li>
      <li>it being NATURAL!</li>
      <li>At first their \\&quot;natural perfume\\&quot; was unbearable but with this soap you only notice if you get your face up close to their cage.</li>
      <li>Most folks have never actually used soap.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Soap is comparatively natural, compared to detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Soap (at least not soap mild enough for hands) is not nearly as effective against grease as is detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Soap is not necessarily mild---some soaps are very harsh---but KMF hand soap is mild.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The key word is Castile which effectively means &amp;</li>

      <li>or so it will be discovered that either detergent (easily absorbed through the skin) or some universal product in makeup and lotions (such as glycerin) is the cause of this epidemic of Alzheimer&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The color stays in my hair right up until it&#x27;s time for a new color due to root growth.  </li>
      <li>It could be because of the subtle scent, the cute packaging...</li>
      <li>My sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t reacted to it, so maybe it&#x27;s fine, but if you&#x27;re used to unscented or subtly scented soaps like dr. bronner&#x27;s this is a shock.</li>
      <li>This is a great hand soap without all the scary ingredients of other liquid soaps.</li>
      <li>I am going to go back to that Ross and see if they have anymore, particularly this scent because it is the only scent that I was fond of</li>
      <li>Even nearly all solid &amp;#34;bar soap&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Apparently all Peace Soap is Castile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it responds well to this product but the only problem is you have to use a lot for the lather to last.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this has not been a problem even during the winter months when our hands tend to get very dry and cracked at times.</li>

    <li> Smells and works great</li>
    <li> Have a bottle next to every sink. The consistency takes a little getting used to, but love that it is environmentally and human-friendly!</li>
    <li> great soap, pure and simple</li>
    <li> Great (check ewg.org rating) but pricey</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It doesn&#x27;t foam like crazy but my hands feel clean and it rinses off well.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this soap at Ross for 2.99! :) Well it was actually purchased for me from my bestie! I decided to try it on my hair since it is a head to toe soap and it worked wonderfully! It clarified my hair and my hair felt clean but not stripped with that matted feel. It is great as a shampoo! I am going to go back to that Ross and see if they have anymore, particularly this scent because it is the only scent that I was fond of :) I used it on my face as well and it felt great :)</li>
    <li> Great soap - have it in all our foaming soap dispensers. A little goes a long way, and the fragrance stays when using a foaming dispenser.  Very nice soap, recommend to all.</li>

    <li> Although the soap is great, there are no large container refills available except in the fragrance free variety, which seems disappointingly inconsistent with the products idealistic presentation!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to antibacterial soaps with triclosan in them and I came upon this. The soap smells okay at first but then develops a weird, not gross or unpleasant, but just a weird after smell. My hands feel clean after I use it though and it doesn&#x27;t have triclosan in it so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> wonderful soap - super gentle and very versatile. pomegranate acai smell is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I have recently discovered this soap and its the best hand soap going that I know of! It is very thick and rich so it can be diluted to make it go further which makes it even more economical and the fragrance is refreshing and not strong. I have sensitive skin and this has not been a problem even during the winter months when our hands tend to get very dry and cracked at times. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but I like this soap, using it makes me smile. It could be because of the subtle scent, the cute packaging...maybe I like how gentle it feels in my skin, or how I can use it to wash my baby&#x27;s hands too. For whatever reason, I find myself a fan and will likely try others from the same line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish it were less expensive...just so I could buy more of it :)</li>
    <li> I use this soap for washing my hair as well as my body.  It is a great product, and I love the pump dispenser.  I have naturally white hair that I have low-lighted with colors such as auburn or even purple.  The color stays in my hair right up until it&#x27;s time for a new color due to root growth.  I have even had compliments on the color of my hair 6 weeks or more after the color was applied.  Bottom line is that this is a gentle product for skin as well as hair.</li>
    <li> Only soap I will use. I have a little sample bottle I refill and put in my purse. Very few ingredients, amazing scent, vegan, biodegradable, huge bottle. Love it</li>
    <li> Love this soap - its perfect for washing my face. This scent is delicious :)</li>
    <li> Favorite soap plus 10% of cost goes to support Seeds of Peace.</li>
    <li> I have five female rats and they are often changing rank as far as who gets to be alpha. Well that many ladies living together means they&#x27;re releasing a lot of smells! And I don&#x27;t mean poo and pee smells because they&#x27;re litter box trained and get all new litter every day. It&#x27;s the oils in their skin and fur releasing most of the smells. I use Odo-Ban to clean the cage and I use this soap to give my rats baths. At first their \\&quot;natural perfume\\&quot; was unbearable but with this soap you only notice if you get your face up close to their cage.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and provided a very clean feel !!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  A nice fresh scent that lathers nicely.  I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to rely on standard soap anymore.  Trying to cut out the toxins from out life anywhere possible.  Decent price - a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it responds well to this product but the only problem is you have to use a lot for the lather to last. Smells nice otherwise.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps! They don&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals in them and clean very well. The pomegranate acai smells great!</li>
    <li> Like this soap, too.  The Peace Soaps are pretty harmless re: chemicals I think.  This Pomegranate Acai has a stronger fragrance so it is my least favorite.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. The smell is amazing and it makes my skin feel wonderful...and clean! My only problem is that it takes SO much of the liquid to get a good lather....which I believe is due to it being NATURAL! But, I can live with that!</li>
    <li> I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have all the junk in other soaps, and still smells and works great! Plus, my hands feel more moisturized after using this one, which is a lovely bonus. Definitely give Peace Soap a chance! ;) Edit: Had to come back and take off a couple of stars. I have now purchased 5 or 6 bottles of this soap, and each one has stopped pumping soap before the soap has actually run out. Not a huge deal for me, since I have the time and inclination to funnel it into our decorative pumps, but most people will (understandably) just toss the bottle, leftover soap and all. I actually measured the amount left over, and it is approximately AN OUNCE AND A HALF of soap! (This is between 8-9% of the labeled 17oz.) That&#x27;s a lot of soap, especially at $6-7/bottle. It is quality soap, but wow...so wasteful!  If KMF fixes this, the soap (and bottle) would be about as perfect as I could hope for, and I could return this review to its previous 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> NICE TEXTURE  - LAST TIME I ORDERED THIS IT HAD A PUMP....NOW IT IS A REGULAR CAP&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT BETTER</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a subscribe and save castile soap to replace dr. bronners, but this has &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m not really sure what it means. All I know is that it is WAY strong (not bad, just really strong), and I don&#x27;t know how this achieved with anything natural. My sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t reacted to it, so maybe it&#x27;s fine, but if you&#x27;re used to unscented or subtly scented soaps like dr. bronner&#x27;s this is a shock. I wish they made a fragrance free version of this soap!</li>
    <li> We subscribe to get this on a regular basis. I love this scent. We use a few different scents back and forth though.</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap is light.  It smells like bubblegum.  I like the way it suds on your body.  I use this as body wash.  I do not want all the additive chemicals on my body that other body washes in the store have... I feel more refreshed.  I have the lavender one and the lemongrass one.  This is my favorite smell out of all of them.</li>
    <li> love this soap it smells great</li>
    <li> The scent is light and pleasant, not too feminine for my husband to use. While the hand soap cleans well, it is a tad runnier than I would like. Overall, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Peace Soap is a pleasant soap with a very nice fragrance in a very functional dispenser&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; However it is soap, not detergent.
