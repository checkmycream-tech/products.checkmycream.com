      <li>They have a circular latch-type post that probably fits a tiny Chinese woman or girl where they were made, but not my sexy well formed lobes.</li>
      <li>(the picture doesn&#x27;t do them justice), and after some time trying to open the latch, which turned out to be stunningly simple, they went on smoothly.</li>
      <li>My 5 year old granddaughter picked them out for mom for mother&#x27;s day.</li>
      <li>stone is shining so far</li>
      <li>They have just the right drop for me, not too long or short.</li>
      <li>Well if you can stand it and that they are pretty but obviously not going to be a long term piece.</li>

<li> but unfortunately the hoop is rather small and very round and opens strangely in the middle making it a little difficult to insert into the ear hole.</li>
<li> Small Lobes Hahah</li>
<li> it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love them very pretty</li>
    <li> The earrings are pretty from a distance but up close look chintsy.  Supposed to be 18k gold filled. Gold filled, not gold plated.  Keep that in mind.  The gold part looks like gold colored paint.  I cannot wear them as my ear lobes are too large.  They would best fit someone with tiny or no lobes.  They have a circular latch-type post that probably fits a tiny Chinese woman or girl where they were made, but not my sexy well formed lobes.</li>
    <li> smaller than expected</li>
    <li> They Really Didn&#x27;t Fit Me And When I Tried Them On They Pinched My Ear And Turn Them Red But They Are Cute But For Someone With Little Earlobes.... But For The Price I Feel I Didn&#x27;t Waste Money Cause I Can Give Them As A Gift To Someone With Small Lobes Hahah</li>
    <li> These earrings were just what I needed. I was looking for earrings that would allow me to wear them to bed. They are great for that.</li>
    <li> These earnings are beautiful and shines very brilliant but unfortunately the hoop is rather small and very round and opens strangely in the middle making it a little difficult to insert into the ear hole. I&#x27;ve only have worn them once since I got them because I needed help putting them on and even the help had difficulties.</li>
    <li> I bought several different pair . they are stunning. My 5 year old granddaughter picked them out for mom for mother&#x27;s day. Mom loves them also. She has been asked several times where she purchased them.</li>
    <li> Really like it... It&#x27;s shiny... Will recommend.</li>
    <li> When they came in for my wife she thought they were hideous. Didn&#x27;t make for a good gift.</li>
    <li> These are exactly as advertised ! Nice! Overall experience was nice !</li>
    <li> AGAIN THESE EARRINGS ARE gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see more down the road.</li>
    <li> Very low quality.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was REALLY dissapointed. They look so pretty. I understand they are cheap. But they look cheap, and the gold is already turning. I have only worn them twice..</li>
    <li> Very happy with the item for the low price, highly recommended:))))</li>
    <li> Look more expensive than the cost.</li>
    <li> This product is better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Earrings arrived early, in perfect condition. They are very pretty (the picture doesn&#x27;t do them justice), and after some time trying to open the latch, which turned out to be stunningly simple, they went on smoothly. They have just the right drop for me, not too long or short. I love them.</li>
    <li> Please reorder four items items against.</li>

    <li> there were much smaller than it appears and very cheap looking with the gold plating-also one of the clasps would not open-</li>
    <li> color isn&#x27;t quite the same as in the picture, came in a plastic wrap, not very comfortable to wear</li>
    <li> I love them but they need a link added so they can swing freely.</li>
    <li> Cure, but hey for $4 and 2 month wait. U hmmm. Well if you can stand it and that they are pretty but obviously not going to be a long term piece. Enjoy them for cheap one night. Our on your good stuff to hide the cheap overlay.</li>
