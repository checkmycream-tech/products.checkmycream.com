<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this product made my hair really greasy and didn&#x27;t seem to do much else to my hair so i would not recommend.  i got this product for free for a product review</li>
    <li> It works well.  My hair feels soft after using it.</li>
    <li> My first time trying this product. Smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Company was very good to deal with.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels when I use this.  It has a slight crunch.</li>
    <li> I love the Arvazallia Ultra Curl defining Cream . My curly hair is damaged due to years of straightening, and dying . My friend told me about Arvazallia and I was skeptical AT FIRST but I ordered the product and I love love love it. After co-washing my hair, I lightly dry it with a towel , then I put some Arvazallia Curl defining Cream in my hair. I scrunch it and make sure I get product all over my entire head. When it dries my curls are soft and defined, If I were to use gel and do the same thing my hair would look like straw. I recently began using the cool setting on my blow dryer and diffusing my hair after I apply the curl defining cream and it comes out even better.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Best curl cream I&#x27;ve found so far.  Leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> By far the best product of it&#x27;s kind ...and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
    <li> Love this product for defining my wavy hair. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> It allows my hair to curl without frizz.  I think this is a fantastic product.  When using, keep in mind, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I received it free to test and share my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell! Comparing the Curl Defining Cream to others I have used, I did get a curl from it, but they weren&#x27;t as defined as I was expecting it to be. After a wash, my hair either curls to a kink (if left soaking wet) or curls to tight waves if I twist it. I wanted my hair to stretch, so I twisted it over night. In the morning, I took photos of it after removing the twists, to show off waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this product, was that although it kept my hair moisturized for the most part, my ends dried. I&#x27;m happy to report though, that even though it looked dryer than the rest of my hair, it did not knot up, I am still able to run my fingers through my hair without obstruction.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  My hair is courser and curly/wavy.  This is a great &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; that helps control the frizz without leaving a crunchy feel, but still keeping the curl in place.  My daughter uses it on her straight hair too because she likes how it makes her hair feel.  My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that I wish it had a little more of a perfume scent like many hair products have, but that wouldn&#x27;t deter me from buying it again.  Seller was great and timely too!</li>
    <li> When I first used this leave in, I was afraid that it would leave my hair crispy like mousse. Once my hair dried completely, the crispiness was gone and my hair felt quite soft, though a little heavy. I believe I might have applied too much. I also added some jojoba oil because my hair tends to dry out a little in the Winter. The smell, I do not like. It is quite strong and perfumey. It smells like the red lotion jars my mother bought from Avon as a kid. Not pleasant for someone who suffers from migraines. Once my hair dried, the smell was less pungent. I wish they went for a light floral scent instead of this, but the product is good enough for me to look past that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this leave in and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I thought it dried out my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning this as fast as I can. It made my hair feel even worse than it did before. But the deep conditioner is absolutely amazing, just ordered the oil.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Quick easy shopping experience. Feel very good (your hand and hair).  It does not make your hair &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.  However, the defining power is weak and not obvious. Will I buy it again?  Not sure.</li>
    <li> I received the product today,  I didn&#x27;t get my hopes too high because I&#x27;ve been in search of a product all of my life. Some make my hair too crunchy or they don&#x27;t help the frizz.  I used this in conjunction with the Argan oil and I was pleasantly surprised.  I have a really tight curl and these products left my hair soft,  curly and the frizz was very, very minimal. The products smell really good as well.  I always wear my hair up because it&#x27;s so hard to manage so now I have to figure out what to do with it!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with curly hair but use the two products together.  I haven&#x27;t tried just using this product by itself yet so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s good enough.  But on my mop,  it works. And I think the products smell really good. This is my new favorite brand!</li>
    <li> I, like many of the other posters have tried tons of products for curly hair.  My cabinet is filled with partially used bottles of product.  Everything from no name to store brand to &amp;#34;designer brands&amp;#34;.  They only thing they have in common?  None of them did what they claimed they promised they would do.  I saw this product and decided to give it a try.  I have very long wavy/curly hair.  I like what the product does for my hair.  The smell?  Yuck.  Maybe I got a defective bottle.  It smells ( in my opinion) like bug spray.  I will probably continue to use it because I like the results.  The smell?  Yuck</li>
    <li> Same as any other cheap product you buy at a drugstore or supermarket. Wet look. Returned after two uses. Not as expected.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this hair product!! It tames my wild, dry, graying, natural curly hair. About 4 pea size small pumps worked through my hair after I air dry my hair leaves my hair curly without that frizzy look. I have a problem area on the left side of my hairline that leaves me depressed at times. Changing hormones, and hair that is graying has taken a toll on my once curly auburn hair leaving it frizzy and ugly.  So I decided to try the Arvazallia products. I am so happy I did! Living where the weather is humid nearly every day adds to the mess that is my overall look. Arvazallia has contacted me with tips to get the best results. Using less of the products is the key to an overall more polished uniformed curly look.</li>
    <li> Make sure to use a very small portion of this each day to get the best out of it. It works great for making my curls look nice and keeps the frizziness at bay.</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this product because it is excellent and worth every penny. No more bad hair days, no more frizz, just my hair looking its best.</li>
    <li> SOO happy I tried this product! Soft, tameable curls a plenty- AND the shipping to Australia where I live was very fast! Do try- here&#x27;s a photo with no other product other than Ultra Curl Definer and my rolling around my finger.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and how it works for curls but the scent is really heavy</li>
    <li> Helps keep curls, not heavy or crunchy.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a product for my fine curly hair that doesn&#x27;t leave it all hard and sticky. This definitely fit the bill. It worked great and smelled really good to boot. The only problem I found was that the pump was really hard to use, it took a long time to get enough product out. Besides that though, it was a great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! I have naturally curly hair, medium length. I have&lt;br /&gt;tried lots of other products and they all leave my hair feeling sticky or&lt;br /&gt;crunchy, which I hate. This cream leaves my hair soft and manageable all day.&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is wonderful. I have used it alone and with a little mousse if I&lt;br /&gt;want more curls. Wonderful! I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Good quality cream with decent ingredients but it weighs curls down, that&#x27;s why I give it 4 stars not 5 !</li>
    <li> Best I have tried. Service was perfect!</li>
    <li> It is a good product! I really like. But don&#x27;t expect a miracle. I will buy again. And I will try de oil.</li>
    <li> I recieved this cream for review and testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this cream and how it left my hair soft and my wavy hair defined. I put the cream on on towel dried hair and it gave my hair defined waves and bounce. Then after 6 hours my hair looked fuller and thicker. This product really works for me and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s paraben and sulfate free !</li>
    <li> The deep South humidity can make a mockery of any product&#x27;s promotional definition of what it can do, but I had high hopes for this cream. Unfortunately for me, my hair is either just too thick, or it can&#x27;&#x27;t deal with this much humidity! I used the cream on wet hair, right after washing and let my hair air dry. I had nice defined waves on the top 1/3 of my hair, my none under neath on the bottom layers. But it was soft, shiny, smelled great, and stayed tangle free. It just needed to be straightened the next day, as the &#x27;fluff&#x27; quotient on the bottom 2 layers was way too much for me to be happy with the top curls.. Bummer.  But we are valiant in testing products for you, so I used it on my daughter. her hair is getting SO long now and it is starting to loose it&#x27;s natural wave, due to it&#x27;s weight. So I applied it to her hair right after her bath. Combing it out was a breeze, thanks to that detangling effect! She wasn&#x27;t too sold on the smell, but kids shampoos can kill a kid&#x27;s sense of smell, so I didn&#x27;t credit that comment. The first time her hair air dried overnight and she woke up with gorgeous bouncy wavy beach styles curls, that stayed tha way ALL day. AHA, we had success. The second time I applied it on dry hair and then rolled her hair in curlers, and the applied heat. She slept with the rollers and in the morning, I applied a touch of the oil to my hands, and undid her rollers and pinned up her hair. The resulting curls were pretty well defined for most of the day, for a long walking parade, with a light spray of hair spray. Now here&#x27;s the amazing part, I let her get away with not washing her hair until the next night. Guess what! Those curls were STILL going strong!  SO for us it&#x27;s a 50/50 cream- doesn&#x27;t work  for me, but works for the kid!  SO, our end result was The deep South humidity can make a mockery of any product&#x27;s promotional definition of what it can do, but I had high hopes for this cream. Unfortunately for me, my hair is either just too thick, or it can&#x27;&#x27;t deal with this much humidity! I used the cream on wet hair, right after washing and let my hair air dry. I had nice defined waves on the top 1/3 of my hair, my none under neath on the bottom layers. But it was soft, shiny, smelled great, and stayed tangle free. It just needed to be straightened the next day, as the &#x27;fluff&#x27; quotient on the bottom 2 layers was way too much for me to be happy with the top curls.. Bummer.  But we are valiant in testing products for you, so I used it on Miss Grace. her hair is getting SO long now and it is starting to loose it&#x27;s natural wave, due to it&#x27;s weight. So I applied it to her hair right after her bath. Combing it out was a breeze, thanks to that detangling effect! She wasn&#x27;t too sold on the smell, but kids shampoos can kill a kid&#x27;s sense of smell, so I didn&#x27;t credit that comment.

The second time I applied it on dry hair and then rolled her hair in curlers, and the applied heat. She slept with the rollers and in the morning, I applied a touch of the oil to my hands, and undid her rollers and pinned up her hair. As you can see from the Wordless Wednesday pictures from earlier, those curls were pretty well defined for most of the day, with a light spray of hair spray. Now here&#x27;s the amazing part, I let her get away with not washing her hair until Sunday night. Guess what! Those curls were STILL going strong!  SO, our end result was on heavy coarser hair like mine, the cream can&#x27;t deal with curl control AND the Louisiana humidity. BUT for Miss Grace, who has finer, more light weight hair, it did a brilliant job!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  I have an odd mix of selective waves and curls.  This product allows me to &amp;#34;wash&#x27;n&#x27;wear&amp;#34; on days when I don&#x27;t want to put in the effort of drying and straightening or curling my hair.  The first time I used it, I followed the directions on the bottle, but found that less product gave me the best results.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would help me flaunt my natural curly hair and this has been great.  I usually use mousses but my hair would feel crunchy and I&#x27;d be left with residue.  This little bottle has gone a long way so far. It&#x27;s always best to apply it when your hair is wet and let your hair air dry. I usually just use it once, right after I shower, and the following day I just spritz some water on my hair and I&#x27;m done. I don&#x27;t have to add more hair product. At first, I did make the mistake of applying it every day, which left my hair stiff and flaky. Now, I just apply it once and refreshen it with a little bit of water. Works great. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have type 3B/3C curls which are very sensitive to product. I apply Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream to my hair when it&#x27;s wet. Then after I apply the proper amount of product I use a diffuser to dry and manage my curls. The defining cream gives my hair the proper moisture it needs without making my curls too soft or too hard to manage. My hair has an overall natural look to it. It&#x27;s bouncy, shiny and full of curls that are defined!</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft while providing great curl. I especially like how it looks day two after combing out with my fingers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far and it worked well. My curls were looking limp and after using this product my curls were restored.</li>
    <li> I used this to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; what happened when I switched shampoos previously just to try a new one out.  My hair had gotten dry and felt like straw.  This fixed it right up and I was able to go back to my regular shampoo.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this on a regular basis, as my hair seemed to get used to it after a while.  I&#x27;d probably use it for a month at a time 2 or 3 times a year just to keep things looking good.</li>
    <li> I can really see a change in my hair with Arvazallia. Love it!</li>
    <li> It is a very light cream. I still struggle with quantity and tend to mix with another product.</li>
    <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t do much for you hair unless combined with other curling products in my personal opinion not worth the expensive price tag</li>
    <li> I love the curl defining cream, it really makes my curl pop.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this, but I have found it really does not leave my hair the way it&#x27;s described. I have med/long, naturally curly hair. I have used a &amp;#34;generous amount&amp;#34;, too just a couple of pumps. When I use a generous amount of this product, it leaves my Hair stiff and a little dry. When I use a couple of pumps, my hair will go flat in a few hours. Im really not &amp;#34;in love&amp;#34;, and if I could I would return this prouduct.</li>
    <li> this is seriously THE BEST CURLING CONDITIONER I&#x27;ve ever used. It activates my natural curls, leaves my hair soft (if I don&#x27;t use too much, if you use to much it sort of works like gel) and it smells great. Whenever I wear it people always compliment how nice my hair smells. So, I&#x27;m never using a different product. :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!  This is the first curl defining cream I have used that actually leaves my hair soft with out that crunchy feel.  I am anxious to try the rest of the line.</li>
    <li> After 45 years, I finally found a product that works well for my curly hair. It defines the curls but without the crunch. I allow my hair to air dry. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!</li>
    <li> Really really Great product. I deducted one star because the pump stopped working after only two weeks, but the cream is still terrific for curly curly hair</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product smells pleasant. I used it as a base before my gel and it worked well. I&#x27;d recommend the product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Defines curls/waves, does not weigh hair down, leaves hair soft - no crunchy feeling. Smells great. One of the best product I&#x27;ve found for defining natural curls with no frizz, however, on very humid/rainy days, you will need to use another frizz taming product along with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. I purchased it for my 7 year old daughter and her hair looks amazing!! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> great stuff...really tames curly hair and doesnt make your hair look stiff  and wet</li>
    <li> This product alone doesn&#x27;t do it for me, but when I mix it with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls, I have an excellent product that is great for my hair. The problem with this product alone is that it makes the hair kind of stiff and leaves a white residue. Mixing it with the other product alleviates those problems.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Not sticky just bouncy soft lush curls!</li>
    <li> Bought the conditioner and shampoo as well.  This line is excellent for curly headed girls like myself.  It is so hard to find products that actually work.  I would highly recommend this product.  It does what it says, defines the curls without weighing it down.  In addition, i have below shoulder length hair and only need a small amount of this product.  So I expect it to last for quite a while, unlike other products.</li>
    <li> This product has a different texture, it&#x27;s thicker than the others. I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I always like to try different products for my curly hair. This is one of the better ones I have used.  I do recommend this product and I love the oil that is use in it !!</li>
    <li> Just not that good! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different curl creams and this one just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Smells good........</li>
    <li> This might work for thicker hair, but it was terrible for my fine, naturally spiral curled hair.  It was like putting heavy hand cream on my hair.  No matter how small an amount I used--even diluted with water--it weighed my hair down and made it look dull.  Weirdly enough, my hair still had frizz, despite the heavy greasy coating of this product.  I subsequently bought John Sahag No Frizz For Normal to Fine Curly Hair, and had a much better result.  (It&#x27;s a light spray gel, rather than a cream.)</li>
    <li> I do like this product, it works well, and leaves my curls soft</li>
    <li> I needed a change of pace for my curls and based on the mostly positive reviews here and the fact that argan oil has worked well with my mop of curls and frizz, I decided to give this a try.  The price seemed reasonable enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have to endlessly tame the beast that is my thick, curly, frizzy mop of hair.  To be clear, my review is based on using this product on the beast all of three times so far.  If my opinion changes over time I will amend the review.  I promise.  For now, this product is absolutely exceptional in my hair. Makes my curls come alive and also hold their shape longer than other products.  There was also a bounciness to the curl.  Now granted, it is the dead of winter here with dry temperatures endlessly below 30 degrees so frizz isn&#x27;t likely to be a problem.  The frizz test will come soon enough (I hate hot weather) and as I said I will amend this review if this stuff can&#x27;t handle my kinks.  For now, the curls are curly and soft and just as I would want curls to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of reviews mention the wonderful smell.  Here&#x27;s where I have to beg to differ.  This stuff does not smell good to me.  It isn&#x27;t horrid, it isn&#x27;t even bad, but I just would not say it smells good.  It kind of puts me in mind of the old afro sheen smell from the days of yore.  Do they even still make afro sheen?  Not that it smells exactly like the old afro sheen but there is a similar olfactory tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell aside, this is my new favorite hair product for my out of control mop.  I have already gotten a couple of folks telling me that my hair looks good.  Could be the recent cut but I think it probably has a lot to do with this ultra curl defining cream with argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER 15 MONTHS OF USE:  I love this stuff and can&#x27;t imagine how I ever lived without it.  My hair is silky smooth, far more manageable and curly rather than frizzy most of the time.  Even in humid summer temps, I see more curl than I ever saw before.  In rereading the above review I see I complained a bit about the smell.  Honestly I have no memory of that.  My first bottle must have been bad or else they changed the scent.  I love it now and ALWAYS get compliments on how my hair smells.  I use this every morning and could not be happier!  In fact, it is now part of my subscribe and save order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Heck yes I would recommend this product.  You&#x27;ve got thick curly frizzy hair like me you know how important good product is.  Try it.above review I see I complained a bit about the smell.  Honestly I have no memory of that.

    <li> I have naturally curly hair and really like this product. While I use it with one other product, I like how it defines my curls, while not leaving them crunchy. The product does have some ingredient in it, which can cause a small amount of flaking-not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase this again; not only because of the product, but because of the wonderful, actually, exceptional, customer service.</li>
    <li> I am IN LOVE with this company and their products. I have dry frizzy hair and the Arvazallia curl defining cream has brought the bounce back! I did receive this item for review and I am going to be a life long customer now that I have found them. I would not recommend this for anyone with naturally oily hair because it can make your already oily hair oiler... this is strictly for people with dry hair. Great, Amazing product!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! My hair tends toward frizziness; Arvanzillia curl defining cream tames the frizz and accentuates the curl. It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This really helps define my curls! I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a curly product to work with my hair. My hair is very damaged and dry and I&#x27;m trying to revive my curls and this is just the product I&#x27;ve been looking for</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and need to use moose or gel to help the curls stay in place and not look so frizzy.  I have not found a product I like until now.The Ultra Curl Defining Cream works wonders.  You don&#x27;t have to use to much and it honestly works all day for me.  I have been out in the rain and wind even snow and nothing changes my hair like some of the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil for Hair Treatment is really nice.  You can use before or after you shampoo your hair.  It made my hair feel stronger and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really enjoyed these products and will be using them again.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product is amazing!! My natural spiral hair is so soft, light and frizz free! A nice light scent- what an absolutely wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> When I received the shipment one of the 3 bottles was broken. This was my first time trying out the product. Not happy at all with shipment especially with what I was already paying for the product you expect better. Once putting the product on it would dry up my hair. When using black shirts/blouses/blazer it would leave an almost look a like dandruff residue which I was not happy with.</li>
    <li> Great product-use a very small amount unless you have extremely long thick hair. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Soft No crunch curls- This stuff is great! Here&#x27;s how I applied it to my hair ( I have very tight curls that are also color treated, and flat ironed often) and the results ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5s7qmHOIdYs</li>
    <li> The greatest curl defining cream I have ever used.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Helped me a lot to solve a big problem in my life :-)</li>
    <li> Not as good as other products they sale. Want to return</li>
    <li> very nice product, works well on my very curly hair</li>
    <li> I have wavy, curly hair but it is very thick. Seeing all these great reviews, I decided to try this product. It really did nothing for my hair. It was like I had put nothing in my hair and remained frizzy. Unfortunately this did not work for my hair and I&#x27;m going to keep searching.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair super soft and my curls bouncy. It does help my hair to curl however I have very thick hair and it does add a little volume which I dont need. Luckily, I am still able to straighten my hair even after using this product and it keeps my hair soft and keeps my hair from getting wavy even when it gets humid!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair (frizzy) &amp; so far this product has been working on taming the frizz as my hair dries - it also defines the curl which I like very much. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy. I can dampen my hair &amp; can either add little extra product or not, depending on my activities for the day. It leaves my hair feeling very soft &amp; manageable.  I have now been using Ultra curl Cream for several weeks &amp; LOVE, LOVE it.  It works wonderfully!!!!</li>
    <li> One word- amazing!  Love this product.  See my review of the hair mask and deep conditioner for details.</li>
    <li> as told in the other review this stuff really really works. Now I used it 5 times and my hair looked like solon styled. I got my last curls last Nov. and it was thinking to do a new one. But now I can wait a long time because of this Defining Cream.&lt;br /&gt;And so I also save A LOT of money.&lt;br /&gt;I can honest recommend this Cream</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me definitely the oil and the treatment perfect for my hair and it really grown</li>
    <li> Great product! I have coarse dry curly grey hair and this product makes my hair soft and manageable. It also defines the curl of my hair and gets rid of the frizzys. Love this stuff. Will be using it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I love the texture my curly hair get when I apply Arvazallia!!</li>
    <li> Love how this product smells and a little goes a long way. I scrunch up from my ends and let air dry. Have received multiple compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Makes ur hair crunchy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very very thick, wavy and most times frizzy hair, especially when there is humidity involved and where I am living now, there&#x27;s a lot of it. However, the odd days when humidity is super low, this curling cream is amazing. My hair is very stubborn so it&#x27;s hard to dissuade it from frizzing up in the humidity-and nothing can help that. But when it isn&#x27;t humid as much as it usually is, the definition of my curls are outrageous with this cream. The scent alone is so cleAn and fresh, like you just shampooed your hair and the curls look so natural. My only issue is the moisture in the air does make the cream turn my hair a little bit knotty but there isn&#x27;t much to be done with that. Once you brush it out, it&#x27;s soft again. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, only because I thought it would help against the humidity. But overall, this cream is great and I would recommend to anyone who&#x27;s hair is a little less stubborn than mine. Great product.</li>
    <li> Smelled great. Consistent was good. But it didn&#x27;t work for my thick but wavy hair. It just weighed it down. But super moisturizing. Was hoping it would help maintain my waves but it did not.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff!  I have terrible frizzy curly hair. I have tried many products, but this one is the best!!!!  It smells really good and wow it absolutely works!!!!</li>
    <li> Will Purchase again This hair product is Great!. I have purchased one of the similar product from my hairdresser. It was an ok product and costs $18. And then I try to look on Amazon, I found this one has a lot of good feedbacks. I decide to give a try! It works perfect! It makes my hair more nature, none greasy feelings, and look great! Love it!</li>
    <li> My hair has some natural curl to it, but not a lot. This product add some definition to the natural curl, giving it more bouncy and body. I&#x27;ve used several curl enhancers. This one is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> This product is great for defining my natural curls.</li>
    <li> This is the only curling cream that I have tried that did NOT leave my hair feeling stiff and crunchy!!  I will never go back to the other products and highly recommend this styling cream to anyone who has curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great smell, not sticky and works on my frizzy, curly, dried out at ends hair!! I have wasted $$$ on hair products and I Promise this is the BEST also you CAN NOT BEAT THE PRICE!!Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I was told by my hair creadas ti buy this product for use with my Parvis curly weave. It brought moisture and life back to the hair.  It worked so well, I tried it out on my Aunt&#x27;s synthetic curly weave and it worked a miracle. She purchased a bottle the same day!  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was because I haven&#x27;t yet tried it out on my own natural hair.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Does seem to help define my curls.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Provides control of my waves/curls without weighing them down or making them crunchy.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! This product is the best I&#x27;ve used so far for my below the shoulder-blades, thick, wavy-to-curly salt-and-pepper hair. The points that really set it apart from other products I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br /&gt;1. It leaves my hair soft with no hint of the &amp;#34;crunchiness&amp;#34; that other products sometimes leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;2. My curls hold their shape through second or third day brushings.&lt;br /&gt;3. It leaves my hair smelling like clean hair and doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product!! It gives me amazing soft curls and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz like crazy anymore!</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair and I&#x27;ve been using flexicurls overnight on slightly air-dried hair. On its own, this cream did not greatly reduce my frizziness and it didn&#x27;t not hold my curly waves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I&#x27;ve been using the DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition. I wrap my hair in a microfiber towel for a few minutes, followed by one pump of this Arvazallia ultra curl defining cream and one pump of the DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam. With these additions, I have noticed significant improvement in my curl volume and definition, the longevity of my curls, and a decrease in the overall frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product to use with the other products I mentioned.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay, I like the smell, but it does not produce the same curl and hold that Moroccan Oil curl cream provides. For the price, I find it a good addition to use on days when I don&#x27;t care if I have a well defined curl.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me 30 years but I finally wear my hair down consistently and this product is why! It&#x27;s the first product that has ever successfully tamed my frizz and I have tried an awful lot of them... I have very thick, curly hair and need to apply this liberally but I&#x27;ve found it to be gentle enough that I can without drying out my hair or creating excessive build up; I use a clarifying shampoo about once a month to be safe though. This is without a doubt the best hair product I have ever found. It has completely replaced my hot iron which was beginning to do some serious damage... I think this along with some homemade hair masks (2 parts coconut oil, 1 part honey and 1 part lemon juice) have even repaired that damage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned just reactivating it the next day with water and that absolutely works! Leaves my hair looking a little softer than the previous day and somehow still manages to hold my curls in place while magically controlling the frizz. Multi-tasking at its finest!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I&#x27;ve tried various curl defining creams with little success, until I found this one by Arvazallia.  I have hair that is wavy and almost down to my waist.  It can be difficult to get definition and volume when it is so long.  Not with this product!  I use three pumps of product and apply it to my damp hair along with a little bit of mousse.  I then use a diffuser to dry it and BOOM!  Loads of voluminous curls!  For a more relaxed curl, let air dry.  Doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but I&#x27;m willing to look passed that with the results I&#x27;m getting.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tight corkscrew curls. This product is a game changer. Scratch that. A LIFE CHANGER. I used this for two days and there out everything else I had in my place. This stuff is unreal. I ordered 4 more bottles immediately. If you have curly hair don&#x27;t hesitate to order this. Its magical!!!</li>
    <li> Helps my hair stay curly and I really like the smell.</li>
    <li> I loved it, best thing I have ever used for my curly hair</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with this product. Whereas it help with my curls,  it leaves my hair stiff as if using gel.  I am looking for something that not only helps my curls but leaves my hair soft.  This one did not.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Keeps my curls tamed, but gives my dry hair more of a still wet look than I like. Once product is fully dry, I can run curls through my hands to break up some of the crunchy texture, so it&#x27;s still a good product, you just have to wait for hair to dry all the way to get softer curls.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Great item, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> very good product it leave my hair curly and very soft. I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair.  For years I have been looking for a product that defines my curls without making my hair stiff and feeling like a layer of glue has been applied.  I apply this on to damp hair and shake out my curls and go.  After my hair has air-dried, I again shake out the curls to loosen up the defining cream.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Just OK. Does what its supposed to do, but I find the cheap stuff at the grocery store works just as well, or even better.</li>
    <li> My wife thinks this is great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many curl creams from high-end to discount &amp;amp; nothing has given my curls so much bounce &amp;amp; life as this one. Seller was excellent &amp;amp; I would order this product from them again. Great product &amp;amp; experience.</li>
    <li> The best curly hair tamer so far.  I am truly impressed with this product.  I don&#x27;t have crunchy, flacky, scrunched up hair.  This product tames the grizzlies and does not make my hair look like a poodle ....</li>
    <li> Weighed my curls down too much but my curls were soft.  Probably better for tightly curled hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for curls.  Hold without &amp;#34;crunchiness,&amp;#34; and smells great as an added bonus!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I ordered it but after a few weeks of use, I am so glad I did! The price seemed a little high for the size of the bottle but this product is worth the cost. I find that I don&#x27;t actually need very much to get great frizz reduction and curl definition. I think the effects are cumulative because my hair seems significantly less dry. I agree with the lack of &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; that other people mentioned. I mix a squirt of this with a few pumps of gel in my palm and scrunch it through very wet hair and let it airdry for soft, well-defined, and bouncy curls. I haven&#x27;t noticed any build-up issues or crunchiness. I like that it&#x27;s not sticky at all. I haven&#x27;t tried this product with heat yet. I&#x27;ve been using it with DevaCurl gel and use DevaCurl low-poo and one condition.</li>
    <li> I have natural wavy/curly/fine shoulder length hair.  This curling cream is light and airy while defining my curls and holding them in place.  I use a small amount, about dime size.  When I used more, it seemed to make my hair clinging and greasy.  So, a little bit goes a long way.  Next day, I Just spray water on my hair and crunch.  Great stuff !!!!  Glad I found it.  The price is so much better than the other products I was using. I like that it has Argan oil because it keeps my hair from drying out and keeps it shiny.  What more can one ask for?</li>
    <li> Great for defining curls without the crunch! Soft all day curls even though your hair is wavy.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what all the reviews say it does!</li>
    <li> BEST stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair! Love, love, love the fragrance!! Wish they made 10 more hair and body products that smell just like this! Medium length slightly curly hair. One pump is all it takes. Gives me nice curls, no frizz or tangles. My hair is soft and shiny. People ask me all the time what&#x27;s in my hair that smells so fabulous! If I like them I tell them. Best kept secret in the hair industry. I use another fantastic product of theirs that rocks too!  Will buy them until they either quit making it or I&#x27;m dead. Really.</li>
    <li> I use it on my 7 years old hair that is very long and curly.  This product has managed to leave it shinny, soft, bouncy and manageable.  Love this product. What a life saver</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I dont know if I applyed it right, but it was very sticky hours after applying.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I have used to curl my hair. The curls were soft and bouncy and lasted until I washed my hair again. I love my curls, no friz, no crunch from hairspray and long lasting. Perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free of charge through tomoson.com in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling cream. I live in So. Fl where the humidity is a hair killer. This cream keeps the frizzies away and keeps my hair smooth and shiny. And did I mention how great this stuff smells? Love it!</li>
    <li> Too perfumy for my sensitive nose. It works well but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all. It almost smells like a man&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
    <li> GREAT product. My daughter has really curly, dry hair and this is one of the best creams we have tried. Worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good leaves my hair soft and frizz free!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and accurate merchandise. This is a great curl defining cream, it really does leave your hair healthy and shiny. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair with frizz. This defining cream calms the hair, and leaves my hair feeling soft. Also when using curling iron gives my hair body. I will definitely continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I have thick, color treated (to cover grey), past shoulder length long, natural wavy hair that tends to frizz especially when its humid &amp; it&#x27;s almost always humid here in Arkansas. I have already cut all the dead hair off last yr then used oil treatments, conditioning masks, It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner spray, etc to make sure it stayed healthy &amp; I always let it air dryer.&lt;br /&gt; I got this curl cream along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner because I love the oil treatment &amp; it really works for me. I wanted something to help define my waves &amp; calm the frizz but this curl cream has been a disappointment for me. It doesn&#x27;t hydrate my hair at all or help define my waves. Plus when used with the shampoo &amp; conditioner, my hair becomes a huge frizzy, dry looking mess. I really wish it had worked for me like in the pics of the other users but after 2 weeks of trying it with the shampoo &amp; conditioner it seems to be just making my hair dryer, even with the conditioning mask 2xs every week. I going to switch back to using my Suave professionals Moroccan infusion deep conditioning shine mask which is amazing. I use it when I color my hair. It literally turns a stiff, tangled mess into silk. As of right now, I don&#x27;t see purchasing anymore curl cream.</li>
    <li> Just permed my hair (asian hair, so thinner and oily) and have been using this too keep the curls curly. DEFINITELY makes a difference. Its really easy to just put on damp hair, twist your hair into curls and just GO. The curls look like I took a long time to do my hair, and this adds alot of volume. The material doesn&#x27;t feel oily or heavy on my hair either.</li>
    <li> Leaves My hair bouncy and curly&lt;br /&gt;Not crunchy</li>
    <li> Best curl enhancer (cream or otherwise) I&#x27;ve ever tried! I have a lot of fine, frizzy hair, and this works wonders! When I want to go curly, this product gives me the curliest defined curls I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Smells nice but not too strong. Moisturises well.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy or flaky.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy curly hair and have tried all of the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products that are supposed to tame your hair, and they either do but stink and leave your hair feeling gross or they do not work at all. This product not only smells fresh and clean, it also takes my frizz and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel gross. I have used 2 bottles and am ready to order my 3rd.</li>
    <li> My beautiful daughter has been blessed with a full-head of ringlet curls (which are just stunning), that I find myself doing everything possible to maintain and care for her curls. After using this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair and having my mom try it on her hair, I am convinced of how amazing it is. My daughter&#x27;s hair was soft, shiny and easy to manage, not to mention her curls were the bounciest they&#x27;ve ever been and frizz free. But then again, I would expect nothing less from Arvazallia, especially after seeing the impact it had on my own hair. we are convinced that no other products compare to Arvazallia. They redefined hair care treatments for all types of hair from damaged-beyond-repair (or so I thought) to curl care-- these product are beyond compare. I truly recommend the Arvazalli products to all ladies who want to repair their hair, restore it&#x27;s natural shine and fullness, care for their curls, or simply to those who wish protect from heat and chemical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;read my full review on my blog meandmyminime.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the products in this post for the purpose of a review. I was not paid in any way to write this review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product - I have not used Arvazallia products in the past, but I was tempted by all the good reviews.  My hair is coarse, freezy and damaged by excessive color/highlights.  When you first dispense the product, it feels too thick and sticky -- which would normally pull my hair and hurt my scalp (I have sensitive scalp and lose much hair).  However, you can distribute the product easily, as it seems to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; - not sure if that is because of warming in your palm, or from contact with damp hair.  So it actually does not feel heavy or sticky to apply.  I let my hair dry naturally, and it becomes a little stiff, but with well defined curls.  Once the hair is dry, you can crunch it and run your fingers through your hair, which relaxes the stiffness and turns your hair into soft curls.  So far, I really like this product.  My hair feels soft, not freezy, and has nice curls.  It is too early to see if it will help remedy my damaged hair, but it definitely improves the look and feel of my hair.  I will try other products from Arvazallia.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have wavy hair that is frizzy without product.  I ran a 5k with my hair loose while using this product and my hair still looked good at the end.  I used to use two products on my hair (Dermorganics Argan Oil and Mop C cream) and now need only one.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or hard or clumpy, just nice and wavy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review before on Amazon but if I did it was a long time ago. I had to review this product because it is one of the best I&#x27;ve used on my hair. I stopped getting relaxers about 2.5 years ago. I cut all of the relaxer out so now my hair is completely natural and curly. I&#x27;ve been through several(thousands) of products over the years that did nothing for my hair. They left my hair dry, frizzy and yucky. Some I bought at various stores, some from Amazon. The end result for each product was pulling my hair back into a ponytail! I&#x27;ve been wearing ponytails for 2.5 years. Not anymore! Thanks to this ultra curl defining cream I finally wore my naturally curls out all day! My curls were soft, defined and not frizzy. It smells good too! I received the package in a fast timely manner. I just purchased the oil. Haven&#x27;t received it yet. I let my mom try the curl cream and she loves it too. Sorry mom, you have to buy your own!</li>
    <li> I just love all there products. I recommend everyone try this product, it is awesome for all hair types. It leaves your hair feeling silky and smooth and more manageable.</li>
    <li> NOTE: I did not get this product free - I paid full price for it based on the great reviews, and I AM SO GLAD I DID!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy hair that is getting very long, and although I&#x27;ve tried tons of products, my hair still ends up being more frizzy/flyaway than anything. Ugh. I hate it. I&#x27;m also sick of blow-drying it/curling it, and wanted to give it a break and leave it natural most days. I&#x27;ve tried everything out there, and never got good results (it always ended up frizzy/separated). So recently I asked a girl at work with curly hair what she used to get her hair so gorgeous and shiny. She recommended this product to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it and tried it immediately. I washed as usual, and put about a quarter size of this product in my hand and just kind of ran it through my hair, scrunching it up at the end. As my hair air dried, I fluffed it out from underneath with my hand, noticing that it was never separated/frizzy like it usually is. When it was fully dry, it was a miracle...I had gorgeous, shiny waves of hair and NO flyaways or frizzies!!!! My entire life I have searched for a product that would do this to my hair (I use only high-end products, on top of it), and never found anything that worked until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try this!! I&#x27;m still blown away that it took me this many years to find something that worked this well. No more blow-drying my hair now, except on special occasions!</li>
    <li> I love how soft my hair gets when I use this cream on a twist out instead of using gel, this works so much better and with no crunch.</li>
    <li> Not too heavy, great fragrance, and easy to use</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been better.</li>
    <li> I have thick fine wavy blonde hair and this product product does not way it down and enhances the natural wave. Works best when hair is still very wet. I don&#x27;t use it on the root area as it smoothes it out too much. I used to wake up with knots but but this product also conditions so that doesn&#x27;t happen any more.</li>
    <li> This products is really nice.my hair damaged so I need repair  product something.looking for what  I need.Anyway,satisfied this product.</li>
    <li> The cream works but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this cream and others I buy at other stores. I was hoping it would work, but I have lots of hair and it&#x27;s very difficult to manage. It will probably work on most people but not me.</li>
    <li> Iam 100 percent satisfied with this product. It certainly defines my curl an I teccimmend it highly.</li>
    <li> I did not try this yet  but I tried all other product from the same company for hair and the are the best product I ever used</li>
    <li> Alright so this thing works incredibly well. I have really confused hair that teeters between wavy and curly. After trying most of my life to get it more on the wavy/straight side by blow drying it daily, I finally said, &amp;#34;screw it&amp;#34; and embraced the curls. This thing works incredibly well. It holds pretty much until you wash it off, doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out, and you don&#x27;t really need to do anything other than apply it to damp hair. The bottle does suggest you use a diffuser (that thing you put at the end of the blow dryer), however since I already have a bit of a curl going, I don&#x27;t use anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this is the smell. It&#x27;s STRONG. It doesn&#x27;t really smell bad but anything gets annoying if it&#x27;s overpowering enough. If you apply too little of it, the smell isn&#x27;t too strong but it is also less effective. So really, it&#x27;s just one of those things you have to grit through. Because of that, I only put it on when I really need it. It&#x27;s not a daily thing or else I&#x27;m afraid my nose would burn off.</li>
    <li> This is oil is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and my hair is soft and shiny and I&#x27;m 49.  I have a lot of grey and coloring has made it course.  This product has made it soft and shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair.  I have fine hair and it&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t build up or weigh it down.  I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as it arrived to set a few curls in the front (test run and couldn&#x27;t wait until wash day). I can already tell this product is superior to other setting lotions I have tried. My hair is soft and shiny with major hold. I have afro textured hair and my curls came out defined and wonderful. Try it yourself- you will not be disappointed!  I can&#x27;t wait to do a whole head of curlformers with this setting lotion on freshly washed hair..</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have tried many curl defining products in my lifetime and I have to say this is hands down the best product I have tried. It&#x27;s not greasy, it keeps my curl all day and it leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair and this cream is a bit too thick for my hair. However, I will keep using it to see if I just need to give it a bit more time.</li>
    <li> Finally, I found something that will work on my naturally curly hair!!! My hair is very temperamental and does not take well to anything and trust me I have used just about everything on the market. I have been styling it straight for many years because nothing would work to control the frizz. I love my curls but not the frizz. What I like about this is, it is not too heavy on my hair. I used a diffuser and finally got the curls without the frizz. I love it! :)</li>
    <li> What can I said? i have try alot products but this one is the exemption to the rule. It makes my hair feel so silky and smells so nice and smoothly. I totally love it...</li>
    <li> Love the product!! I recently permed my hair and was looking for a good hair product that will give me natural curl definition look.  I used it twice so far.  Not only this product gives the curl definition look I was looking for but also feel soft when I touch it.  Highly recommend it for people with curl hair.</li>
    <li> I have used several different curl creams since trying to &amp;#34;go natural&amp;#34;.  This one is by far the best.  Leaves my hair soft and manageable--no heavy residue.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very nice treatment.  My hair was badly damaged from a year&#x27;s worth of mistreatment.  Two uses of this line of products &amp; it looks better than it has in a decade!</li>
    <li> So far I like the product. It definitely works better when I dry it with my infuser. I think it will continue to work better the more I get used to using it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and if  the least bit humid outside, frizzy. My hair feels soft and smooth and is even better the second day after washing with this cream. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> The product is good, I like the way my hair looks with it</li>
    <li> I waited to write my review for a while to see how the product worked for me.  I have long, thick and curly hair that gets frizzy in humidity and is hard to manage overall.  I have tried, as you can imagine, many products designed for my type of hair and found that many of them made my hair look greasy and others weighed it down.  I used to try to straighten my hair daily but gave up on this a few months ago.  When you have curly hair, let it be curly.  Enough said--this product works well.  It defines my curls and makes my hair shine and look healthy.  I try to wash my hair every other day, and my hair looks just as good on the day that I don&#x27;t wash it.  I like the texture and the smell and the fact that my hair looks good all day and doesn&#x27;t go flat or loose the style.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Dont love it. Leaves my hair a bit hard and doesnt do much for my curls at all. Smells good though</li>
    <li> It worked ok my curls were frizzy</li>
    <li> Nothing extraordinary here except price.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell but that&#x27;s about all I liked about it.  I felt like it made my hair more frizzy and dry.  It did not hold my curl well at all.  I used it a couple of times to make sure then I gave it away.  Sorry, I wanted to like it but I just didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this product I wear hair extentions &amp; I mostly wear curly hair extentions . I&#x27;ve never used s product that has left my hair soft manageable, left my curls hydrated &amp; moisturized . My curls weren&#x27;t frizzy at all. This product did not weight the hair down . You do not need a lot of this product  just 2-3 pumps did my hair just fine</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp, so I don&#x27;t shampoo.  Using baking soda and vinegar is great, but over time, my hair needs a boost.  The argan oil mask and argan oil curl defing cream really helped!  I avoid getting the on my scalp but my hair is soft and my scalp didn&#x27;t break out!</li>
    <li> Exceptional product! I have had issues with my hair being severely dry for a couple of years now.... No products seemed to work. This product has finally given me my soft hair again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a curl defining cream. Probably the best I&#x27;ve tried. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this defining curl cream. It not only gives my hair a beautiful salon styled curls but also gives a freshly washed smell to hair, especially after sweating and working out at the gym. I like the fact that you don&#x27;t need much. A little goes a long way and that&#x27;s a good thing because it is on the pricey side compared to other curl defining products I have used. I wanted to try this item based on the past review of others. I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my 2 year old&#x27;s very curly hair. It usually frizzes and is unmanageable so I throw it in a messy bun. This product, when applied after her shower, leaves her hair soft and shiny with springy curls. I reactivate curls the next morning by spritzing her hair with water and reapplying some of the product. It also smells delicious. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this product two tries but it still dried out my hair both times. And even left white flakes and a lot of build up in my hair. I don&#x27;t think this product works for girls with kinky, coily natural hair. It&#x27;s just too drying in all honesty.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  LOVE IT so much I can easily over do it!  I loved it so much I put it on my 4 year daughters hair, she immediately became obsessed with her hair and the smell and softness!  Brilliant product!  The best oil I&#x27;ve found for hair.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the curl creme next.</li>
    <li> Great product, made my curls defined and frizz free.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I was excited to use it but the pump was broken. I had to open it up and dig the cream out.&lt;br /&gt;After that struggle, I was unimpressed. It doesn&#x27;t work well as a leave in on damp hair either. I let my hair air dry but with this product my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to hold anymore curl or curl shape than normal. I have thick hair so maybe that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would, but it does work great in using my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Although if you have Alot of hair, this cream can help little to it. It&#x27;s not a mirae cream either. You still have to brush and maintain the following days.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The smell and texture is great! All of their products work great on my hair they transform my hair into spiral curls. My hair is naturally curly thick frizzy and unruley. I have tried their Argan oil,Hydrating argan oil mask, and the curl defining cream with argan oil. I cant wait for them to have new products! They all smell wonderful and work wonders on my hair! I would recommend these products for any hair type for shiny silky hydrated healthy hair! The company is awesome and fast to respond and ship products! The prices are fair and the products go on sale often!</li>
    <li> I have had the opportunity to try this amazing product and I am happy to leave a review on my results. To start, I have a combination of type 2B/3C, waist length (when wet) fine, curly hair. I was so excited to use this product because I got such wonderful results with the other products in this line. I&#x27;m speaking of their Argan Oil and Hair Mask. THE BEST! Which, by the way, are my official holy grail hair products. Trust me ladies...the Hair Mask alone will have you hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultra Curl Defining Cream works like a dream. It gave my curls insane definition. I sectioned my hair and applied the product, did my usual &#x27;scrunch&#x27; and let it air dry. I used this Ultra Defining Cream for 2 styles. First, was a wash n go and second, a loosely, pulled back low ponytail. My wash n go turned out perfect. Shiny, defined, with lots of movement. My hair dried soft with the right amount of hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my low ponytail the slicked back hair was smooth and shiny. I was literally caressing it all day. As for my ponytail, my perfect curls stayed defined even a couple days after my wash n go. To refresh my ponytail I used a dime size amount of product and ran my hands under water, rubbed my hands together and scrunched it into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 Stars. Arvazallia is the best at making products that not only work extremely well, but they also smell amazing. &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I use this for my wash-n-go&#x27;s and I love it! I&#x27;m natural and most defining creams that I&#x27;ve tried saturate and flatten my natural curls. Or they make my hair look fro-ish LOL! Not only does this curling cream smooth my edges but it also leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: I use it on my hair when it&#x27;s wet and clean. About 2 and 1/2 pumps work for my styles!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product after a read all the reviews. It does define my curls, smells really good, unfortunately left my curls with residues :( Their deep condition is a MUST have.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! It is exactly what my crazy mixed gal&#x27;s hair needs! First - it smells amazing! It&#x27;s very hard to explain the scent, but trust me - it&#x27;s very nice!! Second - it actually defines my curls! It&#x27;s rare to find a product that will define do that, but this one had no problem doing so! And last thing, it kept my hair hydrated and looking great! Even the ends didn&#x27;t feel dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that its sulfate and paraben free, which means its safe for your hair! The only tiny problem I had with this product is the pump lol, I couldn&#x27;t get it to work for good 5 minutes, it even jumped and went flying! But I figured it out, so its not a problem at all now! I definitely recommend this product, I&#x27;m sure you will love it!</li>
    <li> Keeps curls defined and my hair has no frizz with this cream. Great product</li>
    <li> This product really does make your curls soft and defined.  Very pretty smell too, one of the better products I&#x27;ve used for curls.  My daughter has been using the Aragon oil for a long time now when she flat irons her hair for shine, they have great valued products.</li>
    <li> Product is not great. It makes my hair straight instead of curly.  Even worse, once you buy from these people they email you incessantly asking for reviews. So here it is, as you wish- my TRUE review of this lackluster product and annoying company.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It makes my curly hair soft and got rid of the frizz.</li>
    <li> Works for me, not too heavy or oily as some curl creams can be.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.... Love it</li>
    <li> I am REALLY happy with this styling cream! Just one pump of product covers my shoulder length hair and works beautifully! (smells good too!) Whether I want curls or smooth curves, this cream WORKS!</li>
    <li> Nice product that leaves your hair soft but with definitive curl.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this as much as the other Arvazallia products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful conditioner, but in my curly hair, it leaves enough of a whitish residue as a leave-in that I won&#x27;t use it this way anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was the case, using this as a conditioner in order to finish up the bottle, turned out to be a decent alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, so far only those leave ins that are have a &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; quality work well for either my curls or my braids, depending on the style I am wearing.</li>
    <li> While I do not have curly hair, I have very frizzy hair, and this is the only product I have found that takes the frizz away.  Honestly, I have tried many products to handle the &amp;#34;age onset frizz&#x27;, and have spent a lot of money on very high end products that did not work.  This one really does work, and beautifully!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The seller is great.  The product is light and works well on my hair.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Only used it 4 times, so far ... but what a difference it makes! I&#x27;m a youthful 54 years old with fine naturally curly hair past my shoulders. (Most of my hair is still brown, just a bit of grey here and there.) My hair has become much more frizzy this past year... whether age-related or from hair breaking from wearing a swim cap ... with goggles breaking the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been frustrated, with none of my favorite products (Pantene for curly hair, or Frizz-Ease for curly hair, or Frizz-Ease Smooth Start) making much of a difference anymore.  Finally spent hours researching reviews on Amazon, and decided to try this Arvazallia&#x27;s product. So glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product:&lt;br /&gt;** Frizzes near the roots are significantly reduced&lt;br /&gt;** Hair / curls come out soft and happy&lt;br /&gt;** Nominal effort makes a heck of a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned by the comments related to the smell. I try to stay away from perfumed products, with a former history of having smells triggering my asthma. I have no issues with the smell of this. It seems light, when going on, and I don&#x27;t notice it wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that this product continues to work for me. Meanwhile, right after my first time using it, I searched and searched to see if there was a travel-size for me to bring with me on trips, but I couldn&#x27;t find one. Will definitely make up my own travel-size. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to the hair I had before this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just ordered my 3rd bottle of this. I&#x27;m hooked. It is now my go-to product to decrease my frizzies -- while my hair is still wet.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try it as a hair stylist. I wasn&#x27;t sure the first time around buying it. I learned the right amount to use on my hair and I&#x27;am happy with how it works on my curls. Less is more.</li>
    <li> Love the smell...love the product. My hair is soft and i think it looks beautiful. Actually tried to put a picture up but Amazon is acting funny.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I used this product for the first time after the date allowable to return it. I must have gotten a bad batch because it smells exactly like bug spray. Awful &amp; definitely not a smell you want on your head.</li>
    <li> I am asian and got my hair permed with beach waves but they were more like curls when I first got it. It&#x27;s been 6 months so now is more wavy that curly. This is the third curling cream since I got the perm. The first one held my curls pretty well, although it did not leave my hair glossy shiny (like hair gel) it was pretty sticky. The second cream had an amazing smell and left my hair with shiny and bouncy for the first hour but id did not hold my waves/curls, the next day my hair would look pretty much straight. Arvazallia, is my third cream. Although, I think the smell is too strong (like hair salon strong) I really like how it holds my curls/waves, leaves them bouncy, shinny and not sticky and looking very natural!</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought this for my toddler daughter, who has thick, curly hair. This product not only conditions, but detangles &amp; softens too. And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Created curls with great staying power. Also great with my hot curlers.</li>
    <li> My crazy curly very dry hair soaks up every bit of moisture I give it but tends to end up a bit stiff with gels.  I started mixing a little gel with Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream and ended up with bouncing soft ringlets and curls.  My hair is fairly short and colored regularly so keeping it healthy and the style easy and fun is really important.  This cream certainly did the trick.  I can be crazy one day and more controlled the next.  I&#x27;ll get it again!</li>
    <li> Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil is designed for wavy to curly hair. I have not used it on my straight hair, but I absolutely love using it on my son&#x60;s hair. He has african-american type hair, which is dry and frizzy. Applying Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil on his still damp hair creates soft, beautiful and tangle-free curls. I love that this product leaves my son&#x60;s hair moisturized, less frizzy and not stiff, sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;____________________&lt;br /&gt;PR Sample. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair and curls super soft! I used to use the Aveda curl creme but have made the switch. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> This cream is the BEST! I have fine yet thick wavy blonde hair, and it styles my waves perfectly with just air drying! If I want more curl, I just use a diffuser. My hair is left soft and smooth, not at all like that gross crispy feeling you get with gel or moose.</li>
    <li> It works well but I don&#x27;t like the way it feels in my hair.  It makes it a little gummy.</li>
    <li> Gives you the curl that you need.  Nice smell, hair is soft not crunchy.  Love the product will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I love how it works in my curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 stars.  Let me just say that with the first time I used this, I noticed the difference.  Even my sister-in-law asked my what product I used on my hair that week because my curls looked well define and soft.  I had tried the keratin a few months ago and that treatment killed my curls.  I have been struggling finding some type of treatment to help me bring my curly hair back and finally I came across to this miracle product. I will keep buying this for sure!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It leaves my hair soft and helps eliminate frizz</li>
    <li> This is an okay defining cream. The main thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the aromatics. There is a very heavy perfume smell that comes from the cream. It really affects how likely I am to use it every day. In terms of curling defining, it does an okay job. I don&#x27;t really think a miracle product for curls exists anymore after trying so many. But this does a good job of keeping my hair looking and feeling frizz-free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this item 4 stars because of the wonderful customer service, but 3 stars for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item (along with the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask by Arvazallia - wonderful product). The Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil didn&#x27;t hold the curls as expected, but I contacted the seller to find out how to return it.  Not only did they tell me to keep the product as a gift from them, but they sent me the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask by Arvazallia for free, and with free expedited shipping. This was way beyond what I was asking, or expecting. This was wonderfu, and showed how much they&lt;br /&gt;value your customers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase products from this seller again!</li>
    <li> This cream wasn&#x27;t as great as I was expecting, but it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money either. It was a bit thicker than I expected, which is fine, but it also means I have to be careful with how much I use. It didn&#x27;t clump, and I definitely loved that! It did define my curls, so it does the job. It&#x27;s just not spectacular.</li>
    <li> Fabulous, wonderful, smells like a million bucks, detangles, boosts natural curl and provides fullness.  Love it, love it, love it...happy, happy, happy.  This product goes a long way so don&#x27;t let the price scare you off.  I have long hair and just a bit does the trick.  Used with the conditioner and found that there was no need to condition daily-at least not with this conditioner.  A couple of times a week with a light daily use conditioner in between was fine.  Use the curl defining cream daily before using diffuser and am just tickled pink with the results.  Arvazallia is a wonderful product that I simply stumbled upon and am very glad I did!

    <li> Use lightly!  Can be greasy  if you overload, otherwise this stuff is great!!</li>
    <li> Softened my hair and tamed my curls. This product works well and smells great</li>
    <li> Really did not control the frizz as well as the other brand I use.</li>
    <li> Well, I have tried all kinds of leave-in conditioners and curl defining creams, including all natural ones, and they either make my hair very sticky or dried out or limp.  This one is the best so far, although I find that it works much better if I add a tiny amount of coconut oil to it.  My hair just needs the extra lipid, I guess.  What I like about this is that it makes my hair feel really soft, tames the frizz, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down--it&#x27;s very light weight.  It also smells great.  For my hair it would get 5 stars if there were a little extra oil in it, but then it might be too much for others.  I definitely recommend it, but if you have very dry hair, try adding a couple drops of coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I love it so much my hair ist a very good</li>
    <li> Now I bought this product after reading several reviews on a variety of similar products.  It goes to show that no matter how well something works for others, there is not guarantee it will work well for you.  The pros:  It is a creamy, nice smelling and good sized bottle of product.  It does define curls and leave the hair smooth and shiny.  The cons:  It leaves my curls &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; or stiff and once I comb out my hair, dry.  Also, repeated use leaves a sticky residue in my fine, curly hair.  So maybe its my hair type, but I am disappointed in how things worked out for me with this product, I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> Smells great and hold is nice for my curly hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hesitant between a 4 and 5 star review for this. I love how it leaves my hair, its smell, and texture.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and really helps repair damaged hair.</li>
    <li> works great.... I have mostly straight hair... and this helps me get soft waves in my hair!!!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or crunchy like many gels or styling products do, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I am trying to take better care of my hair and wear naturally and this cream really helps tame my curly waves!&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream will def buy again</li>
    <li> seems to do what it says so far.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!  This product creates a head full of soft, healthy-looking curls!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great! No buildup. Works on washed or unwashed hair and it has a very pleasant smell. I recommend it and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find products for my naturally curly hair.  I have several different curl patterns from frizzy to ringlets to waves going on and I wanted to find something that would help the not so curly parts curl a little better.  I have to use this with a gel to get the best curls, but they are much softer and this products smells really really good!</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied with this product and seller.</li>
    <li> So far I like it. Smells good. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Using in combination with the oil.  Ratio of 1/3 creme and 2/3 oil or the creme gets flakey.  Has a great smell, feel and helps with frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Currently using the full product line and have already purchased 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product due to all of the great reviews however, I guess it is not for my type of 3C, 4A, and  4B hair.  I loved the packaging as with everyone else however, the Curl Defining Cream did nothing but frizz out my curly hair and did not define my already present curls.  It actually made it a big poofy Afro.  I am so sad it didn&#x27;t work because when it comes to my hair and shoes, no price is too expensive.</li>
    <li> Definitely works well with a diffuser. I&#x27;m still playing with it during a partial blowout. My particular bottle doesn&#x27;t seems to put out much in the pump. It puts out a dot at a time.</li>
    <li> Ok so I really wanted to love this curl defining cream but it left my hair too crunchy. Used it with the oil treatment on top and that didn&#x27;t break the crunchiness. Tried it a few times in different ways but my hair wasn&#x27;t a fan. I gave it three stars for the packaging, smell, rich texture, and slip. I must say that it did define my curls wonderfully. I have 3b 3c &amp; 4a textures and it is colour treated. I gave it to a friend with 3b hair. We&#x27;ll see how it turns out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! At first I was concerned because it is a cream (looks like lotion) that it would make my hair feel greasy. Happy to report that is not the case. It just keeps my curls looking great and my hair very soft. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this product ! It felt heavy in my hand but on my hair it is actually very lightweight. I have 3a/3b hair and my curls turned out 3c/4a looking. I used a diffuser and saw instant results in my curl definition and my hair has a lot of heat damage at the ends but you couldn&#x27;t tell. It also left my hair with a natural shine, and no product build up! It also smells good. I think it is well worth the money , I am highly satisfied !</li>
    <li> Makes my thick, coarse, curly hair feel great!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, but it is also dry and frizzy.  This curl cream gives me almost perfect curls and it lightweight without being crispy.  I have started wearing my hair curly now because it&#x27;s cuter and easier than trying to go straight.  Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product for curl definition.  Adds moisture and shine without looking greasy.  Eliminates frizz.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product from a wonderful company. I will never use another item for my curls. It provides a good hold and really eliminates a good amount of frizz without that crunchy wet look I hate. My curls are soft and flowing. I use more product when I want more defenition. You can get some build up if too much is used. I have course 3b/c hair. This product has changed the way I see and feel about my hair. The deep conditioner is also a must buy. This company really has the best products for curlies.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair...a little drop of this, mixed with my styling mousse and my hair is so happy!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Wish they had sample sizes of the entire line.  Would love to try it.</li>
    <li> It really works. I am recommending it to everyone. I finally am actually liking my curls!</li>
    <li> This product has transformed the way my hair looks. Soft, curly &amp; healthy looking. I have tried so many different curling products and this is hands down the very best.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It does exactly what it claims to do and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Its ok but really doesn&#x27;t do what I want it to do.  Looks good wet but still have frizz when dry.  Works well if you are straightening our hair. I&#x27;ll continue to search for another product that will work on naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> It definitely keeps my curls defined but it does add a little bit of the unwanted crunch.</li>
    <li> Really helped with frizz.  Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Very good but doesn&#x27;t holds curls well...almost makes hair too soft..</li>
    <li> On time. Good for my curls and smells good.</li>
    <li> My hair smells so good when I used it. My curls looks amazing</li>
    <li> First day using it and am not disappointed. It made my hair feel very smooth and so shiny. I did use a diffuser as I needed my hair to dry quick and I loved the curl I got with it. It was shiny, soft and defined. No frizz whatsoever. I am a believer. I used it with fekkai creme de pod and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair. It&#x27;s soooo soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff (like the argan oil) smells really nice. Not as yummy as the argan oil itself, but pretty good.  The best part is it give me PERFECT beachy waves. I used to use a little mouse, gel, and Fructis curl cream, but my hair would be curly/ wavy in one section and not others. I don&#x27;t know why, but the thickness of this spreads everywhere and just makes it SOOOO soft. I love it, and will probably never use anything else until the beachy look goes away. ;)&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I wouldn&#x27;t use a ton of this or all over your roots UNLESS you want the sleek look for a ponytail. It works well for that, too, if you don&#x27;t want the crunchy hard look.</li>
    <li> After using Arvanzalia&#x27;s Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask (my absolute favorite hair mask), I was interested in trying their Ultra Curl Defining cream.  Another winner.  My hair is very frizzy and wavy.  I don&#x27;t have curls to define but using straightening product tends to be too heavy.  This was just perfect for my hair.  Using this along with a ceramic round brush, I no longer look like Medusa.  My husband even commented on how smooth my hair looked.  I loved how my hair felt without having an oily or heavy feel to it.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product.  I felt that my curls lasted much longer after using it.  I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Its not a bad cream, I just don&#x27;t like the smell of it. Gave me a headache. It smells like roses and its just not my thing!</li>
    <li> I just started using the cream.  I can tell it seemed to make my hair more wavey.  But I need to use it more to see how it can work.</li>
    <li> This cream really keeps the curls in my hair with minimal frizz.  The tip of applying the product and then drying with a diffuser really defines my curls.  I am hooked!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I LOVE this company. I will definitley be using this and buying it again from here.</li>
    <li> Love love love this.  Keeps my hair in place with out being stiff.  I have natural curly hair and when I get up in the mornings I have the true meaning of bed head with this product no more bed head. I have been using this for over 6 months. I can finger comb my hair and no one knows that I didnt use a comb.  Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> this product was okay still trying to work with it have to figure out how much I can use. But it smells delicious</li>
    <li> My hair is medium curly, shoulder length and tends to be dry. This cream does a great job of smoothing my frizz and defining without weighing down any curls. It smells great. I like the Ultra Curl better than Aveda Be Curly, which has been my go-to.</li>
    <li> This is my go to product for my curly hair. Smells awesome, activates curls and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I really love the product and its scent. Anyhow, I was a little disappointed when opened the package: the plastic film to protect the bottle was broken and the inside of the package was stained with oil and all greasy. Not sure how much product was spilled. Looks like it was put inside already broken, because the package it came with was still closed and completely sealed... I told the issue to the Customer Service that emailed me to know if I was \\&quot;100% satisfied with not only the product but the entire purchase experience.\\&quot; Will see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 20 minutes after my email to the customer service, they replied apologizing for the issue and adding that they had just issued a request for Amazon to ship me a replacement unit plus a complimentary jar of their Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask treatment. From what it looks like, this is a world class customer service. Will let you know when the products arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: They both arrived with expedited shipping two days later.</li>
    <li> For now, I&#x27;m going with 3 stars. I was really expecting better based on the reviews. We&#x27;ll see if I like it more the more I use it, if so I&#x27;ll update my review. But for now, It just left me feeling kinda meh.</li>
    <li> My beauty routine pretty much consists of whatever I can fit into as little time as possible these days. With an almost three year old, I do not have time to put a million different hair products in my hair or a million different devices to use on my hair. Yet I love to have my hair long and looking, nice, healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try out Arvazallia’s line of hair care products because they help you fall in love with your hair again by hydrating it to maximize and restore it to your hair’s original state. I decided to try out the Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil and the Argan Oil for Hair Treatment and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil is an advanced professional curl cream that penetrates and conditions wavy and curly hair to restore its definition and activate the curls. It eliminates frizz and provides the perfect combination of hold, smoothing and shine to make sure your curls are healthy and bouncy. The Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil is infused with cosmetic grade Argan oil and Vitamin E to nourish and enrich your hair with the essential nutrients that it needs. This unique all-in-one formulation conditions, moisturizes, and adds shine to your hair. It eliminates the need for extra products. It comes in a 10 ounce pump bottle at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair. I loved the Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil. It really conditioned my curls and gave them great definition and held them very strong all day long, which I loved. I admit it does not do as well on frizz as I would have liked. However, as the Arvazallia pamphlet suggests that you get with your hair products when used in combination with the Argan Oil Hair Treatment &amp; Conditioner I could use the Ultra Curl Defining Cream for awesome curls and put a light amount of the Argan Oil Hair Treatment &amp; Conditioner on the top and it tamed the frizz without weighing down my curls. Of course I have dry hair so it may be different depending on your hair type. I also loved how this was in a pump container and a little went a very long way.ing down my curls.

    <li> Ceramides...hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Not for me. This is the flattest, least curly my hair has ever been.  It felt like latex paint on my hair, and worse, on my face, because after all, it&#x27;s under my hair. I hope the residue goes away soon.</li>
    <li> The Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil is fabulous! I have fine, thin, just-to-the-base-of-my-neck naturally curly/wavy hair. I&#x27;m in the process of growing it out, so I&#x27;m careful about which products I will use. Argan oil, in generally, has become my hair&#x27;s best friend. This curl defining cream take it to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many curl creams, serums, potions, etc. In most cases, I&#x27;m left with crunchy hair as the product dries (I generally leave my hair to air-dry if I&#x27;m staying curly). If I try to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; the crunch, I end up with frizzy hair. Not with this defining cream. At the length I have now, I only need a very little bit to work through my towel-dried hair. Once my hair is dry, I have nice, defined curls. I can then use taffy and spray to push the curls where I want them to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me talk about the smell - it&#x27;s wonderful aroma is difficult to describe. It definitely does NOT smell like the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; argan oil scent I&#x27;m accustomed to. The best I can come up with is a sort of creamy floral note. It&#x27;s a gentle floral scent and the aroma does fade, so you&#x27;re not smelling like a flower shop all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any styling product, you are your own best judge as to how much to use. Start with a small amount. It&#x27;s easy to add a little more, but if you overdo and are left with crunchy-head, you&#x27;ll have no choice but to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won a full-size bottle of this via a social media contest. I was not compensated and my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! My hair feels great when I use this</li>
    <li> Love it, finally found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, and love how it smells, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It actually sort of straightened my hair out, but it&#x27;s still a good moisturizer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.  I have thick curly hair and some days it works great on frizz and other days not so good.  I think you have to use a lot of product.  What is great about it is there is no buildup or stickiness</li>
    <li> two words: HAIR CRACK love this product my hair has never looked or felt better!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on several reviews from other users and they were spot on with their accolades for the product.  I do love the way it makes my hair feel, very soft and touchable.  I let my hair air dry and this cream defines nice soft curls.  I am still working on getting the right amount as some days I do experience a bit of frizz but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.  I plan to keep this product on my &#x27;must have&#x27; list well into the future.</li>
    <li> This works so wonderfully! I have fine naturally curly hair, and new hair growing in. It tames it all. My ends are not dry any longer either. Great product.</li>
    <li> Omg I am in love with this product! Smells amazing, feels amazing, makes my hair feel so much softer, has a shine to it and most importantly adds volume and way more curls! I have long, thin wavy red hair and this cream has changed my whole hair routine 100% and I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> From the reviews I read before purchasing this item, I expected more from this product. It did not meet come close to what I expected. It was no better than any much less expensive over the counter product. It did nothing to enhance my fine, curly hair.  Unlike some of the reviews I read, I could not easily run my fingers thru my hair when dry. While I won&#x27;t say I hated it, I would not purchase this again. Mot worth the money. I&#x27;ll stick with Morroccan Oil Curl Defining Cream; more expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Makes my curly hair look good and smell good.</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter who has very curly hair. She loves it and said it works better then anything else she&#x27;s tried!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff...turned my dry curls to healthy, springy perfection. I&#x27;ve worn braids for the past couple of haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in that time period and don&#x27;t want to since my hair doesn&#x27;t grow in as thick as when I was younger.  My natural curl pattern is ok, just not consistent. I have wavy hair in the front, curly hair around and a rough patch in the back center but the whole thing was extremely dry.  I&#x27;ve struggled with finding the right mix of products to maintain my hair at home when I give braids a break and I think I found my combo!  I washed with Wen, used a deep conditioner- Kanechom/silicon mix- and finished with Arvazallia and carrot cream. It hold up without feeling too stiff and it looks healthy.  I really love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product does seem to work well with my baby fine wavy hair. I need a product that I can squirt and go. I&#x27;m not going to put a lot of time into it. And this product did the trick. I washed my hair, briefly towel dried it and rubbed some of this product into the long ends. It gave me a very nice wave that held for two days of rough and tumble. So, I&#x27;m rather pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Excellent .Excellent, excellent hair products.</li>
    <li> My hair is super curly and if touched when it&#x27;s dry will frizz. Not with this product!  Silky shiny curls that hold their shape. No more flat irons for me, gonna let the curls bounce.</li>
    <li> For my 3b curls,....awful!  Did nothing but cost me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair but it needed a little help to define the curl this works good</li>
    <li> For just $19.99, you can turn you poofy, frizzy, crunchy-from-gel curls into soft, romantic ringlets. In all seriousness, as a curly-haired lady living in a cold, harsh climate, this stuff has worked magic. I mean, my hair still acts up occasionally, but you can&#x27;t blame this product for unexpected torrential downpours. My hair always smells and feel so clean after using this... like there&#x27;s nothing in it at all (which is all I really want-- no awkward goopy crunch that would leave my hair a weird hybrid of dry &amp; oily). I recommend this product completely... especially to women who have lost hope in their curls!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It keeps my frizzies at bay and allows me to go 2 days before washing my hair.  This was important because my curly hair is dry/frizzy and daily washing is a no-no....Thank you for this amazing product.  I will definitely purchase this product again.  FYI, I found you on Pinterest.</li>
    <li> Works great, even with out wetting hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> This curl cream is one of the best curly hair products I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  It is honestly better than a lot of popular name brand products that claim to make the hair curly and moisturized at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product on damp hair and dry hair and its worked wonderfully both ways.&lt;br /&gt;My normal regimen is using the Arvazallia hair mask, then the curl cream followed by the argan hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out moisturized and so healthy looking.  It comes in a fairly large bottle so this will last me awhile.  I even sent some to a few family members and friends and they like it as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this leave in product, after using the Argan Oil hair mask for a while.  I use it from root down to my ends and helps minimize the frizz and defines the curl.  It works well with my naturally curly and very dry hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with any sticky residue. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and definitely defined my curls! Pair with creme,  soufflé, or gel because alone it makes your hair a little hard  when it dries! Not much but just a little!</li>
    <li> I generally apply a curl creme, scrunch and go.  I have spent 20 years looking for the perfect product that will give me soft curls without making my hair crunchy, greasy, heavy or limp.  Who knew it would be such a trying task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creme is thick and stiff.  Almost waxy.  I can&#x27;t seem to find the ideal amount to avoid crunchy spots and whenever I use it my hair is weighted down and limp by the end of the day.  I like other Arvazallia products that I have purchased, but this is not for me.</li>
    <li> I have used tons of products over the years for curly hair this stuff is amazing!  It&#x27;s not heavy or weights down the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a nice thick cream, it goes on smooth and my curls def felt hydrated. Love the packaging, easy to use, but my only issue is the pump, it never worked! So i end up having to pull the product from the inner tube which is a pain, but im not going to take away from the product, it worked for me. My curls were soft n defined, no crunchiness. Just used the corresponding oil to break the slight cast once dry.</li>
    <li> This product works ! I just got my second cream. In love with it.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell. goes on super smooth and stretches easily. My only complaint is that it only lasts for the day and leaves my hair empty (not moisturized but not dry). I wish it has a bit more moisturizer in it and it lasted longer in my hair. I have a texturizer in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product along with the mask for the hair is great!</li>
    <li> This is my first review of any product and to be honest I was asked to give it.  I have naturally curly hair, am approaching 50 and have good hair and bad hair days.  I live in a dry climate and followed instructions and use more product than I would normally.  My curls are soft and not frizzy.  I am really liking the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutley love this cream.  I was afraid that it would weigh down my hair but it didn&#x27;t.  I have long wiry, wavy, fine, frizzy hair that usually just goes up in a bun daily because I just don&#x27;t want to deal with it.  But lately I&#x27;ve been saying to myself, what&#x27;s the point of having long hair if I don&#x27;t ever wear it down?  So the first thing that got me hooked was the smell.  It is delicious! I was happy when I applied it to my wet hair that it wasn&#x27;t skicky or tacky.  I used about 2 1/2 pumps for my hair and just worked it through scruntching it with my hands.  But I know if I would of used a diffuser it would of been curly, more than wavy.  Very pleased and would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;As an active blogger I received this product for little or no cost. All opinions are 100 percent my own</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times yet will know more in time.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best creams that I have used for my long thick curly hair. It is soft with well defined curls. The seller sent a follow up e-mail with great tips on how to use the product along with other products that might work for me. I would recommend this product for other people with naturally curly hair. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly/frizzy hair and this product is amazing.  It keeps my hair under control and it feels very soft.  I love this product and it is at the top of my favorite curly hair products.  Would definitely buy this again.  Thanks Arvazalia</li>
