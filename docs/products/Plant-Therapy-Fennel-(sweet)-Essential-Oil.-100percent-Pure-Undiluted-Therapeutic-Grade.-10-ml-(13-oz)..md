      <li>Love this company and their essential oils!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know why the smell stuck with me the whole day!</li>
      <li>but it lets you long for more of something.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t even smell like black licorice and not as effective as DoTerra brand fennel oil.</li>
      <li>And it came very well wrapped.  </li>
      <li>I really like this oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
      <li>Was packaged really well.</li>
      <li>Thanks a million</li>
      <li>Thanks to Plant Therapy and others</li>
      <li>I was surprised to read that fennel is considered to be a middle to top note.</li>
      <li>It works well, but you may want to mix it with another oil if you don&#x27;t like the smell of black liquorish because it has a very strong smell, even when diluted.</li>
      <li>This oil is fantastic I mixed up an obesity blend using Fennel, Juniper and Parsley as the main fat burners.</li>
      <li>I take it internally together with lavender oil, to activate the work of my kidneys and to help my body to clean itself.</li>
      <li>, however, I do not know if I will use this again since not many people I know liked it on me.</li>
      <li>If you like black licorice you will love it.</li>
      <li>After I used it, as I went through my day, people commented on how I smelled like black licorice... and guess what, no one really enjoyed it.  </li>
      <li>Packaged tightly and secure, smells just like Fennel, and basically, that&#x27;s it!</li>
      <li>maybe felt a little more toned after the bath</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to using oils and with all the hype around Duterra and Young Living</li>
      <li>Eden&#x27;s garden lists it around $0.50/mL, DoTerra $1.09 per mL, Plant therapy (this review) $0.80/mL, Young living $1.00/mL,</li>
      <li>I have not bought other brands of fennel before to compare the scent, however in researching it is not expensive oil if you want to experiment...</li>

    <li> I really like this oil. Its a good concentrate and you should not use it directly but mix it with coconut oil for best results. It smells great!</li>
    <li> Packaged tightly and secure, smells just like Fennel, and basically, that&#x27;s it! LOL.......good stuff for what I&#x27;m using this product for.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m starting to experiment with essential oil recipes and I am happy with the quality. It arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I got this without any leaks, packaged well.  I have used this essential oil in some blends and like it.</li>
    <li> This came quickly as promised and a very nice product. Seems like its true to its description. Nice tasting and smelling.</li>
    <li> I buy essential oils to wear instead of perfume. I get more compliments, it lasts longer and I love mixing scents together. I also like to buy a scent free lotion and add about 20 - 25 drops of my favorite scent in and it&#x27;s like my own Bath and Body Works creation!</li>
    <li> I bought this fennel to use in a diuretic blend to add to bathwater.  After I used it, as I went through my day, people commented on how I smelled like black licorice... and guess what, no one really enjoyed it.  I was surprised to read that fennel is considered to be a middle to top note. That means even though it has a strong scent, it is supposed to evaporate more quickly so I don&#x27;t know why the smell stuck with me the whole day! I gave it three stars because I thought it was ok-- maybe felt a little more toned after the bath, however, I do not know if I will use this again since not many people I know liked it on me. I have not bought other brands of fennel before to compare the scent, however in researching it is not expensive oil if you want to experiment... Eden&#x27;s garden lists it around $0.50/mL, DoTerra $1.09 per mL, Plant therapy (this review) $0.80/mL, Young living $1.00/mL, Mountain rose (organic) $1.30/mL, Veriditas (organic) $1.60/mL.</li>
    <li> I received the fennel eo quickly and unharmed. It smelled really good too. I have yet to put it in anything yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders. I&#x27;ve purchased alot of oils from them.</li>
    <li> I really like the oils from Plant therapy! This oil smells like black licorice. fennel oil can be helpful for general skin care and especially for dispersing bruises, livening a dull complexion, clearing an oily skin and fighting wrinkles in mature skins. It is also useful for removing cellulite, to fight rheumatism and helps with edema.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it in creams and soaps and just think it is great!</li>
    <li> Product is significantly helping with my eyesight along with Frankincense, Carrot Seed Oil, and Saffron Oil. Both the cataracts and the nearsightedness improve when I use it.</li>
    <li> I take it internally together with lavender oil, to activate the work of my kidneys and to help my body to clean itself. The taste of fennel oil that the taste I like from my childhood (we had cough syrup with that taste and I loved it). And I finally found it.</li>
    <li> Good strong E.O. And it came very well wrapped.  Like this brand and will stay with it.  Looking for more ways to use it.</li>
    <li> Great for breastfeeding moms wishing to increase their supply. :0)</li>
    <li> I use this to help with my breastmilk supply. It works well, but you may want to mix it with another oil if you don&#x27;t like the smell of black liquorish because it has a very strong smell, even when diluted.</li>
    <li> Such a good smell. the taste is not bad either but it lets you long for more of something. either to get rid of the taste or to sweeten it. i have to do more research on how to ingest. Under the tongue didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Experimenting with essential oils,  this one has a licorice scent to it, great benefits for hair,  skin and aromatherapy. Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Strong fennel scent. Helped me up my milk supply and good for digestion. If you do not like a heavy black licorice scent this may not be for you.</li>
    <li> It has an awesome relaxing scent, I have insomnia and I used this last night with the WAYCOM Essential Oil Diffuser. All I have to say is that I sleep like a baby at night! Thanks a million</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, just like fennel. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Yum!  If you like black licorice you will love it. I also found that it gave me an extra boost of energy in the afternoons. I use it once a day and love it.</li>
    <li> The package was in good condition and arrived on time. I like the fennel oil. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very nice strong sweet fragrance.  Dropped this and Eucalyptus on a cotton ball and hung on the baby&#x27;s mobile and it worked great for croup.  Plant Therapy is a very good brand.</li>
    <li> Love this company and their essential oils!</li>
    <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using oils and with all the hype around Duterra and Young Living I was worried about trying to order less expensive oils. Glad I took a chance on another company.</li>
    <li> Nice oil! Smells just like the seed. Good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this fennel oil to make an organic facial mask and it worked beautifully.  It arrived quickly and was well packaged, thus avoiding any breakage.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even smell like black licorice and not as effective as DoTerra brand fennel oil. Using 10 times as much for same effect, not worth the savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I got a bad one.. The package upon opening smelled like it was bathed in perfume and when I opened the bubble wrap that scent did not go away.</li>
    <li> Was packaged really well. Haven&#x27;t started using it yet.&lt;br /&gt;Came on time. I am looking for cabbage oil and cardamom oil.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several essential oils from Plant Therapy. Great quality!!</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic I mixed up an obesity blend using Fennel, Juniper and Parsley as the main fat burners. Grapefruit, orange, lemon, lemongrass, and lime to pack the punch. I blended the oils added to a carrier oil. I drink a glass of lemon water and sniff whenever I feel hungry to control cravings. I also massage into the soles of my feet every morning. Recently added Myrrh to aid in blood sugar regulation so far so good.  Thanks to Plant Therapy and others I am on the road to renewed health.</li>
    <li> Love the scent in my products.</li>
    <li> This is the worst strongest smelling stuff ever wow</li>
