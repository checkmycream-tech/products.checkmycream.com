      <li>The packaging wasn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time, as advertized, great price and in good condition</li>
      <li>Quality is good.</li>
      <li>I LOVED THIS ITEM</li>
      <li>It is very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>Filing head stops with very light pressure applied.  </li>
      <li>The driver is ok the Emory wheels are a disaster don&#x27;t buy them</li>
      <li>GLAD</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure it got jumbled around in transit</li>
      <li>Its  OK for a battery powered unit but could use a bit more torque.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed using it before the battery problem.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for light filing or shaping of nails.</li>
      <li>He wanted to be able to do it independently and he now is able to do that.</li>
      <li>I usually get pedicures but that caan get pricey, so this is ideal for in-between maintenance.</li>

      <li>Takes a little getting usd to, but worth the money.  </li>

    <li> Takes a little getting usd to, but worth the money.  I usually get pedicures but that caan get pricey, so this is ideal for in-between maintenance.</li>
    <li> I used it once. When I attempted to take the lid off in order to access other file and to use the file, the entire internal workings of the file came out with the lid!  Hasn&#x27;t worked since.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is better than the last one I purchased - the file part wears out after a while.  I was looking for this, but could not find it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the toenail file; and while using, the battery cover disengaged and the batteries ejected.  I tried to replace the cover, but it wouldn&#x27;t lock.  I had to hold the device so that the battery cover was against my palm.  That was a bit awkward, and I suppose I will duct tape it closed.  That is the reason for the mediocre rating.  I enjoyed using it before the battery problem.</li>
    <li> Dad in nursing home and needed the ability to trim his nails but has vision problems.  This did the trick.  He wanted to be able to do it independently and he now is able to do that.</li>
    <li> Instructions say to pull the bottom off to insert the batteries!&lt;br /&gt;The bottom won&#x27;t pull off and you can&#x27;t insert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;It is flimsy construction and is shipped in a large box without&lt;br /&gt;packaging; so it gets slamed around during shipping</li>
    <li> Filing head stops with very light pressure applied.  Can not get unit to file at all.</li>
    <li> The pet grooming world has used similar instruments for a long time to help with difficult to clip nails.  This file is gently and also strong enough for thickened nails.</li>
    <li> It did not work,  it just did nothing  and yes I used new batteries  very disappointed</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS ITEM GLAD I BOUGHT IT. SHOULD HAVE DONE IT YEARS AGO. MUCH EASIER THAN FILING WITH A FILE I DEFINITLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM</li>
    <li> Its  OK for a battery powered unit but could use a bit more torque. Quality is good. I use rechargeable batterys in it. I would recommend it for light filing or shaping of nails.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. As soon as I put the batteries in, the device immediately went dead. Its not even worth the money I spent, nor the star I rated it at.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> The driver is ok the Emory wheels are a disaster don&#x27;t buy them</li>
    <li> It is very cheaply made.  The packaging wasn&#x27;t very good.  It came in a big box so I&#x27;m sure it got jumbled around in transit but it does the job it says so I gave it a 3 stars..</li>
    <li> Works great.  Need to get used to how it gently sculpts your nails so you do not overuse it.  It can take the place of the emory board or nail file and it works better for me because I have arthritis in my hands very badly, so it is easier than filing.</li>
    <li> Works well but not as well built as I expected</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, as advertized, great price and in good condition</li>
    <li> We have had one of these nail files before and this one also meets out expectations.</li>
