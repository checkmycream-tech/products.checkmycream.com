      <li>Attractive, well-made (from plastic bottles!)</li>
      <li>This is an impressive pair!</li>

      <li>and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>The plush fabric is nice to the touch as well.</li>
      <li>I didn’t like was that there was no inside separator panel, something my organizational loving self would prefer.</li>
      <li>Although these are not my favorite color, they are nicely made, can hold a fair amount of products, and I found them very easy to cleanup.</li>
      <li>Every gal needs some great travel storage for her cosmetics, so let’s see if this will the right storage for you!</li>
      <li>Well, the sizes are nice for fitting in a purse.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to see some better designs on them though.</li>
      <li>They are easy to clean and great for traveling.</li>
      <li>The patterns were cute, the zippers were pretty good quality and the inside of the bag has a nice protective liner.</li>
      <li>The design and color are rather attractive, the up zipper makes them comfortable and easily accessible if we carry them in our purse, for easy of finding our cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pouches were ok.  </li>
      <li>These are two cute bags.</li>
      <li>ok I guess.</li>
      <li>The bags are plasticky feeling which is OK for cosmetic bags that contain items that you don&#x27;t want to leak.</li>
      <li>I really love that they are made from recycled plastic.</li>
      <li>The bags are cute and convenient.</li>
      <li>And to top it all off, they are made in an ecofriendly fashion with the carbon footprint listed inside the pouches.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like them better if they were 1/3 cheaper.</li>
      <li>They are sturdy and the lining inside is handy in that it is easy to clean and one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about the makeup staining it and ruining the pouch.</li>
      <li>The fabric is nice and seems easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Very easy to clean too.</li>
      <li>They are both very spacious and of a good size.  </li>
      <li>I always seem to have leaks, but these bags will mostly contain them, and the bags csn be wiped clean.</li>
      <li>Easy to toss into a travel bag or your purse to carry your makeup.</li>
      <li>but I think it will be strong too.</li>
      <li>The zippers work fine</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, the material is very soft.</li>
      <li>The bags themselves are roomy, with easy to clean insides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>weight of the material is so light</li>
      <li>The zipper zips smoothly every time.</li>
      <li>This makes them easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>They are well constructed and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that the bags are eco-friendly, but I don&#x27;t think you should have to pay so much for recycled plastic.</li>
      <li>They look good and feel so soft.</li>
      <li>These two different sizes of makeup bags are very handy.</li>
      <li>These are otherwise very good bags, but you will need to be gentle if you want them to last.</li>
      <li>Best features are the easy wipe down vinyl and the very well-constructed zipper.</li>
      <li>This is a two-piece kit, each bag made from 50% post-consumer recycled bottle fabric, each with a zippered closure and wipe clean FDA-grade lining.</li>
      <li>-- I simply believe that one can find similarly nice bags at a better deal.</li>
      <li>They are lined with vinyl so you can clean up spills</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing really special about them.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see them as anything special.</li>
      <li>These are cute bags with vibrant colors.</li>
      <li>Of particular note is the easy to clean lining of the bag.</li>
      <li>Nothing special, really, unless it is important for you that they are made out of recycled plastic bottles.</li>
      <li>This also helps when you need to pack the bag into your travel tote / large handbag / carry-on travel bag -- it&#x27;s somewhat malleable, it&#x27;ll fit into a nook in the bag</li>
      <li>The bag is in green with an attractive sail boat and knots pattern.</li>
      <li>The pouches are great for small items that you want to carry.</li>
      <li>The patterns themselves are fairly gender neutral, so a man could definitely use them for travel personals without being made to feel self conscious!  </li>
      <li>These are not the very thick kind that you can pack shampoo or toiletries in - but they work quite nicely for your cosmetics.</li>
      <li>I am a no fuss kind of girl, so really  I need a product that performs as advertised, in this case holds and relatively protects my things.</li>
      <li>I liked the dotted pattern of the larger bag better than the nautical pattern on the smaller – both prints are very clears, no runs.</li>
      <li>Inside and outside are easily cleaned with a quick wipe.  </li>
      <li>The larger size is perfect for cosmetics, while the smaller size can be used for personal items.</li>
      <li>This is not something I would recommend without seeing it firsthand and handling them first.</li>
      <li>Overall, they&#x27;re OK</li>
      <li>That means, they are more prone to crimping and breaking, whereas a metal zipper would last forever.</li>
      <li>When I first received these bags, the quality exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>I love the print on the smaller bag.</li>
      <li>These bags are roomy and will hold enough cosmetics for most ladies.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be well made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But, only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $20.00 I would personally expect something more luxurious or some pockets inside, some better design, anything to distinguish them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The pouches are again fairly standard they are built OK and have a design pattern.  </li>
      <li>The smaller one is pretty much a standard size to fit in most purses, while the larger one is probably more useful for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Considering the higher price point I expected more from these cosmetic bags.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s been adequate in that regard.</li>
      <li>Very roomy inside.</li>
      <li>My old makeup bag was pretty, yet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product but $20 is a lot to pay for two small cosmetic bags, especially when cosmetic companies often will gift such bags for free with purchase.</li>
      <li>Nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
      <li>But for the money, I would look around more and find cuter bags for less.</li>
      <li>love this duo of makeup bags from Blue Avocado because it has all of the above.</li>
      <li>I actually work in an industry where I deal with bags everyday, so I know the importance of a good bag.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a well-made (and funky) cosmetic case, I highly recommend the ones by Betsey Johnson.</li>
      <li>Not inner pockets or dividers - just roomy little bags that seem like they&#x27;d be easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Two very important aspects of a bag, especially a small bag, is that it has a strong zipper and is waterproof.</li>
      <li>They are lightweight far as material but they are sturdy and seem very durable.</li>
      <li>They are the same as any others on the market and do not seem worth the value.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give them a full five stars is because for me as a feminine woman, I thought the design was bordering on the masculine.  </li>
      <li>I have been in the market for a new cosmetic bag for some time now, and I like</li>
      <li>If I spill something, no problem, just clean with a wet wipe</li>
      <li>The smaller bag does fit inside the larger bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to say that the bags feel very soft and fabric-like.</li>
      <li>These bags are pretty basic.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The pouches were ok.  They are the same as any others on the market and do not seem worth the value.  The picture shows them with items inside, which is for illustrative purposes, but they are misleading as the description says they are a pouch kit.  This would lead a consumer to believe that all the items are included.  They are not and all you get is the pouches stuffed with paper.  I would not recommend these items.</li>
    <li> This is a basic pouch kit.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I agree with another reviewer that the advertising is slightly deceptive (the product image and description) in that the image shows certain items whereas the description (at the time of this review) does not indicate, either way, whether they come with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouches themselves are basic, but decent.  They are well constructed and easy to clean.  The larger pouch is 8 X 3 X 6 and the smaller pouch measures 6 X 3 X 4.  My wife liked the design and felt they were very handy for travel.  Of particular note is the easy to clean lining of the bag. However, both my wife and daughter believe that the bags are overpriced, especially since no accessories are included as pictured in the product image.</li>
    <li> I like these. I&#x27;m using the small as a makeup bag and have the large one in my luggage to use on trips. Good size for anything I&#x27;m concered will spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the material is so light but I think it will be strong too. It&#x27;s white inside so can be wiped off if any stains get on it. Nice zippers too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like we have some recyclable products like these bags not just grocery bags lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the outside fabric too!</li>
    <li> These are cute bags with vibrant colors. They are lightweight far as material but they are sturdy and seem very durable. Easy to toss into a travel bag or your purse to carry your makeup. Very easy to clean too. These are not the very thick kind that you can pack shampoo or toiletries in - but they work quite nicely for your cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I am at a loss at what to say about these cosmetic bags. They are just... ok I guess. Nothing special, really, unless it is important for you that they are made out of recycled plastic bottles. The bags themselves are roomy, with easy to clean insides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long the material will last, I am not sure. To me the texture of materials inside and ouside seems questionable. But, only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $20.00 I would personally expect something more luxurious or some pockets inside, some better design, anything to distinguish them.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that 50% of the cosmetic pouches were made from recycled materials. I have been in the market for a new cosmetic bag for some time now, and I like that I will now have two bags to switch off, depending upon my destination and  what size purse I am carrying. Even the smaller bag holds all that I need on an average day: two lipsticks, a compact with blusher, a small eye shadow, two separate cosmetic brushes, eye brow pencil and nail clippers. The bag is in green with an attractive sail boat and knots pattern. The larger bag is navy with small red dots, and that one will be used primarily for longer trips, as it can hold foundation with accompanying brushes, a small pill box, a travel toothbrush and paste set, feminine personal items, and some other things I probably haven&#x27;t even considered. I highly recommend this set for everyday and travel use.</li>
    <li> I really like the design, especially on the green one. The plush fabric is nice to the touch as well. I appreciate that this line is environmentally conscious. Very roomy inside.</li>
    <li> These are two nice-sized, lightweight cosmetic bags in attractive patterns.  The patterns themselves are fairly gender neutral, so a man could definitely use them for travel personals without being made to feel self conscious!  Inside and outside are easily cleaned with a quick wipe.  I especially like the fact that they are eco-friendly, being made from 50% post consumer recycled bottle fabric.</li>
    <li> This is a basic 2-piece cosmetic pouch similar to what is commonly given away with a makeup purchase promotion.  I felt a little deceived by the picture which showed some items in the pouches - I thought the pictured items might be included.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouches are again fairly standard they are built OK and have a design pattern.  Other than that they feel rather inexpensive and are made of average quality components.  This is not something I would recommend without seeing it firsthand and handling them first.</li>
    <li> Every gal needs some great travel storage for her cosmetics, so let’s see if this will the right storage for you! This is a two-piece kit, each bag made from 50% post-consumer recycled bottle fabric, each with a zippered closure and wipe clean FDA-grade lining. Each has a loop tag to strap it to another piece of luggage or to hang it on a hook. The smaller bag does fit inside the larger bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger bag is about 1 1/2 inches longer than my nook, the smaller bag is just under the size of my nook. I like that each bag is a good size, has the wipe-down interior, and has the loop to hang from. Plus, they are both cute designs – not surprising since they are designed by Lauren Conrad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn’t like was that there was no inside separator panel, something my organizational loving self would prefer. There are also several loose threads on each of the bags, something that worries me about how well-made each bag is and how well they’d stand up to the rigors of travel.</li>
    <li> These two different sizes of makeup bags are very handy. They are well-made and lined with vinyl. This makes them easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> These are very nice looking cosmetic pouches with a nautical theme. They are made well and appear to be durable. The larger size is perfect for cosmetics, while the smaller size can be used for personal items.</li>
    <li> These cosmetic pouches are of good quality.  They are sturdy and the lining inside is handy in that it is easy to clean and one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about the makeup staining it and ruining the pouch. They are both very spacious and of a good size.  The blue is about double the size of the sea foam green one.  And to top it all off, they are made in an ecofriendly fashion with the carbon footprint listed inside the pouches.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give them a full five stars is because for me as a feminine woman, I thought the design was bordering on the masculine.  That is just a matter of personal preference.  As for the quality of the pouches, I have no complaints and can fully recommend them on that count.</li>
    <li> The bags are cute and convenient. They are easy to clean by wiping them off with a damp cloth when they get dirty. They look good and feel so soft. The pouches are great for small items that you want to carry. I really love that they are made from recycled plastic.</li>
    <li> The following is the minimum I need for a makeup bag: 1) enough space for all my essentials yet small enough to put in my purse 2) easy to clean 3) durable.&lt;br /&gt;I love this duo of makeup bags from Blue Avocado because it has all of the above. My old makeup bag was pretty, yet splitting at the seams and the inside was stained with spilled lip stain. I switched to the smaller sized Blue Avocado makeup bag because it fits everything I want to take with me: compact, pack of tissues, lip stain, lipliner, eyeliner, blush, hand lotion, allergy pills - and has more than enough room left for anything else I want to store in there. It is well constructed, with sturdy design which can handle every day wear and tear and being hauled in and out of my purse. If I spill something, no problem, just clean with a wet wipe and it&#x27;s gone. All this and the fact that it&#x27;s made from recycled bottles!</li>
    <li> The feature picture shows the pouches full of cosmetic supplies, but they are empty. There&#x27;s nothing really special about them. Not inner pockets or dividers - just roomy little bags that seem like they&#x27;d be easy to clean. The green nautical design is a little too much for my taste. I prefer the red micro dot. It&#x27;s nice that the bags are eco-friendly, but I don&#x27;t think you should have to pay so much for recycled plastic. The bags are plasticky feeling which is OK for cosmetic bags that contain items that you don&#x27;t want to leak. The zipper is plastic, not metal. Overall, they&#x27;re OK but I don&#x27;t see them as anything special. I&#x27;d like them better if they were 1/3 cheaper.</li>
    <li> These bags are pretty basic.It would be nice to see some better designs on them though.One is a navy blue and the othr a light green.Both have a printed design on them and are large enough to put all kinds of makeup in.One is for home and the other for travel.They are lined with vinyl so you can clean up spills and that&#x27;s nice.The zippers work fine and I would think any lady would be happy with  them.</li>
    <li> These little bags are slightly padded to protect those little bottles and jars. I always seem to have leaks, but these bags will mostly contain them, and the bags csn be wiped clean. It doesn&#x27;t seem likely that they will crack or split, so I seem to have two new traveling companions.</li>
    <li> These are basic, cheap-quality makeup pouches.  The smaller one is pretty much a standard size to fit in most purses, while the larger one is probably more useful for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both have wipe-clean vinyl interiors, which is always a plus for makeup bags.  However, the material is very thin and flimsy.  The pattern on the smaller one (sailboats and ropes) leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d give them an average rating.  I doubt anyone is going to open the box and think, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a well-made (and funky) cosmetic case, I highly recommend the ones by Betsey Johnson. For example, this: [[ASIN:B00GYI8KFE Betsey Johnson Cosmetic Make Up Case Bag Skulls Mustache Fuchsia Multi]] I have two that I&#x27;ve used for years and the quality is great.</li>
    <li> When I first received these bags, the quality exceeded my expectations. The patterns were cute, the zippers were pretty good quality and the inside of the bag has a nice protective liner. I actually work in an industry where I deal with bags everyday, so I know the importance of a good bag. Two very important aspects of a bag, especially a small bag, is that it has a strong zipper and is waterproof. People tend to fill small bags like this with liquid cosmetics/small liquid medicines, so it&#x27;s important to have a waterproof liner. I tested out the protective interior liner, by filling the bag with 8 ounces of water. Within a minute, water started to seep through the inside liner, so it is not waterproof. Second, people tend to overpack small bags like this, with as many small cosmetics as they can fit, putting strain on the zipper. This zipper is good quality, but has plastic teeth, not metal teeth. That means, they are more prone to crimping and breaking, whereas a metal zipper would last forever. If you don&#x27;t overpack your little bags or spill liquids, then don&#x27;t worry. These are otherwise very good bags, but you will need to be gentle if you want them to last.</li>
    <li> This is a set of two zippered bags made from 50% post-consumer recycled bottle fabric. The larger one is blue with red dots. The smaller one is green with white sail boats and pink nautical knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a Fossil canvas-type zippered bag for my daily use cosmetics for a few years now. I was skeptical as to how a bag made from plastic bottles would feel. I have to say that the bags feel very soft and fabric-like. I decided to use the small one for my everyday makeup items. The small size is just right for that. Its compact size takes up little space on the counter.  The bag seems to be holding up well for being used on a daily basis. The zipper zips smoothly every time. There are no stains or stitching issues. I am using the larger zippered bag for items I use less frequently. I have little doubt that it will hold up just as well.  I would recommend these bags to everyone.</li>
    <li> These bags are roomy and will hold enough cosmetics for most ladies.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be well made.&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred metal zippers, which I think last longer, but if used was normal care, they should last a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I think they are a good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that the marketing image is deceptive. There are no brushes or accessories that come with these bags. The cost is simply too much for two small makeup bags. Especially, since they&#x27;re made from recyclable materials. Shouldn&#x27;t they be cheaper? Well, the sizes are nice for fitting in a purse. The navy bag is slightly larger. I love the print on the smaller bag. The navy design is a bit dull for what the cost is. The fabric is nice and seems easy to clean. But for the money, I would look around more and find cuter bags for less.</li>
    <li> Blue Avocado XO 2 Piece Cosmetic Pouch Kit, Red Micro Dot and Green Nautical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review of this product is part of my obligation through the Vine Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cosmetic pouches are excellent and Eco friendly. The design and color are rather attractive, the up zipper makes them comfortable and easily accessible if we carry them in our purse, for easy of finding our cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend, especially if we want to be organized.</li>
    <li> These bags are sturdy and durable (thus far). Surprisingly, the material is very soft. since this product is made of recyclable bottles, I expected it to be a bit stiff and harsh, but it is the complete opposite. This means that&#x27;s easier to put make up or whatever contents you have. This also helps when you need to pack the bag into your travel tote / large handbag / carry-on travel bag -- it&#x27;s somewhat malleable, it&#x27;ll fit into a nook in the bag better/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it&#x27;s me being a bit OCD, but I would&#x27;ve preferred two bags of the same color combination. I suppose it&#x27;s helpful for remember what you have in which bag if they are completely different patterns, but I find that the size distinction would&#x27;ve been sufficient for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am rating this four starts is because I believe this product to be overprices. It&#x27;s a good product but $20 is a lot to pay for two small cosmetic bags, especially when cosmetic companies often will gift such bags for free with purchase. This is not me saying that I don&#x27;t think these are a good value -- I simply believe that one can find similarly nice bags at a better deal.</li>
    <li> Although these are not my favorite color, they are nicely made, can hold a fair amount of products, and I found them very easy to cleanup. I am a no fuss kind of girl, so really  I need a product that performs as advertised, in this case holds and relatively protects my things. And when I say my things, I don&#x27;t mean what&#x27;s in the pouch, but what&#x27;s in the bag that has the pouches. So far, it&#x27;s been adequate in that regard.</li>
    <li> Considering the higher price point I expected more from these cosmetic bags. The picture is deceptive; it shows the bags overflowing with miscellaneous cosmetics, yet does not mention – the typical “contains not included disclaimer”. Best features are the easy wipe down vinyl and the very well-constructed zipper. I liked the dotted pattern of the larger bag better than the nautical pattern on the smaller – both prints are very clears, no runs.</li>
    <li> This is an impressive pair! Attractive, well-made (from plastic bottles!), large enough to hold a lot. I&#x27;m a man so I cannot comment on the practicality of this kit but I plan to loan it to my daughter and get her opinion. Would I purchase this? Yes. It would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> These are two cute bags. The green is about the size of your hand and the blue a little bigger. They both can hold a lot. The inside lining is plastic like a diaper bag. They are easy to clean and great for traveling.</li>
