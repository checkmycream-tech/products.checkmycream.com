<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The colors are amazing and the best part is they glow in black light!  The only reason for 4 starts instead of 5 is the fact that they are super thin and chip easily despite multiple coats and top coat.</li>
    <li> Everything came today, and shipped perfectly, no spills or cracks. Sun Worshiper (orange) and Yellow Polka Dot Bikini are VERY sheer and will take multiple coats for those of you who are not familiar with CG Poolside. Also, all the colors are flat, except Towel Boy Toy (Blue) which has a little bit of shimmer.</li>
    <li> I was so super excited to try out all my new poolside colors, the colors are beautiful and radiant. However, after applying it to my nails all of them dry to a very dull finish, there is absolutely no finished shine to them what so ever, you must apply a top coat to get the shine you want from these polishes.     Also, when applying each of the colors you must use multiple layers of color, which unfortunately also leads to the nail polish not lasting as long due to peeling. I don&#x27;t blame the seller for this it would be the manufacturer&#x27;s fault for not producing a quality product. But in essence, you are selling this product and must be a responsible seller for the product you deliver to your client.     I will say that the product was delivered promptly, but each bottle was not wrapped individually to prevent breakage, they were simply thrown loose in the package with no peanuts, paper or bubble wrap for protection. I guess I&#x27;m fortunate that my package arrived unscathed, others may not be so fortunate. So as a whole, I can only give 3 stars for this seller&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I found these! I had a hard time finding them in local stores and was so happy to find all of the colors for such a great price. All the colors are exactly what I wanted them to be. They go on with a matte finish so a top coat might be needed if you prefer shine. Perfect neon polish and great for spring and summer!!</li>
    <li> These were shipped out and I received them very quickly. I love all the colors too. They look beautiful under my CHINA GLAZE Crackle Metals polishes.</li>
    <li> It chips so fast and I don&#x27;t like the fact that I have to apply a shine coat since it doesn&#x27;t shine the slightest, but I heard that&#x27;s pretty common for neon colours. There are two things I don&#x27;t like about this collection a) chips too fast b) for the lightest colours you need more coats, especially for the yellow one! The good things I have to say are that the colours are absolutely stunning and I will never regret my purchase despite the flaws &lt;3</li>
    <li> They seem to be a matt finish I was looking for the shiny but I do stlii like the polish</li>
    <li> The name China Glaze is a misnomer for this polish.  It is flat finish without any shine or gloss. I bought it for my 13 year old granddaughter and she loved the bright colors but not the finish.  It took 3 coats for total coverage...much too much time to sit still.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I received my nail polish, beautiful colors, great bottle , large quantity. But it was an absolutely disappointment when I tried cover my nails. The quality is like his name, from CHINA. The nail polish does not cover well the surface, you have to give a lot layers until you can get something decent. The worst part is, the finish is mate without shine. You have to cover with another product if you want that crap looks good.  Don&#x27;t waste your money&amp; time with this product set.</li>
    <li> Product is OK. It goes on a little streaky &amp; it apprears to not show up all that well.To fix this problem paint your nails with a layer of white polish. Then it looks absolutely great.  Also, I tried it with the crackle &amp; shattered polishes. The only way it look good was to 1st put on a white polish, 2nd put on the china glaze, 3rd put on a clear polish  &amp; 4th put on the crackle polish. This is 2 more steps than I would like to do.</li>
    <li> If you are considering buying these, spend a little extra and just get OPI.  Seriously.  These colors are EXACTLY what I wanted, but the polish itself is pretty crappy.  Perhaps it is because I am no pro nail artist, but the polish was way too thin and impossible to apply evenly.  Also, with the brushes it&#x27;s hard to not gouge the nail polish when applying multiple layers.  I spent hours more than once trying to get this stuff to look good, and it was kind of impossible.  Another person posted that applying it on top of a white nail polish is helpful, and it really does help a lot.  But still, not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I am so madly in love with these colors.  I have been wanting to find a nice set of super bright neon colors, and these are it!  I only wish the blue was a matte neon like the other 5, that is the only reason I have docked it one star.  It&#x27;s a bright blue color but it has shimmer in it.  Try hitting Google for some swatches of the colors.  It has been noted that these colors are not super opaque.  That is easy to remedy by putting on a coat or two of plain white polish underneath the color.  Right now I&#x27;m wearing Sun Worshiper with two coats of white and one coat of color and it&#x27;s amazingly bright.  These are true fluorescent colors, meaning they all glow under a black light, even the blue one.  I have a black light and tested them all under it.  I really don&#x27;t mind taking this extra step of using a white base coat because it is totally worth it for the color payoff.  Also, if you don&#x27;t care for a matte finish, you can throw a top coat over it to give it some shine.  I like using Seche Vite because it dries amazingly fast.  I actually have Seche Vite *under* the top color so I can keep it with a matte finish.  It still dries just as fast with a coat of color over the top of the Seche Vite.  Maybe there are other brands with better opacity, I don&#x27;t know.  This is an excellent price for nail polish and that&#x27;s another reason I don&#x27;t mind the extra step of a white base coat.  If you are into super vibrant color then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I love neon colors, so this set looks really great! The only issue is that most of the colors show up pretty translucent. The pink is the only one that really shows up well, and all the rest are pretty watercolor-like on your nails. It would require more than the normal amount of coats to get them to show up, which may be normal for colors like this, but I was disappointed by it.</li>
    <li> Polish is a little thin, but the colors are great!</li>
    <li> Good nail polish, but they are not shiny. You have to apply a top coat to make it shine. If you do not apply shine, it will look dry and weird.</li>
    <li> Neon and Matte, nothing a Top Coat cant fix.These colors are so Spectacular and BRIGHT! The only bad thing is that you may need several coats. It took me three coats with the Orange to get a seemingly streak-less look but I think four would have done it better. They are full size bottles which for the price is GREAT! I love neon colors and this is a perfect addition to my collection! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> As some reviews have said, some of the colors go on really sheer and then some aren&#x27;t so bad. It&#x27;s not something a light base color couldn&#x27;t fix or a few layers of the color couldn&#x27;t fix. The colors are so fun and are perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> Extremely thin! Takes over 4 coats to cover. Also didn&#x27;t really watermarble well...the ad said it does. Guess I&#x27;ll try again!</li>
    <li> The colors are very bright and pretty. When I got them I immediately had to try all of them, so I colored each finger a different color. I only put on two coats, and they&#x27;re still perfectly on with no chips even after 4 days! At first when you put them on and they dry they look a bit dull, but when you put a top coat on it really makes them look a lot better and very shiny. I used OPI Top Coat which works very well.  The price for this is also fabulous! Much cheaper than OPI nail polishes and these work pretty much just as well. All in all, these are great nail polishes!!</li>
    <li> To matte for my taste.</li>
    <li> This polish makes me think about lounging by the pool, fruity drinks, summer music blaring, and Hawaiian Tropics. Everything I love about summer! The colors are amazing bright happy neons and although they are more difficult to water marble with due to neons fast drying time they are so worth the work! If I run out I will be buying another set as this one is a little pool party in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Love the colors n the size</li>
    <li> Awesome colors at a great price! This is what they use in the salons. They last a long time. I will definitely be buying more. The only thing is they are more sheer than I thought they would be, so you have to apply about 4 (or more) coats. I have gotten so many compliments on them! I can&#x27;t wait to get more!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel like these are really neon.and the consistency of the polishes are very different the one that is peachy in color was the best for water marbling</li>
    <li> The Colors are nice for Carnival in my Island! Can&#x27;t wait!:</li>
    <li> I really like the colors for summer, very cute for sitting by the pool but.... the are a matte finish and even if a put a top coat on they might last a day, if I&#x27;m extremely lucky.</li>
    <li> I only bought these colors so that I could put them under Katy Perry&#x27;s Black Shatter polish. Lucky for me I didn&#x27;t want to wear these without something covering it, because they look awful. There is a HUGE difference between OPI and China Glaze. These are bright and beautiful in the bottle, but they are a pain to put on, especially the orange, yellow, and green. It must take a master nail painter to put these on evenly. I tried the tip below that says to put a white coat underneath, and it looked worse than without it. I&#x27;m no novice at painting my nails, so I have to conclude that these are just cheap. It takes 3 coats of this polish to look halfway decent, and even then some of your nail will show through. I&#x27;m hoping my nail guy will be able to use these and make it look good, but I won&#x27;t be surprised if he gets frustrated. I&#x27;d say save your money, and if you want cheaper polish buy Nicole by OPI.</li>
    <li> China Glaze produces wonderfully bright, long lasting polish.  However, this polish set is, in actuality, flouresent. I&#x27;m talking neon. Vegas-Bright, crossing guard vest neon.  I felt the product picture was horribly misleading and will be returning this set tomorrow.    These colors would look very pretty under a black or white crackle, but they simply aren&#x27;t worth near $30 to me.</li>
    <li> True to Its name.  China glaze has always been one of my favorite nail polish brands.  These are no exception. The neon Colors are vibrant and rich. I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase!</li>
    <li> THESE GOT GOOD COLOR THESE GO ON VERY WELL BETTER THAN ANOTHER HIGHEND NAIL POLISH THAT I HAD YOU WILL WANT THEM ALL.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed although I love the brand China Glaze, I have many other nail polish from them, and they last well usually, but this collection is bad. It doesn&#x27;t last long ( a day at best without using a base and a top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed, and the color weren&#x27;t that impressive...</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described ! I love all of these colors they are bright and I have gotten a lot of compliments on them !!</li>
    <li> Great colors!  But true to the other reviews, you need at least 4 coats to get the neon color effect.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed I was so excited to get these. The polish is thin and dries matte. There is no shine and I have to put on like 5 layers of the color.  It doesn&#x27;t last long starts  chipping quick. I love the colors but really wish I didn&#x27;t have to apply a shine coat to make them look good. The shipping was excellent!</li>
    <li> I received all the colors shown and unbroken, but the nail polish was really thin. Almost watery.</li>
    <li> My daughter and niece absolutely love this nail polish!! I have ordered up a bunch of colors so they have a good selection for every event coming up!!</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and vibrant, but the polish itself is horrible.  I used the Flip Flop Fantasy and the finish was sort of a matte finish, no gloss or shine.  You have to use a top coat, and that still may not help.  The polish started peeling the next day.  It looked like it wanted to peel off as soon as I finished polishing my nails.  Not satisfied with these at all.</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty summer colors but are more matte than expected. As long as you use a top coat there isn&#x27;t a problem but I was a little surprised when I first tried them.&lt;br /&gt;They are all VERY neon.</li>
    <li> I love china glaze products. Bought these for the summer toes and with two coats it&#x27;s just like gong to a salon, just make sure to use clear coat to seal in the color!</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze and just got into and I thought I would have missed the older color packs since they are not in stores really anymore. For some reason i&#x27;m into neon colors this spring/summer so when i seen this for a great price I could not pass it up. they came two days ahead of schedule and the packaging was perfect every bottle was individually wrapped and was secure in a ship box. I will defiantly use this seller again . Great products great service.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice but very watery, I have to use 3 or more applications of polish, the following day it starts to chip off. Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> China Glaze has done it again. Perfect colors for the season. Upon receipt I had to change my old polish immediately. The Blue Iguana is stunning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall that I have ever bothered to review anything. This is the WORST nail polish! I didn&#x27;t mind the matte finish, don&#x27;t mind having to paint it on over white nail polish or applying several thin coats. What really bites the big one about this crap In a bottle is that is freaking chips off literally over night. Last night I painted my nails with another color combo of China glaze. I have painted them four nights out of the past six because every day they don&#x27;t even last 12 hours. I did all the tips, tried several ways, base coat, no base coat, top coat....hours wasted. Whatever gardeners they brag about in every post for China glaze are not doing g their job at all...or way too good because that sh....stuff chips off if you barely brush it against something. So irritating. I&#x27;m sending this back. Does China glaze make anything that doesn&#x27;t suck this bad?  I did vi it a couple stars because for the five minutes it stayed on it looked awesome!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that there was not a true &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; in this set. Two orange colors received. Yellow, blue and green were true to color.</li>
    <li> I just got this polish for my teenage sister&#x27;s birthday.  I have to say I&#x27;m really satisfied with this China Glaze product.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.  The only downer is this polish is a matte finish, so clear gloss is needed to get that perfect look.  All the colors are really cute, but the orange is almost a Kraft &amp;#34;mac n&#x27; cheese&amp;#34; orange color.  Besides that, this is a very nice product!  My sister is SO happy!</li>
    <li> I have 3 daughters who love to have their nails painted all different colors!  This collection is fantastic and looks great together!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for diffrent styles and designs on my nails this summer and they look great. Can&#x27;t go wrong with china glaze,.</li>
    <li> Bright  fun colors. They go on matte finish but can change that with clear  coat. Color appears very different in natural light  (bright neon shades) versus artificial light.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the bright colors for summer time, and found that trying to find all of these individual colors at the nail salon was impossible. In addition, each nail polish was at least $8 a piece at the salon. I received this pack in the mail the other day and began using them immediately! They are true to size and color and look WONDERFUL in the summer with a nice tan. In addition, they equate out to about $5 a piece which is a steal if you ask me. I saved money and I didn&#x27;t have to search around. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants some bright fun flirty summer nail polish!</li>
    <li> Great summer color.  You can do a lot of amazing designs.  I love this set.</li>
    <li> i got these for marbling...they worked so well...i love the colors and everything about them...i want more...i wll get more...when i have money.</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors, although they are very sheer. You need at least 3 or 4 layers before you get a decent nail. To skip this, I recommend getting a good quality white polish and doing these over that.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, these chip VERY quickly on their own(With top coat.) I&#x27;m talking like, 5 hours after they dry fast. I painted my nails at 2 pm when I got these in the mail and when I got out of the shower at 7, the blue was completely off my nail as well as the orange.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> These polishes are all so beautiful and bright! I am not disappointed by a single one! I&#x27;ve read people complain about how they dry matte but all neons dry like that! All you do is just add a top coat and you&#x27;re good to go! I cannot wait to wear all of these this summer! :)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend specifically asked for this brand as a Christmas stocking stuffer. She wanted bright colors, and when I found this set of neon colors I knew it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves them, and from a guys point of view they look fantastic on her nails. Very bright and bold colors, and she says they last a long time on her nails too. She&#x27;s extremely happy with them, therefore I am too! Definitely recommended. Can&#x27;t go wrong with China Glaze and these neon colors look really cool in person.</li>
    <li> great colors that are super bright and fun!&lt;br /&gt;but...&lt;br /&gt;takes a ton of coats to achieve the true color...&lt;br /&gt;and takes FOREVER to dry!</li>
    <li> I love this collection the colors are very bright and pretty. I always apply china glaze white on white for a base to make the colors pop . I would recommend this to any one wanting high quality neon nails.</li>
    <li> i love all the bright neon colors. these are the perfect summer shades. it takes a couple of coats to get the right color then a final clear coat to make it shiny and matte looking but def worth the effort. my toes are always painted one of these colors!</li>
    <li> Nice long lasting polish</li>
    <li> The nail polish came quickly and was protected very well. My only concern is that in stores Solar Power does not look like the one I got. I have no idea which is the correct version because the Solar Power I received didn&#x27;t come with a sticker on the bottom. Regardless I am very happy with this product! The nail polish is bright and colorful, perfect for Summer!</li>
    <li> Upon ordering my China Glaze poolside collection... I only had to wait 2-3 days bec. My Beauty Smart shipped it thru USPS Priority Mail, even if I only selected Standard shipping. (I had been ordering various stuff from Amazon for awhile now and this is the first time that a package came so fast, it was unbelievable). I was very excited upon seeing the fun and bright nail colors and I just had to try every NEON shade on my nails. The price is very  affordable and all the colors are BOLD and beautiful. These are fabulous shades for summer or you can apply it on your nails on a gloomy day (we get a lot of snow where I live) to cheer you up and add some positivity in your day!     Just a pc of advice to all the ladies who would order this... first, apply the neon polish on a coat of white nail polish to make the colors pop. Then, try to apply these in thin coats and always let each coat dry completely before applying the other. This way you will prevent streaks and missing patches of color. Neon colors will dry as matte shades. Finally, you can opt to apply your topcoat or add a touch of glitter nail polish for layering (sparkles) and it will be awesome as well.     Overall, I really, really like the CG Poolside Collection. Thank you My Beauty Smart for the very quick shipment of my package and keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty bright and awesome on their own, but get a solid layer of white under it, and they look even better. Besides, this set is a steal. The slightly darker pink has almost a matte finish- less glossy, more like a glaze on pottery before it&#x27;s fired (hence the name, &amp;#34;China glaze&amp;#34; but still, a very cool look).</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these colors, they look even better with a base coat of white polish underneath to really make them POP</li>
    <li> The formula of this line is very uneven. You have to apply 3 to 4 coats and it doesnt dry evenly. I tried alpine snow  (white) and funny bunny (white but more of a sheer formula) to see if that helped which it did not. The white base definitely brought out the brightness but it didnt help the formula in general. The colors are great but thats about it. Adding a shiny top coat does help!</li>
    <li> Ok, if you have read any of my reviews, I am a polish fanatic! And this is one of my fav brands. China Glaze is awesome and this colors add to you 80&#x27;s collection!  Feel summery all year round with these. I know I do!</li>
    <li> I love the poolside collection for the simple fact that I looooooooove neon colors. My mom was my guinea pig for this since I just did my nails and even she loved it and she never really likes bright colors but she loves it especially with the bnlack crackle on top. LOVE THIS STUFF&lt;3!</li>
    <li> Looks good in the bottle but goes on rough . I got my $ back and would urge you not to purchase this stuff.. Amazon was great about refunding my $ ... Thx Amazon !</li>
    <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
    <li> I bought these nail polish set last month and I&#x27;m really disappointed!!!. First, you have to apply 4-5 coats to achieve the right color  Second, it only last less than 5 days on your nails! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this! Please don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I ordered this polish late Saturday night after a pedicure that made me have the uncontrollable desire to buy flip flop fantasy!!! Even though this polish requires 3 coats these colors are fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! upon gettin it in the mail, my niece was over at the time and she fell in love also. quick delivery time and awesome colors!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because the price was just right, and i couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. the colors are just as vibrant as i thought they&#x27;d be, and im so happy with the service, they got here in less than 3 days.</li>
    <li> cute colors...good price</li>
    <li> I really like the colors of these Nail Polishes and was really excited to get them. However they are really really thin and you have to put at least 3 coats on and a clear coat to have it even look decent.  This goes on like really cheap Nail Polish almost as if it has been watered down.  I have bought China Glaze before in a salon and it is thick and lasts a long time NOTHING like how these came in them mail.  Save yourself the money and don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
    <li> Not to expensive for some very nice colors. I&#x27;ve used a lot of china glaze nail polish before and these meet the expectation that i had for them. A few of the colors like the blue and the yellow either need 2 but put on in a lot of layers or what i do and put over a coat of white.</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised and expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s drys so quick and the finish product is fantastic! I will definitely be buying more china glaze nail polish!!</li>
    <li> The colors in the picture are not representative of the colors I received. The hot pink and mango colors are actually bright orange and salmon. Those were the two I really wanted! As for the quality, it&#x27;s pretty good. Goes on thin so I needed 3 coats, but it goes on smooth. It&#x27;s dull to the finish, but brightens when adding a top coat. I&#x27;m wondering if what they sent me was actually the set since the colors are not as pictured, and they all appear to be solid neon colors except the blue which has a shimmer in it.</li>
    <li> I like these polish, but some of the colors appear differently when applied. They blue is different to what is pictured. A good buy overall though.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy, the colors are bright and beautiful and I got my package In the mail very fast! Each Bottle was packaged securly.</li>
    <li> In my opinion china glaze is the best nail polish I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve been painting my nails since I was 13 so I have 7 years of experience with different brands of nail polish. The formula is very smooth, not too watery. It lasts forever and a day...the colors are vibrant and gorgeous. When it chips the whole color doesn&#x27;t come off like some nail polish&#x27;s. For me it lasts til I have to take it off, of course it chips though but not too much (depending on how rough you are) . 100% recommend this nail polish !</li>
    <li> Such beautiful colors. The yellow, orange, and green are very streaky, but the other 3 are absolutely beautiful. Especially when you use a white base color, to make the colors pop.</li>
    <li> Great color came really fast</li>
    <li> The colors were nice &amp; true to color. Some were a little watery &amp; streaky though other than that they&#x27;re just fine.!.!</li>
    <li> My girls and I are fans of the China Glaze products, but the price often keeps us from choosing that line.  This collection of fun colors is a fabulous value.  Each shade is bright, fun, goes on smoothly, and lasts a long time.  Highly recommend this line.</li>
    <li> These colors are gorgeous! Neon is so on trend right now. To make these colors pop even more, I use a white nail polish as a base before applying the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m form Norway, and the shipping was surprisingly fast! The colors are amazing and I have used every one of them, and i can&#x27;t live without them. I NEED MORE CHINA GLAZE!</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this set, but the enamel has a matte finish instead of a glossy one. The paint is a little thin as well and requires multiple coats. The colors are great, but be sure to have time and clear polish on hand when you decide to paint your nails!</li>
    <li> I love these neon polishes but they are very transparent. I found out that two layers of white nailpolish as a basecoat was a superb idéa!! Then you only need two layers of China Glaze and the neon looks neonfantastic!! :-)</li>
    <li> I love it! They r just what I wanted!!!!! I wear bright colors all of the time and these are just perfect for me. Their colors glow for DAYS!! They even dry faster than usual nail polish!</li>
    <li> The color goes on terribly, no matter what I did I could not get a smooth look....kinda seems like I got old nail polish. Love the colors though.</li>
    <li> I love this collection. The brightness of all the polishes is a great addition to any collection. I love wearing them with a white base coat to make the colors pop. Also, make sure to apply a top coat (such as Seche Vite) to make the polish shiny.</li>
    <li> Nice colours.. Matte finish.. Need base coat</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore these nail polishes! If worked with properly, they create such neon colors that you can&#x27;t help but stare at your nails and grin! I bought this collection at the beginning of summer and am almost out of all the colors. I am going to reorder the entire collection before the summer is out! I get tons of compliments when I wear these, not only because they&#x27;re eye catching colors, but they&#x27;re beautiful as well. I always use a base coat of white polish to make these colors pop off my nails. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with color distribution or needing too many coats (assuming I&#x27;ve used the white base). I always put one coat of quick dry top coat over my dried nails before using any crackle/shatter, knowing that crackle doesn&#x27;t work properly over matte finishes, which these colors DO dry MATTE (most neons, despite brand, dry matte). The matte finish isn&#x27;t for everyone, but your favorite topcoat fixes that! I uploaded a couple pictures of my rainbow crackle manicure to show just how bright and fun these colors are! A fun aspect to these neon polishes (if it interests you) is that they all glow under a black light! Makes this polish literally glow when you&#x27;re out dancing or hanging out, enjoying the night life.</li>
    <li> Ordered this set, it arrived quickly, all colors as described. I had to try each one of them as soon as I opened them, and they are so fun. Be aware that they DO DRY MATTE, so if you&#x27;re not a fan of the matte effect, simply slap some top coat on for shine. I love these colors, they are so bright and beautiful, and at such a good price! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The green, orange, and yellow goes on almost too light, you would have to do allot of layers.  The pinks and blue go apply normally.</li>
    <li> As woman who is on the go, a mother and business professional, having good polishes makes life easier (and prettier). But China Glaze nail polishes are absolutely horrible! 1) They chip and fade the same day you put them on. Sun Worshiper, has no shine at all, it&#x27;s this flat, dull polish. I got about 10 nail polish from them and they stink! They look good in the bottle but after you put them on and go about your day; you will be surprised to see how raggedy your nail looks. Parts of the polish wears off, chip and fade. So, maybe it&#x27;s because I pout my hands in water, no, that wasn&#x27;t the problem; poor formulation is. Stay away from the hype and this brand of nail polish. I guess the makers don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to have your hand in water or do chores. Not pleased with this brand at all.</li>
    <li> Beyond my expectations</li>
    <li> Great colors. I love them all. The thickness of the polishes are inconsistent. Some are very thick and hard to apply evenly while others were very thin (as expected with neon colors) and required several coats. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> if you keep shaking them, they will last for over a year!  some of the polishes clump sooner than the rest.</li>
    <li> My daughter is into nail art and when I saw this set I had to get it for her. She loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy! Getting all these fun colors for this price is awesome! All look great! So happy I found these. Just love them!</li>
    <li> Bright, beautiful colors. Perfect for summer. I would not wear these to work but weekends or summers off this is perfect. My favorite is Pool Party!</li>
    <li> I love all these colors, they are bright and fun and perfect for summer but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is they all dry matte. I always use a top coat which makes it look glossier and better though.</li>
    <li> great product. It was a gift for my daughter and she loves all the colors in this set.</li>
    <li> Colors are great but the polish itself is very very thin and requires like 6 or 7 coats to get even coverage and by then it is rather pulled and no longer smooth. Disappointing. I am trying to find a nail polish thickener to add to them to make them usable</li>
    <li> i loved the colors.&lt;br /&gt;yellow and orange takes like at least 3 coats for it to be bright, so i just suggest having white base coat.&lt;br /&gt;the package itself arrived in 3days, which was like way before it was supposed to arrive. all in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;and the best part is it takes literally 2-3 seconds to dry. it&#x27;s a great collection for summer, bright and neon.&lt;br /&gt;oh and, what i noticed is they glow in the dark, and change color (just looks like it) at different lights, (sunlight vs dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> The best summer colors ever. Point blank period. You can make these matter shades glossy simply with a coat of top coat.</li>
    <li> Nail polish is super thin &amp; streaky. Almost impossible to get it right. Ended up having to put a base cost of white nail polish to start. Takes an incredibly long time to dry as well.</li>
    <li> I have owned other China Glaze nail polishes before, this set is for sure not the same quality. It looks like they have diluted the nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;The colors don&#x27;t have any shine. Disappointment!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this collection, especially for the price. While I&#x27;m satisfied with the price and shipping speed, the quality of the polishes themselves isn&#x27;t amazing. The two pinks, flip flop fantasy and pool party, are smooth and opaque with 1-2 coats. However, the rest take anywhere from 3-6 coats to be somewhat opaque, which is just disappointing. For those who want more translucent nail polishes, these would be great. However, I&#x27;m looking for more solid colors. I&#x27;ll try a coat or two over a white base and see if this makes a difference, as these would be great colors if they only swatched opaque.</li>
    <li> These colors are bright and work perfect for doing french nails.  They match most of my summer dresses and I have already received tons of complements on the colors.  I purchase China Glaze from Sally&#x27;s but this seller had it for a much better price.</li>
    <li> I love these bright neon colors and so do my daughters, the only thing I would change if I could is I would make them more shiny, they have quite a mat finish and it makes it hard to put Crackle over them. The Crackle doest crack as it should due to the mat finish.</li>
    <li> This polish is awful.  It chips after only a couple of hours, even with a base and top coat.  It requires 3 coats to cover evenly as it goes on like paint... Or liquid highlighter.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really missing the sunshine right now and these fun summery colors totally help me! Seems silly I know but they make me happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love China Glaze polish, It&#x27;s always great quality. With these neon colors they dry almost a matte finish. I leave it sometimes, but it&#x27;s as easy as a top coat to shine it up a little. I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews about it being thin...mine wasn&#x27;t thin at all, but I do always do a base coat on my nails (it keeps my nails healthy I paint them way to much). The green was the only one I had to do two coats with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with shipping. They got here very fast and none were broke out damaged! I will definitely be buying from seller again!</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of six colors from the Poolside collection and it came so quickly. I wanted to try it on my daughter right away. But my excitement quickly wore off. I should have read the reviews before buying: the polish was so thin and runny. It looked awful as I tried to put it on her nails. It will dry to a matte finish as most neons do, but be aware that you will need three or more coats to completely cover. Never had this problem with China Glaze before. Maybe it&#x27;s just this collection.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and the recipient loves it!</li>
    <li> The nail polish is very matte and clear and chips fast., but the colour is FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;Love this China Glaze set. Recommend if you are into black light nail polish!</li>
    <li> China Glaze never fails! These colors are beautiful, you can use them alone or over a white base coat to really make them pop!</li>
    <li> I love this set.  The colors are beautiful and bright.  I love the hues.  Dare to be different.  Nice polish that always has smooth application.  You get to use the whole bottle without it drying gunking shut.  I would recommen to any and all.</li>
    <li> I loved the nail polishes in this set, my one complaint was that some of the polishes were very sheer which was a bummer because the colors are so pretty. When these nail polishes were delivered, they came in an O.P.I package, and my orange had stains all over the lid as did my yellow. I was a bummed about this but overall it was a great purchase and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Love these and the colors!</li>
    <li> i LOVE these neon colors but this nail polish chips like crazy. if i put a zoya clear coat over it lasts a little longer.</li>
    <li> Streaky, matte and thw colors were wasy off. China glaze is a good brand but the quality was just plain horrible.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty, until I tried to paint my nails with them. Both yellows barely show up and the orange-yellow color appears on your mail like the color of mustard. I had to use about 4 coats to make the pink less streaky, then it dries a dull color, NOT shiny AT ALL! I did use a top coat to make it more shiny, and after one day has already started to peel off, it was NOT worth $25! What a WASTE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I usually love China Glaze, but these chipped off within hours. The polish was very thin, and of poor quality. It had no shine to it.</li>
    <li> Love love these colors and it came supper quick.</li>
    <li> The price for this 6 pc set of China Glaze nail polish, I think is a steal considering how expensive individual bottles of it are. the product arrived today &amp; it was as described, the bottles were packaged nice &amp; tight. My only complaint is that the shipping was very slow for me. this was for my mother&#x27;s birthday which was on July 3rd, &amp; they just got here this morning. I know I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping, but after reading reviews &amp; seeing that people received it within 2-3 days even with standard shipping, I was impressed &amp; was hoping I would get the same, but no! I ordered these on either Thursday or Friday of last week, here it is 6-7 days later &amp; they&#x27;re now here. Even if customers don&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping, I think as a seller it&#x27;s a good thing to just go ahead &amp; send out the package as fast as you can, just to satisfy the customer.</li>
    <li> I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t be bright enough to satisfy my 80&#x27;s need, but they are great! You don&#x27;t have to put 40 layers of it on to get the color either, a couple coats and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> I loved this collection. Drying time is average but China Glaze lasts a pretty long time. I love the colors; they pop out at you. Perfect for summer...</li>
    <li> I have gotten soooo many compliments!!! As a massage therapist my clients spend a fair amount of time looking at my feet! everyone loves! :)</li>
    <li> I seriously have an addiction to nail polish, LOL. But I love these colors and China Glaze is a great brand! I would definitely reccommend this brand (and these colors) to everyone. The price was pretty good for this pack, as well.</li>
    <li> one of my fave CG collections. awesomely bright colors especially when placed over a white base coat. the colors really pop out. shipping was good and packaging was great. no cracks or chips. very happy!</li>
