    <li> Over priced for what you get. Basically three trial sizes</li>
    <li> I purchased this set to try a new perfume and I loved it.  I went to Carson Pirie Scott recently to buy it and they had a nice set at a resonable price.  I used to use Pleasures by Este Lauder, which I really liked, but I thought it&#x27;s time to try something new.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful way to offer this fragrance.  A person can pack in ones suitcase, purse and have one for the makeup table.  Good job!!!  ALWAYS LOVE CLINIQUE HAPPY!  any way it is bottled.</li>
