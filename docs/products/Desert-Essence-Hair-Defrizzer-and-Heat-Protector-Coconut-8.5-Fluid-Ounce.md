      <li>great smell, but has a tendency to make hair fly away.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to have found this.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue using this product because it&#x27;s a good heat protector for the price</li>
      <li>It has a light wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for the price it was a good product</li>
      <li>love it smells great works good too on the hair</li>
      <li>, I wish I had saved my money &amp; bought more of that instead!</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner in this line are amazing as well.</li>
      <li>The smell, although strong, is still a nice pleasant coconut that eventually fades once you start blow drying or heat styling your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always on a quest to find awesome natural products for my hair.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I am better off having nothing in my hair than this spray.  </li>
      <li>I use it in the winter for static electricity and dryness reduction.</li>
      <li>More time needed to determine the effectiveness of this spray as a heat protector.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>I love all Desert Essence products, and this one is no exception:)</li>
      <li>The coconut scent is overwhelming and smells expired to me.</li>
      <li>great product, nice coconut smell, works so well on my long, fine hair</li>
      <li>Works pretty good....smells nice too.</li>
      <li>Great overall product!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s organic, vegan and cruelty free.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the way it smells while I&#x27;m spraying it, but it does leave a nice scent to your hair after it dries.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this sooo much!</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and love how soft my hair feels when I use it.</li>
      <li>the only thing this product has going for it, is that Desert Essence is a good company, it is organic and cruelty free.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily it dissipates quickly and does not linger.</li>
      <li>I also throw one in my beach bag for a quick refresh after a rinse leaving the beach for the day.</li>
      <li>My hair turned out very pretty.</li>
      <li>I own the Coconut Soft Curling Cream (I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s called</li>
      <li>Not stiff at all, but still nice and straight and with some body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my daughter has wavy/curly hair that looks frizzy and this makes her hair so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I would be most likely to buy the Garnier DeFrizzer &amp; The Garnier Detangler!  </li>
      <li>I use the curl cream first</li>
      <li>All thanks to pinksofoxy from YouTube!</li>
      <li>absolutely recommend this!</li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s full of natural ingrediants.</li>
      <li>did not use this to blow dry because I felt it might do more damage control with a flat-iron</li>
      <li>Overall the product works fine</li>
      <li>This helped to get it straight without using excess heat.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, scent wasn&#x27;t quite as expected but still smells ok.</li>
      <li>This product Didn&#x27;t really work on my hair.</li>
      <li>Neah, very diluted spray.</li>
      <li>moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;Definetly this line of Desert Essence is my favorite over other brands.</li>
      <li>I usually go unscented with products, but this scent is really nice - not overpowering the way some scents are.  </li>
      <li>the smell is rather strong (of coconut, obviously) but to me this is such a nice quality product the smell doesn&#x27;t make me like it any less.</li>
      <li>Product must have been very old.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s natural and organic!</li>
      <li>my hair is so soft and silky, but not weighed down, and not the silicony smooth feel you get from the dimethicone products.  </li>
      <li>The Desert Essence Hair Defrizzer does untangle my hair &amp; it smells great, but within a few hours, it&#x27;s so crazy with static, that nothing will calm it down!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve avoided straightening my naturally curly hair since September of 2013.</li>
      <li>In my continuous quest to replace my products one at a time with natural stuff</li>
      <li>the frizz naturally.</li>
      <li>Mainly because I wanted to avoid the double jeopardy that is blow-drying and then flat-ironing.</li>
      <li>I spray it probably about 10-12 times on the ends of my hair, let it soak in while I do my makeup, then spray a few more times before I blow dry.</li>
      <li>I bought this hair defrizzer and Heat Protector because I have extremely long hair &amp; the ends are very damaged.</li>
      <li>Too much will make hair oily looking and limp, but a little will smooth and add shine.</li>
      <li>I bought this at a local natural grocery store.</li>
      <li>The Heat Protector, I have only used it one time so far</li>
      <li>I am in my 50s and I have short curly hair that I dye frequently.</li>
      <li>I tried it 3 times: on wet, freshly washed hair with blow dryer, on air-dried hair with straightening iron, and on dry unwashed hair with straightening iron.</li>
      <li>And second because I didn&#x27;t have a solid heat protector that was all natural and performed the way I wanted it to perform on my hair.</li>

<li> and it has a terrible smell too.  </li>
<li> but the smell is terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really love this product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is for the smell. It smells like coconut... and pencil shavings. This scent lingers for quite a while too.</li>
    <li> My hair stays in place without looking like it has been sprayed</li>
    <li> Product must have been very old.  Smelled horrible...through it away immediately.</li>
    <li> Great seller and a awesome product!!!!</li>
    <li> Overall the product works fine but the smell is terrible. The coconut scent is overwhelming and smells expired to me. It lingers for a while in my hair until I put hairspray or just don&#x27;t notice the smell anymore. I don&#x27;t plan to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on a quest to find awesome natural products for my hair. I own the Coconut Soft Curling Cream (I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s called but it is the sister to this product) and I&#x27;m on the fence about it. But this......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve avoided straightening my naturally curly hair since September of 2013. Mainly because I wanted to avoid the double jeopardy that is blow-drying and then flat-ironing. And second because I didn&#x27;t have a solid heat protector that was all natural and performed the way I wanted it to perform on my hair. Well, I&#x27;ve found that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use this to blow dry because I felt it might do more damage control with a flat-iron and I think I was correct. I sprayed my hair liberally with this (section by section) and allowed it to dry. Then I ran my flat iron over the hair a maximum of two times per section. This helped to get it straight without using excess heat. My hair turned out very pretty. Not stiff at all, but still nice and straight and with some body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one bad thing about this is the smell. It&#x27;s weird, slightly like coconut mixed with alcohol. Luckily it dissipates quickly and does not linger. I&#x27;ll continue using this product because it&#x27;s a good heat protector for the price and it&#x27;s organic, vegan and cruelty free. SCORE!</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift, so my information is second hand.  The defrizzer works well.  More time needed to determine the effectiveness of this spray as a heat protector.  As always with de frizz products, a little goes a long way.  Too much will make hair oily looking and limp, but a little will smooth and add shine.</li>
    <li> Use this regularly! As a brunette that is now blonde, hair color has dried my hair. This soothes and cal,s the frizz naturally. No cruelty or toxins! I use it prior to straightening always</li>
    <li> I use the curl cream first and then this to protect from hairdryer. They work perfectly together! My hair was dry, but since I&#x27;ve been using this, my curls are shiny and moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;Definetly this line of Desert Essence is my favorite over other brands.</li>
    <li> Great for thickening up thinner hair, but not frizzing or oily look!  Been using daily for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this sooo much! The shampoo and conditioner in this line are amazing as well. This is now my go to heat protecting spray. Plus, it&#x27;s natural and organic! Whoop whoop!</li>
    <li> This is really a great product!  I usually go unscented with products, but this scent is really nice - not overpowering the way some scents are.  Great overall product!</li>
    <li> Great product. It has a light wonderful scent. I love all Desert Essence products, and this one is no exception:)</li>
    <li> the only thing this product has going for it, is that Desert Essence is a good company, it is organic and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;however, as a hair product it sucks.  I am better off having nothing in my hair than this spray.  I tried it 3 times: on wet, freshly washed hair with blow dryer, on air-dried hair with straightening iron, and on dry unwashed hair with straightening iron. in ALL of these cases, the product made my hair STICKY, causing additional tangles, it didn&#x27;t help with frizz and left my hair feeling like straw. of ...and it has a terrible smell too.  I am truly disappointed with the product, and disappointed with the seller for not allowing me to return it. boo</li>
    <li> This product Didn&#x27;t really work on my hair. I am in my 50s and I have short curly hair that I dye frequently. Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> great product, nice coconut smell, works so well on my long, fine hair</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, scent wasn&#x27;t quite as expected but still smells ok.</li>
    <li> hi got this coconut defrizzer today love it smells great works good too on the hair</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and has helped protect my hair</li>
    <li> I rarely buy hair products in the mail for myself especially at these prices but these products made my hair smell horrible &amp; stiff &amp; tacky. Wasted money &amp; had to rewash my hair. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local natural grocery store. I LOVE IT.  I don&#x27;t really like the way it smells while I&#x27;m spraying it, but it does leave a nice scent to your hair after it dries.  It seems to last a long time. I use allot - my  hair is color processed and I blow dry it every other day. I spray it probably about 10-12 times on the ends of my hair, let it soak in while I do my makeup, then spray a few more times before I blow dry. my hair is so soft and silky, but not weighed down, and not the silicony smooth feel you get from the dimethicone products.  my daughter has wavy/curly hair that looks frizzy and this makes her hair so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> In my continuous quest to replace my products one at a time with natural stuff I was so happy to have found this. All thanks to pinksofoxy from YouTube! The smell, although strong, is still a nice pleasant coconut that eventually fades once you start blow drying or heat styling your hair.</li>
    <li> great smell, but has a tendency to make hair fly away. Would not buy again. Was hoping for the price it was a good product</li>
    <li> Works pretty good....smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair defrizzer and Heat Protector because I have extremely long hair &amp; the ends are very damaged. I was using Garnier Anti-Frizz &amp; it was wonderful, I wish I had saved my money &amp; bought more of that instead! The Desert Essence Hair Defrizzer does untangle my hair &amp; it smells great, but within a few hours, it&#x27;s so crazy with static, that nothing will calm it down!  The Heat Protector, I have only used it one time so far and I can&#x27;t complain at all. It left my hair feeling nice and soft.  I would be most likely to buy the Garnier DeFrizzer &amp; The Garnier Detangler!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> absolutely recommend this! it&#x27;s 100% vegan/cruelty-free and it&#x27;s full of natural ingrediants. i use it after washing my hair to de-frizz and also before blow-drying and straightening as a heat protectant. the smell is rather strong (of coconut, obviously) but to me this is such a nice quality product the smell doesn&#x27;t make me like it any less.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and love how soft my hair feels when I use it. I use it in the winter for static electricity and dryness reduction. As for the summer I have a pool and use it after every shower to protect my hair from the chlorine. I also throw one in my beach bag for a quick refresh after a rinse leaving the beach for the day.</li>
    <li> Neah, very diluted spray. Does not do anything for the hair and the smell is unbearable.</li>
