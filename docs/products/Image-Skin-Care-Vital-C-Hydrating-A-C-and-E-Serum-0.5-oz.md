      <li>Lots of great stuff but not this one and only 1/2 an ounce...</li>
      <li>I love the vital C serum perfect for a combo serum due to the fact that most of the items you have to buy you have to get them seperately which.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a vitamin c serum and with that said, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve started.</li>
      <li>This is great for dry and aging skin.  </li>

      <li>I hadn&#x27;t ever tried this serum, but I have used and loved all the other Image&lt;br /&gt;products</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not super impressed but I like it. Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The Image Vital C Hydrating A C &amp; E Serum is great! I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it. It hydrates my skin and makes it look clear and soft. For the price, there&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.  It met my expestations. The skin is glowing.  Thank you very much for this service</li>
    <li> Love this Vital C i use this at night and my face in the Morning has a nice color,This absorbs fast into skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have super dry skin. This keeps my skin from getting /feeling oily, and also helps my skin from looking cakey or flaking when I am only using a powder. The first time/day I used this my boyfriend touched my face and said &#x27; Your skin is so soft!&#x27; Hmmm you&#x27;ve touched my face before! This was the only thing I could think made the difference. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hydrating serum i have ever used. I have used it for several years now. And Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> Great  product for the face</li>
    <li> When it comes to HA and Vit C serums, this is my favorite. I am a Skincare therapist and I use many different lines, and i always have this one on my shelf. Always.</li>
    <li> Takes quite a bit for full coverage of neck and face.  Non-greasy</li>
    <li> This is a fake. I purchased the original at a beauty salon and had a very good experience with it. But this is a knock-off. Even the smell isn&#x27;t the same. If I had carefully read all the negative reviews, I would go back and not buy it. I WASTED MONEY.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum. Unfortunately, the container was smaller than I usually buy, which was disaapointing.  But the serum itself is awesome.  I love the way it does on my skin and the way it is completely natural.  I can put it on my eyelids with no burning, even though it smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> This has really changed my skin! My skin is so soft and more even textured now. My occasional acne breakout have become much less as well. Love this whole skin care line and I promise you cant beat the results for the price!</li>
    <li> I enjoy all the Vital c skincare products from Image, I recommend it highly. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you are over 40 and need moisture in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I added this produce to the other Vital C products it made a noticeable difference in the moisture level in my skin. YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this serum, and was really happy with it. Not only it arrived fast and in good (together with another Image product I ordered), but my skin really did feel hydrated. Since I have a dry skin, I use this serum together with Image cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br /&gt;Why I give the product only 4 stars? it&#x27;s because, for me personally, it is not comfortable to use the dropper (which would be so much better if it had a pump). You have to be very careful when putting the dropper back into the bottle, otherwise, you might spill it out, which happened to me a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the serum is great, Im ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Best skin care line ever!!!! Everyone is noticing that my skin looks &amp;#34; new and refreshed&amp;#34;  Smells wonderful! I will never use another line again</li>
    <li> This is great for dry and aging skin.  The serum is absorbed quick and the results show within days.  I use it under the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I kind of expected this to be rather oily on my skin, but is actually very lightweight and not greasy feeling at all.  I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed a HUGE difference, but I have started the Vital C regimine and I am hoping that it works!  I do feel like my skin is softer!</li>
    <li> Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
    <li> I think this may be a knock-off.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I buy from the salon, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same on my face from my salon that is a licensed dealer for Image products.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I found this serum a bit difficult to use.  I have started mixing it with my night cream, but I don&#x27;t think I would reorder.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the vital C serum perfect for a combo serum due to the fact that most of the items you have to buy you have to get them seperately which. This serum is light and does not leave your skin greasy feeling throughout the day. I pair with a light mosturizer that includes SPF to get an overall coverage for face.</li>
    <li> My daughter now looks very young and vibrant. Maybe it is all in my mind because I love her so much. Her children(my gkids) also remarked on how well she looked, so it must be true. I am usually VERY cynical and sceptical of women&#x27;s cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit disappointing compared to the rest of the Image skin care line.  It smells like old frying oil. I cannot see it doing anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> Great communication, love this product !!  Great for that over 45 skin!!!!</li>
    <li> Product does wonders for evening out skin tone and has a great citrus smell to it!</li>
    <li> When I received the item the label on the bottle did not look my bottle that I had purchased at a salon. So I&#x27;m hoping this is not a knock off which I&#x27;ve read about happening.  It has a distinct orange scent which I don&#x27;t remember my original having.  I will try it and hope for the best with my skin. If anyone else has had a problem I&#x27;d like to know.  I</li>
    <li> Helps to heal my skin and it is easily absorbed, no greasy feeling, which is good for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!! first time user great stuff and it arrived so fast....wonderful. I have told my friends all about it</li>
    <li> Works well with my other serums, is light and keeps me hydrated.</li>
    <li> i HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT NUMEROUS TIMES IN THE PAST AND LOVE IT.  THIS ITEM WAS NOT AS I&#x27;M USED TO.  ALTHOUGH IT WAS SEALED, IT HAD A DIFFERENT SMELL AND WAS A LOT RUNNIER IN CONSISTENCY THAN I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO WITH PREVIOUS USE OF THIS PRODUCT.  I AM NOT SURE WHY THIS ITEM WAS NOT THE SAME.</li>
    <li> I love image skin care, vital c and ormedic lines are my favorites. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a vitamin c serum and with that said, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve started. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks and my face has already gotten better. It is seriously better than testimonies cream for me and a lot less irritating.</li>
    <li> I use &amp;#34;IMAGE&amp;#34; products because the Professional Skin Therapist I go to recommends these.  She uses these on her clients and also sells these products in her shop.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the order &amp; shipment experience going thru AMAZON.COM for these purchases.</li>
    <li> Had this product recommended when getting a facial for treating an age spot.  It worked !!!  It really makes the skin glow.  Loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum and learned the hard way not to use too much at a time. Other than being gentle with use, I like this product.</li>
    <li> This is perfect and what I had been looking for I use it almost every day and love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this because my salon charges $40 plus tip for this product.  Crazy.  Arrived quickly.  Very pleased.  I don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This is part of my morning routine and helps with the melasma and discoloration I have - no one can tell I struggle with this!</li>
    <li> Excellent serum combined with other Image One skin care products.  Worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product and I&#x27;m not happy with it at all.</li>
    <li> Great experience would use again</li>
    <li> I love all Vital C products!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t ever tried this serum, but I have used and loved all the other Image&lt;br /&gt;products so I gave it a try....I will now add this to my arsenal of products that&lt;br /&gt;keep &amp;#34;age tracks&amp;#34; from my face!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Murad works so much better. I believe this is mainly water in the bottle. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me. I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use this assuming it will feel greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t at all.  I use it in the morning and evening. My skin feels softer, brighter and has more of a glow.  Very nice product. Love this whole line.</li>
    <li> We love this serum! I have really liked all the products I have tried from the Vital C line. My mom uses it religiously, and it was she who got me hooked, when she gave me part of a tube of the Vital C Enzyme mask to use after I got my first chemical peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying, keep in mind that a little goes a long way.Use the dropper to evenly distribute the syrum, as well as to target  application on problem areas.The dropper has a hair trigger, so be mindful as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the skin lightening serum from the same line before buying this. I prefer this one. It seems more suited to my skin&#x27;s needs, packs a stronger punch in the vitamin C department, and seems more potent in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that it costs more, but until I find a vitamin C serum of comparable quality at a better value, I will be buying this one!</li>
    <li> Like all Image Skincare products I have tried so far, I love it. Don&#x27;t need much to cover your face, the oil penetrates in the skin very fast, it doesn&#x27;t smell anything (which I prefer). The effect is immediate in terms of hydration and glow, and after 2 weeks of daily use I am noticing my skin is radiant even right after waking up.</li>
    <li> I have been using Image products since they were first developed in 2003 (my salon was one of the first to carry them). I have sensitive, oily, acne/rosacea skin that I have struggled with all my life. The Vital C line calms redness, hydrates without feeling greasy, and helps my skin glow. I love this serum as it absorbs quickly so I can layer it under other lotion, sunscreen, or makeup. You can also add a few drops to whatever skincare you are already using for an added boost of vitamins. After a few weeks, your skin will glow.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum</li>
    <li> I use it morning and night.  I works great! Very hydrating. I&#x27;m glad to have found an eye serum that works!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend buys it every year and loves it very much. She looks younger as her age  so it is working, I think.</li>
    <li> I love Images products! I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;m able to purchase them in Amazon. My skin is soooo picky but is now very happy.</li>
    <li> Watered down.  Why don&#x27;t I believe the negative reviews -- because they are tempered with GREAT reviews.  look -- this stuff stinks and it is mostly water -- THE END</li>
    <li> I am using this product on the advice of my physician.  I love the smell and feel of the product.  It is too early to tell if it is making a difference, but I like the smell and feel of the product.  It smells like I have just peeled an orange!</li>
    <li> I was expecting more...but I always am! the coconut lightner is wonderful and there lipgloss...my goodness, it is way OVERPRICED...but I just have to get in once in a while. also the b5 serum is good the clenser w the green lable smells great...awesome sunscreen. Lots of great stuff but not this one and only 1/2 an ounce...no trials...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love getting trials!</li>
    <li> My skin gets dry in the winter and the image vital c hydrating serum is a big help. It keeps skin hydrated. My skin is bright and healthy and I highly recommend image products.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I  started using this product 2 days ago and my skin is loving it. Very light and product smells fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/7/2013 -Months later- like most of the product that you use you cannot see the results until months continous use. Usually your skin breaks out or dries not. This is still one of the best products that I have used. My skin absorbs the product instantly with no reaction. Very hydrating.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product and I really like it a lot.  Sometimes I put it on under makeup and love the glow in my skin.  Now that I am older, my skin is drier, but this product does what it says.  Your skin looks so refreshed.  Since I have really clear skin, I am thinking about wearing far less make-up.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Very Hydrating and helps with hyper pigmentation ! Not greasy and smells like an orange! Wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> I like the IMAGE product line especially the ones smell like orange. I was hoping this would be a great addition, but it smells funny, I would not buy it again. I only use this product when my boyfriend is out of town...</li>
