      <li>(Truth be told, I believe this is the stuff they use at the popular massage chain, Massage Envy.)</li>
      <li>Nice feel, and did not leave areas tacky afterwards as massage oil can.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best combination of oils and lotions to appropriate balance and accommodate a smooth and flowing canvas by which to keep clients skin smooth and the massage to be conducted with flow and ease.</li>

      <li>Absolutely love Biotone lotion.</li>
      <li>This product was my favorite through school and will remain my favorite.</li>

      <li>I have found it doesn&#x27;t work much better than my Bath and Body Works hand cream.</li>

      <li>Better yet: Who didn&#x27;t talk.</li>
      <li>As a licenses massage therapist, this is probably my favorite massage lube.  </li>
      <li>I love this massage lotion.  </li>
      <li>My favorite lotion for doing massage.</li>
      <li>Just love this product.</li>

      <li>Biotone is a product I&#x27;ve been using for many years</li>
      <li>This has been one of my favorite to use.</li>
      <li>These product alone will make working as a massage therapist all the more enjoyable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lasts a long time when massaging.  No odor, no stains.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion, works into the skin well. I don&#x27;t think it dries up too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I had with mine is it arrived with a broken pump-- think I&#x27;ll buy the tube next time.&lt;br /&gt;No smell on this lotion at all.</li>
    <li> The pump broke the second time I used it. The lotion itself was very runny. Not my favorite for massage.</li>
    <li> Usually I use unscented massage oil, but I wanted to try this. Nice feel, and did not leave areas tacky afterwards as massage oil can. It washed off my hands very easily with soap and water, which I see as a big benefit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Biotone lotion. Moisturizes the skin and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too quickly. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the refill gallon.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Has a great glide and leaves skin luminously moisturized but not greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Biotone is a product I&#x27;ve been using for many years and it&#x27;s always worked great for me.  The only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is the smell, most people wouldn&#x27;t notice it but I really didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> I got this from massage therapy school at NHI with the oil.Never used this on anyone else and now Im using it for hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It grapeseed apricot and sesame.It has almost no fragrance at all.Its light,thin and I have it on my computer desk.</li>
    <li> The lotion is very energizing. It doesn&#x27;t dry up as quickly as most lotions I&#x27;ve worked with in the past. It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling slippery or oily. The bottle is well designed with a collar around the neck that allows for locking the pump without having to force the pump down first (in the process, wasting a pump of lotion) and the top of the pump has a nice contour which allows for easy, one-handed application making it easier to keep one hand on the client while you re-apply.    Fantastic stuff, it will be a staple of my massage therapy business.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Non greasy.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I just had gotten a massage table for personal use and wanted to get some massage oils and lotions.  I purchased several.  This product is by far my favorite.  It has a good ability to be smooth while massaging skin.  It stays on and doesn&#x27;t get flaky or dry.  It&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kindof expensive for my tastes but I&#x27;ll probably get the gallon size when I purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbed by skin quickly.  Use a little bit and lasts all day. Highly recomment for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great massage lotion.  My physical therapist recommended it. Perfect for deep tissue work!</li>
    <li> Pretty good...works well and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Long-lasting glide, but not too slick so that you can&#x27;t go deep</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  The lotion works well when massaging clients.  I just prefer to use massage cream over lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great massage lotion. Not a lot of lotion needed and it does not have an oily texture. No scent and works great.</li>
    <li> used it few times. No smell, very smooth. I like it. However, the price is a little too much compared to other brand.</li>
    <li> Great all around lotion and hypo allergenic. The glide is great for deep tissue and no scent. My clients love this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love biotone and my rating is not due to the lotion, which I would give 5 stars. It&#x27;s the pump / bottle. This is the 2nd time in a row that I&#x27;ve ordered this item and both bottles the pump is non functional.</li>
    <li> Great product for massage - professional or otherwise - this is a white lotion that reduces friction but is also not greasy nor detrimental to the skin.  Has a little bit of &amp;#34;grap&amp;#34; for the massage yet allows hands, forearms to slide over skin and muscle.  No need to wash off as it is made with quality oils and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Cant wait to use it on the wife</li>
    <li> I have used this product alone and with other oils when doing massage. It is not the least bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and my wife (my only client) really likes the lotion better than the oils.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Leaves your skin feeling supple and smooth and almost as good as if you&#x27;ve just had a professional massage. (Truth be told, I believe this is the stuff they use at the popular massage chain, Massage Envy.) The only thing that could improve this product is if it came with a strong-handed masseuse named S&amp;ouml;ren who didn&#x27;t talk too much. Better yet: Who didn&#x27;t talk. At all.</li>
    <li> I love this massage lotion.  It provides the perfect balance of glide and friction.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other lotions, but nothing else measures up.</li>
    <li> Prompt and as described.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how quickly I went through the 8oz bottle.  I had to use so much of this lotion on each client because it absorbs so quickly.  I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great for massage therapy.</li>
    <li> So when I ordered this I could have swore it was for the Gel, but apparently it wasn&#x27;t and I received this instead. I hate lotion for massages, it dries up too quickly and doesn&#x27;t have good glide potential! My own fault I guess, will look closer next time!!!!</li>
    <li> Light, easy-to-use lotion, works well for a wide variety of massage techniques.  Works for connective tissue massage as well as for Swedish.  I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, and the smell of this lotion is barely noticeable.  The 8 oz bottle is a nice amount to start with if you&#x27;re getting used to lotions.  I&#x27;ve been using this pump bottle for several months and it&#x27;s held up so far.  I ended up buying the 1 gallon refill bottle - I like this lotion.</li>
    <li> wonderful glide, control, and texture. no messy clean up and easy to wash off. would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Best products on the planet</li>
    <li> the pump doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I have to say, I was a bit disappointed to find that I have to apply this lotion more frequently during massage, which interupts my flow. I will try blending it with some sweet almond oil, so it doesnt dry out on the skin. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs well...but maybe just too much. Handy for clients that are fitting in a session in between work.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful massage lotion. It has just enough oil in it to make it easy to massage, but it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like others I have used.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the reviews of others and I was not dissapointed!  I am just starting my massage therapy certification and I wanted something to practice with.  This is odorless, not sticky or messy and still provides great glidability.  The best testimonial I can give is that my boyfriend said he didn&#x27;t feel like he had to shower it off once the massage was over.  Great product!  I will continue to buy this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this as massage oil. I am allergig to fragrances and this product does not give me any rushes or such. However, it is a little bit too thick for massages. I expected a more oil-like product. The advantage: It stays more on the body and does not drip as much as oil would do.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again,</li>
    <li> I like bio tone massage creams. I have my therapists use this on me. Order this and others all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought the Biotone massage lotion hoping that it would be a good lotion to use on my daughter, who is a gymnast. I often rub her sore muscles and wanted a massage lotion similar to the one my massage therapist uses on me (he buys a special brand in 5 gallon containers...way more than I need).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biotone lotion got such good reviews, I was hoping it would be as good as the professional brand my therapist uses. I was sadly disappointed. Its staying power is very short-lived, and the &amp;#34;high glide&amp;#34; quality of it lasts for about one minute.  I find myself applying more every couple of minutes in order to retain the right amount of friction. My daughter does not have dry skin, so I don&#x27;t understand why it seems to absorb so quickly, truly like a lotion you might buy at the store. I have found it doesn&#x27;t work much better than my Bath and Body Works hand cream. It does claim to absorb clean, like a lotion, but again, I would have expected it to not absorb quite so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even thought it says it is unscented, it does have a very faint odor.  Nothing bad, but not completely unscented. It did not affect my ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, and it doesnt have a harsh floral smell that bothers someone.  Its just a great lotion that works well</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Perfect consistency and no smell</li>
    <li> This is the best massage lotion because it glides seamlessly and doesn&#x27;t ball up or get sticky. It&#x27;s far better than oils since it doesn&#x27;t leave oil stains and doesn&#x27;t make you greasy. The pump functions well without any problems. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out, but didn&#x27;t like it when compared to FreeUp Massage lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It is thin like a hand lotion and absorbs more quickly than the thicker stuff that comes in tubs.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try somethign new, but I&#x27;ll probably just stick with the FreeUp from now on.</li>
    <li> great product and easy to use as a massage therapist.</li>
    <li> Great massage lotion.  My only negative comment is the price, but it is worth it for how many uses we got with this lotion before having to purchase a second bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapy student so I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of experimenting with different gels, lotions, and oils over the past year. This has been one of my favorite to use. It doesn&#x27;t dry out too quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it over-lubricates. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I really really love this lotion. My massage therapist used it and I knew then I needed to buy some. I will continue to buy and use this product.</li>
    <li> The lotion is fine, but they did a horrible job packaging them with the massage bed sheet sets I purchased. One of the bottles broke at the pump.</li>
    <li> As always, this is a great product that I have been using for years and years. Thank you for providing it.</li>
    <li> I like the massage lotion a lot. I have been a Biotone user for a while, but preferred the massage cream until recently. Takes too long to apply for a home user. The lotion has no offensive odor and absorbs into the skin within minutes. Not oily! Makes me very happy! This lotion is lighter than the cream and spreads better, easier, and more quickly on the body, than the cream, but gives the same level of moisturizing. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pump. Hence the 4 stars. Way too small for dispensing any decent amount. I bought a Biotone dispenser bottle for $16 to see if that solves my problems......This lotion is expensive in the 8 oz bottles, but much more affordable in the 1/2 gallon size. If I fix the dispenser problem, the bigger size will be my next purchase....Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite massage lotion.  The scent is very faint; I don&#x27;t care for perfumed lotion.  I have had many people with various skin allergies and none have any problems with this product (myself included).  My favorite thing about this, as compared to other massage lotions, is that it is perfectly between being too slick and too dry.  It is great for deep tissue massage, without slipping greasily over the muscle or having irritating friction on the skin.  And by varying the amount applied you can get quite a range of friction or lack there of; perfect for any massage technique I&#x27;ve ever known.  I use other massage lotions as well, but only when I have to.  This is my go-to, and has been for years now.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion for doing massage. I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> As a licenses massage therapist, this is probably my favorite massage lube.  Works well, has great workability and glide without being too greasy.  So it is also suitable for deeper tissue work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Biotone and I will continue to do so.  This product was my favorite through school and will remain my favorite.</li>
    <li> I like that it is truly unscented as some lotions are labeled as such, but still have some sort of smell. This one truly has no smell. Has a good glide. Only setback I have found is that it needs to be reapplied frequently. Dries/absorbs extremely quickly.</li>
    <li> my husband bought, so I do not know the price- so not sure if it was good value. But my product review is I love this. I use it as my go-to lotion, even though we were supposed to buy it for massage purposes :)</li>
    <li> The wife and I love the stuff. It isn&#x27;t slimy or greasy and does not dry with residue but my favorite, it don&#x27;t smell of perfumes.</li>
    <li> No smells works as a great massage lotion.</li>
    <li> The massause loves it  I don&#x27;t wipe off keeps the skin soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of biotone products, but this is the one I use and it is the only non-greasy option.</li>
    <li> We use this for gua sha, and it works quite well for that.</li>
    <li> have horses and often shower three times a day. i have dry sensitive skin and i always rather up when i get out. affordable. i recommend</li>
    <li> I researched and purchased this lotion about 8 months ago to take along to my chiropractor and massage therapist treatments; both continue to comment on how much they like working with my lotion.  I love this stuff - it doesn&#x27;t smell (I have one of the most sensitive sniffers on the planet), it lasts well during a 60-minute massage, and when used as a moisturizing lotion it absorbs easily.  It is also non-staining.  My chiropractor got some on my slacks once and it washed-out completely.  I see a few massagers complain that they need to use too much, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me whatsoever.  I&#x27;ve had five months worth of weekly visits to chiropractor and/or massage therapist and still have more than an ounce  left in my 8-oz bottle.  I&#x27;m ordering the gallon now, so I can moisturize and still have plenty left for therapy appointments!</li>
    <li> I received the package and half of the lotion was on the outside of the bottle. Other than that it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> the product came with a broken pump, but the cream was still useable.  I bought a replacement pump from the store.</li>
    <li> Great for self massage. Not sticky.</li>
    <li> No smell, not greasy residue, it&#x27;s thin enough to be easily spread on the skin. It lasted me almost a year (of getting a back massage 3-4 times a month from my boyfriend). I&#x27;m about to get another bottle.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion as a licensed massage therapist for thirteen years.  My clients often told me that they liked this lotion because it left their skin soft but not greasy.  I still like it for after- shower moisturizing.</li>
    <li> seems like I use too much product especially on a full body massage.  Ok for smaller areas.  I liked the pump though..</li>
    <li> Great product for professional use or like me occasional massage giver. It&#x27;s sliky semi odorless (kinda smells like almond) but by adding fragrance oil it can enhance the massage experience.</li>
    <li> This massage lotion is thinner, which means a person needs to reapply more often.  However, it is more silky than creme.  It really depends on what someone prefers.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Great pump.</li>
    <li> Bought this when recommended by my massage therapist. It works very well and evaporates without any stickiness or odor. The pump head isn&#x27;t the greatest. It broke when initially released. We may have done it incorrectly. There were no instructions how to do so.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll be absorbed into your skin very smoothly. Pump-up neck is nice and easier to use than other bigger tube one.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars, however the lotion does not last as long as it says it does and multiple applications were needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it was pretty good.</li>
    <li> Just love this product. It is great for anyone who requires a massage on a regular basis.  Not greasy and takes very little which makes the lotion last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like that this is long lasting, has no sticky residue and no scent. I think the creme may be a better product, for better glide, but this is a good product too.</li>
    <li> non greasy, perfect for massages and hot stones. makes the skin glide and no residue. Def will continue to order this</li>
    <li> I wanted a product with no smell that would glide well.  Both of those requirements were met.  My boyfriend was able to roll over and go to sleep instead of needing to be cleaned off due to stickiness or stench. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bring this when I travel in case the masseur has only oil available.  This is a smooth, long lasting and non-greasy lotion that is ideal for massage.  It does condition my skin and it is not necessary to shower immediately after the massage.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is viscous, lasts quite some time and does not have a greasy, slimy feel.  The product is unscented and hydrates very well.</li>
    <li> Bio tone makes excellent massage lotion. I never feel greasy or smelly after using it and it applies so smoothly. This is my go to massage lotion!</li>
    <li> Not bad - may go for coconut oil next time. Does rub into skin well, and didn&#x27;t seem to come off on the sheets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion in the past and have just stuck with it.  Good product and I recommend it.  No problems.</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist, I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of lotion over the years but I always return to Biotone products.  This has great glide but also works well for deep tissue work.</li>
    <li> a great hypoallergenic massage lotion!</li>
    <li> Good product... Why are you insisting I write more words then what is necessary to say the product works for me..?</li>
    <li> Very good product. I will use only this one now...</li>
    <li> I found out about this lotion when I got a massage.  It is excellent!  It soaks into the skin rather than leaving it oily.  With oil, I have to take a shower very soon, or I end up feeling icky/sticky for the rest of the day.  We now keep this on the nightstand at home.  (Warning: Hardwood floors are especially slippery after getting a foot massage!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem I have is that it&#x27;s expensive.  The [[ASIN:B001204REM Biotone Advanced Therapy Lotion - Half Gallon]], on the other hand is about one-third the cost - but I really don&#x27;t care to have *that* on my nightstand.  It&#x27;s really hard to refill the 8-ounce bottle, but I figured out a nice trick that makes it easy:&lt;br /&gt; * Buy a 16 ounce plastic funnel - the thickest part of the neck should just barely fit into the top of the 8-oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt; * Using a sharp knife (a kitchen knife will do) cut off the funnel&#x27;s neck so that about 1/2 inch will still fit into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt; * Now the trick: The funnel has 3 or 4 little ridges running down the sides and neck.  Using the knife, trim off the ridges where the funnel neck fits into the bottle so that you have a good seal between the bottle and the funnel.  (You normally like the ridges - they let air escape from the container when you pour stuff in the funnel.)&lt;br /&gt; * Set the funnel into the small bottle and \\&quot;pour\\&quot; from the big bottle into the funnel.  There&#x27;s no pouring, of course - you have to squeeze out a glob into the funnel.  Set the big bottle down.&lt;br /&gt; * Now, squeeze the small bottle (a lot) to push out air.  Smack the bottle and funnel down onto the counter to close up the hole.  Let the small bottle expand, and it will suck in a bunch of lotion.&lt;br /&gt; * Repeat until done.  Don&#x27;t try to fill the bottle all the way up.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this to use on my back for my chronic pain. She is very sensitive with odors and oils. This lotion works very well and does not leave my back sticky or oily like some lotions can. Well worth the money for us.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for massage therapist. Great brand. Easy glide with effleurage, non oily, washes off easy, doesn&#x27;t leave client oily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in school for massage therapy and I use primarily BioTone products.  This was my least favorite so far.  I found it soaked in too quickly and I was needing to use way more lotion that I normally do.</li>
    <li> professional massage therapist use and trust biotone as an industry standard. it&#x27;s the best combination of oils and lotions to appropriate balance and accommodate a smooth and flowing canvas by which to keep clients skin smooth and the massage to be conducted with flow and ease. A bit pricey, but it&#x27;s really worth it. Buy the squirt bottle and then the large refill when the bottle runs out. These product alone will make working as a massage therapist all the more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Great hypoallergenic, fragrance free massage lotion. A little costly but works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This massage lotion has been a great help. My wife has a sore back and is VERY sensitive to smells and perfumes. This lotion is unscented and works great. This would be a good option for a pregnant couple.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion! It&#x27;s great to find a smooth, non stinky lotion that can be used for sex.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived already opened and the pump engaged. Due to safe fears/ health issues I through it out. Never even got to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  If you are looking for Massage lotion that does not smell, does not leave a nasty oily after effect, moisturizes, and is really smooth to use... this is it.  You do end up using a lot due to it essentially working itself into the skin and evaporating, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and works great for a massage.  I massage my husband&#x27;s tired feet and he loved it because it was not greasy or oily at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have bought or used.  It truly has no smell, leaving a non-greasy clean feeling. Go for it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this for professional massage therapy. Perfect balance of slip and grip. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and absorbs nicely. Also rinses easily from sheets without leaving residue or odor.</li>
    <li> I use as massage lotion for a client. Odorless, calming and decent slip.</li>
    <li> Have used it before and glad we were able to get it again. Great lotion gets into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
    <li> This has a nice texture and a very nice smell to it. Only issue is that it soaks in a little too soon.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion very much.  It has the perfect friction when applying it to message and it is not greasy.</li>
