      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit.</li>
      <li>Justified Labs sent me a system for free to review and I immediately said of course!</li>
      <li>My mom always told me that it was important to make a good first impresstion.  </li>
      <li>and I was very excited when Justified Laboratories provided me with this kit for review.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was packed well in nice packaging, it was packed in a way I could have thrown the kit in my purse right away to travel.</li>
      <li>gel was really easy to apply to the tray.&lt;br /&gt;*The</li>
      <li>directions were really easy to understand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>kit is incredibly easy to use.</li>
      <li>I got to try this product free for review its super high quality, works great, easy to use.</li>
      <li>and I can see a huge difference.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend, however, experienced no white gums or sensitivity</li>
      <li>The kit includes a UV light, just like when whitening in the dentist office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Why would you go to the Dentist to get whitening done when you have access to an at home UV light.</li>
      <li>I got to try this product for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>UV light did have a tendency to slip out of my mouth, so I had to hold it still in my mouth at times.</li>
      <li>Turn on the mini light and place it against the front of the tray.</li>
      <li>was sent 5 syringes with the whitening gel in them along with the light and mouthpiece.</li>
      <li>You then place it in your mouth along with the UV light and keep it there for about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>This keeps the mini light from turning on in transit.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different whitening products and I have to say this is on of the best by far that I have tried.</li>
      <li>This is important to do this correctly because if you don&#x27;t it won&#x27;t work the way it should.</li>
      <li>I know, that way, that the UV light was not used by anyone else</li>
      <li>Included in the kit are ;5 5ML syringes of 44% carbamide peroxide, a mouth guard, as well as a UV light.</li>
      <li>Just light bite on the mouth piece to hold it in place.</li>
      <li>It came with five things filled with whitening gel, the mouth piece that  lights up and a silicone mouth piece.  </li>
      <li>I think part of the enhancement is the light that you use in conjunction with the trays and gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light mint flavor that leaves you feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>There was no swelling or redness of the gums in which I have experienced in most other teeth whitening stripes and there was also so burning feeling.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this kit I was beyond excited to try it because of the UV light being included in the kit</li>
      <li>overall opinion – this is a great product, for a great price, and it really works!!&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to review the Justified Laboratories Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit for free.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient in the gel that makes it so effective is the 44% Carbamide Peroxide.</li>
      <li>The product is ok but the light broke the first use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this for review purposes.</li>
      <li>All statements above are my own!</li>
      <li>I was asked to review a professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit from Justified Laboratories and it’s amazing.</li>
      <li>I liked that the light had a clear tab I had to remove in order to get it to work.  </li>
      <li>I love having nice and white teeth</li>
      <li>Super accurate 10</li>
      <li>Let me begin by saying, as most people realize, your smile is something that people notice right away.  </li>
      <li>so bright people will need SHADES to look at you outside.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>so your mouth is quite full for the 20 minutes you wear it</li>
      <li>I absolute love this teeth whitening system.</li>
      <li>this is right up that alley, everyone noticing my Brite smile great feed back.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and easy and if you have Prime, free.</li>
      <li>whitening products, cause my teeth or gums to be super</li>
      <li>Its super squishy and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
      <li>and I love doing it at home using products like Justified Laboratories&#x27; Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit.</li>
      <li>All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>This product is very well thought of, reasonably priced and most importantly, it delivers what it promises to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have a huge sweet tooth and drink way too much soda.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let me begin by saying, as most people realize, your smile is something that people notice right away.  My mom always told me that it was important to make a good first impresstion.  Well I am a firm believer that having a white smile will leave not only a lasting first impression but every impression following that.  I have always had a natural yellowish teeth color.  This is not due to smoking, as I am not a smoker and never have been, but more due to drinking coffee and dark sodas, which I no longer do but the damage is done. When I ordered this kit I was beyond excited to try it because of the UV light being included in the kit means that it really is a professional teeth whitening kit, you see when you whiten in the dentists office you sit under a bigger version of the light that comes with this packet. When I got the package it did not disappoint.  It was packed well in nice packaging, it was packed in a way I could have thrown the kit in my purse right away to travel. I have listed my impressions of the product below:  Pros: - Comes with a mini UV light that is the same is what the Professional Dentists use in office to whiten your teeth.  Why would you go to the Dentist to get whitening done when you have access to an at home UV light. - I liked that the light had a clear tab I had to remove in order to get it to work.  I know, that way, that the UV light was not used by anyone else and it wasn&#x27;t wasting battery time bumping around on during packaging, shipping and handling. - The instructions are extremely clear on what to do.  If you follow them step by step (I always had the printed out intructions in front of me when I was planning on using the UV light which ensured no mess ups on my part) instructions included in the product you will NO DOUBTEDLY have a smile that is so bright people will need SHADES to look at you outside. - The flavor of the gel isn&#x27;t too overwhelming but it is not chaulky tasting or greesy feeling. It&#x27;s a light mint flavor that leaves you feeling refreshed. - The syringes of solution last longer that one application.  One syringe can be used for up to 10 applications (my personal one still had solution in it after 10 applications) so a little goes a long way.  This is a major plus for anyone who does use teeth stain causing things in their lives as they have MANY applications with the first purchase. - You can order more syringes when you run out. - The trays fit easily in my mouth without feeling like they are too bulky or weird and has a nice hole for ventilation so I don&#x27;t feel like I am blocking my mouth with a hard object.   Cons: - I didn&#x27;t find this sooner! LOL  All in all, I am SO BEYOND glad that I got this teeth whitening kit and look forward to using it to keep my teeth white instead of yellow.  *I got this product free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, truthful review.</li>
    <li> Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit 5 ml Syringes &amp; Mouth Trays Designed for At Home Use &amp; Formulated in a FDA Certified Laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sense I quit smoking 5 years ago I am always trying to get my teeth to be whiter. I have tried many different whitening products and I have to say this is on of the best by far that I have tried. I think part of the enhancement is the light that you use in conjunction with the trays and gel. I have been impressed with the results I am getting to this point, So if you are looking for something to enhance your whitening experience get this. I think you will be impressed as I was,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Place a small bead of gel from the 5 cc syringe into the upper portion of the tray, about a drop or .5 cc per arch on the inner facial side of the try that will rest on the visible teeth. The duplex tray covers both the bottom and top arch at the same time. Please note to use just a drop and spread it evenly around the tray using the syringe tip for both the upper and lower portion of the tray. Next open the mini blue light accelerator battery cover and carefully remove the clear safety strip from under the batteries and put the batteries back in the same way as they came out. This keeps the mini light from turning on in transit. Turn on the mini light and place it against the front of the tray. Keep holding it against the tray and teeth for no more than 20 minutes. Next rinse the tray in cool water. Do this once daily for up to ten days for maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free for my unbiased opinion. Included in the kit are ;5 5ML syringes of 44% carbamide peroxide, a mouth guard, as well as a UV light. The way it all works is you place a little bit of the gel on the front part of the mouth guard (the part where your teeth will touch). You then place it in your mouth along with the UV light and keep it there for about 15 minutes. As with any teeth whitening kits you can expect to have some sensitivity with your teeth.  You will notice a difference in your teeth color after the first use.  Great little starter kit.</li>
    <li> I love having nice and white teeth and I love doing it at home using products like Justified Laboratories&#x27; Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit. I love the comfort of doing it at home and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as getting it professionally done at your dentist&#x27;s office! This product has worked very well for me and I could see a significant change on my teeth after using the product a few times. This product is very well thought of, reasonably priced and most importantly, it delivers what it promises to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I have had a yellowish teeth color for as long as I can remember. I have a huge sweet tooth and drink way too much soda. Yeah of drinking soda and not-so-good dental hygiene in my younger years has resulted in the yellow teeth color.  Now that I have cut way back on my soda intake, it was time to do something about the yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different whitening techniques in the past. Some with little success and others that did not work quite as well. So I was really excited when I was given the opportunity to review the ‘Justified Laboratories’ Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit. The kit includes a UV light, just like when whitening in the dentist office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are my impressions of this kit -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*The tray was a good size and did not affect my gag reflex at all.&lt;br /&gt;*The gel was really easy to apply to the tray.&lt;br /&gt;*The directions were really easy to understand. I had the printed directions next to me every time as to not make any mistakes and no mistakes were made.&lt;br /&gt;*The tray fits really easy in to your mouth and allows for really good ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*The 20 minute wait time is difficult when you have a 5 year old asking you a million questions and you cannot answer them. {Well maybe that’s not such a problem :-P}&lt;br /&gt;*The UV light did have a tendency to slip out of my mouth, so I had to hold it still in my mouth at times. But that was sacrifice I was willing to make for great looking teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall opinion – this is a great product, for a great price, and it really works!!&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to review the Justified Laboratories Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit for free. That does not affect my review and this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me.  I drink a lot of coffee and needed something to whiten my teeth.  The whitening toothpaste and mouthwash don&#x27;t do much by itself.  I like this because you get professional results in just five minutes.  It came with five things filled with whitening gel, the mouth piece that  lights up and a silicone mouth piece.  The mouth piece is very jelly like.  I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in hopes of my honest thoughts and review.  All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s.  There has been no other compensation, nor is there any intended.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the only teeth whitening kits that I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using. It doesn&#x27;t make my teeth and gums burn, it doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and the mouth piece has breathing holes if you don&#x27;t use the blue accelerator light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is incredibly easy to use. The syringes of whitening gel are very easy to handle and to get the proper amount of gel into the mouth piece. The best of all is it doesn&#x27;t taste terrible. So many products I&#x27;ve used tasted so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand to use them. The gel also stays in place, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the solution getting all over your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two days and I can see a huge difference. I smoke and I drink a lot of coffee. Finding a product that really whitens has been a little tough, but this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also safe to use over dental work. My two front teeth are fake, so this has taken them back to the original color of the dental work. What&#x27;s even better is it hasn&#x27;t lifted the shade of my other teeth too light yet, I&#x27;ll just have to keep an eye on that to keep my teeth a uniform shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re newer to teeth whitening, I think you should give this system a try. It&#x27;s gentle and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I absolute love this teeth whitening system. I have been seeing them going around the internet for a while now and I never jumped to get one but Justified Labs sent me a system for free to review and I immediately said of course! I never thought that I would see the changes so quickly or that it would actually be minty like toothpaste. It leave no gross film over your teeth and you can INSTANTLY see the difference after only one time. I am on my 3rd day and can honestly say, my teeth are white. My teeth used to have a slight yellow tint to them like most teeth and bones have (not due to smoking or coffee) but we all want those pearly whites and I am well on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent 5 syringes with the whitening gel in them along with the light and mouthpiece. I absolutely love it and will be buying again. I recommend this product and company. The shipping was fast and easy and if you have Prime, free.</li>
    <li> I did the first 20 minute treatment. After the 20 minutes I did noticed one area on my teeth did whiten. I will add another picture after 10 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference wasn&#x27;t much but it did let me know that this stuff does work. I did not care for the directions as I found them &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34;. I also was puzzled if I could swallow when my mouth began to collect spit. I just held it in because I wasn&#x27;t sure. It made it sort of uncomfortable. The whole system is pretty neat and somewhat easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECIEVED THIS ITEM IN EXCHANGE FOR HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW***</li>
    <li> this is an awesome kit! everything you need! ive only been using this just a few days now and i have great results! my teeth are whiter! i really love how this kit comes with everything you need, trays, gel and uv light.  i think the best part is the refills for life! how can that be beat! really easy to use too, very comfortable and no tooth sensitivity. no funny taste or smell either. so glad i was given the opportunity to test this teeth whitening kit for free for testing and review purposes!</li>
    <li> Hurt my sensitive teeth. Says not to get it on your gums, however with the trays that is impossible not to do. It was VERY painful in the first few seconds, and when I went to return the product they wanted me to pay shipping! Amazon did cover the cost when I complained..</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening kit works pretty well. Each of the 5ml syringes come with enough gel to last for around 5 uses, but I have been able to get around 7-8 uses out of each one. So, overall this kit can last anywhere from 25-40 sessions, depending on how much you use.  The main ingredient in the gel that makes it so effective is the 44% Carbamide Peroxide. This ingredient is known to effectively lighten teeth without wearing the enamel down. Since it still is a strong chemical, I suggest that each teeth whitening session should last no longer than 20 minutes. I always go around 15 minutes just to keep safe, since I regularly brush with whitening toothpaste. The teeth tray is a bit uncomfortable, but you get used to it after a few minutes. After each session, I make sure that the tray is cleaned and dried before placing it in a drawer or cabinet. Overall, I have been able to see improvements with this product and plan on using it for a while!  This product was provided to me at no cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker, so teeth whitening is always on my mind. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some teeth whitening products for a while and I was very excited when Justified Laboratories provided me with this kit for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were a little unclear to me because none of them include pictures. Yes, yes, it is all written and explained, but having pictures would have been so much better. The first time I used the gel and the mouth piece, I didn&#x27;t do it correctly. I&#x27;ll spare you the photos, but a small part of my gums got discolored by the gel. Then the discolored skin came off and everything was ok, I didn&#x27;t hurt or was bothered during subsequent applications. I do want to stress, though, please MAKE SURE that the gel doesn&#x27;t get on your gums. Don&#x27;t make my mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any problems with excessive salivating like some other reviewers did. I also learned not to clench my teeth around the mouth piece, which is what I did during the first time application. Just light bite on the mouth piece to hold it in place. Holding the lamp for 20 minutes was annoying, but doable. I simply read a book to pass the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the results go, I can see a slight difference. I only used did 4 applications out of the recommended 10, so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results after 10 days. I&#x27;ll post updated photos then. Remember, I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker. I drink lots of coffee in the morning, and even more during the day. I was afraid that my coffee drinking will negate any results I achieved with the kit. My teeth are also not sensitive, but I can see how someone with sensitive teeth might experience discomfort while or after using the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit. It&#x27;s giving me a result after 4 applications, and I&#x27;m confident that after 10 applications I&#x27;ll get an even better result. Even if this product will not give me very dramatic results at the end, I can at least maintain a slightly better version of my current smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Please note that the touch up pen and vitamin E swabs are not included in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR A FAIR, HONEST, AND UNBIASED REVIEW *****least maintain a slightly better version of my current smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Please note that the touch up pen and vitamin E swabs are not included in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR A FAIR, HONEST, AND UNBIASED REVIEW *****</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I do drink coffee and tea. So I am always using whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;Most whitening products, cause my teeth or gums to be super sensitive!!&lt;br /&gt;I use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash on a daily basis, so my teeth are&lt;br /&gt;not too tarnished. If you use one of those dental color guides I am the second shade from&lt;br /&gt;the beginning...&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this set was produced. The mouth tray says it all! Its super squishy and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Most of time you will receive a hard tray or one you have to boil water to shape. I am bad&lt;br /&gt;to tighten my jaws up when I am using a product like this, but not with this tray!!!&lt;br /&gt;It was so comforting. The gel did not have a harsh flavor or smell. I also liked the fact that they put a piece of&lt;br /&gt;plastic between the batteries, so it did not turn on during shipping. Smart... After 2 uses, I did notice&lt;br /&gt;my smile was much brighter... I highly recommend this teeth whitening system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this item free or heavily discounted in return for my unbiased and honest opinions. All statements above are my own!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused why the instructions state clearly that this package comes with an on-the-go pen and Vitamin E swabs, but never got either of these (although I understand not in the description) but why wouldn&#x27;t it come with this if stated to use these ON the instructions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how I feel about this, my upper right gums hurt now and didn&#x27;t notice any change in color after my first session tonight. I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> This whitening system is really nice and super easy to use. You don&#x27;t have to use very much and it is at a good price point compared to other teeth whitening systems. They tray and light are a little bulky so your mouth is quite full for the 20 minutes you wear it but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable. I like to wear it in the shower or while doing something else to keep my mind off of it and stop myself from fiddling with it. The gel also has a nice minty flavor. You are supposed to keep the gel off of your gums which is quite hard to do so you might experience some discomfort or sensitivity. The gel made my gums white for about 10 minutes afterwards and my teeth and gums are sensitive for about an hour afterwards. My boyfriend, however, experienced no white gums or sensitivity so I think it varies from person to person. Overall, I really like this kit and we will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: My picture is after two uses and my boyfriends is after one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest opinion. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255. I wrote a more detailed review at our site which you are welcome to check it out at: myemptynesting (dot) blogspot (dot) com.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about two weeks. The first 7 days, I used everyday for 20 minutes. The second 7 days, I used every other day for 20 minutes (my gums started to become irritated) My teeth started out as typically yellow from coffee and wine ect.. Now they are radiant white. I plan to purchase more peroxide solution in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this in exhange for my HONEST review and with BEING honest I really didn&#x27;t think it would work. IT DID!! I do have sensitive teeth normally though so I have only used it two times. Every OTHER day. And I have already noticed a difference. It&#x27;s easy to use. And quite fool proof!!  For your easy &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; teeth whitening - I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS!</li>
    <li> So I was asked to review this great new product AT NO COST to me and I just love it. I was asked to review a professional Strength Teeth Whitening Kit from Justified Laboratories and it’s amazing. I have only used it 2 days but I can already tell a great difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I taste of the gel that you but on the mouth guard is a little bitter but compared to others its mild in awfulness. There was no swelling or redness of the gums in which I have experienced in most other teeth whitening stripes and there was also so burning feeling. I am really excited to see what the end product will be once I complete all the steps.</li>
    <li> Would not purchase this again. I can&#x27;t even wear it for 10 minutes because it hurts my teeth, and then makes them very sensitive..</li>
    <li> Super accurate 10 to 15min you start to see results, I love it!!!! And who doesn&#x27;t want great looking nice white teeth this is right up that alley, everyone noticing my Brite smile great feed back. #Mustbuy you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product is ok but the light broke the first use.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a long time to find a teeth whitening system that works and that is safe. I honestly have given up looking for a system that works. The last teeth whitening system that I tried did not work and was very disappointed and was expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would give it one last try and try Justified Laboratories Teeth Whitening Kit. When I read up about it I honestly thought it was too good to be true. Boy was I wrong. I actually found a teeth whitening system that actually worked and half the price what I have paid for in the past!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the kit I was surprised on who much whiting gel this kit provided!! It quite worth it and the price. First it seems overwhelming with the instructions but after reading them and getting and understanding the product was simple to use. The first session took a little longer because you have to mold the mouth piece to fit your mouth so you can get the best experience possible. This is important to do this correctly because if you don&#x27;t it won&#x27;t work the way it should. This helps the gel stay where it needs to be so it can whiten your teeth. I noticed results after the first use and would highly recommend this product and would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** i did receive a heavy  discount rate  when ordering this product**</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free for review its super high quality, works great, easy to use. I feel much better about my teeth overall!</li>
