      <li>, it is a very good for you to choose this facial mask!!</li>
      <li>But the product overall is very good.</li>
      <li>my skin was so soft and happy after this mask.</li>
      <li>Reason for purchase:&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to see what the hype was all about and to see if the serum in these products were really that good.</li>
      <li>After one night, my face looked plumped and glowing from the serum which was a huge surprise</li>

      <li>the serum spreads easily and literally gets absorbed into the face with ease.</li>
      <li>What I like the most is that this mask comes very well saturated with product</li>
      <li>Luckily Amazon will take a return on this</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth in serum and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>it is a really good right now very surprisedit&#x27;s extremely hydrating</li>
      <li>;).</li>

      <li>The box that came looks exactly like the picture.</li>

      <li>Thanks to youtube makeup guru)!</li>
      <li>It feels very cooling and soothing on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very hydrating</li>
      <li>This one just didn&#x27;t seem to do that much for me.  </li>
      <li>The eye holes are too close together and the nose portion doesn&#x27;t cover my whole nose</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Would love some suggestions on any of their other products . .</li>
      <li>way that I make full use of these masks is that instead of using the mask itself I squeeze out all the serum in the mask and place the serum in a container and just use it as a daily night mask (without the mask of course</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend and buy again.</li>
      <li>Me: oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone skin with acne scars and large pores.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The results aren&#x27;t long term, so recommend this if you have super dry skin and need quick hydration or before a night out or day out.</li>
      <li>A little messy, but what a great value.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I was able to get around ~4/5oz of serum from all the masks for which if you&#x27;ve bought serums in a bottle before usually costs ~$30/oz.</li>
      <li>I previously ordered this one (and love it) and needed the English version packaging (again) for a gift.  </li>
      <li>Does not break me out and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>a week so far three times, and have noticed a definite difference in my face.</li>
      <li>I bought from Amazon directly to avoid any forgeries/ fakes, I recommend that everyone do the same.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using this brand and to try the other kinds they have.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This are not skimpy with the serum.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Did the job of hydrating and toning. A little messy, but what a great value. Would highly recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried other ones from the Korean Store and this brand is one of my favorites (Thanks to youtube makeup guru)! What I like the most is that this mask comes very well saturated with product so I usually go beyond the time on the instructions.

    <li> I ordered this one but received the other packaging which is in all Chinese/Japanese.  I previously ordered this one (and love it) and needed the English version packaging (again) for a gift.  Sorry, but the recipient does not read any other language.  Luckily Amazon will take a return on this but it is a royal pain to have to deliver it to UPS myself.  I hope the replacement will actually be the correct product.</li>
    <li> my skin was so soft and happy after this mask. Big difference. I love it.</li>
    <li> always love this brand, price and quality are all acceptale</li>
    <li> I think this mask leaves my skin feeling better than the Royal Jelly Mask but here again this isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;ve found myself wanting to use regularly.  Masks are a bit messy.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped heal when I had dry flaky skin from sun burn. My skin felt firm and dewy. The results aren&#x27;t long term, so recommend this if you have super dry skin and need quick hydration or before a night out or day out.</li>
    <li> Love it. Good for hydrating your face. I used it twice a week for my weekly routine facial!&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying and you will like it. Value for money</li>
    <li> Reason for purchase:&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to see what the hype was all about and to see if the serum in these products were really that good. Also, heard from other reviewers that the amount serum used in these mask was a lot so I found another use described in my review for these masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Impression:&lt;br /&gt;After using so many types of Hyaluronic acid serums, I can say that whatever serum they put in these products are worth the $$$. When you touch the serum that&#x27;s in the mask it feels like there is silicon but there isn&#x27;t so the serum spreads easily and literally gets absorbed into the face with ease. Another great thing about this serum it&#x27;s paraben and fragrance FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way that I make full use of these masks is that instead of using the mask itself I squeeze out all the serum in the mask and place the serum in a container and just use it as a daily night mask (without the mask of course ;). I was able to get around ~4/5oz of serum from all the masks for which if you&#x27;ve bought serums in a bottle before usually costs ~$30/oz. I plan to use this trick for all my future masks so I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth in serum and moisturizing. After one night, my face looked plumped and glowing from the serum which was a huge surprise but then again I used it over night &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I bought from Amazon directly to avoid any forgeries/ fakes, I recommend that everyone do the same. It gives you peace of mind when using this product. It&#x27;s getting harder to tell the fakes from real ones from other 3rd party sellers.</li>
    <li> love this sheet mask, such an amazing product. i love everything by my beauty diary.</li>
    <li> works great, my skin is finally looking really good</li>
    <li> I usually love My Beauty Diary masks and I use several kinds.  This one just didn&#x27;t seem to do that much for me.  I have very sensitive skin and I felt this one dried me out to much.  I might try the couple I have left at another time.  I might have a different opinion.  My skin seems to change a lot.</li>
    <li> My face felt really good after I removed the mask...I really like it</li>
    <li> Always like their products. Have tried many different ones.</li>
    <li> Wonderful love it very much, it is a very good for you to choose this facial mask!!</li>
    <li> Mask feels great on my skin</li>
    <li> it is a really good right now very surprisedit&#x27;s extremely hydrating and it&#x27;s great to use me for a night out on the town</li>
    <li> First off this is a great price for this product. The box that came looks exactly like the picture. There are 10 individually wrapped masks inside. The masks are a paper material cut out in the shape of a face that&#x27;s soaked with the hyaluronic acid mixture. It has a plastic overlay that you use for application then peel off. You do not wash off the mask when you are done, you just rub the mixture into your skin when you take off the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is immediate relief if your skin is dry, itchy, or burned. I used a derma roller on my face and I was so happy to put this on, because the roller made my face sting and burn after using it. It feels very very cold when applying and so good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this once a week so far three times, and have noticed a definite difference in my face. It&#x27;s softer, and is relieving the redness on the sides of my nose.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I heard a lot of good reviews about this product and was so happy when it arrived. The box was smaller then expected but, it was still very cute. After trying it out I have to say it&#x27;s very hydrating! It felt very cool on my face. And their was so much serum left behind. I ended up saving all that serum. But the product overall is very good. I absolutely love it!!! Might try the others next time!</li>
    <li> A great mask that I would recommend to almost anyone! Very hydrating and I receive lots of compliments on my skin in the days after I use the mask.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! My face instantly looks smoother, softer, and brighter. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than one year. Really helps lighten the color of my face!</li>
    <li> Me: oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone skin with acne scars and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;The serum on this mask actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It can feel a bit tacky on the skin once you remove the cloth mask, but it absorbs into the skin within 10ish minutes. Does not break me out and does not irritate my sensitive skin. It feels very cooling and soothing on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says it will do&lt;br /&gt;Feels nice on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent&lt;br /&gt;INSTANTLY hydrates the skin&lt;br /&gt;Does not cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Soothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The cloth mask itself doesn&#x27;t fit the face well (at least not mine). The eye holes are too close together and the nose portion doesn&#x27;t cover my whole nose area(I don&#x27;t have an unreasonably sized nose.. just a regular nose) leaving uncovered spaces (that just so happen to be my biggest problem areas for dehydration).&lt;br /&gt;It feels a bit sticky/tacky for a while until it absorbs into the skin fully once the mask is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED FOR:&lt;br /&gt;ALL SKIN TYPES&lt;br /&gt;People with dehydrated skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS:&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this mask works.</li>
    <li> After using the mask just once . . I noticed a plumping of my skin and my cheeks actually glowed when I looked in the mirror for a few days . . would definitely recommend.  Would love some suggestions on any of their other products . . what a find!!</li>
    <li> Very bad mask, water drops everywhere</li>
