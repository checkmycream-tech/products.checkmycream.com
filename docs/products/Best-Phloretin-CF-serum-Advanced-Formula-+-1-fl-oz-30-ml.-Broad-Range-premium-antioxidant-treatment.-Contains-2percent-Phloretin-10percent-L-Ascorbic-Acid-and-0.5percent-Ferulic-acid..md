      <li>think this serum, with 10% LAA, is best for those with sensitive (usually very fair) skin who want to incorporate a stabilized LAA serum into their morning routine for preventative purposes but react with redness and irritation at the 15% LAA concentration in the Ferulic</li>

      <li>I love the feel of it and my skin has never looked better!</li>
      <li>I am extremely impressed with this product thus far.  </li>
      <li>(I had to look into an effective replacement of the more costly &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; variety of what is basically an identical product.  </li>
      <li>I also find it more effective if you apply this after using the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>They answered all my questions thoroughly and honestly and were able to recommend a skin care regimen to suit my needs.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I can now find this available at a more affordable price!</li>

      <li>I was trying to find something more affordable.</li>
      <li>She seems to be pleased with it, so I will probably order it for her again.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this product for about a week,and I am absolutely impressed.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve heard that Phloretin is better than Ferulic Acid for stimulating elastin--</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have noticed my face breaking out a lot more since switching to this.</li>
      <li>I am so glad with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the price and</li>
      <li>The products are A+ quality, and I cannot wait to order more from them.  </li>

      <li>I love it and will order it again.  </li>
      <li>I am confident it will continue to offer unmatched results and improvement to my skin.....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping my skin looks great after I finish the whole bottle (I use every morning under sunscreen).  </li>

      <li>I wanted a quick fix and jumped inside at this highly rated item that could be shipped to Europe: D</li>
      <li>But, the lasting effects of this serum is remarkable!</li>
      <li>All in all, money well spent which makes me very happy.</li>
      <li>apply this gorgeous mixture to my whole face, neck, everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Phloretin Serum works best for me due to my combination oily skin</li>
      <li>A month later, I am more than happy with the results.</li>
      <li>The original is more of a light brown color and thicker.  </li>
      <li>I feel confident that this more affordable brand is a good quality product and is providing the same benefits.  </li>
      <li>I realise that we need not spend big money to have beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>The serum is light, easily glides all over your skin</li>
      <li>I have read research that Phloretin, Vitamin C and Ferulic Acid help to improve fine lines, discoloration and reverse some pre-cancerous skin changes.  </li>
      <li>This is a very effective serum that keeps spots to a minimum and general signs of aging at bay.</li>
      <li>It just prepares your skin for the serum to be absorbed more easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased another brand Phloretin CF at my spa. This formula is lighter in color - it seems to have quite a bit of alcohol. As for the results, I don&#x27;t see a difference between the brands so I would continue to purchase this over the more expensive one.</li>
    <li> This product was advertised on a TV program about beauty tips.  It was supposed to lighten dark spots. I used it for three weeks and got no results.</li>
    <li> Works exactly the same as the original Skinceuticals product at less than half the cost. Very good purchase and quality. Thank you Cosmetic Skin Solutions.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She has used a similar product before. She seems to be pleased with it, so I will probably order it for her again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing a dermatologist say it would diminish brown spots on my hands.  The product was very reasonably priced from this company although it did not deliver results.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my skin. My face gradually turned yellow, as my fingernails. I can&#x27;t tell if the serum was fresh, it had a light champagne color, and after I applied it on my face for couple of days, my skin developed that strange oxidized chemical smell. It didn&#x27;t do anything to a brown spot on my cheek. I gave it to my mom to try it, but she got the same result.  I tried to returned it, and the company promptly replied that they will refund my money back, after i return the serum with the shipping slip. Unfortunately, I lost that slip, so I could not return it. It is still in my fridge, waiting for any of my friends to volunteer to give it another try.  It doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for someone else, maybe I just got somewhat oxidized serum, or L-ascorbic acid is not my thing.  If you want to give it a try, my best advice SAVE THE SHIPPING SLIP.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have used the CE Ferulic Serum from Cosmetic Skin Solutions for some time now and really like it. I thought i would give this one with the Phloretin a try. NOT GOOD! With one use my skin broke out in a horrible rash all over my face neck and chest. I had oozing bumps that did not go away for two weeks! I think there may be TOO much alcohol in this maybe....</li>
    <li> I realise that we need not spend big money to have beautiful skin. I used to have problem skin - pimples, dryness and dullness. After using Ploretin C+F with Vitanmin C, the result is 5A Star! I will not trade it with other product.. it is too silly not to use this magic bottle!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a week,and I am absolutely impressed. After literally ONE day,my skin was smoother,brighter and softer - plus,two monster zits I had were almost gone. You know,the kind that stay ugly,red and flaky for a good couple of weeks? Well,the redness went down OVERNIGHT. I dabbed a bit more right on the spots the next night,and in the morning they seemed to peel right off! So much so,that just a tiny dab of concealer was all I needed,and it blended right in,with no flakes visible. I&#x27;m very pleased,and I can&#x27;t wait to see what this product can accomplish with some time. Last but SO not least - this product is affordable!!! Shipping was about 4 days total and FREE. I will be purchasing this product again and again,and I HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Does good job of making my skin feel and look nice. Fades some of my hyperpigmentation.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  So glad I purchased this product versus the more expensive brand.  I used to use the more expensive brand and both products are the same so why not save money?</li>
    <li> i have bought this product twice.  The first time, I noticed it was straw-colored vs brown like the SkinCeuticals version.  I used it with similar results, though, so I bought it again.  This time, the product is clear, smells like alcohol, and stings my face like alcohol.  I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, first from a more expensive brand and for the last few years from Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  I feel confident that this more affordable brand is a good quality product and is providing the same benefits.  I have read research that Phloretin, Vitamin C and Ferulic Acid help to improve fine lines, discoloration and reverse some pre-cancerous skin changes.  I use this daily on my face, shoulders and chest where I have already had basal cell cancers removed.  I have noticed a smoothing of my skin tone and people usually think I am younger than I am.  It is best to use vitamin C products in the morning and this should be the first product on the skin after washing.  It is liquid and easy to waste--I tilt my head back and put one drop on my forhead and one drop on each cheek.  Then I swirl it in with my fingertips.  I then use one to two drops on my decolletage and one drop on each shoulder.  Let it dry for three minutes, then apply your other products as directed.  Using 7-8 drops this way allows for about five to six months of use for each bottle.</li>
    <li> Good product and have even received compliments for my glowing skin.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle that I have purchased since it seems to have the same consistency and applies the same as the SkinCeuticals product. I&#x27;m definitely happy with the product and the price and will continue getting this product and try others by this company.</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed by this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for six years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a year now.  I had placed my first order quite reluctantly (I had to look into an effective replacement of the more costly &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; variety of what is basically an identical product.  This was a direct result of this recession thing we&#x27;ve been recovering from for ages now.) I placed my second order strictly as a satisfied consumer. This is a wonderful anti-oxidant, truly broad range with a delivery system that causes no side effect - and believe me, my sensitive skin would jump on a chance to go into hysterics at a hint of harshness.&lt;br /&gt;I consider the CSS&#x27;s Phloretin CF serum a stand-alone, superior broad-range anti oxidant. As if dry hot summers weren&#x27;t bad enough, for weeks our region has been covered by heavy smoke from huge wildfires (think face masks.)  My complexion is OK due to careful application of CSS&#x27;s product line, including the Phloretin CF serum..&lt;br /&gt;Also important is the fact that the Cosmetic Skin Solutions people take pride not only in the quality of the product, but also in the way they handle orders and stick to posted shipping policies.  My orders arrive packed with care and always promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend both the product and the company.</li>
    <li> I am so enthusiastic about this serum (and about other CSS products like Vitamin C+E Serum in combination with Hydra B5) that I even order it from Germany several times a year.&lt;br /&gt;CSS Phloretin helps diminishing my brown marks and draws a kind of glow over the entire face. Besides, I love the nurturing effect...</li>
    <li> Great product and so much less expensive than high-end brand</li>
    <li> This is the same product as Skinceuticals, at a 1/4 of the price! Don&#x27;t waste your money, compare before you buy!</li>
    <li> I used to buy the C serum only from Skinceuticals, spending 120 bucks a bottle. Yes it does work, but the cost was killing me. It was just about that time for me to get a refill when I found this company on Amazon. I was skeptical, but desperately wanted to believe that I could save so much if it actually worked. I took the plunge and bought their c+e ferulic serum.  A few months later and I am positive it delivers the same excellent benefits sckinceuticals does. My skin is wrinkle free and continues to improve on clarity. I have heard all the buzz around Phloretin and was happy to know that this company had it in their line of skin products so I tried it. A month later, I am more than happy with the results. The brown spots I had on my cheeks continue to get smaller and smaller by the week. I have found nothing that would make it fade or at least make it seem lighter until I started using this serum. My skin looks vibrant with a beautiful glow to it. I am also amazed at how it makes your skin so smooth and radiant. I am 40 years old and have been getting compliments lately about how great my skin looks. So tonight, I decided to write this review, which I rarely do, but this stuff works. I also find it more effective if you apply this after using the Clarisonic. It just prepares your skin for the serum to be absorbed more easily. After applying the serum, I use my normal Cerave moisturizer which works wonders for my skin as well. The serum is light, easily glides all over your skin so you only use a few drops. All in all, money well spent which makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I thought it was like the skinCeuticals one, exact same ingredients. And this is how it was advertised on the website but when I received the box it describes vitamin C as one of the ingredients and not 10% L-ascorbic acid which is what I was looking for, so I will not bu this product again I will just go for the skinCeuticals one</li>
    <li> This is great!  I will always buy this brand.  It really works!  The smell is mild and scent disappears.  But, the lasting effects of this serum is remarkable!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive stuff! I&#x27;ve seen the results and can actually afford the cost. I Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Seems to be just like the serum that is much more expensive. I use it morning and night under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended phloretin and Ferulic acid manufactured by a different and considerably more expensive company, but she is impressed with how this works and has encouraged me to continue with this. This is a very effective serum that keeps spots to a minimum and general signs of aging at bay. Three or four drops in the evening does what needs to be done.  I have been using this for years (with the approval of my dermatologist).  This does what it says it does, and this is one skin care product I wouldn&#x27;t do without—one advantage is that it allows me to save a bit on moisturizers and eye gels.  Most skin care professionals do suggest a phloretin/vitamin C/ ferulic acid treatment daily, but there is no need to spend $130 + to have it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this after I tried</li>
    <li> I started with the name brand of this product, it was a lot more expensive. Read the reviews on line about this one, the same ingredients etc. I am getting the same results, on my third  bottle. I love this stuff. It really makes a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Like all of the CSS products I use, I love this serum. I alternate between this, the Phyto, and the B5. This has definitely lightened pigmentation from sun. Highly recommend this (and all of the other products!).</li>
    <li> Omg! okay I have tested out the over priced version of this and I was not impressed at all ( Based on the price). I used the over priced version for 30days and it worked well but this is almost  1/3 of the price and it worked just as well. the other version did make my skin a little oily under my sun screen. I didin&#x27;t have that problem with this one.  I have been using this for about 6-8months and I can see such an improvement in my skin. I&#x27;m a fan and will be purchaing this for my mother to try.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels when I use this and it has many benefits as you are aging.. Not sure how much it&#x27;s helping- only time will tell as with all the things we do and &#x27;hope&#x27; they help reverse the aging process.  About 30 dollars cheaper than my spa brands with the same ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phloretin Serum for about a month now along with Phyto Botanical Gel. At night I alternate with Resurfacing Serum and Retinol. All of these products are wonderful, and my skin has never been in better condition. I&#x27;ve used the high-priced equivalent products, and I cannot tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this serum for anyone who has sun damage currently or is trying to prevent it in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  Very comparable to the Skin Ceuticals but a lot less money.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> In all honesty, I didn&#x27;t find any difference betweem Cosmetic Skin Solutions&#x27;  version ofthis product and their more expensive competitor. Although the ingredients are the same, I was wary about trying it at all  this after reading some reviews saying it was watery, a cheap knock-off compared to the other etc, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance, as there is nothing significantly diffirent as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  The condition of my skin has not deteriorated since I switched months ago and I will stick this more affordable brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful, but it&#x27;s not as good as Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> ...from Skinceuticals. I&#x27;ve used this generic brand long enough that I can see it works just as well but it&#x27;s not as costly.</li>
    <li> I break out in white heads overtime I put any of the serums by this brand. A bummer, really.  I wanted to love this. Will get something else instead...</li>
    <li> It was a rip off. Didn&#x27;t do anything it promised. I would not recommend to anyone I know. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> It seems to work just as well as the product it&#x27;s copying.  I actually like the viscosity better and the fact that it has a less strong scent.  I&#x27;m hoping my skin looks great after I finish the whole bottle (I use every morning under sunscreen).  My skin does look less dry/parched.</li>
    <li> This product works so well on my skin I receive compliments continue stating how my skin always looks so hydrated and so fresh. I love the way it smells and hydrates my skin and even though I only use it once a day before bed, if I am going on on a special occasion, I will be sure to use it and I am almost guaranteed someone will compliment me in my skin.  I have been using this product for over two years w/ other serums and most people think I am in my 40&#x27;s and I am much older than that.</li>
    <li> Phloretin Serum works best for me due to my combination oily skin and I follow up with Hydra B5. I love the feel of it and my skin has never looked better! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am especially impressed with the customer service of this company.  They answered all my questions thoroughly and honestly and were able to recommend a skin care regimen to suit my needs.  The products are A+ quality, and I cannot wait to order more from them.  Looking forward to trying the derma roller!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin and has improved the texture and appearance of my skin. Will buy again. Delivered as expected by the company.</li>
    <li> I feel like it is good value for serum that works.  Arrived very timely and I feel like I can see results.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative to the SkinCeuticals brand.  But I have not seen the same results.  SkinCeuticals always helped keep my face from breaking out.  I have noticed my face breaking out a lot more since switching to this. Still good enough to at least finish the bottle off, but I will be switching back to SkinCeuticals once this runs out.</li>
    <li> JUST FANTASTIC!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it in thre three past years and my face skin is less wrinkled and much more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;People always talk about my skin and how I look at least ten years younger</li>
    <li> My go to product to improve the way my skins looks and feels. I&#x27;ve used others in the past that were not affordable and didn&#x27;t work half as well. But now that it&#x27;s affordable I actually use the product as intended and see the results. I switch between this for the summer and the C+E (during winter) to help my skin maintain proper moisture. This product line is awesome and works well together.</li>
    <li> Cosmetic Skin Solutions products are AWESOME - they are comparable . . . . no, equal to Skinceuticals at LESS COST!  Buy these products!  Your skin will thank you . . . . your friends and family will comment on how great you look . . . . you will feel FABULOUS!</li>
    <li> I will always&lt;br /&gt; this co.</li>
    <li> I just turned 55 today, and I can honestly say-I have finally found  the answer to my life-long search for skincare. I have wasted thousands of $$s on every new, every guaranteed to work, every new technology that has come out.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up w/ a lot of bad reactions, breakouts, and some really painful rashes,etc. Not to mention an empty purse!&lt;br /&gt;Finally,I ended up at the dermatologist, and she sent me home w/ some &#x27;serums&#x27;-I liked them,but,once again-the prices were outrageous!&lt;br /&gt;I found this site on Amazon-and I was in my element. I am a licensed cos./and have worked w/ any &amp; all actives, oils,etc.One thing I KNOW-I cannot use cream on my face I don&#x27;t care if it is certified non oily-it makes my skin go into oily overdrive!&lt;br /&gt;I knew the B5 gel was a hit, but I picked the Phloretin advanced serum, instead of the plain C serum I got from the derm.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is-I have been using the two serums together-a full dropper of B5, and a few drops of the Phloretin, mix them together in the palm of my hand -and apply this gorgeous mixture to my whole face, neck, everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I have re-ordered-(something I can&#x27;t say about any other product)-&lt;br /&gt;I will not be w/o it- What I have noticed-clearer,more radiant complexion, firming of the skin, pore size reduced, NO breakouts,&lt;br /&gt;One more thing-you will hear neysayers saying the &#x27;other product&#x27;-the way more expensive one -is so much better-Bull****! I know when I made; my first order-I still had some of &#x27;the other stuff&#x27; -I used this instead!</li>
    <li> I used the same formula from the Skinceuticals brand which is over twice the price and have had similar results with this brand.  I saw increased clarity and smoothness in my skin with both.  It does not break out or irritate my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m glad that I can now find this available at a more affordable price!</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get myself to spend the price for the skinceuticals product, although they do have excellent products.&lt;br /&gt;This works great for me. Yes, it has alcohol, but it has to have that for the Ferulic component. My skin looks great. Smoother, spots fading, and I hardly have to use any foundation now. I use tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my neck and décolleté because at this price, I can afford to do so.&lt;br /&gt;If possible, apply to clean, dry skin and wait 15-20 minutes before applying other moisturizer or makeup. I find I don&#x27;t need moisturizer afterwards, but I do not have particularly dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good-value, High-quality skin treatment. Worth the price. After about 4-6 weeks of using vitamin c products, you will most likely see a noticeable improvement in your skin.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin combination skin. It has taken me years to find the right regimen to not irritate my skin. After finding the right cleaner and moisturizer I set out to find a serum that won&#x27;t irritate my skin. I emailed the company and explained my situation and they sent me a sample of this serum which lasted me 2 weeks. I was able to determine that it did not irritate my skin and now since purchasing the full size serum I am starting to see results. My skin is smoother and clearer. I use it after cleansing my skin in the AM. I love the price and the customer service is fantastic. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am so glad with my purchase. I arrived on the time and perfect! Like i was waiting. Then i point the company to everybody!</li>
    <li> Live this stuff. Was using Skinceuticals brand that is much more expensive, but virtually the same product. Why pay more for the same thing?</li>
    <li> i am 45 years old . and since i started using this product. people think i am in my 20&amp;#34;s</li>
    <li> Disappointing - why would an antioxidant product contain denatured alcohol (aka SD Alcohol)?  Take a look at an MSDS sheet and you&#x27;ll see that denatured alcohol is not something you want to put on your skin.  This would be a great product without the alcohol.</li>
    <li> I used a couple of times and experienced an allergic reaction causing a rash on my neck and face.  I wasn’t sure it was this particular product because I’ve never had any allergic reaction to any other products (or even foods) but I tested it by placing a small drop on my neck and rubbing it into the skin…sure enough shortly thereafter I developed a red rash on the applied area.  It could just be me but advise that you try testing it first.  I would have returned it but missed the return date.</li>
    <li> I feel like the mean girl here but I can say I honestly do not think this item deserves five stars. It is a nice consistency and the bottle will last you a few months, with few results, if that is what you are looking for. I am in Germany and Recently ran out of my Obagi system. I wanted a quick fix and jumped inside at this highly rated item that could be shipped to Europe: D I have used it for multiple weeks now, only to notice an increase in blackheads and now... are these whiteheads on my chin where they never have been before?! Maybe there is a warming up phase and it eventually gets better? I hope so.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered from Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  Their products are great with the same amount of ingredients as a much more expensive one.  I will stick to these products and save money...nothing wrong with that!</li>
    <li> I love using this product, I have very sensitive skin and easily get freckles and brown spots when I spend too much time outdoors. This product help me lighten those dark freckles and brown spots. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and would recommend this.</li>
    <li> In my estimation, this product is not as close to its Skinceuticals counterpart as CSS CE Ferulic is to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, but this is only based on my gut feeling about slight differences in texture between the two.  The ingredient lists look the same, and the PH is below 3.5 (at least for the bottle I tested with a ph strip) enough to be effective at entering the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this serum, with 10% LAA, is best for those with sensitive (usually very fair) skin who want to incorporate a stabilized LAA serum into their morning routine for preventative purposes but react with redness and irritation at the 15% LAA concentration in the Ferulic formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve heard that Phloretin is better than Ferulic Acid for stimulating elastin--something that&#x27;s notoriously hard to do compared to collagen stimulation, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find studies confirming this conclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received was not clear (unlike CSS CE Ferulic) but very slightly yellow.  The bottle oxidized and turned light amber much quicker than the CSS CE Ferulic, for those of you concerned about product oxidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would recommend storing this product in a wine cooler/wine fridge in its box (kept dark).  The lowest temperature setting for most fridges is still too cold for \\&quot;ideal storage\\&quot; for stabilized LAA serums.</li>
    <li> I saw good results from this for the two weeks I used it, but in the end, I just could not put up with the smell. Still, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay three times as much for a different brand with basically the same ingredients. I was also concerned about the oxidation promoted by the significant proportion of alcohol in the formula.</li>
    <li> Just like the Skinceuticals versions. Love this</li>
    <li> I purchased the product in expectation for quick result. think it worked but was very slow. I will want to try it again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a product that costs a third of the price of the original would be as good but this product measures up.  I love it and will order it again.  Great value and prompt service.</li>
    <li> Heard about this type of product on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try. I like it and think it has improved the look of my skin.  I use it in the morning after washing my face and then I use a moisturizing sunscreen over it. Skin seems firmer and looks better to me. So far I&#x27;ve used about a quarter of the bottle, will keep using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Works wonders - noticible difference in the appearance of my skin and lightening of the dark spots on my face.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love to spend time outdoors but over the years my skin tone had become blotchy and uneven. I&#x27;ve been using the Phloretin serum for about a month now and it has greatly improved the tone and texture of my skin. I also use the B5, eye, and resurfacing serums and last winter used the C+E serum. I&#x27;ve found all of these products to be highly effective and use them as the cornerstone of my skincare. I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> So far so good but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give my opinion</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Within a week or 10 days I started seeing results!  Smoother skin, smaller pores, decrease in lines and age spots.  Totally a miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Incredible product that my derma suggested after eye surgery. Im looking unbelievable since January 2013. My skin is much more healthy than when I was 30.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that&#x27;s far more of a value than the Skinceuticals equivalent and I get compliments on my skin all the time.  I tried the CE Ferulic but it&#x27;s a little too heavy for my skin, so the website recommended this as an alternative and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended that I use skinceutical&#x27;s version of this product. She gave me some samples that finished so when I went online to get more I came across the Cosmetic Solution (exactly the same) and much more reasonably priced. I have been using it for a while now and my skin seems smooth and glow-y. However, last \\&quot;batch\\&quot; the product seemed to have oxidized really fast (going from clear to brown). I am not sure how that affects its efficiency. Current batch is still nice and clear.</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed with this product thus far.  Before using this product, I was a bit skeptical as to the amount of research studied on this new antioxidant Phloretin.  Since only having read positive reviews about it&#x27;s benefts to the skin, I decided to give it a try.  After having used this product for only 2 weeks, I have noticed the redness (rocesea) I once had on my cheeks has almost disappeared.  Being also borderline as a person with normal to oily skin, it has kept my skin clear and non-oily, a good thing.  I have also noticed my makeup goes on much smoother without irritating my already sensitive skin. This new serum has worked wonders on the overall improvement and radiance of my skin....I am confident it will continue to offer unmatched results and improvement to my skin.....You would be just as satisfied with it&#x27;s benefit&#x27;s as I, especially for the PRICE....</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but not as good as the much more expensive counterpart. It works well, evens out my skintone, and seems to help skin retain moisture. However, I feel that my skin has been breaking out somewhat from this product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for years. I noticed a difference almost immediately. Thank you, KW</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle now.  I use just 2 drops on clean skin morning and evening.  Just got a note from one of my friends asking if I had \\&quot;something done\\&quot; to my face.  I do not need any make-up , skin is flawless.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I personally think this is just as great as the more expensive version of it.  Have tried both, and would repeat this purchase again (and I have!)</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C serums and B5 moisturizer for over 10 years and since they are usually very expensive I was trying to find something more affordable. When I found this company few years back I was skeptical at first but decided to order. I have been using this and other products ever since with a great satisfaction. I do not leave my house without Vit C serum on my face.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily w/ Retinol 1.0 Crème - love the results using both products.  Previously purchased Phloretin CF Serum from my esthetician- the CSS product has the exact same ingredients at a third of the cost - plus no tax.  Love the products and hope CSS expands their line.</li>
    <li> Best price on the web</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001G2LWDK Phloretin CF serum Advanced Formula + 1 fl oz / 30 ml. Broad-Range premium antioxidant treatment. Contains 2% Phloretin, 10% L-Ascorbic Acid, and 0.5% Ferulic acid.]] I purchased the Phloretin CF serum from CSS based on reviews, expecting much...I was truly blown away! The serum was clear, my oily skin easily absorbed it...Within three days, the skin I did not pay too much attention to, since I didn&#x27;t like what I was seeing previously, was being constantly touched and looked at! I saw a glowing, soft skin that I still can&#x27;t believe belongs to me.  I used the serum once day, in the morning, and that&#x27;s it!  It&#x27;s now fall, and my skin seem to have responded so well with the Phloretin, that I am now using the Vitamin C Serum and expect nothing less than glowing results.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to see how this product worked since the original is so fantastic.  Of course it was the price that drove me to purchase this being the original is so expensive.  The ingredients are all the same according to the bottles.  This one is just not quite as good.  The original is more of a light brown color and thicker.  I will definitely use this entire product as it works okay.  You are just not going to see the same results as with the original....at least my skin didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> great product. love it. Phloretin CF serum Advanced Formula + 1 fl oz / 30 ml. Broad-Range...&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic Skin Solutions LLC</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, which is always appreciated. I don&#x27;t wear makeup on my skin, only this serum and an eye cream and people always comment positively on my skin. I love this product. I work as a flight attendant so it&#x27;s really important that I look after my skin and I really feel that this serum keeps my skin well nourished. There is really no point in buying the more expensive brand, as this Skin Solutions product works just as well for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using products from this company for several years now and they are all fantastic. I just recently incorporated the phloretin CF  serum and I am loving it also. I was previously using the 20% Vit c and loved it, but with the hot weather coming and my oily skin I decided to use the Phloretin CF and im so glad I tried it. I just cant get enough from this company. I hope they come out with more products. I also use the B5 gel and eye serum among others. Try it , the customer service is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Arrived spoiled. oxidized. wasted my money.at least if u buy it in a store u can check it immediately and get a different product. I&#x27;m completely annoyed, just writing this now when I have the time.... I never used this product because when I got it I notice it was YELLOW, which I know means the vitamin C has been oxidized.  therefore.... waste of money. darn</li>
    <li> The smell is weird, feels like rubbing alcohol on my face.  Showed no sign of skin improvement unlike many other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> JUST like skinceuticals, no need to spend three time the amount! My skin&#x27;s coloring, texture and more look a lot better.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the smell and don&#x27;t think it made much difference on my skin</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as Skinceuticals, at a third of the price. Same ingredients, same results. If you had any hesitation becouse it&#x27;s a cheaper product don&#x27;t. Totally worth it</li>
    <li> I normally use skinceuticals but thought I&#x27;d give this a try to save some money.  The look and feel of the serum is exactly the same, but this brand had more of an alcohol smell, enough that it made my eyes water when I first opened it.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and it seems like the alcohol smell has faded, but it still has a very different smell than skinceuticals.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if there is a difference in results.  I use the serum as a preventative measure, and never really noticed any &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; even from the original brand, which I  over a year.  Hopefully I am less aged than I would have been without it, but who knows, really.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels when I put it on.  Not sure it has made a permanant difference but it does seem to tighten my skin, which leads me to believe the pours look smaller (I&#x27;m 57 yrs old).  Seems to give a glow to my complexion, but again, after 2 months use, I can&#x27;t tell that anything permanent had taken place.  I still look 57...LOL!</li>
    <li> Works great, smells good, there is a result. I love it. Perfect substitution for more expensive brands like skinsuticals and others</li>
    <li> I would like to say that Cosmetic skin solution has great customer service and will stand behind their products! I purchased a botched bottle of this serum from another retailer and the cosmetic skin solution company replaced it for me right away. This product is just like ones i have used before from skinceuticals for about three times the cost. Its a great product and a great company!</li>
    <li> Amazing is the only word to describe PHLORETIN. My skin is soft, bright and looks like a baby face i am really happy.</li>
</ol>
