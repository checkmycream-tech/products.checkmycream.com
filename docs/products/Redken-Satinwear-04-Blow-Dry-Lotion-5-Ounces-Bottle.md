      <li>item arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>

      <li>Shipping was decent and packaging was just right!</li>

    <li> I love using this Redken Satinwear Blow Dry hair lotion!!  It&#x27;s very lightweight and leaves your hair feeling very silky when done.  It&#x27;s not a heavy weight gel either which can weigh your hair down.  Sometimes I like to combine this one with the 09 gel too, on humid days and if you want more hold in your hair. But the 02 is great for every day!!</li>
    <li> Used for the first time this morning. An excellent product. I had no idea that this is a cream. I was thrilled with results. I blow dry my hair and just found this product and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt; It is wonderful. My hair is soft and styled. I do have my hair professionally colored and no problem with color fading.. I am almost 72 and have tried hundreds of different hair proucts.&lt;br /&gt; I will reorder this as soon as I need it.</li>
    <li> I started using Satinwear about a year ago.  It was a pricey salon purchase but loved how easily is made my wavy hair smooth and straight.  I ran out a few months ago and couldn&#x27;t find similar product that had the same results.  I searched the internet for a less expensive option and was pleased to find it at half the cost on Amazon.  I actually got a buy one, get one deal and even with shipping it was still less than what I paid at the salon.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Hello, I use this product as a leave in conditioner and it works wonderfully.   It adds shine and hold, and with no heavy or greasy feeling. Light and clean I don&#x27;t even blow dry it, I just run my fingers through my hair for a a light finger wave. Absolutely this is the best leave in type product I&#x27;ve run across.  6 stars out of 5!!!</li>
    <li> My stylist used this after she colored my hair and I loved how it made my hair feel so I bought a bottle to try it out at home at it works like magic--I used a tiny amount, blew dry my hair and there was no frizz.  Also, my hair was so soft everyone wanted to touch it.  My hair stayed soft and non-frizzy for the rest of the day.  I&#x27;ve become a believer and a daily user!</li>
    <li> Abosulutely love this product. Don&#x27;t use too much. A little dab makes your hair feel so silky! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product does everything I want. It thickens the hair and makes it more manageable without leaving my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> Really helps protect my hair!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling really soft and it smells so good!! I always recommend to use Redken products when it comes to heat. It seems to work best with my hair.</li>
    <li> The best styling gel I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Will make your hair like silk!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like \\&quot;satin\\&quot;. I&#x27;d rather just go back to using the Bumble and Bumble product that I used.</li>
    <li> best product out there for long hair</li>
    <li> I started using this I apply after towel drying daily regardless of if I&#x27;m going to blow dry or not it keeps my hair healthier and adds more shine to the color.  It also smells good which is a bonus.  I think it&#x27;s a great product from Redken and recommend it for those who have color treated hair who want to keep the color fresh and also people who have dry or damaged hair from it being color treated or using too many heating products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have VERY thick hair and I use about a nickel size amount on my wet hair. I distribute it evenly and then I blow dry my hair before using a flat iron. It leaves my hair soft, smooth and tangle free. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works as well. I would definitely recommend it! Great product!</li>
    <li> So I saw the ratings for this product and had to buy. I usually wear Paul Mitchell blow out and it doesn&#x27;t protect my hair at all. So I decided to use this product besides my daily keratin treatment and it works wonders. No split ends like before. I used to get so many split ends when I would blow dry and use other products.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft. Tossed the rest of my hair products that I would use before drying my hair</li>
    <li> Why do companies insist on messing with their best products?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not the same as the older red bottle version. The old red version of this product was perfect, and made my fine straight hair silky soft, but able to hold a loose wave for a couple of days after blow drying. This new black version makes my hair too heavy and greasy within a day, and the hair falls completely flat after a couple of hours at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars since it&#x27;s still better than nothing and hopefully protects my hair from thermal damage, but I&#x27;m very disappointed the company changed the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it daily. Shipping was decent and packaging was just right!</li>
    <li> Smells great. love this stuff</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase if this product. item arrived quickly and well packaged. makes my hair very soft and helps moisturize hair. i would suggest this product for all hair types. works great! awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have very kinky and curly natural hair. I got this because I saw the great reviews. After washing and deep conditioning my hair and air drying it with a leave in, my hair was already soft, but as I applied it to my damp hair just before blow drying...WOW. It glided so smoothly and it only took my pass of my denman and blow dryer for it to feel soft, relax my curl, and it be pretty straight for just blowing it out. Super soft results and when I flat ironed, it felt SO light. This product gave me soft and moisturized results without the extra manipulation and tugging. I recommend to all naturals!! Buying again</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Very light, doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and it truly fights off humidity! I will be honest, I naturally have semi-wavy hair, and on a very humid, sticky day, my hair will curl up- but it generally works really well and smells nice too! Def recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. It has a great scent and makes my hair really soft. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This will protect damp hair from the damage blow dryers do. It&#x27;s quite amazing stuff. Only need a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and find it one of the best ways to keep my hair in control.</li>
    <li> good product.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> nice product but what was pictured was not what came in the mail....different packaging, different feel (gray, not pink). I&#x27;ve tried both the gray packaged product and the pink (bought in-store), and honestly, I like the gray better anyway. They may be the same since both are 02 satinwear, however, seller should not be misleading with pictured image and what is actually delivered.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. My salon used it and I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of this product. It keeps your hair silky&lt;br /&gt;even after blow drying and hot roller use.</li>
    <li> I was doing a lot of research, trying to find a product that would protect my hair when I blow dry and/or straightening it. I did not want to spend way too much after all a high price on a product doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it works. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. SO I decided to give this a go after reading all the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it smells good but it was very sticky. It did protect my hair but it had a stick to it. My hair did not have the shine compared to the other products I&#x27;ve used before. It did not get silky either. I have dry, wavy, thick and coarse hair. I was hoping this product would solve my issues but I am not fond of it. I still apply some but it&#x27;s not comparable to the BioSilk Silk Therapy I&#x27;ve used for years (was looking for a change).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it works wonders for specific people but not for me.  Even when I blow dry, it&#x27;s practically the same result as if I didn&#x27;t apply this. Rather upset with the results but it&#x27;s okay. That was a whole part of experimenting. Not a bad product, just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> I Love this. It smells so good and really works. I will be reording this again. It also has lasted me a while</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to protect my hair from heat and this product claims to protect up to 450 degrees. I have found this seems to be accurate, although I still burn my hair occasionally when I hold the dryer over a spot that did not get this lotion on it. It is light weight and does not add a heavy feel to the hair once finished, it is also great for curling irons. My hair is medium/long and it requires two pumps of this to get the job done. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this a great light lotion which leaves my hair soft not oily or greasy</li>
    <li> It does help your hair dry like it says. But if you have a powerful hair dryer, BEWARE! It will leave rats nests in your hair and winds up hurting your hair more than helping. Was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i discovered this product and i love it. i have slightly wavy hair that i like to blow-dry straight. this makes my hair SOFT SHINY and SMOOTH. i agree with the other reviewers - a little product does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it is great to protect hair from heat and gives you that satin finish, It leaves the hair silky and smooth</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this by my hairdresser.  Great silky results from heat styling which last until my next wash.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product it leaves my hair soft, shiny, and silky with no waxy or tacky feeling buildup.</li>
    <li> I have allergies to most hair products,  my hairdresser introduced me to this and is one of the only products not to break my head out</li>
    <li> Fantastic product &amp; better that so many others that sell for $$$$. This does everything it promises!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is super soft with it and I have less fly aways (Even in humid weather)</li>
    <li> I rarely use heat on my hair. I prefer to let my hair air dry, but when I do need to blowdry or use hot tools I always use this first. I love the smell, the softness, and I always have manageable and easy to style hair afterward. My hair is really bad about getting split ends (even though I rarely use heat) and this has helped protect my hair. Since I rarely use it, I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for almost a year and half and it&#x27;s not even halfway gone. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, shoulder length hair. I use a dime-sized squirt in my palm and rub my hands together before applying to my damp hair. I try to make sure that my ends are covered since they need protection most. I don&#x27;t go near my scalp with this because if I use too much it&#x27;s super heavy and makes my hair look greasy. I kind of know by feel how much I need to use, so I wipe the excess off on a towel. A dime sized amount is sometimes too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I spray a bit of It&#x27;s A 10 (ASIN: B002CMLHEC) on it. Just one or two little spritzes, and scrunch up my hair to distribute. Then I blow it straight. I don&#x27;t need a straightening iron if I blowdry it correctly (my natural texture is a soft wave) which is helpful because that&#x27;s less heat I have to put on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my toddler&#x27;s hair. She has long, thick but fine (thick texture/lots of hair but a thin strand) curly hair. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, just before styling it for special occasions. She will not tolerate blow drying (her hair is so fine that it air dries in minutes) and she has Disney Princess curls so she doesn&#x27;t need hot tools. I add it to her hair while it&#x27;s still damp and it adds definition to her curls and tames flyaways. It&#x27;s such a light formula that I feel okay putting it on her hair and knowing it won&#x27;t damage it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and silky and it smells great. Other heat protectors tend to make my hair sticky or even leave a dull residue. This is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really like using this product when I blow dry my hair. It really makes the frizzies disappear. I would recommend this to anyone of any type of hair.</li>
    <li> It is just an average product. Probably will not buy again. Does not seem to make my hair more shiny or soft than other products I have used. Not worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> Great blow out lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy.  Have tried so many products and finally found the perfect one!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but it is FRIZZY if I do not apply heat to it. This makes my hair so silky, and frizz-free, when I blow dry it.  I also put it on my hair when it is wet, let it air dry, then use a straightener.</li>
    <li> Absolutely live this product! I love the feel feel of my hair after the blowdry!</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product, especially the fragrance.... but Redken evidently changed the ingredients and packaging, it has a different fragrance now, but this was not mentioned in the description.  I contacted the seller and they sent me the link for Redken to show the change and said I could return items.  I bought 2, but I just kept them.  Very disappointed, but seller did respond.  I wish the change had been noted though, I probably would not have purchased.  This picture is not the new package look, it is the old one.  New bottle has silver print not black.</li>
    <li> While it won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, it really does nothing to condition or moisturize.  As a blow dry lotion, it&#x27;s hard to say whether it is effective since my hair seems to be getting more dried out...</li>
    <li> I bought this and it protects my hair wonderfully. I had dry hair and it is much healthier now that I have been using this product</li>
    <li> Love this product, it leaves my hair so smooth and silky ! The smell is incredible, it smells all day long. I can&#x27;t get enough!!! I wish it was a little cheaper but it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE**** 8/30/2014&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased this product again because I thought it would be the same pink bottle that I received the first time.&lt;br /&gt;However, this seller has sent me the newer black bottle. I&#x27;m disappointed because that&#x27;s the reason I had chosen THIS specific listing. Not sure if the formula has changed, but Amazon should change the photo and not be misleading!!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot it works great I would buy it again. All you need is just one little pump and your hair is good to go after you do you stuff with your hair;</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  I blow-dry my hair everyday and it was getting fried and brittle.  I have thin, fine hair.  Using a little amount of this blow-dry lotion goes a long way and my hair is protected.  More manageable and doesn&#x27;t get dried out anymore.  Only downside is that bottle is pricey, but plan to use it sparingly to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> 5 star rating because this product is truly AWESOME!!! I got a sample of it in the mail about a year ago. It literally transforms your hair into a silky mane and it doesn&#x27;t conflict with what ever other types of products you have in your hair, meaning a recent dye job,or perm. It&#x27;s very hard to find, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!!!! oh, you can use it on dry hair as well. Of course its a leave in conditioner, but I don&#x27;t even need to blow dry my hair after I apply this, it&#x27;s that good! And my hair doesn&#x27;t come out crunchy and rough as with other lotions. Excellent,excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It makes my hair feel so silky and smooth after blow drying!  It leaves it feeling soft and beautiful all day long!  I have very long hair and I highly recommend this product and company!</li>
    <li> I blow dry my hair every day and this is the product is perfect. Makes hair feel smooth, silky and sleek (insert other synonyms here). I take a pump of this and a pump of the anti-snap also from Redken and rub my hands together and run it through my hair (my hair is medium-long length and thick). Great value, use this almost every day and I still have the bottle I purchased in Feb 2013. If you use too much your hair will feel somewhat greasy, just use one pump. Ulta no longer carries this, so I will be buying from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Using this helps dry your hair quicker, so use the lower setting on your hair dryer as it&#x27;s not as necessary to use the high setting.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and the product doesn&#x27;t weight or make it look greasy. The blowdrying became so easy and with very good result.&lt;br /&gt;I colour my hair blonde, and for the first time in a very long time I have shiny tips after blowdrying. They used to get dull and dry.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hair product I use -- I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle in about a year.  2 or 3 pumps of this stuff every morning keeps my hair under control... in terrible humidity, too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a creamy solution. I love all Redken products. I mainly use this with my new Valera Nano 9000 professional hair dryer. However I like to use it mainly when I use my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works fabulous! I  recommend this product 100%,</li>
    <li> My hair looks great every time I use it. Cant even tell I have product in my hair either!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years now. It is my go to when I straighten my naturally curly hair. I just put on after towel drying my hair and it keeps my hair shiny and gives it a little shape. When I use this prior to blow drying I really don&#x27;t need to touch up with a curling iron. I love the smell it is clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Smoothes out my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Came in a black bottle and not a pink one which I like better anyway.</li>
    <li> My hair looks awesome when I blow dry. No more of the&amp;#34;dry tip&amp;#34; look. I am waving my silky smooth hair everywhere.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Keeps hair soft and shiny. Makes tangles disappear. Highly recommended, and it only takes a dab.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; have very thick, course hair that always looks frizzy. This product softens and reduces frizz without making my hair feel or look greasy.</li>
