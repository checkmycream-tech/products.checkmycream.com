      <li>I love Pureology products.  </li>
      <li>so I use it mostly as I do sunscreen, when I&#x27;m outdoors.</li>
      <li>Really protects your hair from sun damage as well as great to aid in tangles.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found this doesn&#x27;t preserve my hair color any better than not wearing a hair sunscreen at all.  </li>
      <li>I also love the smell of this spray.  </li>
      <li>and this is quick and easy at a good price.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair healthy and tangle free, as it helps my hair color from fading.</li>
      <li>It has greatly delayed the fading process and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Maybe the desert Southwest sun is too strong for the product</li>
      <li>Not only do I use this as a spray conditioner for my hair, it is also a great de-tangler.  </li>
      <li>mMy hair color faded quick and the chlorine damamged it.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell too.</li>
      <li>Smells like the salon right after you get your hair</li>
      <li>Not too sure if it actually working though....</li>
      <li>I was really upset to find they&#x27;ve changed the formula (as well as the packaging) on this product.</li>
      <li>Also seems to really help the color not fade in the sun.</li>
      <li>have gone with out for a period of time when I ran out of product and could really tell the difference.</li>
      <li>Just like the original formula only.  </li>
      <li>Detangles well as I have very long fine hair.</li>
      <li>Hard to get in the larger quart volume, but if you can find it, it is a great deal.</li>
      <li>I live in a very sunny state</li>
      <li>But I dye my hair a bold, vibrant red</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this color care product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you spend a lot of time outdoors.</li>
      <li>My hair looked soft and shiny, but I don&#x27;t think it really helped to protect my color.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smeel like they normally do and had zero effect on my hair.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and this product does not irritate it....and doesn&#x27;t cause my hair color to fade.</li>
      <li>It did make my hair manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>This product is one of the few products sunscreen products available for women that color their hair.  </li>
      <li>I have been fighting the grays for some time and frequently color my hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin, color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Not any other new combination spray or such.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> As much as I love Purology products, I didn&#x27;t even like this one. I honestly  doubt that this is an authentic Purology products. It didn&#x27;t smeel like they normally do and had zero effect on my hair. I felt like I was spraying water on. I feel like I have wasted my money on this one.</li>
    <li> I use this before I go in the sun or before I go in the pool.&lt;br /&gt;It protects my hair from chlorine damage and keeps it from fading my color.&lt;br /&gt;I have gone with out for a period of time when I ran out of product and could really tell the difference. mMy hair color faded quick and the chlorine damamged it.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell too. Smells like the salon right after you get your hair done.&lt;br /&gt;The price was better on Amazon than at the salon. :)</li>
    <li> Smells great,  Smooths,  Use on wet hair with the Pureology Max Shine.  I let my hair dry naturally, no heat.  Hard to get in the larger quart volume, but if you can find it, it is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is a great detangler and brightens my blond. I highly recommend this color care product.</li>
    <li> This seemed to work just so-so. My hair looked soft and shiny, but I don&#x27;t think it really helped to protect my color.</li>
    <li> Not only do I use this as a spray conditioner for my hair, it is also a great de-tangler.  I have a very sensitive scalp and this product does not irritate it....and doesn&#x27;t cause my hair color to fade.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist. Very Impressed.  Had a problem with the shipment being damaged but the company has incredible customer service. Kuddos!!</li>
    <li> THis is an excellent product for colored hair - i always get it online and this is quick and easy at a good price.</li>
    <li> Been buying for years-great product.</li>
    <li> While this was not the product I was searching for...I found a gem. Detangles well as I have very long fine hair. Also seems to really help the color not fade in the sun. Does what it states it will and smells good too.</li>
    <li> As described, thank you!</li>
    <li> I love Pureology products.  Not too sure if it actually working though....but I&#x27;m using it.  :)  Recommended by hair stylist</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I live in a very sunny state so it helps my color last I&#x27;m between hair appointments.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Pureology products. Leaves my hair healthy and tangle free, as it helps my hair color from fading.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the few products sunscreen products available for women that color their hair.  I lived in eastern Washington where the sun shines 300 days per year and this product prevents color fading in your hair.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Maybe the desert Southwest sun is too strong for the product but I&#x27;ve found this doesn&#x27;t preserve my hair color any better than not wearing a hair sunscreen at all.  It&#x27;s nourishing, I&#x27;ll give it that.  Hence the two stars.  But I dye my hair a bold, vibrant red and I&#x27;ve noticed the same amount of fading not wearing anything versus using this product daily.  Considering the cost and it doesn&#x27;t perform it&#x27;s desired function for me (while it&#x27;s nourishing I also use oils in my hair so it&#x27;s not necessary for me to keep using) I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I was really upset to find they&#x27;ve changed the formula (as well as the packaging) on this product. It now contains denatured alcohol as the second ingredient. It smells of alcohol now - not to mention alcohol is extremely drying and not at all what I want on my hair! I&#x27;m not able to return this so it was a complete waste of money. Pureology has lost my business, sadly.</li>
    <li> Really protects your hair from sun damage as well as great to aid in tangles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and it extends my color for a couple of months, which saves $$ at the hair dresser. I use this and the Pureology shampoos and conditioners and have noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> I used it everyday on my 2 week vacation to Barbados. My color still faded. I am red though so it is hard not to get fading in the sun. But honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the fading with this product. It did make my hair manageable and soft. But that is not what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, color-treated hair.  Pureology products seems to work best for me and they protect my hair color as well.  :o)</li>
    <li> The only problem is they quit making it!!!!! Why did you do that Pureology?  This is the best &amp;#34;after shampoo&amp;#34; uv protection, leave-in spray that I have found.  I also love the smell of this spray.  It also does some &amp;#34;taming&amp;#34; of my hair too, although it isn&#x27;t made for that.&lt;br /&gt;I can only ask that Pureology would start making it again.  Not any other new combination spray or such.  Just like the original formula only.  I tried the other one they made to replace it and it doesn&#x27;t work the same and leaves the hair heavier.  I don&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t buy that one.  Please Pureology, bring it back.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting the grays for some time and frequently color my hair. I also spend a lot of time in the sun which basically bleaches my color out and turns my hair to straw. I have tried other products which did not deliver and decided to try this product soon after I colored. It has greatly delayed the fading process and leaves my hair soft and shiny. I highly recommend if you spend a lot of time outdoors. It is a little on the greasy side so I use it mostly as I do sunscreen, when I&#x27;m outdoors. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will buy again.</li>
