      <li>Love this product, for dry curly hair</li>
      <li>this large bottle is a bit cumbersome.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good products to use on my daughters curly hair and the Paul Mitchell Curls line is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Thick consistency.  It takes a lot of shampoo and water for my hair to get sudsy.  Not purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo that makes my hair curly not frizzy - and I have been on the hunt for 38 years!!!!!! Got samples at the dirty girl run and had to buy this. Love it!!!! Wish I could subscribe and save, and that they carried the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Lightly perfumed leaving a fresh, clean scent that lasts all day. Best of all, it really tames the frizz while defining waves and curls from root to tip.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO IS COUNTERFEIT.  The bottle came with a &amp;#34;Try me, not for resale&amp;#34; Sticker on it, the barcode was covered with a sticker (Not totally out of the normal I know), it LATHERS A LOT (not sulphate free), is a funny yellow color, and has a different smell to it than all other Paul Mitchel products I have in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNACCEPTABLE.</li>
    <li> Love this product, for dry curly hair</li>
    <li> All the Paul Mitchell for curly hair seems to try to add volume and that&#x27;s the last thing I need.  I already have enough hair for 3 people, but if you need to add volume, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very wavy hair, its also very long and knotty so this shampoo is very helpful when trying to comb out the knots. The bottle lasts forever but that is possibly because she doesnt wash her hair with every shower (that would not be good for her hair!).</li>
    <li> I am a product junky.  I have been looking for an ultra moisturizing shampoo that: 1.) Does not eight my hair down, 2.) Does not leave my hair poof and hard to brush, 3.) Makes my hair soft and shiny, 4.) Smells clean and not to perfume like, 5.) Sulfate free, 6.) I have a ton of allergies and doesn&#x27;t break out my scalp.  I do not have curly thick hair.  I have wavy fine hair, but a ton of it.  I was always told to stay away from curl products.  However, I stumbled across an article that stated for wavy frizzy hair curl shampoos are the best because (just as this product says)  it moisturizes, while taming frizz and not roughing up the cuticle and therefore detangling your hair as well.  I have never had any shampoo work so well for me.  I love the light clean smell, the softness and texture of my hair, the rejuvenated shine and color is has now, I was able to use it with one of my deep conditioners, and I blow dried my hair straight without a hitch.  I was incredibly amazed and about to give up on ever finding a product like this.  I have always been afraid to let my hair grow out for fear of how it would look, but with this I think I can do it!</li>
    <li> This product is not Paul Mitchell shampoo, it is horrible and dried out my hair.</li>
    <li> I recently moved from a dry to humid climate and my hair dresser suggested I use this product line after I complained about how poofy my hair looked with the humidity.  The Curls shampoo, leave in conditioner and curl definer have made my hair much more manageable with humidity.  The products control my hairs natural curl instead of leaving my hair a poofy mess.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo you can find anywhere.  I have permed hair, and with this shampoo it is never snarled.  I love the Paul Mitchell products, and love that I can get them online.</li>
    <li> this large bottle is a bit cumbersome. the price was hard to resist, but since getting it I&#x27;ve found that it takes up a lot of space, and the product itself is a lot heavier than the trial size and smaller bottle I purchased at the salon.  It leaves my hair much heavier (with more residue).  But still - it really works with your own curl to pick it up and make your hair look great.  This is the best product my curly-haired self has found to keep things under control!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair but leaves it with long loose curls.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone who has natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> I initially bought a smaller size at my hair dresser&#x27;s. That one worked fine. Thought I could get it cheaper and a larger size on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for about 2-3 months, and couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair was becoming do dull and DRY, DRY.&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized that this shampoo was probably not the authentic Paul Mitchell shampoo that I was used to when purchased directly from a salon.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, another life lesson learned.....</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very hair friendly. There is no alcohol in it. It curls my hair and gives it shine and body.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I&#x27;ve purchased every product under the sun to get my wavy hair to curl and not look fuzzy. Unfortunately, I was never satisfied and continued to buy product after product. I like the Mousse Paul Mitchell makes, I have used it for years. So when I saw they made a curl shampoo, I immediately started looking for where I could buy it. Thank you AMAZON!! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;S. D., Ohio</li>
    <li> Not only a wonderful product but great customer support and excellent service. Would definately order again.Item received fast and as described.</li>
    <li> This has totally calmed my hair down. I also like the convenience of the pump for dispensing shampoo when I need it.</li>
    <li> This really does work to enhance my curls.  I have long hair, and it looks like it did when I was a teen.  I&#x27;m 66 yrs old.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best I have tried. It keeps my hair from the frizzies and gives me more control without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all the curly girls out there.</li>
