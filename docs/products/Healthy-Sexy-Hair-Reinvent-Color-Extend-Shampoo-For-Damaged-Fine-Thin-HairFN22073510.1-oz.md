    <li> This product smells good and lasts long. You don&#x27;t have to use that much. I do not like the conditioner in this line though. Doesn&#x27;t condition that well. The shampoo is good though. This shipper always sends quickly and I&#x27;ve never had any problems.</li>
    <li> My favorite Shampoo. I am unable to find it anywhere else. Hope they don&#x27;t take it off the market.</li>
    <li> Keeps color in much longer.</li>

    <li> I received this product several days ago, in a fragrance.net box, I received samples of their new products with the shampoo. I was delighted with the shampoo, I was also delighted with the perfume sample, eye sample, and emery nail board samples. I&#x27;m glad I received coupons for each sample. I would reorder from them again. Best seller, best company to buy anything fragrance from too. They have great sales too!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Mom, so I only have her review.  For her it did not foam enough.</li>
    <li> Since I was a teenager, I&#x27;ve had such problems in finding shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in a few hours. Healthy, Sexy Hair is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve found that will keep my hair beautiful all day. A tip: Buy the 33oz size, it&#x27;s a much better deal!</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered shampoo...but I got conditioner. Either way, my daughter loves the Sexy Hair products.</li>
    <li> This was part of my order when I got the conditioner, but sad to say I never received it.  I was mistakenly sent a proactive product instead and although I returned the proactive product, I never received the shampoo.  I was sad because I had to purchase a different shampoo which I don&#x27;t like as well.</li>
    <li> It has the consistency of water.  I never used this brand before, so maybe that is how it is supposed to be, but I have to wash my hair twice each time I tried it.  I keep wondering if it is really the real thing or a fake that I got.  It was not wrapped in plastic when I got it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the rating time frame for Sexy Hair Shampoo.  My initial reaction is &amp;#34;so far so good&amp;#34;.  Will update my review if I find any issues with this product.</li>
    <li> Was this watered down? No where near as thick as when I buy at Ulta</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m a guy and usually don&#x27;t care about this kind of stuff. It&#x27;s kind of spendy but worth it. I dilute it with water (50/50) because it&#x27;s so thick and it still works great.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair like silk</li>
