      <li>I figured spending the extra money would give me a better product.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before but was looking for something to provide a \\&quot;more finished\\&quot; look.  </li>
      <li>still use my good cheapo ceramic conair iron daily at a low setting as needed.  </li>
      <li>i have naturally pretty straight hair</li>
      <li>I would get many compliments so after getting my hair back into health, I turned again to the high heat ceramics.  </li>
      <li>This iron heats up very quickly and I only need to pull it through my hair one time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like they seal my ends and make my hair very shiny and sleek.</li>

      <li>I have fairly straight hair to start with.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would use it that much but find myself using it almost every day.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

      <li>I normally wear my hair curly or in two strand twists.</li>
      <li>I can get it to that nice silky smooth straight, not the disappointing straight-ish frizz</li>

      <li>texture is medium-coarse and this iron leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>It gets my very curly hair stick-straight and leaves it so much silkier than the other irons I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron gets my hair just as straight as it would if I went to the salon.</li>
      <li>I am caucasian with medium thick, tends to frizz, shoulder length hair and my old Paul Mitchell flat iron always produced great results in just a few minutes-smooth,straight and shiny hair.</li>
      <li>(my hair is fine and shouldn&#x27;t be that hard!).</li>

<li> Not so with this flat iron.</li>
<li> I did receive my replacement flat iron and within 2 months that one broke too.</li>
<li> I bought this flat iron after having an FHI used on my hair at the salon.</li>

<li> I think there is a reason why the FHI is half price!</li>
<li> My hair is not super curly, but it has waves in unpredictable spots and can be difficult to manage esp.</li>
<li> My hair would be shinny with the CHI, but it would also feel hard and fried.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is an incredible flat iron. i have long, thick, wavy hair and it is so easy to straighten with this iron. absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this FHI platform flat iron based on the many good reviews these flat irons have received. However, I returned this FHI because it altered the texture of my hair regardless of which temperature I used. Applying heat protector products for hair did not change the strange results I was getting. My hair looked terrible with the use of this flat iron. Moreover, it was taking too long to style my hair with this product. I am caucasian with medium thick, tends to frizz, shoulder length hair and my old Paul Mitchell flat iron always produced great results in just a few minutes-smooth,straight and shiny hair. So, I returned the FHI and ordered the Paul Mitchell Ion styler flat iron which I am alot happier with. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Paul Mitchell stylers in the future.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse curly hair, and this iron does the trick. It gets super hot, heats up in about 15 seconds  and straightens quickly and very effectively. I can get it to that nice silky smooth straight, not the disappointing straight-ish frizz girls like me are often stuck with. I thought about the 1 3/4\\&quot;, but the 1\\&quot; lets me get my bangs and it&#x27;s still no problem for handling long hair quickly. I used Amazon Prime and got it the next day.Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I love this irons!! It&#x27;s like they seal my ends and make my hair very shiny and sleek. I&#x27;m returning a pair of solia hair irons today. I love my FHIs.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended the FHI flatiron.  It&#x27;s great!  Heats up quickly.  I set temp to about 370 degrees and my hair is so silky.  If you have frizzy hair and are looking for a flat iron that will not only make the hair straight but also feel silky smooth then I would get one of these.</li>
    <li> I am African American with very thick, long, chemically colored, wavy/curly, natural hair. I normally wear my hair curly or in two strand twists. This flat iron gets my hair just as straight as it would if I went to the salon. I only go to the salon to get a trim and color. I use Biosilk in my hair before I press it, and it&#x27;s perfection. With cheaper flat irons my hair would wave/curl up after a day or so. Not so with this flat iron. I had a Chi previously, that broke. And this works the same if not better than the Chi.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who has owned many flat irons and she says this one is the best she has ever had. She also has told me that this exact model is what her hair stylist uses and sells them for about $150.</li>
    <li> this straightener is a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  i use to buy really cheap ones like conair and revlon and then my hair stylist told me about the fhi platform and i began to look for them and saw they were 200$$$!!!!!!!!! but then here only $90, once got it i saw the result and they left me speechless!     i have naturally pretty straight hair but i have alot so its puffy and sometimes firzzy and a straightener helps me keep it tamed. and wit the platform my hair felt so soft and silky and pin straight. all i can say s if u have the 90$ to spend then definity spend it on this cuz i dont regret it at all.</li>
    <li> I have fairly straight hair to start with.  I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before but was looking for something to provide a \\&quot;more finished\\&quot; look.  This fits the bill.  It does a great job of smoothing out my hair.  It heats up very quickly.  It goes down the hair very smoothly - no tugging or tearing.  It does a good job without major abuse to the hair and adds shine.  I didn&#x27;t think I would use it that much but find myself using it almost every day.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair straight, soft and shiny. It does the job pretty well and in no time. I have natural wavy hair and it tames them down very nicely. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because I heard it was the best. The first time I used it, it broke. I figured that was just a faulty one. I sent it back and asked for a replacement. I did receive my replacement flat iron and within 2 months that one broke too. I figured spending the extra money would give me a better product. I guess I was wrong!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after having an FHI used on my hair at the salon. The stylist told me FHI&#x27;s were the best. My hair has never looked better. This iron heats up very quickly and I only need to pull it through my hair one time. I actually cut out using the blowdryer. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron that does what it is supposed to do. It straightened my kinky, wavy black hair with 1 pass. No problems so far. Love it.</li>
    <li> I get monthly chemical relaxers, so I just need a flat iron to take the texture out of my hair when I blow dry.  I don&#x27;t know about using a flat iron as a daily straighener because my hair is already chemically straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My texture is medium-coarse and this iron leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I use my FHI once a week whenever I wash it, and I feel the difference for days.  The CHI may have just been too hot for my hair because the one I had didn&#x27;t have the temperature setting.  After I used this FHI a few times, I gave my old CHI to my friend.  My hair would be shinny with the CHI, but it would also feel hard and fried.  Plus after about 2 days, it seems like it needed to use some serious CHI heat again which may have contributed to my hair breakage so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser uses FHI and my hair always feel great. I would get many compliments so after getting my hair back into health, I turned again to the high heat ceramics.  When I use the FHI, I can go a nearly a week with using minimial or no additional heat. I especially noticed the difference in the back of my hair (known to some as the \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use my good cheapo ceramic conair iron daily at a low setting as needed.  I could also use the FHI daily at the lower settings, but the cheaper irons do just as well after my hair is initially strengthened with the FHI.  So why burn out this expensive iron everyday?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many flat irons and hair products.  To me, the health of your hair and your regime makes a huge in the determining whether a hair tool or hair product works.  I definitely recommend any flat iron that is ceramic. Even the cheap ones help my hair hold moisture - less frying.  It makes a huge difference for me! Combine it with a ionic dryer, a great conditioner and setting lotion, and I am good!</li>
    <li> This iron broke in 1 2/2 week of receiving it. I bought the Sedu and it is out of this world. The sedu is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I had to turn this iron up really high to get any results (my hair is fine and shouldn&#x27;t be that hard!). It always felt dry afterwards. I went back to my HAI and realized how good it really is!! I think there is a reason why the FHI is half price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of flat irons and this one is, by far, the best! It gets my very curly hair stick-straight and leaves it so much silkier than the other irons I&#x27;ve used.  This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent iron for straightening and styling.  No pulling of the hair.</li>
    <li> Just finished trying out the FHI Heat Platform flatiron (1&amp;#34;). After washing and without product, my hair is quite curly and prone to frizz. I used a creme for frizz while my hair was wet and let it dry.  Just before using the flatiron, I used a spray specifically for protecting hair from heat. I was happy to see this flatiron did the trick - giving me shiny, sleek, straight hair unlike curling/flat irons I&#x27;d previously used.  And it came in just a few days, even using the SuperSaver shipping option. Update: 8 years later, it&#x27;s still working...quite a feat compared to some of my cheaper model heat styling tools.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great flat iron.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a good flat iron for years.  The salon I go to uses the FHI brand so I decided to purchase this model.  I&#x27;m bi racial and have VERY curly hair it gets my hair pretty straight and REALLY shiny.  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after I chopped 11 inches off for Locks of Love. My hair is not super curly, but it has waves in unpredictable spots and can be difficult to manage esp. in humid weather when you have short hair. It was not as much of a problem when I had longer hair, but when I got my hair cut, I knew I had to invest in a good quality flat iron.     I decided to go with FHI for the simple reason that my hair dresser used it and my friend with really curly hair used it and it straightened her hair like she had naturally straight hair. I chose platform b/c of the varying degrees of heat. I&#x27;ve found for my hair, 375 works great. Since I&#x27;ve gotten the hair straightner, I don&#x27;t have bad hair days anymore and my hair is manageable and tamed. No more odd strans in the back sticking out in directions it&#x27;s not suppose to be. It&#x27;s easy to use and heats up so fast! I&#x27;ve bought drugstore type straighters in the past that were not only difficult to use, but didn&#x27;t work as well and still left my hair course and wavy. FHI leaves my hair sleek, shiny and looking like I spend a lot of time on my hair. My sister in law has the same hair texture and length as me. She has a salon caliber straightner. After she tried mine, she loved it and wants one for herself. It may seem pricey, but the results it produces, is well worth the price!!</li>
