      <li>I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>Love the Sexy Hair Curl Cream too.</li>
      <li>With the addition of the &#x27;color safe&#x27; component it changed the results some, but I can&#x27;t find any non &#x27;color safe&#x27; type.</li>
      <li>The first week, it seemed amazing!</li>
      <li>I like thresame shampoo better</li>
      <li>I have been using Curly Sexy Hair for 10 years.  </li>
      <li>with this brand it takes more conditioner than others.</li>
      <li>This is for me the best for keeping hair frizz-free and healthy compared to other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My hair stays frizz free all day.  </li>
      <li>My hair has a wave to medium curl and can turn into a huge fuzzball quickly.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my curls feeling refreshed and full.</li>
      <li>I really like paul Mitchell better.  </li>
      <li>definition is great, my hair feels clean, and it is still a great value a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It arrived fairly quick.</li>
      <li>My curls have never been more defined, soft and shiny!  </li>
      <li>I do feel that the old formula shampoo/conditioner was better.</li>
      <li>The product arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>, three months later: So, after using this product for three months straight, I&#x27;m still totally thrilled.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out my curls like so many others do.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>so I ordered it and used it the times before going back to sexy hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I used to be able to use a quarter size amount of conditioner on my very long hair...</li>
      <li>Using this product still to determine if its what making my scalp itch so much.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t really see it helping my curls or color.  </li>
      <li>I used to swear by Target&#x27;s store-brand curly shampoo with cornstarch, but of course they stopped making it, and until now I really haven&#x27;t found a product that works.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I have normally liked this brand in the past but won&#x27;t plan on buying the shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
      <li>A lot of product for a decent price.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I was worried that this shampoo might eventually irritate my scalp - nope!</li>
      <li>Four stars because I wish it would do a little more for definition, but</li>
      <li>now I used my whole hand full and conditioned twice and it was still dry!  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good, doesn&#x27;t lather, and was worse for my curly hair than the cheapest shampoo you can buy.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of decreasing potentially harmful chemical use, but I feel this new formula leaves my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>The second week, it was ok, with a slight difference in my hair texture and shine began to diminish.</li>
      <li>Amazon is by far the cheapest place for this duo.</li>
      <li>I have extremely thick curly hair, and tried so many brands over the years that I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
      <li>I have loser curly hair and my daughter has super tight curly hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is super-fine, so although it&#x27;s curly, it frizzes and loses definition really easily.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled, just because the new formula is low sudsing, doesn&#x27;t mean your hair isn&#x27;t getting clean.</li>

<li> but now it&#x27;s gave me dry hair.</li>
<li> but this new formulation SUCKS.  </li>
<li> As expected I have have curly hair hair and I rely on the conditionerto get all my tangles out of my hair so that i can brush it without pain....</li>

<li> Shampoo bottle came open, made a mess inside the package, and wasted quite a bit of the product.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this new \\&quot;sulfate free curl defining conditioner</li>
<li> it enhances my curls and it keeps the frizz down.</li>
<li> I paid over $50 each time for shampoo and conditioner and ended up throwing away both bottles of conditioner because it wouldn&#x27;t even touch my dry thick curly hair.  </li>
<li> In the last two years my hair has gotten very stiff, scratchy and dull.  </li>
<li> I have tried over 25-30 different shampoos trying desperately to bring some life back into m y hair.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> It may work for others , but for me, my hair changed after a few weeks.</li>
<li> I use this shampoo everyday and usually cannot find it on sale.  </li>
<li> I bought a 2nd bottle at a salon because I thought this Amazon purcahse was a fake, and turns out it sucked too.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past</li>
<li> It is weak and watered down.  </li>
<li> This tends to leave my hair a bit dry and weighed down which I know sounds a bit crazy.  </li>
<li> Defective, or at least watered down.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
<li> Received the wrong type.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in the change to this product.  </li>

    <li> Defective, or at least watered down.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like the formula I get from the salon.</li>
    <li> It may work for others , but for me, my hair changed after a few weeks. The first week, it seemed amazing! The second week, it was ok, with a slight difference in my hair texture and shine began to diminish.</li>
    <li> I have been using this duo exclusively for a few years now and it definitely works wonders for naturally curly hair.  I do feel that the old formula shampoo/conditioner was better. With the addition of the &#x27;color safe&#x27; component it changed the results some, but I can&#x27;t find any non &#x27;color safe&#x27; type. I have extremely thick curly hair, and tried so many brands over the years that I&#x27;ve lost count. This is for me the best for keeping hair frizz-free and healthy compared to other brands that I&#x27;ve tried. Amazon is by far the cheapest place for this duo. I have shoulder-length hair and with almost daily use these bottles normally last me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have loser curly hair and my daughter has super tight curly hair. This is the only thing we can both use.</li>
    <li> service and product are both great</li>
    <li> Received the wrong type. I ordered curly received another kind</li>
    <li> I like thresame shampoo better</li>
    <li> Best products that I have ever used for natural curly hair. It eliminates frizzy hair. Great price for the combo of shampoo and conditioner. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past but now it&#x27;s gave me dry hair. This review was written by: Katey</li>
    <li> It arrived fairly quick. However, I don&#x27;t really see it helping my curls or color.  I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of decreasing potentially harmful chemical use, but I feel this new formula leaves my hair dry and frizzy. Curl definition is great, my hair feels clean, and it is still a great value a little goes a long way. Don&#x27;t be fooled, just because the new formula is low sudsing, doesn&#x27;t mean your hair isn&#x27;t getting clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My hair is super-fine, so although it&#x27;s curly, it frizzes and loses definition really easily. I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that will keep the curls defined, and not bother my skin. I used to swear by Target&#x27;s store-brand curly shampoo with cornstarch, but of course they stopped making it, and until now I really haven&#x27;t found a product that works. This does - it provides definition and shine for my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all. Plus it smells great! Four stars because I wish it would do a little more for definition, but honestly it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, three months later: So, after using this product for three months straight, I&#x27;m still totally thrilled. I have very sensitive skin, so I was worried that this shampoo might eventually irritate my scalp - nope! No dryness, no itch, no problem. My hair&#x27;s a lot shinier than it used to be, as well.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo everyday and usually cannot find it on sale.  This was a great price and free shipping with PRIME.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Did not get the item as pictured but still an excellent value</li>
    <li> Shampoo bottle came open, made a mess inside the package, and wasted quite a bit of the product.</li>
    <li> Put the bounce back in my curls!</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly as it works well on my hair.  The product arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> Using this product still to determine if its what making my scalp itch so much.  Never happened before.  I really like paul Mitchell better.  A lot of product for a decent price.  Not too sure of the quality at this time</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, and salon has asked her what she changed.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great smell. Love the Sexy Hair Curl Cream too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good, doesn&#x27;t lather, and was worse for my curly hair than the cheapest shampoo you can buy. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love Curly Sexy Hair products! They definitely enhance my curls. The reason I am giving this product 4 stars though is because of the conditioner. As expected I have have curly hair hair and I rely on the conditionerto get all my tangles out of my hair so that i can brush it without pain.... with this brand it takes more conditioner than others. However, it still smells nice and is great with my curly hair. I would still buy this product again though.</li>
    <li> I have been using Curly Sexy Hair for 10 years.  It&#x27;s always been my favorite go-to but this new formulation SUCKS.  It is weak and watered down.  I used to be able to use a quarter size amount of conditioner on my very long hair...now I used my whole hand full and conditioned twice and it was still dry!  I am very disappointed in this new \\&quot;sulfate free curl defining conditioner stylePRIMED Jojoba oil Panthenol &amp; Proteins\\&quot; formulation it is now.  I bought a 2nd bottle at a salon because I thought this Amazon purcahse was a fake, and turns out it sucked too.  I paid over $50 each time for shampoo and conditioner and ended up throwing away both bottles of conditioner because it wouldn&#x27;t even touch my dry thick curly hair.  Very disappointed in the change to this product.  I wish I could get a bottle of the old stuff, it was perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It makes my hair so soft and as long as ypI rinse well, it leaves no residue behind.  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I LOOOve this stuff. it enhances my curls and it keeps the frizz down. at any salon or any store for this size bottle is 27.50 each so this is a GREAT deal and soo worth the money for wuch a great product</li>
    <li> This tends to leave my hair a bit dry and weighed down which I know sounds a bit crazy.  I have normally liked this brand in the past but won&#x27;t plan on buying the shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
    <li> Came without the shampoo.  Just a bottle of conditioner in a opened bag</li>
    <li> The bottles are not as pictured. One of the bottles was cracked so there was shampoo leaking in the package.</li>
    <li> LOVE how defined my curls are with this line!</li>
    <li> My hair has a wave to medium curl and can turn into a huge fuzzball quickly.  In the last two years my hair has gotten very stiff, scratchy and dull.  I have tried over 25-30 different shampoos trying desperately to bring some life back into m y hair.  This product is like liquid gold.  My curls have never been more defined, soft and shiny!  I have been using it for a month and saw the rave reviews on Diva Curls shampoo so I ordered it and used it the times before going back to sexy hair.  My hair stays frizz free all day.  I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my curls feeling refreshed and full. Does not dry out my curls like so many others do.</li>
    <li> I do like this product but I don&#x27;t love it. I wouldn&#x27;t re buy, I feel like it made my hair more tangly</li>
