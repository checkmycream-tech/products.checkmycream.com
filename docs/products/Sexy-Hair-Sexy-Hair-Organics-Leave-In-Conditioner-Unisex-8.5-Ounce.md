      <li>My hairstylist couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how shiny and healthy my hair looked.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because it didnt have all the added chemicals and parabens that most products do.</li>
      <li>I love the pumo bottle ot</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell</li>
      <li>I WAS SOOOO excited i thought this was a AMAZING CONDITIONER i looked at the ingredients;Organic Aloe Vera Juice Extract, Organic Avacado Extract, Organic Goji Berries Extract &amp; Organic Sunflower Oil</li>

      <li>This product does a great job of de-tangling and taming my long curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It works best for me straight out of the shower when hair is fully wet.</li>
      <li>walgreens.com is a good one for giving the entire ingredient list if they have the product you are looking for.  </li>
      <li>Good product, was surprised by size of product, works really well.</li>
      <li>but I love the free shipping and my soft hair.</li>
      <li>This really smooths my hair and makes it easy to style.</li>
      <li>I like it a lot and notice my hair is more shinny and soft.</li>
      <li>The Sexy Hair Organics Leave-In Conditioner, however, I could not find the complete ingredient list for and found it on Curl Mart at naturallycurly.com</li>
      <li>is is a good price and that it natural (less chemicals than most products).</li>
      <li>the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Works well but smells funny.</li>
      <li>I have asian hair and just needed something to keep my hair healthy as I grew it out.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smooth and soft and detangles my hair too, will buy again</li>
      <li>I love that this is organic, it smells good, and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I felt cheated when I saw the real ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is softer and I don&#x27;t have as much breakage that occurs when I brush my hair in the morning.</li>
      <li>that doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
      <li>I bought it to compliment a conditioner I bought that wasn&#x27;t doing the de-tangling job very well.</li>
      <li>Dimethicone, Fragrance (Parfum), and many other ingredient</li>
      <li>I noticed my hair was soo dry &amp; breaking off easily.</li>
      <li>and I like this better because it is less greasy.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, damaged, dry hair, so I need a really strong, soft, silky leave-in.</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t high maintenance</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for people with damaged hair like me.</li>
      <li>Then I stopped using this and the very first time stopping my hair was back to being buttery soft &amp; not snapping off.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m always trying new products.</li>
      <li>I use this Leave-In Conditioner instead of the clear anti-frizz conditioners I had been using.  </li>
      <li>It was somewhat difficult to figure out how to open, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Recently I started using it again, for about 2 weeks straight.</li>
      <li>not a bad product however it does weigh down the hair a bit</li>
      <li>I feel like I have to use more than I&#x27;d like for my long hair and have tried other products that work better, but they were expensive and not organic.</li>
      <li>My hair type is very dry and intensely curly.</li>
      <li>Spend the extra couple dollars and get a leave-in that actually makes your hair feel soft.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, not the worst I&#x27;ve used but far from the best.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s lightweight and won&#x27;t make your hair greasy like some other leave-ins do.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Use it after I straighten my hair and it makes my hair super soft and smells amazing! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works great, shiny easy to brush hair, but, It&#x27;s NOT organic. The description is very poor and the title misleading. I felt cheated when I saw the real ingredients. As a Leave In, 4 stars, as an Organic Zero Stars!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful leave in conditioner. I bought it because it didnt have all the added chemicals and parabens that most products do. When I used it I was pleased at how great my hair felt, my hair was super easy to brush while wet. I will definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I WAS SOOOO excited i thought this was a AMAZING CONDITIONER i looked at the ingredients;Organic Aloe Vera Juice Extract, Organic Avacado Extract, Organic Goji Berries Extract &amp; Organic Sunflower Oil....i was STUNNED at how amazing they were untill i researched further and found that it has more then triple the amount more of TERRIBLE CHEMCIALS IN IT....i will not be purchasing this item for the following reasons  -TERRIBLE INGREDIENTS  -not good for enviroment(THEy LIE!!!!)  -its a SPRAY ON(i always like cream better)</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I now have an organic leave-in conditioner to protect my hair.  I hope to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair so shiny!  My hairstylist couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how shiny and healthy my hair looked.  It&#x27;s lightweight and won&#x27;t make your hair greasy like some other leave-ins do.  The person who left the last review is wrong... this product is a cream, not a spray on.  This product is great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care about the environment and know one hair product not going solve the problem but I love the free shipping and my soft hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this conditioner cause it&#x27;s cheaper than my usuals, Pureology and Unite 7 Seconds. You get what you pay for, not the worst I&#x27;ve used but far from the best. Spend the extra couple dollars and get a leave-in that actually makes your hair feel soft. Gave 2 stars cause the smell was nice.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works well but smells funny.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this could leave my hair so nice.  Highly recommend it for people with damaged hair like me.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I bought it to compliment a conditioner I bought that wasn&#x27;t doing the de-tangling job very well. Two pumps in my super-long, very curly, thick hair is all it takes. It&#x27;s silky and does not weigh down my hair at all, it keeps the curls curly without the &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; Perfection!</li>
    <li> not a bad product however it does weigh down the hair a bit, I have longer hair and I believe with shorter hair this product is more compatible</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of de-tangling and taming my long curly hair.  I use it currently instead of a standard conditioner in the shower and have been using it for almost a year now.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is softer and I don&#x27;t have as much breakage that occurs when I brush my hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> I literally love this stuff! I was using the leave in conditioner from garnier, the sleek and shine one. It left my hair weighed down and dry. This stuff is great, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell but it works so well that doesn&#x27;t really matter. I love the pumo bottle ot comes in as well. I will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> I use this Leave-In Conditioner instead of the clear anti-frizz conditioners I had been using.  It is in a convenient pump container.  I have thick wavy hair with some gray under the color.  This really smooths my hair and makes it easy to style. Not greasy or oily.  It says 90% organic on the bottle and it has a pleasant light scent.</li>
    <li> I have asian hair and just needed something to keep my hair healthy as I grew it out. My hair isn&#x27;t high maintenance I just three pumps when I get out of the shower. It makes it easier to brush through. I like it a lot and notice my hair is more shinny and soft. I like that is is a good price and that it natural (less chemicals than most products). I recommended it to a friend. I have use ( and still use) Miracle 10 and I like this better because it is less greasy.</li>
    <li> This product smells real good.  It does what it describes but I think it is a bit too expensive.  There are products out there for less than half the price that does the same job.</li>
    <li> Good product, was surprised by size of product, works really well. Leaves my hair smooth and soft and detangles my hair too, will buy again</li>
    <li> It was somewhat difficult to figure out how to open, but it&#x27;s a great product. My hair type is very dry and intensely curly.</li>
    <li> I have bleached hair so I&#x27;m always trying new products. Picked this up &amp; tried it a few times then it sat in my bathroom. Recently I started using it again, for about 2 weeks straight. I noticed my hair was soo dry &amp; breaking off easily. Then I stopped using this and the very first time stopping my hair was back to being buttery soft &amp; not snapping off. Im not sure if it&#x27;s my hair type or what but this was definatly a no for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend for dry hair treatment.</li>
    <li> Great for my curly hair. Helps my frizz and defines my curls. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot either. I section my hair, use only a quarter sized amount, then let it air dry. It works best for me straight out of the shower when hair is fully wet. Using on dry hair did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought the Leave-In Conditioner because it was organic.  When I actually got the product and read the label it was only 90% organic ingredients.  So that was disappointing, then reading the actual ingredients on the label it has PEG-17 Dimethicone, Fragrance (Parfum), and many other ingredient I, personally, don&#x27;t care for. I would not order it again.  I so wish the entire ingredients would be posted on the product information here for all hair and skin care products but I guess that would narrow down the sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  I google the product and find a site that gives you the entire ingredient list before buying.  walgreens.com is a good one for giving the entire ingredient list if they have the product you are looking for.  The Sexy Hair Organics Leave-In Conditioner, however, I could not find the complete ingredient list for and found it on Curl Mart at naturallycurly.com but I believe their information was incorrect at the time as it is NOT SILICONE FREE.  HTH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably not use it and give it away.  Sorry, I can&#x27;t tell you how well it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the organic smell, but I love Sexy Hair. This is a wonderful leave in conditioner. My routine is to massage it into my hair, root to tip, then take a towel and remove any excess conditioner. This leave in conditioner gives my hair a nice sheen and noticeable healthy moisture.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for wild curly hair. Happy I ordered more than one.The more product ordered the more you save.</li>
    <li> Works good . the price is very reasonable. I will continue to buy it and tell my friends about it.</li>
    <li> Helps untangle my hair and leaves it softer than washing alone. I feel like I have to use more than I&#x27;d like for my long hair and have tried other products that work better, but they were expensive and not organic. Excellent product for the price and for being organic.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, damaged, dry hair, so I need a really strong, soft, silky leave-in. I love that this is organic, it smells good, and it&#x27;s not too expensive. It works well, but not amazingly. It&#x27;s the best natural thing I&#x27;ve found yet, though, so I&#x27;ll stick with it. It definitely helps detangle, so that&#x27;s great too.</li>
