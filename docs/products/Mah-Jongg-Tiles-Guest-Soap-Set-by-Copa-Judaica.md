      <li>Great and a hit with fellow players</li>
      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>These were great to give to my friends who play Mah Jongg.</li>
      <li>They made a very nice gift.</li>
      <li>I gave these to my sister - Master Maj Jongg Diva - as a Christmas gift - she was thrilled!  </li>
      <li>Our Mah Jongg group is thrilled with these soaps, which will be used as a gift to our Mah Jongg teacher!  </li>
      <li>My friend was thrilled to receive the soaps as a gift!  </li>
      <li>I do not know how the soap is, but it made a great presentation and the person receiving the gift was very pleased.</li>
      <li>Again, the BEST gift to give to someone special, or as I did, split them up and gave them to the winners.</li>
      <li>Cute!  </li>
      <li>They are cute and smell good, though.  </li>
      <li>The symbols were kind of blurred on the soap.</li>
      <li>They arrived early and were perfect.  </li>
      <li>They are so pretty and wonderful for the right person.</li>
      <li>This was an okay gift for my mahjong playing friend.</li>
      <li>Will probably order more around holiday time.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a mah jongg buddy and noticed it in a lovely dish in her guest bathroom.  </li>
      <li>Top and bottom pieces come apart and don&#x27;t know how to reattach to keep together</li>
      <li>This is an adorable hostess gift for any MahJongg player.</li>
      <li>Soaps are cute, but the coloring in the design is a bit smeared on some of them.  </li>
      <li>Really cute idea for mah jongg players.</li>
      <li>Soaps have great color, which, I guess,  is all that is really needed, as no one would dare use something so unique!</li>
      <li>Nothing really special.</li>
      <li>Soaps are exactly as described, arrived in a timely manner, and enjoy a permanent place in the guest bathroom.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t nice enough as a presentation.</li>
      <li>However, this was bought for a gift for someone who is a Mah Jongg player who may appreciate it very much.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll certainly serve its purpose--a going away gift for an avid Mah Jongg player.</li>
      <li>Just a nice little gift to say thank you to a friend who loves Mah Jongg as much as I do.</li>
      <li>The soaps are cute little chunks, but the packaging is like something from the dollar store.</li>
      <li>Somewhat disappointed in the packaging as it was not as impressive as advertised.</li>
      <li>Bought as a gift for a new mah jongg fanatic, who was extremely pleased.  </li>
      <li>I bought these as a present for a friend who is really into mah jongg, and she loves them.  </li>
      <li>Gave it as a Christmas present to a friend that plays the game, she was very pleased.</li>
      <li>They are a really cute idea for the guest bath when one is hosting the game.</li>
      <li>Adds a little clean fun to game day.</li>

<li> Hardly noticeable, though.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, there was a problem with delivery and product was received late.</li>
<li> A bit expensive to get one box for each.</li>

    <li> These were great to give to my friends who play Mah Jongg.</li>
    <li> The soaps were smaller than I was expecting/hoping for.  They are cute and smell good, though.  I gave 1 soap to each of my 3 Mah Jongg friends.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a present for a friend who is really into mah jongg, and she loves them.  They are a really cute idea for the guest bath when one is hosting the game.</li>

    <li> Cute!  Gave two each to my mahjong buddies.  A bit expensive to get one box for each.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!  I gave these to my sister - Master Maj Jongg Diva - as a Christmas gift - she was thrilled!  Soaps have great color, which, I guess,  is all that is really needed, as no one would dare use something so unique!</li>
    <li> You can break this set up - each soap is individually wrapped!  I gave them as small gifts to my MahJongg group.  Worked otu wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Giving them to my Mah Jongg ladies.  Can&#x27;t wait to see their reactions.</li>
    <li> Our Mah Jongg group is thrilled with these soaps, which will be used as a gift to our Mah Jongg teacher!  Great quality.</li>
    <li> Soaps are cute, but the coloring in the design is a bit smeared on some of them.  Hardly noticeable, though.  It&#x27;ll certainly serve its purpose--a going away gift for an avid Mah Jongg player.</li>
    <li> This was an okay gift for my mahjong playing friend. A little pricy. Nothing really special. The symbols were kind of blurred on the soap. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product looks just as advertised - just like Mah Jongg tiles, even in size.  This was a gift for someone else, so I do not know how the soap is, but it made a great presentation and the person receiving the gift was very pleased. Unfortunately, there was a problem with delivery and product was received late.</li>
    <li> They are pretty to look at, but are very messy soaps. The green lining melts all over the soap dish.</li>
    <li> These were gifts for a Mah Jongg card opening party.  They arrived early and were perfect.  They made a very nice gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a mah jongg buddy and noticed it in a lovely dish in her guest bathroom.  They are so pretty and wonderful for the right person.</li>
    <li> The soaps are cute little chunks, but the packaging is like something from the dollar store. There is no print or label on it, identifying the maker, the origin, the ingredients- nothing. It just makes me think there is something toxic inside. I bought it to give as a gift, but won&#x27;t now. It isn&#x27;t nice enough as a presentation.</li>
    <li> Great and a hit with fellow players</li>
    <li> Product works well. Would recommend it to others. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Top and bottom pieces come apart and don&#x27;t know how to reattach to keep together</li>
    <li> Gave it as a Christmas present to a friend that plays the game, she was very pleased.</li>
