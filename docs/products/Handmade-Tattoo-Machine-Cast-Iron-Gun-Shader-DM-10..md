      <li>/&gt;Ok, after toying around and some mild research.</li>
      <li>the only thing about this machine is&#x27; the front tube clamp nosse hole has stripped out on all thee machine, but the hardware and coils are pretty good</li>
      <li>This is a great little inexpensive machine.</li>
      <li>Cant beat the price worth every penny.</li>
      <li>fun times</li>
      <li>,I parted two out and got some nice parts to put on other machines I liked better, so I didn&#x27;t loose no money in the long haul,  because a set of coils cost more than the machine.</li>

      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>And since the shipping takes forever I didnt feel like goin through the hassle of sending it back and waiting another month or more.</li>

      <li>Use a higher UF rated capacitor.</li>
      <li>The only con that it has to be on a precise voltage or it will jump and bog other then that good deal for the price</li>

      <li>thats black and looks like some kind of scaley creature skin texture.</li>
      <li>Runs strong at low volts.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Cap sizes , 10 Uf STAY Away from these... 22 Uf 23 UF Fast cycle.  </li>
      <li>this is a very confortable and ease to use item its state of de art work</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it straight out of the box.</li>
      <li>This whole machine was $5.95.</li>
      <li>buy this machine it runs smooth as butter and is solid.</li>
      <li>Cap sizes , 10 Uf STAY Away from these... 22 Uf 23 UF Fast cycle.  </li>
      <li>this machine has delivered several nice tattoos as long as it stays tuned.</li>
      <li>Also needed alot of tuning to get it running decent.</li>
      <li>For any beginners that are having any trouble with your machine spittinng sputtering or don&#x27;t sound right.</li>
      <li>I let the machine run for about 3-5 minutes straight, the spark died down to a considerably smaller size, almost unnoticeable; But to be honest</li>
      <li>Rare for a Chinese Tattoo Machine.</li>
      <li>aka; needs a new capacitor.</li>
      <li>but like I said the tube clamp hole or the t screws are to soft metal all three of mine stripped out and I didn&#x27;t put hardly no pressure on them</li>
      <li>I have the machine up and running, but the vise is so tight that none of my metal tubes will fit.</li>
      <li>I got this machine and i am blown away at the overall nice quality and performance for such little money!</li>
      <li>The plastic disposable tips fit only if the vise screw is completely removed, and the plastic shaved down.</li>
      <li>it was actually polished before the clear coat.</li>
      <li>The tube clamp stripped out not long after I got it.</li>
      <li>Either a stiffer Gauge rear spring say a 20 gauge instead of a 18 gauge,  &amp; or a wider rear spring &amp; or replace the round washer holding rear spring down with a saddle washer or you can cut a coin to fit.</li>

<ol>
    <li> For any beginners that are having any trouble with your machine spittinng sputtering or don&#x27;t sound right. buy this machine it runs smooth as butter and is solid. its the only chinese machine u will find that will work like a 150 to 200 dollar machine. u won&#x27;t regret it. i love it best machine i own.</li>
    <li> were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends .. the quality is awesome .. thank you very much</li>
    <li> Just got my machine on time and not damaged. This machine is great all around, weight, running volts, and design, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have it set up as a liner and it runs amazing at 9.5 volts(the sweet spot). The A-bar has a beautiful wave motion if you take the time to set it up. I wouldn&#x27;t use it straight out of the box. I had to bend the rear spring just slightly because when I got it the A-bar was miles away from the coils, so if your new to tattoo machines, really pay attention to little things like that cause you don&#x27;t want to have to run the machine at 16 volts just to get it to make contact. All in all this machine is great.</li>
    <li> This machine came fast, in a box and works as well or even better that it states. I can make clean straight lines and when I do shading it comes out amazing. Very machine for a very good price, So good I had to buy another.</li>
    <li> This is a great little inexpensive machine. Runs strong at low volts. Love the tube vise holds everything nice and snug. The design of the machine is beautiful and has a really great weight to it.</li>
    <li> this is a very confortable and ease to use item its state of de art work it works great love it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this machine to go with some more that I have and because I really liked the look of the frame with the zig zag around the hole and the wooden look design and what not.  Well this product ships from china and took along time to get to my house but as it was shipped from china I understand the time, but the problem is that this company shipped me the totally wrong machine. They sent me another one that they sale thats black and looks like some kind of scaley creature skin texture. And since the shipping takes forever I didnt feel like goin through the hassle of sending it back and waiting another month or more.Will not do business with this company again. If you plan on purchasing this be prepared to recieve something other than what you ordered. BUYERS BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> Shipment came in a timely manner. For only $20 this is an excellent shader. Planning on buying a liner from this company. Cant beat the price worth every penny.</li>
    <li> the finish come off the other one and I have not use the third one, but the coils are nice so far ,I parted two out and got some nice parts to put on other machines I liked better, so I didn&#x27;t loose no money in the long haul,  because a set of coils cost more than the machine. the only thing about this machine is&#x27; the front tube clamp nosse hole has stripped out on all thee machine, but the hardware and coils are pretty good and you might like the two piece frame, but like I said the tube clamp hole or the t screws are to soft metal all three of mine stripped out and I didn&#x27;t put hardly no pressure on them oh well thats what experience I had with these so called hand crafted machine from china</li>
    <li> Great Price If you Can Re-Build the Tattoo Machine. The Frame is Cast Iron &amp; is finished nice it was actually polished before the clear coat. Rare for a Chinese Tattoo Machine. Nice hardware. However as with all Chinese Machines the Springs are trash. &amp; as with Most Chinese Machines the Coils &amp; Capacitor are junk. I just always buy a frame I like.  Knowing I will replace the rest. This whole machine was $5.95. That is CHEAP !  So The hardware is good. That&#x27;s great. Now The Front &amp; Rear Springs. $1.00 to $ 2.50 each, The Coils $25.00 the capacitor is $1.00 &amp; if you want to customize it. The Armature Bar is $2.00 - $7.00. So $6.00 For Machine + $25 for Coils they can come with a cap or you can solder one on your self. + Cap $1.00 + Armature Bar $5.00 + Springs $4.00 &#x3D; $41.00 You Just Built a Custom Tattoo Machine..  That is  over 90% Off Retail for a good machine. $250.00 to $1,200&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Machine Tailored to the way you Tattoo. Not how some Guru Thinks you should tattoo.

    <li> Love it!!! Thanks it sounds great right out of the box, recommend it to anybody that needs a good machine, wish the detail outside wasn&#x27;t al crooked. But still great for the price.</li>
    <li> this machine does heat up but it finally heated up after 2hrs doesn&#x27;t hit hard like a jack hammer but the coil screws do get loose so you gotta watch out for that over all good for beginners</li>
    <li> Thinking it wouldnt go the distance but it fooled me 12 hour tattoo not a PROBLEM the thing shrads great buy!!!</li>
    <li> It is very nice.. Had some issues... Now just gotta tweak it.. Would like manual with it as possible on tweaking</li>
    <li> I love this machine. Its runs great! I can use it as a liner or shader. Very smooth either way.</li>
    <li> Love the grip and feel of this gun, was completely shocked with results. Highly recommended, this is an amazing shader.</li>
    <li> possible fluke, but mine has a blue spark from spring to contact bar. aka; needs a new capacitor. yeah! fun times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, after toying around and some mild research. I let the machine run for about 3-5 minutes straight, the spark died down to a considerably smaller size, almost unnoticeable; But to be honest I don&#x27;t think there should be a spark AT ALL. I Will keep posting updates on the performance of this machine, I apologize in advance if I jump to conclusions.</li>
    <li> The tube clamp stripped out not long after I got it. Also needed alot of tuning to get it running decent. The frame is solid. Coils are turds. All other hardware is pretty good. The tube clamp is just a bad design.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this machine, good weight, great control, low vibration... I would recommend this machine to anyone, novice or not.. I will purchase from this supplier again.. Current setup for outline, going to set it up for shading and try it soon..</li>
    <li> I have the machine up and running, but the vise is so tight that none of my metal tubes will fit. The plastic disposable tips fit only if the vise screw is completely removed, and the plastic shaved down. The angle from the a-bar to the vise hole is also angled poorly, so the needle drags in the tube.</li>
    <li> So i finaly got this machine in! Tested it to make sure it works ! Seems to run strong ! Ill know more soon and will repost my final review! So far seems great!</li>
    <li> Got this as a backup machine and end up using it more often than I thought. For the price it does an excellent job. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I got this machine and i am blown away at the overall nice quality and performance for such little money! I had to buy 2</li>
    <li> this machine has delivered several nice tattoos as long as it stays tuned. I would have another for the price.</li>
    <li> buena compra puntual excelente, honesta, buena calidad, llego a tiempo , buen trato , todo fino, sin ningún inconveniente y gracias</li>
    <li> love these for the price</li>
    <li> Awesome for a beginner tattoo artist one of my machines went out and I needed one the next day and my orginal supplier couldn&#x27;t get me one for two weeks so I ordered this with a hope that it would do well! Well looks good to start with! The weight and balance is on point! The only con that it has to be on a precise voltage or it will jump and bog other then that good deal for the price</li>
