      <li>Outstanding beard oil!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Honest Amish products.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product,my skin feels better and has helped with the hot spots i get in the summer months sweating alot.</li>
      <li>I love Honest Amish beard balms, just not this oil.</li>
      <li>This is the best beard oil I&#x27;ve ever used, I began using it in my hair as well as my beard and both are far healthier softer and more manageable now.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
      <li>Use this more to condition my skin beneath my beard after a shower.</li>
      <li>It does what it says it does and more so.</li>
      <li>Keeps my beard soft and smells great.</li>
      <li>Some people say the smell is strong.</li>
      <li>just as good the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; Honest Amish beard oil, only unscented.  </li>
      <li>If u got a beard of any kind you should be using this, definitely helps keep skin and hair very healthy..</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this beard oil when I first got it</li>
      <li>One of the reviewer stated that this product made his beard smell like he was standing over a fryer all day, and while I got that impression when I first started using it, after a month the smell became more tolerable</li>
      <li>Feels nice and leaves my beard glossy and soft without being greasy.</li>
      <li>meaning that it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb that quickly.  </li>
      <li>in order listed are:  Avocado Oil, Virgin Pumpkin Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil; Apricot Kernel Oil, Golden Jojoba Oil, Virgin Argan Oil, and Kukui Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>This is also good if you put beard oil in your beard right before bed and don&#x27;t want a strong smell bothering your significant other or new born.</li>
      <li>Despite it being a better price than most, it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does smell like cooking oil when I first put it on, but that fades pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I seem to have to use a bit more than the recommended &amp;#34;dose.&amp;#34; I only wish I could have had a way to try the scented beard oil as well.</li>
      <li>I wanted unscented oil but had to add a bit of essential oils to make it smell OK.  </li>
      <li>It keeps this masterpiece as soft as the fur on a baby bunny&#x27;s belly, and tangle free too.</li>
      <li>Leaves your beard soft, manageable, smelling good, and relieves that beard itch and dry skin.</li>
      <li>I bought the pure beard oil due to the feedback on the honest amish scented version that some can&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
      <li>and I really like.</li>
      <li>fast food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the scent of this oil as well.</li>
      <li>After a few uses with the constant removal of the cap the strong smell starts to mellow out to a more lighter sweeter scent.</li>
      <li>I rub it in as soon as I get out of the shower and work it through with a few strokes of a fine comb.</li>
      <li>It smells like old fryer oil.</li>
      <li>The only con is my inability to concentrate due to the constant distracting sound of panties dropping.....</li>
      <li>Half a dropper full worked into this facial extravaganza</li>
      <li>Leaves my beard soft and manageable....will definitely buy again...</li>
      <li>My beard is slightly less bristly so far, and I expect that it will bet even a little softer with several more days use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer for the beard, but it has a little bit of an off or stale smell.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricier than other similar products but it works really well.</li>
      <li>A full 2oz for less than what the other guys charge for 1oz.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this on the daily, I get complimented on my bear on its softness and look. I definitely give this oil some of the credit.  If not all.  My beard has grown spectacular because of this great oil. No scent so it compliments you daily.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard oil I&#x27;ve ever used, I began using it in my hair as well as my beard and both are far healthier softer and more manageable now.</li>
    <li> I bought the pure beard oil due to the feedback on the honest amish scented version that some can&#x27;t stand the smell.  I figured unscented was the way to go and I can always add some fragrance later using essential oils.  I haven&#x27;t tried adding my own fragrance yet, but this beard oil smells like canola or vegetable oil, and yes, I feel like using it makes me smell like I work in fast food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (since as of the time of this review, they aren&#x27;t listed on the product page) in order listed are:  Avocado Oil, Virgin Pumpkin Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil; Apricot Kernel Oil, Golden Jojoba Oil, Virgin Argan Oil, and Kukui Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is not labeled as organic, though the product page for their scented version states that it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it works...  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts yet.  It is &amp;#34;oilier&amp;#34; than I expected, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb that quickly.  My beard is slightly less bristly so far, and I expect that it will bet even a little softer with several more days use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?  No.  Despite it being a better price than most, it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit... I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks and the only change I&#x27;ve noticed in my beard is that it now smells like vegetable oil.  My beard is not softer and this has caused a few pimples as well.</li>
    <li> This is a review that I wrote about their scented version...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;First time ever using any type of beard oil. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than other similar products but it works really well. Leaves your beard soft, manageable, smelling good, and relieves that beard itch and dry skin. They say you can rub the leftover oils that are on your hands, into your skin. I usually just run my hands through my hair a few times and it works just as well as any hair tonic by keeping rouge hairs in place all day. Good stuff. It does what it says it does and more so. Some people say the smell is strong. To me it does smell like Jagermeister but I&#x27;m ok with that. After a few uses with the constant removal of the cap the strong smell starts to mellow out to a more lighter sweeter scent. I see no reason to try any other beard oil at the moment.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is on par and just as good the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; Honest Amish beard oil, only unscented.  If you are going out for the night and don&#x27;t want something clashing with your after shave\cologne, this is where it&#x27;s at.  This is also good if you put beard oil in your beard right before bed and don&#x27;t want a strong smell bothering your significant other or new born.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer of this product. I use it every other day or so, depending on what I have been up to. I get complimented on the softness of my beard quite often. I really like the scent of this oil as well.</li>
    <li> Product is what is advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Honest Amish products. They all work and smell great. A full 2oz for less than what the other guys charge for 1oz. I have a thick tactical beard and it loves this stuff!. Half a dropper full worked into this facial extravaganza is all it takes. I rub it in as soon as I get out of the shower and work it through with a few strokes of a fine comb. It keeps this masterpiece as soft as the fur on a baby bunny&#x27;s belly, and tangle free too. The only con is my inability to concentrate due to the constant distracting sound of panties dropping.....</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the beard, but it has a little bit of an off or stale smell.  I wanted unscented oil but had to add a bit of essential oils to make it smell OK.  I would not get this again.</li>
    <li> Good beard oil. Does not leave your beard feeling oily. I seem to have to use a bit more than the recommended &amp;#34;dose.&amp;#34; I only wish I could have had a way to try the scented beard oil as well.</li>
    <li> I got this oil because I thought this was unscented. It smells like old fryer oil. I love Honest Amish beard balms, just not this oil. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product,my skin feels better and has helped with the hot spots i get in the summer months sweating alot. If u got a beard of any kind you should be using this, definitely helps keep skin and hair very healthy..</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this beard oil when I first got it but after using it for a month I am a believer. I got this with a buy-one-get-one promotion when I purchased the heavy duty beard balm which I&#x27;ve used in the past and I really like. I used to prefer the balms to the oils but this product has changed my views. One of the reviewer stated that this product made his beard smell like he was standing over a fryer all day, and while I got that impression when I first started using it, after a month the smell became more tolerable and I think it is the grape seed oil that is noticeable. My lady thinks my beard smells like hay now, which she likes. I will buy this product in the future but I think I want to try one with a fragrance. Also, not only does a little go a long way but you get 2oz which is going to last.</li>
    <li> Item just as discribed. Use sparingly. Use this more to condition my skin beneath my beard after a shower.</li>
    <li> Was always impressed by the Honest Amish leave in coditioner so i figured I would give the beard oil a try....not disappointed....  Leaves my beard soft and manageable....will definitely buy again...</li>
    <li> Feels nice and leaves my beard glossy and soft without being greasy. Does smell like cooking oil when I first put it on, but that fades pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Outstanding beard oil! It is the best product I have ever used on my beard!</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my beard soft and smells great.</li>
