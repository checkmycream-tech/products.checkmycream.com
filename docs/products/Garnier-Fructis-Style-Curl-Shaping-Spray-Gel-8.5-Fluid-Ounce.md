      <li>Great price for a big bottle.</li>
      <li>I bought this since they were out of their Wonder Wave product (which is far superior, in my opinion).</li>
      <li>Generally I really like Garnier products and use their hair color and love their conditioner, but Bumble and Bumble works better for my hair.</li>
      <li>i love it so much!</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very curly:)  </li>
      <li>It does, BUT because it is a gel, you have to pump it a good minute before it comes up the tiny tube inside the bottle, to the sprayer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great addition to my soft feel curl creme. Between the two I get nice definition and hold on my very fine curls.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy this product because of the good reviews, but then I saw some saying about test on animals. Doing my research at the PETA website I could find that they really do it, since Garnier is owned by L&#x27;Oreal. Not buying any product with the Garnier name on it.</li>
    <li> I give this product 3 stars because as a man, I don&#x27;t think it has quite enough hold, however for women who don&#x27;t want their hair as hard as a rock, I think this will work for them.</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily. It helps make my permed curls more definitive and does not feel sticky or tacky.  Light weight on my curls for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Thank you Garnier  for this product! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been styling my hair on rollers since I was a teenager back to the days of Breckset and Dippity Do. Since those days 40 or so years ago I have tried dozens of setting/styling gels and this one is by far the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a gel but sprays like a liquid from the plastic pump bottle. It has a scent that is clean and fresh and as advertised, holds my curly style incredibly well with zero flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid less than $5.00 retail for the first one and  after trying it went out and bought two more!</li>
    <li> (read on for the edit)..Keep looking. Tresseme has a new spray gel (all stores don&#x27;t seem to have it yet), and it&#x27;s alcohol-free.&lt;br /&gt;The Garnier \\&quot;curl shaping spray gel\\&quot; seems to work at first, but later the hair is gross. It&#x27;s crispy when it dries and when you touch it to \\&quot;soften\\&quot; the curls, it only feels sticky and you can feel the product on the hair. It feels terrible and the only relief is to shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;The Tresseme spray gel is alcohol free, doesn&#x27;t dry the hair or leave a crispy or sticky touch and it styles the hair but leaves it soft and bouncy. The Tresseme is MUCH better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY... glad I can edit this. To be fair and honest, I added water to my bottle and it isn&#x27;t as thick. I&#x27;ve actually been using this. Not sure I&#x27;ll purchase again, but it&#x27;s useable. If you cut it with a styling cream of your choice, it&#x27;ll work better and won&#x27;t be sticky. As it is, it doesn&#x27;t work, but you can make it work. Actually a cream recommendation is \\&quot;CurlMax\\&quot; Curl \\&quot;activator\\&quot; which you&#x27;ll find in the ethnic section if you really search. (Use a TINY bit.) I also will mix with a good curl-moisturizing mousse. I&#x27;ll probably be playing with products as long as I let my hair go with its curls. (I&#x27;m Italian. Thick hair that wants to curl whether I agree to go there or not :) Just add moisture and see so. :)  The latest craze of straightening with those nasty hair irons made me realize I don&#x27;t want to go there with the crowd.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great all u have to do is put it on let it dry and curl it😍😊</li>
    <li> This gel gives my curly hair a sticky feel and it feels sticky on my hands.  Just weights my curls down rather than giving them shape.  Not a good hair product for me.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. The product is very thick and tends to weigh my hair down. It was not expensive so not a big loss. I will not order it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair but I do have a lot of unruly body.  I dampen my hair, spray this on segments and twist or twirl with my fingers and Voila! bouncy curls that last all day.  I&#x27;ve also sprayed and scrunched, that works ok and is much faster, but a much more casual less polished look.  It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t feel overly stiff like hairsprays.    Love love love this stuff! I just can&#x27;t even believe how well it works.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly lightweight spray, but the bottle literally sprays and doesn&#x27;t mist, which would be much more helpful.  Generally I really like Garnier products and use their hair color and love their conditioner, but Bumble and Bumble works better for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it right after getting out of the shower, but instead to purk up curls after my hair is dry. It works great! I use suave professionals mousse on my wet hair then this product as needed throughout the day. I don&#x27;t think spray gel would work on wet curly hair. Atleast not mine anyway....</li>
    <li> * Garnier Fructis (GF) Style Curl Shaping Spray Gel, 8.50-Fluid Ounce Review:  * This curl spray worked well for me, I used it with the GF curl construct mousse  * Highly recommend it!  * TIGI Foxy Curls also worked for me, but is a little stickier, so you have to use a small amount (1 pump spray amount only for med-thick, shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> It really really works, I just spray and scrunch before running out the door and voila--nice beach waves! This works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, namely the bumble and bumble beach waves salt spray...and this is priced much better.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the brand, and it does shape, but dries too hard for my taste.</li>
    <li> This is the first styling gel that works for my son.  His hair is fine and floppy with no shine or body.  This stuff gives his hair body, shine, and control without weighing it down or making it look dirty.  Affordable, too.  My only complaint is the scent is a little too strong, but considering the absolute delight I have at finally finding a styling gel that works, I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star rating just the same.</li>
    <li> I have hair that can be straight, wavy, or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want it CURLY (not frizzy), I turn to this every time.  Spray it on wet hair, gently blow dry... and watch the curls come alive.</li>
    <li> I love this product and now that it is something I can subscribe and save to, I&#x27;m saving money and getting a great product. A win-win!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy, thick frizzy hair &amp; this product did TERRIBLE! It was so frizzy &amp; tangled my hair!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It has great value and works great. i recommend this to everyone who wants to have curly hair :)</li>
    <li> the sprayer doesn&#x27;t due it&#x27;s job-at all, had to unscrew the top every single time. I bought this since they were out of their Wonder Wave product (which is far superior, in my opinion). This works ok, I suppose,as any other gel would do, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again;and if I had the receipt I would return it. I have very thick, med/long wavy hair.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific! I have very thick blonde hair that is curly on the bottom and wavy on the top, and this product sculpted perfect spiral curls on top and bottom! It is extremely hard for me to find a good product that works well with my hair, and this one did the trick! The price is awesome because it cost me a fraction of what i was paying before on salon brand products. I liked it so much, i bought two- one for my locker at school and one for home! its great for touch-ups during the day and its very light and doesnt look or feel like you are wearing a ton of product! i love it so much! i would definately recomend it to any curly or wavy haired women and girls out there who are looking for a fabulous new product!</li>
    <li> I ordered them twice. Excellent feel. Gives hair a wet look and doesnt make them hard or stiff. Keeps hair soft. The hold isnt strong.</li>
    <li> I feel neutral about this product. When I first applied it and let my hair dry, my hair felt crunchy and some areas looked like it was still wet. So I brushed it out. I really like the way it made my hair look - my hair is naturally curly, but when I brushed it out my hair had big waves/curls. Even though I thought my hair looked great, there was a ridiculous residue left on the brush. My brand-new hairbrush went from black to white and crusty in 30 seconds flat. It was gross! I didn&#x27;t even put a large amount of this stuff in my hair. I like the look that I achieve with this product, but I&#x27;m still not sure about it. It just seems like it has too many cons.</li>
    <li> Would never use any other styling product for my curly hair.  Really helps define and hold curls all day long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of years.. I have thick, curly shoulder length hair, and after washing,  I squirt a couple of squirts into the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and apply it to my hair that way.. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the spray.. I discovered after using it for awhile, that the spray can over shoot and hit the wall or the door in my bathroom, but spraying it into my hand has solved that problem.. It helps define the curls in my hair and controlls frizziness.. I straighten my bangs with a round brush and hair dryer, and this actually helps keep them from curling up... I also occasionally straighten my hair with a flat iron, and it helps to keep my hair shiny and from having flyaways...</li>
    <li> My wife prefers the gel over the aerosol to avoid getting it all over everything and this is her favorite kind.  She has curly hair and this gives just enough hold/control without weighing the hair down.</li>
    <li> Like everything Garnier does, this gel is amazing. It gives my curls definition, and eliminates frizz. I use it with damp hair, and let it dry naturally for bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that holds my wavy hair without a crunchy feel.  Plus, it&#x27;s a great price.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I thought it would hold my thick hair/curles in place but it didn&#x27;t do the job that I thought it would so I had to purchase a different formula. Would probably work better for someone with thin hair.</li>
    <li> This product does just what it says, I have very fine hair, a lot of it, but very fine. This gives it a nice curl when set with rollers or without. They even last all day, which was never possible before.</li>
    <li> This curls hair fast and easy. Great price for a big bottle. I love this you can use your fingers or snail curls on youtube. I would buy a lot more.</li>
    <li> This stuff adds some little curls in the edges of my undercut hairstyle, and ladies love it! Pretty strong hold too; it won&#x27;t hold up to 20+ mph winds (I live in a windy place), but it keeps the shape in anything below that for males - not so sure about long hair...</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I recommend</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife. She has very curly hair and did not like how this product felt after it dried. She would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have thick naturally curly hair that tends to frizz up after a few hours. This really does the trick and it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Use a little when the perm is new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use double the amount when the perm is about dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS for my curly hair.  I&#x27;ve tried mousse, other gels and sprays and this is the one that I always come back to.  Helps keep the friz in check, dries soft, and works well air dried or diffused.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, I don&#x27;t think it defines curls all that well though, in fact, gells tend to weigh your curls down. It&#x27;s a good product when used very lightly. I&#x27;m just not sure there are any benefits as far as your curls go. It does help with frizz.</li>
    <li> Aside from hairspray this is the only product I use in my hair. I have naturally curly, often frizzy hair. I just spray this in after towel drying my hair, brush and I am done. This has been a must have product for me for at least 6 years now.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My friend used it on my hair and I loved it, so I had to buy it. I have straight hair and I usually sprayed my hair with this product and then put rollers over night. The hair is curly for 2-3 days (not greasy and to my surprise I dont have a oily hair!! And thats miracle for me because I usually wash my hair every day)... Maybe its greasy when you put it on but it absorbs... And you can wash your hands :))) i will use it for rest of my life</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, I followed the directions directly as written: spray generously on damp hair, create ringlets, and blow dry.  I was left with sporadic, sad looking curls that died a slow, painful death throughout the day and the unpleasant feeling of tons of gunk in my hair.  Disappointed, I washed it out and went to bed already planning on flat-ironing my hair once more.  To my amazement, I awoke the next day with the tight, bouncing ringlets I had hoped for.  They stayed for two more washes and never had that \\&quot;hairspray\\&quot; texture.  I would suggest anyone looking to use this product, try spraying your hair first, then shampooing to get max curls.</li>
    <li> Like this product, not always easy to find locally..doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff but gives a nice natural shine too and you can use it the next days to freshen up your style with a light re-spray or even with a fine mist of water.  I have fine texture, short wavy hair and it does give me enough body.  I use a lot of Garnier products and I like them all.  Never dissapointed.  Here&#x27;s a tip and I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know this.  KEEP YOUR REGISTER RECEIPTS until you have used cosmetic or hair products a couple of times.. I pin mine on my bulletin board so they are easy to locate.  Every store will take the product back if you don&#x27;t like it or have a bad reaction to it..for instance..when you pay $12 for a lipstick and it doesn&#x27;t look the same way on your mouth that it does in the tube then why should you be out that amount of money ??  Be a good consumer</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has close to African-American curls and it makes his hair shine and really helps control frizz!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and love it. My hair is fairly long and I don&#x27;t like hair spray</li>
    <li> This is a gloppy mess that could never be sprayed on. The entire concept is flawed. If it were in a jar like the old Dippty Do it might work. But in my humble opinion it is not even as good as Dippty Do and far more expensive. It also created stiff curls that had the texture of concrete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer noted that she shampooed and the texture became soft and the shine came back to her curls. This also happened to me. But I don&#x27;t have that much time to mess with my hair. I have short wavy hair with a coarse texture that one hair cutter called &amp;#34;iron nails&amp;#34;. It curls nicely with the right product and a quick flip with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my Swarztkopf Got 2 Be Kinkier Curling Mousse. I have tried the Garnier Curling Mousse and the texture is softer with that compared to this product, but the curl power doesn&#x27;t compare to the Kinkier Curling Mousse. I also got some Swarztkopf Got 2 Be InPlay Sculpting Paste which is a superior lightweight tousling pomade which brings up my wave and flips my short hair very well. I will also try some of the other products suggested here, especially if they aren&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I really liked this gel! I could spray my hair before French braiding (to create curls) and I could also spray my hair once I took the braids out to scrunch it. As long as it wasn&#x27;t overused, my hair was never stiff or sticky, and the product smelled good. I would&#x27;ve liked the hold to be a little stronger (my hair is very heavy and thick) but other than that, I loved this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it gives me the perfect amount of curl!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this gel is perfect for holding them together without that &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; look.  I put it on my towel dried hair, scrunch and then let it air dry.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my hair when i curl it, as well as for my sister&#x27;s curly hair. She really loves it. It gives her nice, defined curls instead of the matted, wavy mess she&#x27;s used to.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are not accurately listed. This is what is actually in the bottle: aqua/water/eau, PVP, propylene glycol, phenoxyethanol, polycrylate-3, triethanolamine, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, methylparaben, parfum/fragrance, peg-70 mango glycerides, butyrospermum parkii butter/shea butter, limonene, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, amyl cinnamal.</li>
    <li> The product is fine. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I love this for the crunch curly look.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this spray for my naturally curly hair and after using my fructis shampoo and conditioner i sprayed this in my damp hair and it was so stiff and crunchy after it dried i could not even comb through it. It states how it is not suppose to do this but it did and i am not happy at all with it. I will never use this ever again.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles &amp; they both look like someone used them before placing them into the box.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> This is a sad product that had been tested extensively on animals. I do not recommend. There is beauty in compassion. I will heartily recommend another product- PureShine Spray it Curly- Works great! I have wavy thin (and fine) hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out. It looked pretty scraggly- and the longer it gets, pulls itself down to drab thin-ness- so I have to be careful to get products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This product I&#x27;m mentioning the pureshine adds body, fullness and helps the curl be curly. Decent ingredients- no animals tortured to make it. I&#x27;m really glad I found it, with this problem hair. Please look for it. I found it at my local drugstore. Pure Shine</li>
    <li> I like using garnier products cause they always make my hair look great. This spray gel is perfect for my curls.</li>
    <li> Perfect for buns. Doesn&#x27;t leave nasty film behind. Nor does it flake when it deteriorates.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair, gives nice shape to my curls, prevents poof.  I use it with the Suave curly hair foam/lotion.  Does tend to clog but I wash off the nozzle after each use to prevent this from happening.  You can soak in hot water if it hardens and it will come off, biggest problem with this product is the nozzle, but worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Was very hopeful this would finally help me have curls. I have curly hair underneath and STRAIGHT hair on top. Its a no win. Have to straighten all or curl all. One way or the other, I spend a good deal of time on styling my hair daily. Sadly, it just didn&#x27;t hold up. It looked ok and was about half way dry when I went to sleep. Figured sleeping with it semi wet could only help it as thats when my hair gets scrunched up and is curlier in the am. Nope. ALL of it looked very meh..slightly curly. Even the parts that should be curly. Oh well. Worth a shot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product! It leaves the hair a bit hard. But I still like it, it defines my curls, :)</li>
    <li> This makes my hair evenly curly.  i really like it!  It helps take away the frizz abit too.  It also makes my hair feel softer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second day using this stuff, and so far, so good! I bought it to use as a product for second and third-day curls, meaning to spruce my hair up after I&#x27;ve slept on it, and for days I don&#x27;t shampoo.  I spray a little water on my hair, scrunch, then spray this on flat sections of my hair, scrunch again, and voila! Bouncy curls, good as new. A great time-saver.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good...I have bought it and reviewed it a few times. It works well for scrunching and holding all day.</li>
    <li> Excelent. I get curls without frizz :D</li>
    <li> While this product is very gentle to your hair, the hold is a little stiffer than I like.  It makes nice curls, but they are fairly rigid.</li>
    <li> This gave my curls awesome definition without the normal crunch of spray gels. Make sure you use this lightly too much and your hair will end up a mess.</li>
    <li> I have this wavy/curly hair that is impossible to manage. It goes frizzy, it goes puffy, it goes everywhere and I spent ages (and way more money than I like to think about) trying products that either left my hair crunchy or fell flat halfway through my busy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I found this spray gel. It has wax in it so it holds my hair nice and firmly without being crunchy. It defines my waves so instead of one huge lump of puff I have a cool beachy look that lasts all day. I spray this on when my hair is just about dry from the shower and then scrunch. No special brushes or diffusers, just five minutes and perfect results! I&#x27;ve been really happy and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this product for as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a big box store.  The price on Amazon is very good.  This product is super crunchy.  If you are not careful you could glue your bangs to your forehead.  I tried to use this several times and ended up dumping it down the sink.  I do not recommend it for curly girls.</li>
    <li> Helps keep my hair in place. I wear my hair up an it works great. Not sticky an no white flakes. The spray helps give me a slight wave when I crunch my hair. My 16 yr old granddaughter likes it too. It makes j&lt;br /&gt;Her hair have a slight wave  She loves it.</li>
    <li> This particular product is very thick, sticky, does not work well or smell very good. HOWEVER, Fructis Wonder Waves (Wave Enhancing SPRAY) is amazing and a great product to use on either wet or dry hair. I have naturally curly medium to long hair and it works fantaistic on my freshly washed wet hair but the great thing is that even if you brush out your curls to wear it straight during the day and want curl/body for the evening but don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair, just spray this product on your dry straight hair, scrunch hair slightly while fluffing lightly with a hairdryer on low and it will curl and give your hair extra body, plus unlike the unpleasant smell of the gel, the smell on the Wonder Waves spray is delicious. I often use a light spray of it just to give my hair a fresh, clean scent throughout the day. It is a great product and I highly recommend it. I hope this helps those of you who read my review; if you are like me you spend far too much time and money looking for just the right hair care product. This is definitely worth both time and money.</li>
    <li> This product works but at the cost of some soft texture. Luckily I have naturally curly hair so I can pass with a few sprays for extra hold in my curls (live a very active lifestyle). If you are not careful you can end up with hard crunchy hair so try to spray the bare minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the few things I have tried it works great compared to kinky curl spray and it works better than tresemme (that was too sticky and hard), bounce and shiny curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I will just spray this in for the weight to cut frizzy and it has a nice shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try another brand just incase because working near hba I know frictions style products switch every now and than at wal mart.</li>
    <li> Made my hair hard, less volume.</li>
    <li> First of all, it was delivered in un-working condition.  The spray part of the product would not work at all. I had to screw off the lid and glob it into my hand to use it. I have now gone through the entire bottle (I don&#x27;t like to waste money) and my experience is that what it did cover got hard and crunchy yet also left certain spots still frizzy.  I am willing to admit that perhaps it&#x27;s because the product was globbed like a normal gel as opposed to being sprayed on as it was supposed to be and so perhaps my experience was just doomed to begin with and the product might not be too bad. Either way though, I will not bother trying it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Light and easy to apply.  And they no longer sell it in my local supermarket or drug store.</li>
    <li> My hair has natural wave/curl to it, but sometimes it needs a little boost to make sure ALL the pieces are wavy. After showering, I spray this onto my semi wet hair and scrunch, then go! I can&#x27;t blow dry or diffuse my hair because it makes it frizzy so I&#x27;m not sure how the product reacts that way. But it works great for air drying!</li>
    <li> I probably should have read the directions before I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, dense, wavy hair that is past my shoulders. With some help, it is more curly. I&#x27;ve used spray gels before. Spray, scrunch, let dry. That didn&#x27;t work with this one. I ended up with less wave than if I had used nothing (although it wasn&#x27;t frizzy, so I guess there&#x27;s that).&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to spray on damp hair. No problem. Then &amp;#34;twist hair around fingers to create ringlets.&amp;#34; What? Are you kidding? It would take me half the day to do my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this would work for someone with not as much hair.</li>
    <li> I live in a country where most people have straight hair, and there are very, very few products that work with naturally curly/wavy hair, and still fewer that actually work! I was so excited to be able to order this on Amazon, and will continue to do so when I deplete my current supply... Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, and I&#x27;ve only used it once. I&#x27;d recommend definitely following the directions and making sure that your hair is just damp, a drier damp, and not too damp. Mine was too damp but it still worked. I also used a lot and found that it does not make your hair hard after it dries. It&#x27;s very curly:)  but it kinda does make your hands a little sticky if you touch your hair throughout the day. But other than that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, straight hair. It is also very fine, but I have A LOT of it. I purchased this from my local Walmart because I wanted to add wave to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my hair, sprayed this on, twisted it with my fingers and air dried it. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain that the pump doesn&#x27;t work. It does, BUT because it is a gel, you have to pump it a good minute before it comes up the tiny tube inside the bottle, to the sprayer. I had to do this to mine. In the store I tried all of them and none worked, until it occurred to me that it is a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... great stuff. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this to assist with my curls as well as like a hairspray. I love it either way.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly/wavy waist length hair. This product keeps it under control.  I like the way my hair smells :-)</li>
    <li> Love this product I recomend it  more than actual Gel..</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Was bothered about the overspray in the floor making it dirty.  Now just leave bottle in the shower.  Step out, Dry hair, step back in, and apply.</li>
    <li> Use this every day; it helps hold the curl in my hair beautifully</li>
    <li> I used it when I had curls and I did the directions to make curls from this product and it didn&#x27;t work. Now it might just be my hair type but it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Keeps my curl locks in shape&amp; frizz free! I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair also...works great!!! Love, love it!</li>
