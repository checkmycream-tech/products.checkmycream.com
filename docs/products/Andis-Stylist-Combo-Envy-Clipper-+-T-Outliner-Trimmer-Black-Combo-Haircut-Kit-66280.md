<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. Does the job great for my hair and my sons hair. Only thing one of the guards broke from the plastic being weak.</li>
    <li> Great choice for home use.</li>
    <li> WHEN CUTTING HAIR THE TOOLS YOU USE ARE IMPORTAN. ANDIS CUTS VERY WELL IS EASY TO CLEAN, TAKES A WHILE TO GET WARM AND LEFT ME SATISFIED. I LOVE THE OUTLINER AS WELL. IT ERASES ALL HAIR IT TOUCHES WITH ONE SWIPE.</li>
    <li> great clippers especially the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Was a Gift never actually used machine but was told they loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great reliable clippers</li>
    <li> I could not be any happier with these. I&#x27;ve had them for 3 months, I use them atleast 2x&#x27;s a week, and they&#x27;re are Great!!</li>
    <li> IF U R going into becoming a hairdresser or Barbara this is a great deal great price made very well and yes my daughter BABYFAYE is a barber and this started her off, SHE IS IN HER 2 YEAR N THEY STILL WORK AS THE FIRST DAY SANTA PUT THEM UNDER THE TREE N SHE OPENED THEM.. S.I.N.Y.LADYRIDER</li>
    <li> I always wanted to get me my very own haircut set &amp; with this set i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Professional quality.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> love the weight of the trimmer and the power. The clipper are a little loud but workable very good set</li>
    <li> 2 of theT-Outliner Gaurd teeth broke off after first use.  Returned the next Day</li>
    <li> These clippers are nice but may be a little noisy for me. I have tried making the proper adjustments but still makes more sound than what I like. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they do work terrific. If noise is a factor to you, you might not like these clippers is all I&#x27;m saying.</li>
    <li> Giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because I waited a while to write this review.  It&#x27;s been months, maybe years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T-Outliners are a great trimmer.  The Envy Clipper is decent, but nothing special, and definitely not professional quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too pleased with my order - the box was already opened when arrived!  Pieces of hair were already on the clippers!  How can a pair of &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; clippers already have hair on them?  Let that process in your mind...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products were obviously used prior to shipping to me.  Not a fan of this shipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of this s****y service.  That is all...</li>
    <li> Best Andis I had yet. Have had a lot of andis&#x27;s clipper and trimmer set&#x27;s but they never lasted more than a year.</li>
    <li> works fine just thought maybe the outliner would of been sharper but it cut fine. Great buy would recommend it</li>
    <li> I had been purchasing cheaper ($30-$40) trimmer models for the past 10 years and only got 1-2 years out of each model. Most of the time, the cord would break at the base. These trimmers are much better quality that you can just feel. The T-Outliner gets so much closer than simply using the large clipper with no attachments. Highly recommend you spend a little extra and buy these.</li>
    <li> Love this product...I save a lot of money cutting my own hair now that I have this.  looks just like came from the barber shop.  you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I recently had to replace my Andis trimmer and was pleased to find this combo on Amazon. This Andis combo was not as expensive as the Andis at my local beauty supplier and works even better than the one I replaced. It&#x27;s like getting two for the price of one.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the clippers and accessories, and they work great.</li>
    <li> I have always used andis brand products and they never fail to please. I am not a professional, I just always try to by the best made products so me and my family can enjoy years of use oppose to dealing with the hassle of having to replace an inferior product every year or so.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as a gift. He loves it. It works amazingly!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He loves them and so does my sons. My sons now don&#x27;t mind daddy cutting their hair.</li>
    <li> Most other clippers you might want to tinker with, but these clippers you can tell were built for specific uses.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> I really love these clippers they do a very good job. the trimmer work just like magic I would recommend these to anyone I love them.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers. Sometimes is not the clippers that are lacking, but rather the barber. The clippers will cut as good as you cut.</li>
    <li> The T edgers cuts real good, but I had a problem with the switch on the adjustables clippers. Couldn&#x27;t get them to stay on. Sending them back.</li>
    <li> The Andis Envy Clipper does fit nicely in the hand but it does not cut as smooth as I had hoped.  The sliver lining of this combo is the T-Outliner.  EXCELLENT Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good purchase for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Trimming</li>
    <li> As soon as I got them I was disappointed that the Envy was very loud. I threatened to take it back and a barber I work with played with it for a while and was able to tone it down a bit so I decided to keep it. I have to watch how much pressure I use with the T-outliner because I have noticed little tiny nicks on customers (they never felt) but all the same, I always have to watch the corners while going around the ears of my clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KT, from NC</li>
    <li> The envy clippers will cut threw thick n wet or dry hair n the t-outliners are pro grade clean cut edger&#x27;s the envys are not good for fade and come with very cheap gaurds but its always best to buy better gaurds anyway I recommend this set for basic haircuts.</li>
    <li> Love this combo and it&#x27;s the real deal and definitely as advertised. I was looking for power and close cutting Blades and this Combo is exactly that. I purchased another Combo from the Andis family and was disappointed but this one put a smile on my face along with a crisp lining on my Beard.....</li>
    <li> great combo pack. adjustable clippers work great. powerful, precision cut. the trimmers work very good but not as crisp as higher quality t-blades when doing hairlines. still can&#x27;t beat the deal and would purchase again. only problem is the set doesn&#x27;t come with a clipper brush to clean your blades out afterwards which isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the Andis reputation for quality and durability, however, surprisingly, the teeth in the clippers have already begun breaking, without cause. I&#x27;m looking into the manufacturer warranty for replacement now.</li>
    <li> Received and found all parts and product in gr8 condition.  I have used it and it is as expected. Love it!</li>
    <li> used them only once and they cut perfect&lt;br /&gt;they do not heat up at all. the contour of&lt;br /&gt;the handle makes it easy to hold. well worth&lt;br /&gt;the price</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a hair clipper set. I&#x27;ve enjoyed my clippers.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last more than two weeks clipper button out of order only trimmer working.</li>
    <li> I was online shopping for a good quality clipper for a while.  I went to a salon supply warehouse and I saw the quality of the Andis clippers, the price was around $200.00.  I allways check on Amazon to get the best deal and yes I found it for half the price.  The quality of the clippers is excellent, I love the cuting precision, no overheating like those cheap ones.  I would recommend this clippers to any do it yourself guy or to a professional barber.</li>
    <li> the t liner sucks and the other does as  well. terrible product i have been extremly dissapointed by this cra</li>
    <li> Set a Clippers work like they should and I love them!</li>
    <li> I cut my sons hair trim myself and do some of my friends kids hair. I also volunteer my time donating hair cuts to youth.</li>
    <li> Bought this set to start cutting what&#x27;s left of my own hair.  As anyone with male pattern baldness knows, over the years, you get less hair to cut, but more &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; to wash.  Unfortunately, where my hair does still grow, it grows like a WEED.  I start getting the Dilbert pointy haired boss look after a couple of weeks, and just got tired of paying 15 bucks to get my hair buzzed.  SO, I did some research and settled on this combo.  GREAT price from Amazon, as each clipper alone costs 2/3 of what the set costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I watched a few Youtube videos on &amp;#34;cutting your own hair&amp;#34;, and finally got the courage to slap on a guard and fire up the  clippers.  A few quick observations: 1) MAN, a lot of hair flies around when you cut it - doesn&#x27;t seem like that much at the barber, but the bathroom was covered 2) The envy clippers really mow through thick hair with little noise, vibration or heat - great clippers 3) Cutting your own hair is HARD - looking in the mirror, everything is backwards, and it&#x27;s hard to get the back, sides, etc all evenly 4) If you have a &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34;, you can get a shop-quality cut with these things - I took a good run at it, then called in the wife to do the trimming work.  She ended up re-clipping me, and it turned out really, really good. 5) Cords are a pain - unfortunately, similar quality cordless tools would cost over $200, so for the home user, these ROCK 6) I no longer need to pay $15 to get my hair cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line; these are not the cheapies you buy from Walmart, they are professional quality tools and can give you as good a cut as your skills (or those of your helper) will allow.  A bit more expensive, but worth every penny.  I&#x27;m happy, happy, happy.  VERY highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> One of the clips came broken and it overheats very quickly.</li>
    <li> Have to say it was a great purchase. The T trimmers is definitely a plus, of course you have to adjust the blade..... that&#x27;s easy make sure you use a mirror when adjusting. The clippers I haven&#x27;t used yet but I adjusted em and use the power screw to have em where it should be, when I use em I&#x27;ll update. Very good combo doe they come well oiled only issue I had was it taking a week to get em.... but love the items so far.</li>
    <li> Everything came quickly and works exactly the way it is supposed to work.  I am very happy that I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome pack everything came as describe and in the box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is my envy clippers on switch broke within a week of purchasing and now to keep it on I have to hold my thumb on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the only downfall of this but the outliners work great, clean crisp cuts!</li>
    <li> this product over heat&#x27;s alot especially the t-outliner, may nit be good for fading if not a professional up to the individual. love the four grauds offered of the t-outliner but not a buff.</li>
    <li> Cant wait to have this clipper in my hands! Every excited</li>
    <li> I did not give this product a full star because the blade for the trimmer arrived broken and even after it was replaced the blade for the trimmer lasted only a few days. I had to purchase a stainless steel replacement, will monitor and report back if the replacement was worth the buy. The clipper works well and cuts perfect...no dull blades. The trimmer is handy except for the inferior made blade it came with. The trimmer does neat, even and close shaves. My teen and his friends gets compliments often.</li>
    <li> worst hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. they stopped working the first week i had it. I oiled it every use.</li>
    <li> I received it fast and they perform very well. Well worth the money, I really like the T-outliners they cut very good after I adjusted them.</li>
    <li> I received my shipment only to find that only half of my product worked the trimmers which are the main reason I got this product won&#x27;t even turn on. You would think that things like this are tested before they ship. If I could give less than one star I would.</li>
    <li> good quality, i love it thankkssssss</li>
    <li> Bought this from Cosmetic Central, unfortunately some reviews mention these are defective and while your chances of getting a defective pair are slim i happened to get one. The power button doesn&#x27;t stay on, i can&#x27;t have this happening, it makes it very difficult to cut hair properly with a defect such as the power button turning off every few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to live on the edge and risk getting a known defective product then this is for you, otherwise I would stay away from this set.</li>
    <li> I purchased these about a year ago to be more frugal. Not only did they &amp;#34;pay for themselves&amp;#34; by saving me money in haircuts, I&#x27;ve made a few bucks cutting friends hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a barber, so I cannot judge them on that level. I however had had no issues whatsoever with these clippers and they work great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product March 2014.  I used it twice.  The second time the ON button would not stay on (larger size clipper).  I really liked how this clipper worked.  It seems like it was well made but apparently not!  Returned to Amazon but was charged a restocking fee of $10.64.  Not a happy camper!  I called Amazon and explained that this item was faulty, which is why it was returned.  With the great customer service, I got credit towards the restocking fee.  I will not purchase this product again but will try out anther set of clippers from Amazon.  Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift...recipient was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Work Great! Im saving $100 a month on haircuts now.</li>
    <li> The main envy clipper messed up, the lever to adjust the size wouldn&#x27;t stay. When I was cutting hair it would move to a shorter size. I tried to tighten over and over again but it didn&#x27;t work. The T-Outliner works great though! The only bad thing is that it over heats kind of fast but it cuts pretty good.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Self-Cut System (which is a basically a hanging three way mirror) which I saw on World Star Hip Hop, in order to cut my own hair. The instructional DVD that came with the Self-Cut System utilized this brand and specific model of clipper and trimmer. I did not want to buy through them because they were charging and arm and a leg for it. So I found them on Amazon! I always cut my bald fade with a 3 on top. These clippers, paired with Andis Cool Care spray, will satisfy anyone who likes to cut their own fade haircuts. I would also recommend the trimmer which is GREAT for shape ups and beard detailing. Cutting your own hair is a money saving, and fun learning experience. These clippers and trimmers did their job well.</li>
    <li> Had to adjust clippers when they arrived. I still haven&#x27;t zero gaped the trimmers yet. The don&#x27;t hit very close. I believe this is because of the comfort edge blade. I will be changing mine out to the original blade. The clippers do cut well.</li>
    <li> I like the overall quality of the clippers. I wish they had a #5 guard. The guards stay put but I don&#x27;t feel like the clippers catch all the hair. Sometimes it looks choppy. Never any problems I can&#x27;t fix though, I just may go over the same spot 2 times. I use these at work so they&#x27;re okay but I think there are better clippers out there. Packaging was great and shipment time was accurate. So far no mechanical problems.</li>
    <li> Best value for two sets. Have used each one time no problems.</li>
    <li> i had been using the andis improved master and andis t-outliner II for over a year. due to cicumstances unforseen to me i lost them but decided to get the envy clipper combo b/c i didn&#x27;t wanna forked an amt. upwards of $140. what i got was a loud motor, hard to align clipper teeth to precision cutting like shape-ups. if you need a simple clipper to simply cut hair, it wiil do the job, if you require more from your clippers i suggest getting the masters series</li>
    <li> I expected the T liners to cut much closer than they actually do right out of the box. I wouldn&#x27;t consider it near razor like. I wish the Envy clippers would accept the magnetic guards. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the combo deal</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quiet and handles well. Does a nice job .</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.  Clippers were as described in the post.  I would order again.  I highly recommend this item for working anyone that needs these for personal grooming.</li>
    <li> I really like it and my brother want it too&lt;br /&gt;My friends like it toooooooooooooo&lt;br /&gt;Buy it andis really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber, but I cut the heads in my family. I was happy to find that this combo suits my needs very well. Excellent product by Andis. Arrived undamaged and on time. Nothing more I could ask for.</li>
    <li> The clippers wasnt what i expected the T-blade clippers didnt cut as fine as i wanted them too. But the over all look was fantastic .. i still use the clippers today</li>
    <li> I purchased this gift for my husband and the product was wonderful.  Durable for usage and sleek in appearance.  Easy to care for and a great product at a great price.  The product arrived in a timely manner and was everything that my husband wanted.  The trimmer as well as the actual clippers are superb products for men who strive to keep up their well-groomed appearances.</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER, I bought these clippers for my face, not hair on my head.  As an African American, I have to use clippers vice a razor to shave.  I bought this combo pack because I maintain a groomed goutee.  I was using a beard and mustache trimmer from another manufacturer, but they never cut close enough.  These clippers are the same ones the barber uses in my old barber shop when I would get professionally trimmed up.  And the T-outliner is awesome for grooming around the mouth and under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;The performance has been fantastic.  They cut so close it might look like I used a blade, but no razor bumps or iritation here!  The one caveat I will add though... they send guards for the outliner!  So I didn&#x27;t need the combo pack... I edge with the outliner, slap on the guard, trim my goat, and it&#x27;s all good!  I wish I had known they were sending those, I would have bought the trimmer only.  Ah well, I will do something with the large clippers... maybe ebay.</li>
    <li> This cuts great. Leaves no lines. My only complaint is that it is very loud.  Much louder than cheaper clippers I have bought.</li>
    <li> I cut majority african american hair styles, and if thats what you do as well, then these clippers are not for you. Clean trimmers though</li>
    <li> Great customer service, will buy again. Very pleased and great purchase...</li>
    <li> I live in Europe and the amps of this product is 8 and i needed at least 12.  So i willl hold on to them and when I return to USA i will use them then.</li>
    <li> good value for the money</li>
    <li> No what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend who works at a professional salon, still going stron after months of use in a high traffic environment.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming beard and all...</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> I think is a good machine for personal uses. It needs more clics but it&#x27;s ok it&#x27;s a great clipper.</li>
    <li> The outliner is a great outliner but but but the envy blows and the guards that come with it are plastic, cheap and only come with 6 guards . I would not recommend getting this bundle, just buy the outliner by itself.</li>
    <li> My barber uses this brand and I have seen many barbers with this model and they still use it today. I have it out in Afghan and it works like a charm to cut my hair as well as my team. Great investment. I am looking, later, to add different types of clippers to this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: it works well cut different textures of hair.</li>
    <li> my sons really like this clipper set, hopefully one of them will become a barber! thanks</li>
    <li> Trimmers were chipped causing cuts in my clients skin and clipper blade was not lined up causing excessive hair pulling while servicing clients. Will never buy andis again.</li>
    <li> Clippers were not sharp at all. Threw away in disgust.. Didnt even bother returning it. Better in Trash.</li>
    <li> I am never going back to a barber shop. These clippers are working wonders for me. Ladies give me a lot of compliments every time I use these.</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend... said they are the truth. Worked so much better than his other clippers he had, quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a barber, but I decided to splurge and buy some pro products instead of the cheap consumer brands.This combo is worth every penny! Very, very sharp. The units are also quiet and easy to clean. I actually look forward to shaving my head and beard. No bumps or ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly... althougj the blade guard was M.I.A..</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I love it!!!The quality very good and I need it for my job! I like this items very much!!!</li>
    <li> The best deal I&#x27;ve seen on clippers in a long time...</li>
    <li> Very nice set of clippers and well worth the price.  I was looking for something more towards what the professionals use and this is as close as it gets.  This works perfectly able to outline my beard and do things that cheap clippers cannot do.  Comes with a great assortment of guards for both the large and small trimmer and could not ask for a better quality.  They work perfectly and make keeping my beard in check much easier.</li>
    <li> I like the envy the edgers get a little hot but what clippers don&#x27;t that&#x27;s why the barber always has more than one pair but they get the job done for what I need them for.</li>
    <li> Gets too hot quickly and is too loud. Cuts hair though. 3 and a half stars for it. Not recommended for African American hair though.</li>
    <li> They cut really good 👍</li>
    <li> Cuts very good and tight&lt;br /&gt;Quiet when running&lt;br /&gt;Like the attachments with different sizes&lt;br /&gt;Would like it if we had a hard case to keep it in.</li>
    <li> serves very well as a home grooming kit and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money by grooming yourself</li>
    <li> Great for first time barbers getting started and needing an pair of good liners as the GTX liner that comes in this set has the deep tooth design.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold up for us and we can&#x27;t find replacement parts.  My andis dog clippers on the other hand are wonderful</li>
    <li> It makes my husband looks sexy and clean.</li>
    <li> The small one cuts your skin</li>
    <li> What are the t outliner blades so dull???</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son to practice on my boys. So far he loves it and so do I.. I don&#x27;t have to pay for any more haircuts..lol</li>
    <li> I use it all the time since I got it to keep a fresh haircut at all times saves me a lot of money from going to the barber shop</li>
    <li> AWESOME. Great value for the price. Honestly after searching for one decent clipper i was amazed that i was able to buy two for this price. Andis as always offers great quality with these barber level clipper and trimmer. They came quick in the mail and easy to used to. If i keep up with maintenance i foresee a  using these for years to come. Great product, even greater seller</li>
    <li> This was an awesome product. It was a very good choice after reading multiple reviews and watching a video demos.</li>
    <li> Both clippers were brand new and in working order. Once the blades were sharpened the cut was amazing. Both have very long cords.</li>
    <li> Decided to invest in a good pair of clippers for my boys to save on barber expense. These came recommended by my barber.  They cut great.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of clippers. Higher quality means fewer passes and a straight cut with little to no stragglers left behind. Not quite professional quality but good for a midrange set of clippers.</li>
    <li> Greatest investment of my life! Great clipper set!</li>
    <li> Ordered Them With The 2 Day Shipping &amp; Arrived Next Day. Really Nice &amp; Came Just As Described. Came Very Well Packaged. My 2 Year Old Son Didnt Fuss When I Cut His Hair For The First Time With Them. Only Thing About Them Is That The Trimmer Does Get A Bit Hot After About 30-45 Minutes But Other Than That Im Pleased With Them.</li>
    <li> it is a good clipper, but It could have been sharper.  I have to cut my hair low in order to shave it with the t-outliner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pro barber.&lt;br /&gt;Started with this set.&lt;br /&gt;For the price your getting yourself a great deal, clippers n trimmers with guards.</li>
    <li> Andis held up to the hype and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, and is an advanced clipper.&lt;br /&gt;There is little forgiveness if you make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;That shows the blades are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and highly recommend it to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> Really meet all I was look for in a clipper esp coming in as combo... The price is amazing unbelievable</li>
    <li> So far so good. Just received the product in the mail and I used the t outliners. Out the box they were set to perfection. Haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use the clippers yet. We&#x27;ll see tonight.</li>
