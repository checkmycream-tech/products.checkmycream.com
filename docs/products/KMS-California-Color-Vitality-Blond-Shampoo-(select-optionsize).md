<li> It leaves my highlights less brassy!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve re-purchased in the past and will continue to use this shampoo.</li>

    <li> Satisfied.  Good product at a fair price and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> good product. fast delivery!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 6 weeks since my last expensive highlight treatment at the salon and my hair is still that same color. I don&#x27;t have that brassy blonde color that develops after a month. This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> It took me a long time to find the right shampoo. I have always struggled with my blonde hair going brassy and looking dry. Now it is soft and the color stays great in between color sessions. I can even go longer before coloring my hair. Wish I had found this sooner. The protein is really great for your hair. Try it; you will love it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased hair does not get brassy keeps the blonde the color that I died for a very long time. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but, for a purple shampoo; and I&#x27;ve tried lots, it has a nice consistency and better than normal shampoo experience. Smells better than others I&#x27;ve tried, too. My highlights are recent, so, the usual fading and tint altering, due to the crappy water where I live, hasn&#x27;t really started yet. But, from my 1 time use I can tell I won&#x27;t dread using it.</li>
    <li> Worked well on my color treated hair.  Great size and value. Worked as well as some costlier products I have used.</li>
    <li> I like the violet shampoo for my blond hair.  Helps to keep the brassy elements away.&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says and does it well.</li>
    <li> I get my hair done at a snazzy hair salon in town and this is the product line that they use.  I could not afford to buy it there, but I can on Amazon.  My hair looks good and feels good when I use KMS products.</li>
    <li> KMS has always been my go-to for my violet shampoo. It keeps away the brass colour that plagues blondes for as long as possible. I have been using it for 10 years now and it has never disappointed.</li>
    <li> We have used this for years and it&#x27;s the only one that never causes issues with color treated hair. The smell could be better, but it works great!</li>
    <li> Its okay -- there is better though. Especially for the money.</li>
    <li> This shampoo  costs much less from Amazon than purchasing it locally.  I have gray hair and this shampoo takes the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out of the hair that is caused by the sun.  I have been using it for a lot of years and find it to be the best for my gray hair.  Delivery time was good on lthis order.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purple shampoo. Most I&#x27;ve tried leave my hair flat or with a residue and I still want to wash my hair with a different shampoo.  I can use the kms as my daily shampoo, my hair feels soft and clean! It smells great and helps fight yellowing. I&#x27;ve re-purchased in the past and will continue to use this shampoo. Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> This blonde shampoo is the best I have tried. This is my 4th bottle.  It leaves my highlights less brassy!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Says &amp;#34;natural ingredients&amp;#34; without listing them. The bottle just arrived, second ingredient is sodium laurel sulfate, a known chemical carcinogen!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! So glad to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I still love this product and cannot see changing</li>
    <li> used this product for years and just love it!</li>
