<ol>
      <li>Great job!</li>
      <li>Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
      <li>I miss that this model no longer has the QuadPacer feature, but the Soniccare E-Series still provides the best value for a rechargeable toothbrush that dentists continue to recommend..</li>
      <li>The best Sonicare!  </li>
      <li>the timer is perfect cause it gives you just what the dentist recomended</li>
      <li>This one is perfect for me.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This tooth brush is amazing!</li>
      <li>I gave two stars because the warranty claims department was pleasant to work with on the phone, and are sending me a replacement.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>It turns off after 2 min which is nice, that way</li>
      <li>very easy to use and</li>
      <li>Best one I had so far.</li>
      <li>This replaced a more deluxe model for me.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see this with such a great price - not like years ago.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Though I liked the Diamond Head, I realized I never used all of the available options.  </li>
      <li>Could have designed it better so the water doesn&#x27;t drain inside so it must be cleaned every week or so.</li>
      <li>Sonicare Essence had, but I still love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It is ok for me as I saved money on this model</li>
      <li>Reaches all areas easily and is comfortable.  </li>
      <li>great price easy to use and leaves teeth and gums feeling like you just left the dentist office without the pain.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>It was time to replace my original Sonicare, either the charger had gone k-put or the battery inside the toothbrush had died.  </li>
      <li>I love my new toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>After a full week with this -- the original Sonicare -- I am so happy to share with you that this brush beats the more expensive version.  </li>
      <li>I love this basic model and the purple color is fun!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using these sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out, oral hygiene is much better than regular brushing, this was a replacement for one of the original units</li>
      <li>My teeth never feel fully clean with any other kind of brushing.</li>
      <li>Great Price for the unit, the last one finally died, this was a inexepnsive replacement</li>
      <li>It clears plaque and tartar unlike the other one and it great for my sensitive teeth/gums.  </li>
      <li>I had my first Sonicare Essence for over six years.</li>
      <li>5 stars for Amazon&#x27;s same day delivery too :)</li>
      <li>I purchased a replacement for my first Sonicare Essence toothbrush that would no longer hold a change.</li>
      <li>You have to get used to electric if you are new to them, but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Your teeth will feel so much cleaner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s REALLY purple vs. the medium purple in the photo.</li>
      <li>Works well and color was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
      <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it, and it was a pretty decent price (on sale for about 60$) for a professional tooth brush.</li>
      <li>and I got a snappy new color - purple!  </li>
      <li>Was hoping for better results than the last Oral-B rechargeable I had, that lasted only a year.</li>
      <li>I wish my new Sonicare Essence toothbrush had this feature like my old (first)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the use of the Soniccare to everyone.</li>
      <li>I got a new waterpik the same day and together it was just as good, if not better than going to the dentist for a cleaning!  </li>
      <li>I will note that it doesn&#x27;t really have an indicator to notify you to switch surfaces, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me; I still brush my teeth for a long time anyways.</li>
      <li>It charges easily and beeps and flashes green when it&#x27;s time to recharge.</li>
      <li>This looks and works just like my old one</li>
      <li>Finally replaced the one I&#x27;ve had for almost 20 years--had just bought new brush heads.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Be aware that the purple color in the picture does not perfectly reflect the true color of the handle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this toothbrush. I purchased a replacement for my first Sonicare Essence toothbrush that would no longer hold a change. I had my first Sonicare Essence for over six years. The toothbrush I purchased doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second intervals between the two minute brush cycle. I wish my new Sonicare Essence toothbrush had this feature like my old (first) Sonicare Essence had, but I still love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Works well, frustration-free package is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Had it less than 30 days and the battery failed to recharge enough for even one use. Was hoping for better results than the last Oral-B rechargeable I had, that lasted only a year. The Oral-B brush prior to that one lasted 12 years. Seems like rechargeable toothbrushes are getting worse, not better. I gave two stars because the warranty claims department was pleasant to work with on the phone, and are sending me a replacement. I&#x27;ll post back how well that one performs.</li>
    <li> I now have them for everyone in the family. Everyone of us has had the same reaction.</li>
    <li> Prior to this model, I was an Oral B fan. However, after the deaths of a few of the tooth brushes, I wanted to try this company out since my boyfriend raved about how well it works. So, I switched over to Sonicare and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to anything else. My teeth feel so much cleaner and it&#x27;s been pointed out by my dentist of the improvement. I will note that it doesn&#x27;t really have an indicator to notify you to switch surfaces, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me; I still brush my teeth for a long time anyways.</li>
    <li> Works great. Could have designed it better so the water doesn&#x27;t drain inside so it must be cleaned every week or so.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and the timer is perfect cause it gives you just what the dentist recomended</li>
    <li> The best Sonicare!  This review is coming from a former Sonicare Diamond Head owner.  The toothbrush and system eventually went to toothbrush-heaven.  For about 4 months I went back to the manual toothbrush.  After several episodes where food stuck to my teeth, I knew I needed to go back to an electric brush in order to be be presentable after my hearty salads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I liked the Diamond Head, I realized I never used all of the available options.  At  ~$200 it was a frivolous expanse, in hindsight.  After a full week with this -- the original Sonicare -- I am so happy to share with you that this brush beats the more expensive version.  It clears plaque and tartar unlike the other one and it great for my sensitive teeth/gums.  This one seems to heal/seal the gaps.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the same toothpaste as before... the only change is the toothbrush.  This one is fantastic!!!!  Give it a try ...no need to splurge on the Diamond Head, in my view.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This electic toothbrush leaves the mouth tingling after using.  Feels like I just came from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush.  I got a new waterpik the same day and together it was just as good, if not better than going to the dentist for a cleaning!  5 stars for Amazon&#x27;s same day delivery too :)</li>
    <li> Finally replaced the one I&#x27;ve had for almost 20 years--had just bought new brush heads. My teeth never feel fully clean with any other kind of brushing. Takes up very little room. I replace the brush head every 6-8 months. You can buy them here on Amazon. I highly recommend the use of the Soniccare to everyone.</li>
    <li> feels like going to the dentist every time you brush.</li>
    <li> Great job! Your teeth will feel so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush. I was very disappointed that it does not have the 30 second timer feature that my old sonicare had.</li>
    <li> I love this basic model and the purple color is fun!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out, oral hygiene is much better than regular brushing, this was a replacement for one of the original units</li>
    <li> It was time to replace my original Sonicare, either the charger had gone k-put or the battery inside the toothbrush had died.  Whatever, it lasted years!  I was happy to see this with such a great price - not like years ago.  This looks and works just like my old one and I got a snappy new color - purple!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. It turns off after 2 min which is nice, that way I know I&#x27;m brushing for long enough. My teeth feel cleaner since I started using it. It charges easily and beeps and flashes green when it&#x27;s time to recharge. I wanted an electric toothbrush but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This one is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This replaced a more deluxe model for me. It is ok for me as I saved money on this model but I would not recomend it for someone who has never used a rechargeable toothbursh.  I next time I will go back to the model that has the 30 second beep.  I like Sonicare and will always use this brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this sonicare because it was the only one that had the longer brush head...it is heavier than my previous sonicare...does not give a 30 second beep...I don&#x27;t like having to change the toothbrush head when it stops working as that is quite expensive...would prefer to change batteries instead.</li>
    <li> Works well and color was better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Best one I had so far.</li>
    <li> I miss that this model no longer has the QuadPacer feature, but the Soniccare E-Series still provides the best value for a rechargeable toothbrush that dentists continue to recommend..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the purple color in the picture does not perfectly reflect the true color of the handle.  It&#x27;s REALLY purple vs. the medium purple in the photo.</li>
    <li> Quiet and efficient.  Reaches all areas easily and is comfortable.  You have to get used to electric if you are new to them, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is amazing! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> great price easy to use and leaves teeth and gums feeling like you just left the dentist office without the pain.</li>
    <li> Great Price for the unit, the last one finally died, this was a inexepnsive replacement</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She absolutely loves it, and it was a pretty decent price (on sale for about 60$) for a professional tooth brush. It also times how long you should brush (2minutes)</li>
