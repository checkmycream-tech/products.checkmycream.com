      <li>Great economic product!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Maybelline eyelash curlers for MANY years.</li>
      <li>and I have used a curler for many many years</li>
      <li>I only use Tweezerman - the best products out there.</li>
      <li>I have Asian eyes and this lash curler fits my eyes perfectly.</li>
      <li>But why I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many eyelash curlers in the past, and this one is the best.   </li>
      <li>Easy to use, does a great job, and comes with three extra pad refills.  </li>
      <li>Produces a tight long-lasting curl; one of the best eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Thank you to the company for providing such a great product.</li>
      <li>and easy to clean</li>
      <li>and they fit.</li>
      <li>Could have been a cheap Maybelline.</li>
      <li>Absolutely luv these curlers!!!</li>
      <li>Tweezerman products are often highly priced in stores, I think this was a pretty good deal.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday, it works great, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my lashes :)</li>
      <li>I am able to curl my long lashes better that way, Love it &amp; the price, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
      <li>Good investment if you use a lash curler on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>quickly comes out.</li>
      <li>The more I use them, the better I like them, and do plan to purchase another pair in the future.</li>
      <li>I did better with my old Maybelline lash</li>
      <li>It came with multiple rubber replacements and I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far.</li>
      <li>But worth it.</li>
      <li>It took me a while to get this right without pinching myself.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this a an awesome eye lash curler that curls lashes and last for a very long time and not just and hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>However, after several uses the pads softened up and now make my lashes look long and beautiful.</li>
      <li>and so my lashes aren&#x27;t as easy to curl as those with lush lashes.</li>
      <li>I have a very straight eyelashes</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t happy with this eyelash curler because the pads were very stiff and did not work well with my lashes.</li>
      <li>After the initial &amp;#34;getting used to them,&amp;#34; this lash curler has become a favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>They really do the trick!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been consistently using one for maybe two years.</li>
      <li>but I all I do is adjust it slightly for a better fit.</li>
      <li>The refills are (so far) easy to find for the Tweezerman, and that is what prompted me to buy this particular eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>I think that was pretty decent.</li>
      <li>The backup pads are also a very convenient add-on.</li>
      <li>When I apply a blow-dryer to this curler for 3-5 seconds as well it makes the curling process much faster.</li>
      <li>It does seem very well made though.</li>
      <li>The pads wear out fast, you can tell when it starts to make lashes fall out</li>
      <li>Inside, the whole lash curler is made out of plastic instead of metal as was depicted.</li>
      <li>She says that it gives a nice and consistent bend that makes her eyes look wide open.</li>
      <li>I ordered this eyelash curler to replace my older, worn out one, and it works really well.</li>
      <li>love its packaging especially with 3 extra purple rubber helpers</li>
      <li>has a small top metal bender rather than the wide one that most eyelash curlers have.</li>
      <li>This lash curler is the only one I have EVER used that has worked on my SO straight lashes!  </li>
      <li>Try heating it up for a second with your hair dryer and it really curls your lashes!</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are completely flat/invisible without this eyelash curler</li>
      <li>No complaints from me so far.</li>
      <li>but this one far exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>After using this eyelash curler for a few days, I developed this bumpy rash above my right eyelid and at the inner corner of my right eye, forming the shape of the eyelash curler (but only for my right eye).</li>
      <li>There is a big curve in these that doesn&#x27;t fit the shape go my eyes like my other curlers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: Just a few days after this review was posted, the seller offered me a full refund and a replacement curler.</li>
      <li>This may be due to the very nature of eyelash curlers, I may be doing something wrong, or there may be a better eyelash curler.</li>

<li> This may be due to the very nature of eyelash curlers, I may be doing something wrong, or there may be a better eyelash curler.</li>
<li> Highly recommend it for people with sparse or thin lashes because it really   grabs them for you and curls them.</li>
<li> I have very straight eyelashes and hard to keep curled all day.</li>
<li> The pads last a long time</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t stay curled for a long time, however.  </li>
<li> It is larger than my previous eyelash curler, and I am still learning how to use this larger one.  </li>
<li> It also seems like it&#x27;s well made, especially compared to other grocery store brands.</li>
<li> Tried them all, I have very small eyes and this particular eye lash curler</li>
<li> You can also use other pads in this thing, I tried some left over ones I had in there the other day</li>
<li> It takes a couple weeks of continuous use to get them broken in, but after that they work very well.  </li>
<li> This is a good curler, I&#x27;ve been using it for quite awhile now &amp; have never been disappointed!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure it is any different from any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> Extremely dissapointed.</li>
<li> I had hoped to receive a product that would curl my extremely curl-resistant lashes.  </li>
<li> I started trying other eyelash curlers and found none that compare to this one.</li>
<li> they are the only brand that i know will not stick to your delicate lashes.</li>
<li> No distinct difference from the $3 curlers that you can buy from ELF.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s some slight pinching</li>
<li> I thought it was a little pricey but thought I would give it a try anyway.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Maybe this curler is not a good shape for my face as I can&#x27;t get it as close to my lash line as I have with other curlers.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting...</li>
<li> like I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
<li> These are just average - they are difficult to grip.</li>
<li> Not too difficult thing to do!  </li>
<li> The worst I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not what I was expecting for the price.  Could have been a cheap Maybelline.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, does a great job, and comes with three extra pad refills.  Tweezeman makes good products and I will stick with this brand.</li>
    <li> My lashes are very crucial to me.  I am asian ethnicity and so my lashes aren&#x27;t as easy to curl as those with lush lashes. I have used variety or eyelash curlers but this one does its job: to Curl Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love its packaging especially with 3 extra purple rubber helpers: sorry I am not to sure what they&#x27;re called (x&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this a an awesome eye lash curler that curls lashes and last for a very long time and not just and hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product that came did not match the picture description. Inside, the whole lash curler is made out of plastic instead of metal as was depicted. Extremely dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many eyelash curlers in the past, and this one is the best.   Highly recommend it for people with sparse or thin lashes because it really   grabs them for you and curls them.</li>
    <li> I think learning how to curl your lashes takes practice. It took me a while to get this right without pinching myself. Now I got some rocking lashes (which are invisible when they&#x27;re not curled). The pads wear out fast, you can tell when it starts to make lashes fall out and just doesn&#x27;t curl as well. You can also use other pads in this thing, I tried some left over ones I had in there the other day and they fit. It also seems like it&#x27;s well made, especially compared to other grocery store brands.</li>
    <li> I changed nothing in my morning regimen, except for my eyelash curler. After using this eyelash curler for a few days, I developed this bumpy rash above my right eyelid and at the inner corner of my right eye, forming the shape of the eyelash curler (but only for my right eye). I may be allergic to the metal that is used to make the curler. I wrote to Tweezerman asking what it&#x27;s made of and they didn&#x27;t write back.</li>
    <li> Lightweight.  Does the job.  Not too difficult thing to do!  But why I love it is that it came with 2 extra rubber cushions.  That&#x27;s a nice plus.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t happy with this eyelash curler because the pads were very stiff and did not work well with my lashes. However, after several uses the pads softened up and now make my lashes look long and beautiful. My eyelashes are completely flat/invisible without this eyelash curler and now I can&#x27;t leave the house without it! When I apply a blow-dryer to this curler for 3-5 seconds as well it makes the curling process much faster. The backup pads are also a very convenient add-on.</li>
    <li> The picture shows a metal curler. I received a plastic one. T</li>
    <li> I only use Tweezerman - the best products out there.</li>
    <li> Did and embarrassing of research I did before purchasing this as my replacement curler...But worth it. Its awesome. Will buy again when the time comes</li>
    <li> Great economic product!</li>
    <li> I have Asian eyes and this lash curler fits my eyes perfectly. There&#x27;s some slight pinching but I all I do is adjust it slightly for a better fit. I also purchased the refills so I never have to run out. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Maybe this curler is not a good shape for my face as I can&#x27;t get it as close to my lash line as I have with other curlers. Also the purple cushion is rather sticky and I feel my lashes stick to it a bit.  It does seem very well made though.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman always works the best!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely luv these curlers!!! they are the only brand that i know will not stick to your delicate lashes. They really do the trick!</li>
    <li> Produces a tight long-lasting curl; one of the best eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. She says that it gives a nice and consistent bend that makes her eyes look wide open.</li>
    <li> The best there is!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyelash curler to replace my older, worn out one, and it works really well. I get really great curl from it. No complaints from me so far.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is always quality for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting... it curls lashes nicely without pulling them out but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure it is any different from any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The best eyelash curlers I have ever owned. Thank you to the company for providing such a great product. I will never buy anything but Tweezerman products.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a lash curler that actually works without heat and I found it!  This one works!</li>
    <li> The worst I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t open up enough, pinches, and curl quickly comes out. I did better with my old Maybelline lash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Just a few days after this review was posted, the seller offered me a full refund and a replacement curler. I think that was pretty decent.</li>
    <li> There is a big curve in these that doesn&#x27;t fit the shape go my eyes like my other curlers. I can&#x27;t get a curl close to the root so it doesn&#x27;t look as good.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler out there. I like that you can purchase refill pads separately.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Maybelline eyelash curlers for MANY years. But Maybelline has changed their product and I will never use again. They don&#x27;t work. I started trying other eyelash curlers and found none that compare to this one. I thought it was a little pricey but thought I would give it a try anyway. I am so glad I did because it works so good. I have very straight eyelashes and hard to keep curled all day. This one definitely works. I will continue using this product</li>
    <li> I have a very straight eyelashes and I have used a curler for many many years but this one far exceeded my expectations. this is the only type of curler I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great curler for my lashes. I use it everyday, it works great, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my lashes :)</li>
    <li> This is a well made eyelash curler.  It is larger than my previous eyelash curler, and I am still learning how to use this larger one.  The refills are (so far) easy to find for the Tweezerman, and that is what prompted me to buy this particular eyelash curler.  I would recommend this curler.</li>
    <li> comes with extra strips so you can use it forever and guaranteed by the brand-came in two days! and easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is a good curler, I&#x27;ve been using it for quite awhile now &amp; have never been disappointed! The pads last a long time so it&#x27;s not a flimsy curler like I&#x27;ve had in the past. Good investment if you use a lash curler on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I love it, It works great. Recommend to everyone who likes curly eyelashes. It comes with 3 refills. So good product for price.</li>
    <li> This lash curler is the only one I have EVER used that has worked on my SO straight lashes!  It curls them every time!  I then use a mascara that has 2 step process and is a microfiber mascara or I don&#x27;t think my lashes would stay curled.  But without this curler, I wouldn&#x27;t have a chance!  Thank you for making it!</li>
    <li> After the initial &amp;#34;getting used to them,&amp;#34; this lash curler has become a favorite of mine.  It takes a couple weeks of continuous use to get them broken in, but after that they work very well.  The more I use them, the better I like them, and do plan to purchase another pair in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an eyelash curler before, so my opinion may not be as valuable as others&#x27; opinions.  It arrived with four extra rubber pieces, which seemed like a generous idea.  It curls my eyelashes.  They don&#x27;t stay curled for a long time, however.  This may be due to the very nature of eyelash curlers, I may be doing something wrong, or there may be a better eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I always hated buying those cheap ones at the store, now i have these, by eyelashes look 10 times better</li>
    <li> No distinct difference from the $3 curlers that you can buy from ELF. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I could have done just as well at my local drug store.  I had hoped to receive a product that would curl my extremely curl-resistant lashes.  No luck with these.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Revlon eyelash curler, but it wasn&#x27;t the best. This tweezerman curler does the job. You don&#x27;t even have to squeeze the grip a lot and I still get a great curl!</li>
    <li> These are just average - they are difficult to grip. The quality is good.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler! Try heating it up for a second with your hair dryer and it really curls your lashes!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman products are often highly priced in stores, I think this was a pretty good deal. I&#x27;ve been looking for an eyelash curler that was priced well and practical, and this did the job. And it&#x27;s my fav color. Yay. :D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with eyelash curlers I guess. I&#x27;ve been consistently using one for maybe two years. I was pretty happy with my plastic Tweezerman one but it broke (twice) so I was happy to find this one for a comparable price. It came with multiple rubber replacements and I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far. Just wish it was cushioned but I&#x27;ll survive!</li>
    <li> Tried them all, I have very small eyes and this particular eye lash curler has a small top metal bender rather than the wide one that most eyelash curlers have. I am able to curl my long lashes better that way, Love it &amp; the price, can&#x27;t beat it. Much more expensive elsewhere.</li>
