      <li>Does a very good job, quiet, light weight for travel.  </li>

      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I found this razor and ordered it because its nickel free, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for precise shaving.</li>
      <li>I did not think I would like shaving with an electric shaver, but this one is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really give me as close a shave as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised how good it works.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>For someone who has light soft hair on their body, I&#x27;m sure it will work much better for you.  </li>
      <li>I do not get razor rash no more very happy!</li>
      <li>, I was really excited.     </li>
      <li>This is the first time in years I have been able to shave my knees and not get nicked...</li>
      <li>Item works very well and might be rated a five star if we had owned it longer for more experience with its performance.</li>
      <li>It is not a close shave, but I think it is great for other areas.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of times I used it it was fine.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted, portable, light weight AND NO ELECTRICAL CHARGING REQUIRED.  </li>
      <li>but pretty close!  </li>
      <li>While I can get most of the hair off, it grows back so very very quickly and there is stubble</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Although it was very light and easy to use, it was not very powerful, and the batteries were drained after just one use.</li>
      <li>It left my skin really irritated, even with really nice shaving gels, and even after a couple weeks of use.     </li>
      <li>This is a good little shaver which uses 2 AA size cells.</li>
      <li>I can switch from trimmer to shaver and back quickly and easily</li>
      <li>but if traveling you can get alkalines pretty much anywhere).</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really shave very close and it irritates my underarms.  </li>
      <li>That being said, however, I haven&#x27;t found anything that really works.  </li>
      <li>As far as the shaving performance, she likes it better than her last razor, on which she had replaced the blades two or three times.</li>
      <li>Good that it can be used wet with regular shaving cream too.  </li>
      <li>The batteries are easily available in stores and the shaver is plenty powerful with sharp blades.  </li>
      <li>which is greatly appreciated since I live in Hawaii.</li>
      <li>This is something I will use all the time and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>so much I also bought one for my adult granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>Still use it every other day for a quick smoothing.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Does not get competetly smooth but is a small price to pay for no razor burn.</li>
      <li>She admits she prefers the closeness of a razor in such sensitive areas, but still appreciates the decent job it does on a larger surface, as her legs.</li>
      <li>I was a bit concerned that AAA batteries wouldn&#x27;t last very long, but she just replaced them for the first time this morning.</li>
      <li>This is a super shaver - battery operated and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to everyone who wants a shaver to be used while travelling or to use world wide.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and at least doesn&#x27;t make my legs bleed!</li>

<li> In my opinion, it didn&#x27;t give a very close shave and took too long, had to go very slow and just wasn&#x27;t a close shave.</li>

<li> Haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great shaver!  I love that it has batteries instead of a cord.  I like the simplicity of it.  I can switch from trimmer to shaver and back quickly and easily and it&#x27;s super easy to clean.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me with razor rash. This is something I will use all the time and I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Left very little stubble. No ingrown hairs, no bumps, no alergies! My only rant is that The batteries didn&#x27;t last very long, I have to change them every 5 days or so.</li>
    <li> It works ok if you want to make 40 swipes on just one leg to make sure you got all the hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife because I noticed she used razor blades. She uses it in her bath shaving her legs and enjoys the convenience and portability of the unit but cannot come to a close shave in her bikini area. She admits she prefers the closeness of a razor in such sensitive areas, but still appreciates the decent job it does on a larger surface, as her legs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a stocking-stuffer for Christmas last year. I was a bit concerned that AAA batteries wouldn&#x27;t last very long, but she just replaced them for the first time this morning. With so many toys and remotes lying around, we keep AA and AAA rechargeable batteries on chargers all the time. So this is one more thing she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping charged, nor losing the charger, nor expensive proprietary batteries.    As far as the shaving performance, she likes it better than her last razor, on which she had replaced the blades two or three times. She especially likes that it doesn&#x27;t seem to nick or grab at all.    I feel it was a great deal, too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t shave one hair, do not buy</li>
    <li> I still got some razor burn on the bikini area but is much better than a razor. No cuts or discomforton my legs. Does not get competetly smooth but is a small price to pay for no razor burn. Have used in shower and out seems to get a closer shave in the shower. I like the battery rather than having to wait for a recharge.</li>
    <li> This is a super shaver - battery operated and can be used wet or dry.  I like it so much I also bought one for my adult granddaughter.  Price is low also.  You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my small Panasonic \\&quot;smooth operator\\&quot; that I learned to shave my legs with 10 years ago started to slow down. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have never gotten a shave this close with an electric. It is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic ES2291D Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver for my girl as a replacement for her all in one shaver/epilator and apparently it&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s less irritating. She also likes it because it&#x27;s cordless and can use AAA batteries (she uses NimH rechargeables in it but if traveling you can get alkalines pretty much anywhere). I also got here the  Panasonic ES2082P Hair Removal System and she loves that as well (it doesn&#x27;t pull skin).</li>
    <li> this product is not so good to shave legs and it is more for lots of hair. lol</li>
    <li> Better than any razors</li>
    <li> For what I am using it for, it is fine.  It is not a close shave, but I think it is great for other areas.  I am pretty happy.  For the money, it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is the best ladies shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love that it is cordless and yet doesn&#x27;t have to be recharged or plugged into an outlet.  The batteries are easily available in stores and the shaver is plenty powerful with sharp blades.  A total winner for me.</li>
    <li> This product works good if you just want a quick surface level shave on the go. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for precise shaving. If your hairy, like me, the hair will be back the next day.</li>
    <li> Helped my daughter&#x27;s allergy to nickel, she does not \\&quot;itch\\&quot; amymore using this shaver. Arrived in great condition in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I bought it specifically because I have an allergic reaction to nickle. The first couple of times I used it it was fine. This last time I used the razor my legs broke out again.</li>
    <li> Had I known it was battery operated I never would have purchased it.  With fully charged batteries, it did a horrible job.  It is supposed to be a wet/dry shaver, but it fell in the shower and never worked again.  Absolutely awful!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time in years I have been able to shave my knees and not get nicked...It&#x27;s nice to just be able to shave and not have to fool around with water and gel if I don&#x27;t want to...</li>
    <li> This razor did not meet my expectations, . Although it was very light and easy to use, it was not very powerful, and the batteries were drained after just one use. I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted, portable, light weight AND NO ELECTRICAL CHARGING REQUIRED.  And, to my surprise, a wonderful feature of a bikini comb.  I had no idea that Panasonic made ladies&#x27; shavers so was glad to find this item on Amazon.  None of the usual shaver mfgrs. had this simple battery operated model.  It seems Epilators are now the thing but not for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Takes a long time to trim.. bad bad bad!!</li>
    <li> This is a good little shaver which uses 2 AA size cells. It does what it is suppose to do. I recommend this to everyone who wants a shaver to be used while travelling or to use world wide.</li>
    <li> I have a strong nickel allergy, that I was diagnosed with in summer of 2013. I broke out in hives on my legs from the irritation from razors containing nickel. I found this razor and ordered it because its nickel free, and it doesn&#x27;t work. I moved it up and down, down and up, around in circles, I pushed down hard, I lightly placed it on my legs, and it would NOT shave any leg hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really shave very close and it irritates my underarms.  Still use it every other day for a quick smoothing.  Haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to have a charger for this shaver.  It does a good job for this type of shaver.</li>
    <li> Does a very good job, quiet, light weight for travel.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> this is as good of a razor as you can get and at such a very fair price.well satisfied! thanks</li>
    <li> So happy with this shaver.  It gives a nice smooth shave on my legs.  I love the fact that it runs on batteries--no charger required which is especially nice when traveling.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised how good it works.  It will never be as close a shave as with a razor...but pretty close!  Good that it can be used wet with regular shaving cream too.  Easy to clean. Also, it arrived so promptly(!) which is greatly appreciated since I live in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> I love this razor !! I had issues with razor rash I do not get razor rash no more very happy!</li>
    <li> It looks and works ok.  I&#x27;m using it for hair on arms.  Doesn&#x27;t really give me as close a shave as I would have liked.  That being said, however, I haven&#x27;t found anything that really works.  I am, unfortunately, hairy and have tried everything.  While I can get most of the hair off, it grows back so very very quickly and there is stubble w/i 1-2 days.  For someone who has light soft hair on their body, I&#x27;m sure it will work much better for you.  I shave my legs every night in shower w/regular razor as I&#x27;ve found this works best even though their is stubble very next day.</li>
    <li> This fits my hand perfectly and even arrived a day earlier than projected.  Needless to say, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job and was a good price.  Easy to hold and easy to replace batteries. Ease of ordering.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this!! It&#x27;s super hard to find an electric razor these days that uses batteries and doesn&#x27;t charge in an outlet! My mom lives in a nursing home and things come up missing due to staff or seniors with alzheimers so we lost 2 that charged on the wall outlet. I searched and searched and found this one that uses batteries so we can keep it out of site! Works great. It shipped from another country and I was skeptical but, its great, came perfectly packaged in original packaging and was brand new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.  No electric shaver shaves as closely as a razor, but this isn&#x27;t bad.  It&#x27;s easy to use and at least doesn&#x27;t make my legs bleed!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it! Said it was the best Christmas present ever (age 11).</li>
    <li> It does not work.  Put the batteries in and nothing happens.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I did not think I would like shaving with an electric shaver, but this one is fantastic.  So helpful when it&#x27;s just not convenient to use soap &amp; water.</li>
    <li> It works...sort of. I got this for Christmas and, as a person always looking for something better than a razor and shaving cream, I was really excited.     The shave isn&#x27;t anywhere near as close as a standard razor, it leaves little stubblies of hair behind, sort of a day after shaving effect. It doesn&#x27;t cut you, as promised, but that&#x27;s about the best thing it has going for it. It left my skin really irritated, even with really nice shaving gels, and even after a couple weeks of use.     So, I&#x27;m back with my Venus, which is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever found. And the wet dry shaver has joined the corpses of my other &#x27;miracle&#x27; hair removal products. It has joined the Nair, the Nads, the Veet and that barbaric little machine that just yanks your hair out by the roots.     If you don&#x27;t mind a bumpy, stubbly finish, by all means, pick one of these babies up.</li>
    <li> Works great!!  I used to shave in the shower, making my shower time very long.  This shaver is awesome!  I can grab it at any time I have a free minute, while watching TV, and it does such a great job and very quickly too!!  I bought one for my Mom too and she is just as happy with it!!</li>
    <li> Item works very well and might be rated a five star if we had owned it longer for more experience with its performance.</li>
    <li> She likes it because it&#x27;s easy to put in a put in her bag when traveling and not having to worry about a cord or charger.  This one uses 2 AAA batteries and she is very pleased with it.  Since I don&#x27;t use that type of razor, you won&#x27;t get any comment out of me.  You see, I&#x27;m her husband and the one who got it for her.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, it didn&#x27;t give a very close shave and took too long, had to go very slow and just wasn&#x27;t a close shave.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product it was a gift for my wife, however she said it works pretty good. No better or worse then any other shaver.</li>
