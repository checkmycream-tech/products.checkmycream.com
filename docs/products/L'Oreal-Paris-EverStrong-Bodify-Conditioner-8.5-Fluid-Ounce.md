      <li>This conditioner works well by itself but even better with L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Bodify Shampoo.</li>
      <li>Adds body and shine to my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I wanted something Sulfate free</li>
      <li>this line of L&#x27;Oreal products is sulfate free...</li>
      <li>I can also feel good about the run off not polluting our world any further :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I will not buy it again, nevertheless the saler was excellentn the product arrive before I expected and in good conditions</li>
      <li>At first I liked it and it smelled fresh, salon fresh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost 40, and I have been trying to find a good shampoo/condition to make my hair look fuller for as long as I can remember...</li>

      <li>My hair loves, And the price is right.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter since it is sulfate free to help with her dandruff and it may be good for that, however I will likely never find out because the smell from this shampoo is making me have an allergic reaction even being in the same room as my daughter now after she has used this (once).  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product too much!</li>
      <li>Perhaps this works better on younger hair (I&#x27;m 68)</li>
      <li>but she has to flip her head forward and thoroughly blow dry to get more fullness.</li>
      <li>I would use it over products that most hotels leave in their bathrooms, but I would choose other conditioners first, if I had a choice, at home.</li>
      <li>I have never found one that made much of a difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product really works it leaves the hair managable and helps give it body.</li>
      <li>I enjoy scented products but a lot of lower-cost hair products tend to smell similar, My shower smelled like the hair dresser&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very silky.  </li>
      <li>all my years of buying different shampoos/conditioners, I have never, not even once, liked one enough to purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>Better than most commercial brands, but really, not as good a product as L&#x27;Oreal should be producing.</li>
      <li>This is the very first shampoo/conditioner that I will actually be repurchasing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It has a fascinating smell of Rosmary and mint, you feel relaxed with it (like an aromatherapy) but the texture of the hair isn&#x27;t smooth and it is quit difficult to brush!</li>
      <li>However, after a few uses it smells more like medicine or something that I would except to smell in a hospital and for me, the scent is a little overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Very lightweight, gives me shiny, soft, silky hair.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t think it possible, but this conditioner (used with the matching shampoo) left my baby fine hair even more flyaway and shapeless than before.  </li>
      <li>This is the only shampoo/conditioner that I have used that has given a very noticible increase in body.  </li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t interested in getting something like VO5 or some other cheapy shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>barely any tangles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it is gentle and less harming to your hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair type is long, baby fine, very thin, and stick straight.  </li>

    <li> I bought it cuz it looked extra-moisterising. I believe it is. I had an awesome hair day after my first use anyway. The kicker for me is how lovely it smells. I enjoy scented products but a lot of lower-cost hair products tend to smell similar, My shower smelled like the hair dresser&#x27;s (ie good memories of fun times) and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted something Sulfate free and I wasn&#x27;t interested in getting something like VO5 or some other cheapy shampoo and conditioner.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very silky.  I must say that the smell is a little weird.  At first I liked it and it smelled fresh, salon fresh. However, after a few uses it smells more like medicine or something that I would except to smell in a hospital and for me, the scent is a little overwhelming.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again for that reason unless they decided to change the scent.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it possible, but this conditioner (used with the matching shampoo) left my baby fine hair even more flyaway and shapeless than before.  I gave the product two stars only because it also left my hair extremely shiny.  Perhaps this works better on younger hair (I&#x27;m 68) but I will be throwing it away and going back to L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
    <li> that means I use it: erday erday.  for you proper people that means daily. I use it erday for good smelling hairday hairday!</li>
    <li> Been using this along with the matching shampoo.  Adds body and shine to my fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. Great scent.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;oreal always did excellent products to hair care! But I&#x27;ve got say with a note of dissatisfaction and disappointment: I didn&#x27;t like this product too much! It has a fascinating smell of Rosmary and mint, you feel relaxed with it (like an aromatherapy) but the texture of the hair isn&#x27;t smooth and it is quit difficult to brush! I&#x27;m sure I will not buy it again, nevertheless the saler was excellentn the product arrive before I expected and in good conditions</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works very well for me.</li>
    <li> I usually love L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong products but this conditioner weighs your hair down and actually makes your hair feel dirty instead of silky and soft.</li>
    <li> I will keep buying this until they do.  My hair loves, And the price is right.  Great quality and smells so good.</li>
    <li> I started buying this for my daughter about a year ago and she uses it, along with the shampoo, every day and loves it.  She has flat hair and this helps but she has to flip her head forward and thoroughly blow dry to get more fullness.</li>
    <li> My hair type is long, baby fine, very thin, and stick straight.  I&#x27;m almost 40, and I have been trying to find a good shampoo/condition to make my hair look fuller for as long as I can remember...probably at least 20 years.  I have tried SO MANY shampoos.  Drug store brands, all the way to insanely expensive salon brands.  I have never found one that made much of a difference in my hair.  After using this for about 2 weeks, my had has DRASTICALLY improved!  This is the only shampoo/conditioner that I have used that has given a very noticible increase in body.  I also am noticing less breakage, and my hair is very soft and shiney now.  This conditioner is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, yet it conditions so good, I don&#x27;t even need to use a detangler anymore.  That boggles my mind.  I&#x27;ve always had to use a ton of detangler, and still work at combing through my hair with a detangling come.  When I use this conditioner, without even using any detangler, my comb goes through my hair like butter - barely any tangles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all my years of buying different shampoos/conditioners, I have never, not even once, liked one enough to purchase it again.  This is the very first shampoo/conditioner that I will actually be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I used this product by mistake once and fell in love.  NO SULFATE!!  My hair feels looks and smells beautiful.  I get tons of compliments on how great my hair smells all the time.  I no longer use conditioner since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I can also feel good about the run off not polluting our world any further :)</li>
    <li> Probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used under 10 dollars. I have oily hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gross and over conditioned. Very lightweight, gives me shiny, soft, silky hair.</li>
    <li> this line of L&#x27;Oreal products is sulfate free...so it is gentle and less harming to your hair.  My daughter uses it and says it leaves her hair soft and healthy, and gives her hair some body.</li>
    <li> This product really works it leaves the hair managable and helps give it body. It also has a nice scent</li>
    <li> This conditioner is good and smells great, but I doubt if it is giving any volume to my hair. I don&#x27;t notice any results.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works well by itself but even better with L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Bodify Shampoo. It definitely produces volume and body. Has reduced the amount of hair loss on brush or comb and the occasional shedding on shoulders. Product has great clean scent. I use this product regularly and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> Better than most commercial brands, but really, not as good a product as L&#x27;Oreal should be producing. I would use it over products that most hotels leave in their bathrooms, but I would choose other conditioners first, if I had a choice, at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter since it is sulfate free to help with her dandruff and it may be good for that, however I will likely never find out because the smell from this shampoo is making me have an allergic reaction even being in the same room as my daughter now after she has used this (once).  My eyes burn, my lungs get tight and I start to get a sore throat.  I don&#x27;t know what they put in this but I can&#x27;t be around it.  Awful.</li>
