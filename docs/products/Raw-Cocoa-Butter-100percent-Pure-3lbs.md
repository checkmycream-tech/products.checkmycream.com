      <li>The nurses where my daughter works love it and are always wanting more!</li>
      <li>Nice product, as advertised, excellent for soap making use, and a really good price compared to other sites.  </li>
      <li>All that would be fine, but it didn&#x27;t have ANY scent at all when the bag was opened!</li>
      <li>Great quality and fast shipping</li>
      <li>I will reorder when I need more.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of it, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
      <li>it was in simply by the wonderful scent of cocoa butter!  </li>
      <li>Love how my skin feels after applying this product.</li>
      <li>May be fine for skin applications...?</li>
      <li>The packaging was very secure and good enough to keep the cocoa butter until it&#x27;s ready for use, was very clean and smooth feel.</li>
      <li>Rich and creamy when you rub it on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Good solid cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>So after I&#x27;d gotten in the swing of making chocolate I wanted more and this only cost a bit more for three pounds than the original order.  </li>
      <li>However, if you want to make high quality chocolate with it, is even better.</li>
      <li>is not add easy to apply but when you do get it on if it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to make chocolate yet with it but am worried that even the mellow lovely Trader Joe&#x27;s raw cocoa may not be able to give my chocolate the rich flavor I got from the other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Raw cocoa butter was a great buy, I told my friends and also send them a picture.</li>
      <li>:) Could just use it daily by itself!</li>
      <li>What I ordered is exactly what I wanted for the bees wax cream that I make.  </li>
      <li>I really like how it is in chunks</li>
      <li>and I use it on my whole family.we</li>
      <li>use it for our skin and our hair.it can be used for the whole body</li>
      <li>I will update if I find a way to get good results, but I fear that the handling and packaging ruined the delicate balance of health benefits in the cocoa butter...</li>
      <li>This will last an average person a good while.</li>
      <li>This stuff is super handy since it is already broken into a bunch of chunks and smaller pieces.  </li>
      <li>I use this cocoa butter to make my all natural cocoa butter!  </li>
      <li>my first order and definitely not my last!</li>
      <li>It is so soft and creamy also!</li>
      <li>The description made it SOUND like just like the other cocoa butter!  </li>
      <li>I was extremely surprised by the individual packing; each pound was in a separate sealed package that will help with the life span of my cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>As expected and fast shipping</li>
      <li>Many of the bags had broken.  </li>
      <li>I normally hesitate to shop on line because the wit time of a product you have paid for is ridiculous, but I was immediately so exciting when the very next day my package was delivered!</li>

<li> When it arrived at the same time as several other packages it was obvious which package</li>

<li> My first order of raw cocoa butter came in a two pound block in a silver heavy duty ziploc bag and smelled heavenly of chocolate when opened!  </li>
<li> When it finally came it was loosely bagged in thin CLEAR plastic in irregular blocks that had banged around in transit and one had splintered until half the block was a powder!  </li>
<li> I melted down in the microwave with some shea butter</li>
<li> I could care less about anything else.  </li>
<li> I am not sure what this is, but it isn&#x27;t Raw Cocoa Butter 100%.  </li>
<li> Nasty, soft, mushy and no cocoa butter scent at all.  </li>
<li> This is false advertising and wrong.</li>
<li> I am afraid to use it because I don&#x27;t know what it is!  </li>
<li> :-(  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
<li> It is terribly tempting to just eat this stuff!  </li>

    <li> I am used to shea butter. This was good but I do prefer the shea. is not add easy to apply but when you do get it on if it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Raw cocoa butter was a great buy, I told my friends and also send them a picture.</li>
    <li> My first order of raw cocoa butter came in a two pound block in a silver heavy duty ziploc bag and smelled heavenly of chocolate when opened!  So after I&#x27;d gotten in the swing of making chocolate I wanted more and this only cost a bit more for three pounds than the original order.  The description made it SOUND like just like the other cocoa butter!  When it finally came it was loosely bagged in thin CLEAR plastic in irregular blocks that had banged around in transit and one had splintered until half the block was a powder!  All that would be fine, but it didn&#x27;t have ANY scent at all when the bag was opened! :-(  I&#x27;d taken a risk and not ordered a prime item so it would have been a hassle to return so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I haven&#x27;t tried to make chocolate yet with it but am worried that even the mellow lovely Trader Joe&#x27;s raw cocoa may not be able to give my chocolate the rich flavor I got from the other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m disappointed.  I will update if I find a way to get good results, but I fear that the handling and packaging ruined the delicate balance of health benefits in the cocoa butter...May be fine for skin applications...?</li>
    <li> What I ordered is exactly what I wanted for the bees wax cream that I make.  I&#x27;ll use this site when I reorder.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super handy since it is already broken into a bunch of chunks and smaller pieces.  I love the smell and feel of it, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Everything was as described.&lt;br /&gt;Got three bags of cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t weight them but I am happy with the product. it appeared to be three pounds.&lt;br /&gt;The product looked just like the picture.</li>
    <li> my product was of great quality. I was extremely surprised by the individual packing; each pound was in a separate sealed package that will help with the life span of my cocoa butter. I normally hesitate to shop on line because the wit time of a product you have paid for is ridiculous, but I was immediately so exciting when the very next day my package was delivered! my first order and definitely not my last!</li>
    <li> The packaging was very secure and good enough to keep the cocoa butter until it&#x27;s ready for use, was very clean and smooth feel. Loved it!</li>
    <li> Arrived looking like a bag of mashed potatos.</li>
    <li> (Janelle here)  This was delivered fast, and the product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> As expected and fast shipping</li>

    <li> Nice product, as advertised, excellent for soap making use, and a really good price compared to other sites.  I love my Prime shipping!!  Saves a bundle when you&#x27;re buying a lot of ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this and I absolutely love it I melted down in the microwave with some shea butter and I use it on my whole family.we use it for our skin and our hair.it can be used for the whole body</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping but again it was packaged with 5 pounds of shea butter and the box was all but opened. The bag had a slit in it and the butter was all over the inside of the box, I lost allot of the butter to the ground from the mailmans truck to my house</li>
    <li> The bags were loosely packed in a box.  Many of the bags had broken.  The product is great, but the packaging could have been better.</li>
    <li> I use this in my handmade soaps.  Very nice product.  Rich and creamy when you rub it on your skin.  Smells so good and a really great price.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. If you want to eat it as it is, its great also. However, if you want to make high quality chocolate with it, is even better.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what this is, but it isn&#x27;t Raw Cocoa Butter 100%.  I buy lots of cocoa butter, and this isn&#x27;t it.  I am afraid to use it because I don&#x27;t know what it is!  Nasty, soft, mushy and no cocoa butter scent at all.  It also only weight 2.14 lbs.</li>
    <li> Awesome butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for making body butters.</li>
    <li> Paid for 3 lbs only got 2.  I could care less about anything else.  This is false advertising and wrong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent quality cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> This Cocoa Butter arrived way before I thought it would. I opened the package, and my entire kitchen and living room smells of this heavenly cocoa scent!!! I really like how it is in chunks-It is easier for me to work with.  It is so soft and creamy also! :) Could just use it daily by itself!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great and melts easily for chocolate and lotion.</li>
    <li> I added this with Shea butter beautiful</li>
    <li> I bought this cocoa butter for soap making.  When it arrived at the same time as several other packages it was obvious which package it was in simply by the wonderful scent of cocoa butter!  It is terribly tempting to just eat this stuff!  It is working great in my soap recipes also, just 10% leaves a wonderful cocoa scent to the soap.</li>
