### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great shaver!</li>
      <li>I bought this Remington trimmer to replace an excellent Norelco beard trimmer that I had owned for 5 years.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps the best feature is the number of attachments you get with it.  </li>
      <li>So happy I found this!</li>
      <li>Perfect gift for my husband.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this razor / trimmer</li>
      <li>However, if you like the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look...this product is perfect.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>The seller was awesome, the product itself isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>It is ideal for my moustache, eyebrows and sideburns (and nose and ear hair, but let&#x27;s not go into that).  </li>
      <li>Works so great was a gift very pleased!</li>
      <li>To trim beards and hair this works great.  </li>
      <li>razor, the Remington PPC is great.  </li>
      <li>Great selection of attachments yet</li>
      <li>/&gt;It recharges and has great battery strength.  </li>
      <li>like I do this works great for them.</li>
      <li>great gift for your man</li>
      <li>of them have been great.  </li>
      <li>Works great good value</li>
      <li>The price was good for all the attachments</li>
      <li>Good quality, works well</li>
      <li>It looks nice on website, and comes with a great package.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather opt for one that is not cordless that is good quality.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good razor, which will extend the trips between the haircut</li>
      <li>and he was very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>but I guess they had some really nice trimmers before.</li>
      <li>If you have problems with the battery life, that&#x27;s your own fault.</li>
      <li>Was looking for replacement from an older model this is just perfect!!</li>
      <li>By far the best one I ever had.</li>
      <li>The beard trimmer has very fine adjustments on the comb that do not stay locked during use.  </li>
      <li>but if you have a light beard and will probably use it for light maintenance trims then this is a great buy.</li>
      <li>very cheap holder for this set, we had a remington set</li>
      <li>(i think thats what it is) before this model was much better.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer guards could be better.</li>
      <li>most of the times they were the types that were attached to a remington/braun razor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all better now and look like Andy Rooney (RIP) but</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s out of warranty.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, I liked the design of this groomer as well as the nice storage box.</li>
      <li>Anyway, my pg350 worked great for me, i might just get a new one.</li>
      <li>This is a good personal PRECISION timmer for a good price.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is very light and cheap feeling which leads me to believe that build quality and parts are not quite up to par with the Norelco or Wahl products.  </li>
      <li>This model has more attachments (and they&#x27;re more useful attachments!).  </li>
      <li>I would definitely buy it again  Very good value.</li>
      <li>Great product by a fine old company!</li>
      <li>A charge lasts for 5-8 weeks depending on usage and it recharges very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s real light and pretty durable.</li>
      <li>Although the unit worked fine for me, I did not like the design of the hair trimming attachments.  </li>
      <li>It felt cheap and wasn&#x27;t comfortable to hold.   </li>
      <li>should have returned it, but I just started chemotherapy treatments and trimming my eyebrows didn&#x27;t seem as important at the time.  </li>
      <li>My last Remington was great, but is now discontinued.</li>
      <li>It took me some time to fit it.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
      <li>I was actually surprised to see another review saying good things about this product.</li>
      <li>very powerful.</li>
      <li>this is the original model from Remington.</li>
      <li>wish I had just gotten the Norelco trimmer that I had originally asked for. :</li>
      <li>On most of them, the blades would move at first, but as soon as they hit one hair, they stopped.</li>
      <li>any rate, my groomer was well worth the money and is really easy to use, with the exception of that one attachment and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for trimming sideburns and mustaches, but trimming an entire beard takes longer than most trimmers.</li>
      <li>I rarely go for a \\&quot;clean</li>
      <li>Normally I&#x27;d give it 3 stars for \\&quot;mostly working\\&quot; but being nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For just about ANY product, the first charge is extremely important.</li>
      <li>This is my second time buying these trimmers and that&#x27;s because its sharp, precise, and excellent in aiding with a fade.</li>
      <li>so if you have a super thick beard or are used to some real nice trimmers then this is probably not the trimmer for you</li>
      <li>The adjustable beard trimmer works, but doesn&#x27;t have really useful settings.</li>
      <li>The main head attachments interchange easily and lock in well.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Have Fun.</li>
      <li>It says to charge it for 14-16 hours right when you get it.</li>
      <li>Every time I need to use it I need to predict ahead of time, charge it fully and then use it right away.</li>
      <li>But for a full beard trimmer, or hair trimmer, you should look for something bigger and more</li>
      <li>It is well worth it to pay a few more dollars and get a better quality product.</li>
      <li>I have used this regularly for a few months now and am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable, and if you let it charge overnight it keeps</li>
      <li>I am very very very upset with these deceptive sellers.</li>
      <li>The lubrication-free blades do work as advertised, remaining free of rust as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s ok at trimming, it did last almost 3 years, although with some frustrations.</li>
      <li>I would have rated this higher</li>
      <li>I personally love Remington products, especially this one because it does what I need.</li>
      <li>I use my for basic cleanup nothing more.</li>
      <li>I fear in the interest of profits, Remington made this far too cheaply and they have forfeited their reputation.</li>
      <li>The first charge sets the battery life.</li>
      <li>First of all, the attachments do not provide consistent lengths on your beard.  </li>
      <li>This happens even if you set the clip setting to #4 or #5 or even higher.  </li>
      <li>It slips and cuts hair much shorter than anticipated, and the teeth on the guard are far too fine.</li>
      <li>a good job for short facial</li>
      <li>I was used to trimming my beard down to a nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
      <li>Older models tended to collect dust and debries because the top was open.</li>
      <li>I have been very satisfied with the old groomer, and the new one seems to be equally satisfactory</li>
      <li>I too am online looking for a new trimmer because this Titanium is no longer even useful.  </li>
      <li>however, you have to hold it at a certain angle and go in a certain direction or else</li>
      <li>As soon as the blades began to dull a bit it went from being marginally ok for the cheap price to unuseable.</li>
      <li>go for this if you want a versatile groomer for light facial hair, at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>It can handle only light trimming.</li>
      <li>so i went with this one, very unsatified</li>
      <li>No it really didn&#x27;t meet my expectation</li>
      <li>The foliage attachment works really well</li>
      <li>However, I did need to buy a replacement attachment since it would go straight to level 1 (shortest) from wear and tear.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even get that much.</li>
      <li>This is very disapointing that its completly unusable because it&#x27;s so unreliable and you have no idea on how you&#x27;ll look when your done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband loves it and it was a replacement for a &amp;#34;tried and true&amp;#34; old Remington.  This model has more attachments (and they&#x27;re more useful attachments!).  A charge lasts for 5-8 weeks depending on usage and it recharges very quickly.  Great product by a fine old company!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible trimmer.  The battery lasts 5 minutes, and since you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in, you have to stop in the middle of trimming to wait for it to recharge.  It only cuts well when it&#x27;s fully charged, so unless you keep it plugged in 24/7, you will have to make several passes to trim anything.</li>
    <li> Wow, this has to be the worst trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I got this for Christmas and I feel bad that my father spent good money on this product.  The other reviews go into detail, I&#x27;ll just give my personal highlights.  The trimmer is very light and cheap feeling which leads me to believe that build quality and parts are not quite up to par with the Norelco or Wahl products.  It takes forever to charge and when it does charge it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;ve resorted to just using it plugged in all the time because even with a \\&quot;full\\&quot; charge it starts to slow down and choke by the end of one session.  Now you might think that this isn&#x27;t so bad?  The problem is the power adapter is so mediocre that it can&#x27;t supply enough juice to power the trimmer unless the battery is FULLY charged!  Case in point, I am standing here writing this review with my beard half trimmed because the battery died midway though, (while it was plugged in), and it didn&#x27;t have enough power to finish the job.  It must have a watch battery inside to supply power.  This is an absolute garbage product and Remington should be ashamed.  Even my old $20 Wahl trimmer was able to go a few weeks between charges and when it ran low was able to be completely powered by the wall adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had just gotten the Norelco trimmer that I had originally asked for. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tl;dr; Avoid this trimmer at all costs!  Battery and power adapter are sub-par.  Poor quality product.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product. The cover for the brush and replacable heads in the storage base is a nice touch. Older models tended to collect dust and debries because the top was open. I would have rated this higher but I don&#x27;t care for the way the charger plug mounts in the storage base. It seems a bit on the flimsy side and I&#x27;m not sure of the long term durability and reliability of the connection.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know this is a very low cost product, but it is total junk. If you happen to read any good reviews of it anywhere, they must be written by kids who have never enjoyed the high quality, robust beard trimmers of the past. I have had a beard for 25 years, so I have used up about 5 trimmers. My last Remington was great, but is now discontinued. This 7-in-1 has no quality whatsoever, and a terrible dime-store warped plastic design.  It is hard to say which is worse: the flimsey base, with a cheesey unreliable re-charge connector holder or the poorly designed, hopelessly cheap way the various attachments push-turn onto the handheld trimmer body. There is no snap-lock effect. Lastly, all the plastic heads are far too light and flimsey. I fear in the interest of profits, Remington made this far too cheaply and they have forfeited their reputation.</li>
    <li> The trimmer I was using before was stolen, so I decided to replace it with this one. I was used to trimming my beard down to a nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. The Remington can&#x27;t seem to do that. It can handle only light trimming. It certainly can&#x27;t trim down a full thick beard, it&#x27;s just too weak. Aside from that, it pulls hair constantly. Why in the world would they make a piece of crap like this?</li>
    <li> great gift for your man</li>
    <li> I was so excited expecting to see my Remington PG350, to my GREAT disappointment I received&lt;br /&gt;PG250 instead. I had paid for the PG350 model instead the seller sent me the PG250 model which  is cheaper than what I paid for. I am very very very upset with these deceptive sellers. No explanation was indicated in the package. I cannot write a review on the PG350 cause I never got it. Shame on you deceptive sellers!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this Remington trimmer to replace an excellent Norelco beard trimmer that I had owned for 5 years.  I could not find the same Norelco trimmer locally for replacement.  I was attracted to this Remington trimmer by the other trimming features that it offered and its smaller size.  Boy, was that a mistake!  The beard trimmer has very fine adjustments on the comb that do not stay locked during use.  They slip all the time by getting caught in the beard hairs and then it slips.  If you are not careful, you will end up shaving your beard at a much lower setting as happened this past week.  Net, I would not recommend this trimmer to anyone.  I just bought a Norelco single function beard trimmer on Amazon today and this Remington trimmer is going into the trash!</li>
    <li> It got there before I was expecting it, as it works I think it&#x27;s fantastic, I&#x27;ve had no problems with it it works up to my expectation.</li>
    <li> Remington&#x27;s cost cutting went a little too far with this model.  My main complaint is that the trimmer is very flimsy and cheaply made.  It lasted a few months before the plastic trimmer attachment broke.  Once I started using this, I knew it was only a matter of time before it broke.  Also, the plastic base/holster is just pointless.  If you&#x27;re looking for a beard trimmer, you should probably keep looking.</li>
    <li> I have used this regularly for a few months now and am very happy with it.  The unit is conveniently small, is easy to use and has proved reliable.  Perhaps the best feature is the number of attachments you get with it.  There is a holder for all the parts, and its footprint is very small, which is important for a typically crowded bathroom vanity top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are however, a couple of problems with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not up to the task of serious hair trimming and does not look robust enough to deal with thick beards.  It is ideal for my moustache, eyebrows and sideburns (and nose and ear hair, but let&#x27;s not go into that).  But for a full beard trimmer, or hair trimmer, you should look for something bigger and more specialized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is that the recharge connector does not easily fit into the holder.  It took me some time to fit it.  I am puzzled that Remington couldn&#x27;t get such a simple thing right.  It is after all just a simple plastic catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go for this if you want a versatile groomer for light facial hair, at a reasonable price.  Avoid it if you want a heavy-duty hair or beard trimmer or if you can imagine having to reconnect the charger from time to time.</li>
    <li> I personally love Remington products, especially this one because it does what I need. The foliage attachment works really well and yea, I do need to use the short hair attachment to get a stray hair but it beats using a razor! I use the attachment as my body trimmer and that works well. However, I did need to buy a replacement attachment since it would go straight to level 1 (shortest) from wear and tear. Got it off the Remington website for $4 bucks so can&#x27;t complain too much about that. It&#x27;s real light and pretty durable. If you have problems with the battery life, that&#x27;s your own fault. It says to charge it for 14-16 hours right when you get it. For just about ANY product, the first charge is extremely important. The first charge sets the battery life. Meaning, say you only charged it for 7 hours, you will only get half as much of the possible charge permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see alot of complains for those with long / thick beards and I can definitely see how this wouldn&#x27;t work well. However, if you like the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look...this product is perfect. Using the foliage attachment for you entire face will take a quality amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I got this item for WAY less than 44 bucks. I got it at a place which starts with T and ends with GET. Think I paid 25 bucks two years ago.</li>
    <li> Battery life is very very very poor. It was a waste of time and money spent buying this product, am not covinced this is the original model from Remington.</li>
    <li> The beard trimming aspect did not do the job.  All it did was cut to the skin, not to the length wanted..</li>
    <li> Buy the Remington P6-6025, same exact razor, but only $15!  Both versions will die on you after a year and a half, but at $15 it&#x27;s disposable.  Note well, I am a heavy shaver, every two days or even every day.  SO if you shave less it will last you longer.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of razor/trimmers throughout the years... most of the times they were the types that were attached to a remington/braun razor.  Little flip up affairs that trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of them have been great.  Some of them have been okay, or average... but none of them have been AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor, the Remington PPC is great.  It has multi attachments that firmly snap into place.  And it cost under 20 dollars.  The razor attachments all work well, but some of them work extremely well, and overall this is quite a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It recharges and has great battery strength.  If you are looking for a good razor, which will extend the trips between the haircut (I don&#x27;t plan on going to the barber for quite some time)...  BUY THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have Fun.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my old groomer of the same brand.  I have been very satisfied with the old groomer, and the new one seems to be equally satisfactory</li>
    <li> The only reason that I am writing this review is because I am on line now looking for a new trimmer.  I bought this \\&quot;gem\\&quot; less than a year ago and was not satisfied then.  Tonight, I&#x27;m trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out.  The extra cutting heads are all but worthless.  I would never recommend this P.O.S to anybody. &lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Perfect gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> Bought for son-in-law-had no complaints, so I guess it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver, PG250, for some time now. The price was good for all the attachments and I see it in stores all the time now. With that said, I&#x27;m finding it very difficult to locate a replacement screen &amp; foil for the little shaver that comes with it. The trimmers are sharp enough but, the length adjustment keeps slipping and thus cuts my hair to short. I like that it&#x27;s rechargable not a battery you have to replace affter every shave.</li>
    <li> Ouch.  This trimmer is not very useful however I did not really expect much for the price. I have used it a couple times for some basic personal grooming but it can not provide a close or comfortable shave at all.</li>
    <li> It looks nice on website, and comes with a great package.  The product does not cut well, motor speed is not stable.  Great selection of attachments yet Remington needs to improve the blades and motor on this product.</li>
    <li> I was given this trimmer as a gift.  I would never recommend buying it.  First of all, the attachments do not provide consistent lengths on your beard.  If you change, even slightly, the angle you are holding the trimmer, you also change the length of the beard you are trimming.  Second, the small trimmer does not work for me at all.  It won&#x27;t cut my beard.  I have a thickish beard, but I&#x27;ve met plenty of people with thicker, I guess its only for 14 year olds.  The large trimmer works well, but its attachment doesn&#x27;t cut short enough for the beard that I - and most people not named Santa - am going for.</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised to see another review saying good things about this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I went to use it after letting it charge up, none of the heads would work except for the nose trimmer. On most of them, the blades would move at first, but as soon as they hit one hair, they stopped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a top quality trimmer for the price, but I was at least expecting something that basically did the job. I didn&#x27;t even get that much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he likes to keep his facial hair trimmed and I found this product.  The price is very reasonable, and if you let it charge overnight it keeps it&#x27;s charge  long enough to perform whatever function you need it to do. I was surprised to see other customers who were dissatisfied with the product.  My husband loves it and I am buying one for my grown son for his birthday.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a year, it works well on the face and neck so long as you hold it at a good angle, it hasnt broken in a years time, however it battery life has gone down the tubes, after a full 24 hours charging i get about 10-15 mins use before it starts snagging and pulling hair out, WARNING not at all suited for shaving below the neck line!</li>
    <li> Works great good value</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m with J. Herr on this one.  This product is terrible.  The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;attachments are very weak when used.  When you switch attachments,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it sounds like you are about to rip the thing apart before they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;come free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand, to store everything, and charge it, is worthless.  I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really can&#x27;t express myself completely on this item because I was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so frustrated with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 day guarantee.  I&#x27;m getting my money back.</li>
    <li> I too am online looking for a new trimmer because this Titanium is no longer even useful.  It has always tended to pull hair even to the point of feeling like it has built in tweezers yanking hairs out.  The nose hair and shaver attachments were always worthless.  Battery life was decent.  As soon as the blades began to dull a bit it went from being marginally ok for the cheap price to unuseable.</li>
    <li> The interchangeable attachments this product boasts set a high bar, one which unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is kind of mediocre… the long-hair trimmer works, if a bit unevenly. The adjustable beard trimmer works, but doesn&#x27;t have really useful settings. The lubrication-free blades do work as advertised, remaining free of rust as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest caveat? This product doesn&#x27;t run while plugged into the charger, which means that when the rechargeable battery&#x27;s life inevitably declines, you will find yourself unable to trim your entire beard on a dwindling charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy something that runs in corded mode as well.</li>
    <li> It broke after 2 months.</li>
    <li> Unlike several other reviewers, I loved this trimmer for 5 months.  At that time the rechargeable battery just died completely, would not recharge at all, and the Remington people are useless when filing a complaint</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t hold a charge at all. Every time I need to use it I need to predict ahead of time, charge it fully and then use it right away.</li>
    <li> I have only one complaint about this product and that is the screen attachment that doesn&#x27;t seem to do so well, but that could be from lack of experience, as I get better at using the groomer all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other attachments work very well and the little box keeps all the attachments handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t attach the cord properly to the base, you&#x27;ll go crazy trying to get it to charge.  It&#x27;s not hard to do, but it must be done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, however, mine is a PG-250, even though it appears to be identical to the picture, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a typo or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, my groomer was well worth the money and is really easy to use, with the exception of that one attachment and like I said, It could be that I&#x27;m just not using it correctly.</li>
    <li> Pro: &lt;br /&gt;Fancy looking. &lt;br /&gt;Nice storage. &lt;br /&gt;Rechargable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Con: &lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful. &lt;br /&gt;Poor for rough beards.</li>
    <li> I actually ended up here because i am looking for a replacement charger for my Remington PG 350.  I really do not know why people are really unhappy with this product but I guess they had some really nice trimmers before. Anyway, my pg350 worked great for me, i might just get a new one. It is not high end so if you have a super thick beard or are used to some real nice trimmers then this is probably not the trimmer for you but if you have a light beard and will probably use it for light maintenance trims then this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> My always faithful Remington MB-40 died after 10 years of weekly use, so I picked up this set as a replacement.  The guard wasn&#x27;t very useful and the beard hair slipped under it, cutting way too close.   It felt cheap and wasn&#x27;t comfortable to hold.   It also completely jammed several times and pulling it apart to clear it was difficult.    The hair clippers or other attachments might work, but this was unusable for me and I wish I could have my MB-40 working.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift 3 years ago. I rarely go for a \\&quot;clean shave\\&quot; look, which is good for this trimmer because a clean shave is nearly impossible. It&#x27;s pretty good for trimming sideburns and mustaches, but trimming an entire beard takes longer than most trimmers. My biggest disappointment was with the battery; it only charges while the trimmer is not in use. So if you need a quick trimm job and forgot to leave the trimmer on the charger, you were out of luck and had to wait a half hour for the trimmer to charge itself. And after a year or two, the battery barely held a charge. I put up with it for nearly 3 years until something on the inside broke while I was using it, causing it to no longer hold any of the trimmer pieces in place. I give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s ok at trimming, it did last almost 3 years, although with some frustrations.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old Remington of the same model. Old one lasted me 6 years of heavy use, I hope this does as well.</li>
    <li> If you look through all my reviews, you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m usually happy with what I get, and rarely post a bad review.    I bought this as a replacement for my [[ASIN:B0015MN3NS Remington Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer]].  I used the predecessor to that model for 3 years until I carelessly dropped it and broke the trimmer head.  I now have one on order to replace this piece of junk.    Pros:    * Lots of trimmer head choices.    * The single \\&quot;foil\\&quot; head is half the width of a regular razor, and works well to trim small spots.    * The main head attachments interchange easily and lock in well.    * Cordless    Cons:    * The body uses a rotary attachment connector, and the trimmer blades are slooooo[...]  This causes:  -----&gt; Pulled hair  -----&gt; Excruciatingly long trimming time.  -----&gt; Inability to cut through thick hair (I wear a full beard.)    * The \\&quot;length adjustment\\&quot; heads are cheap plastic snap on attachments over the cutting blade.  Hard to remove, and will probably break sooner rather than later.    * The \\&quot;long hair\\&quot; trimmer won&#x27;t cut shorter than 1/4\\&quot; without removing the guide attachment.  The \\&quot;short beard\\&quot; trimmer won&#x27;t cut longer than about 1/8\\&quot; at the tallest setting.  I guess they think that you either want a long beard, or a super short one.      **************    Final Thoughts:    I&#x27;ve already got my order in for the trimmer I mentioned above.  This was a waste of the money I spent.  It looked like the best option when I was in the store, but after I tried it I found out just how bad it was.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying these trimmers and that&#x27;s because its sharp, precise, and excellent in aiding with a fade.</li>
    <li> No it really didn&#x27;t meet my expectation</li>
    <li> Good quality, works well</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my dad on fathers day.  the damn thing would not hold a charge tryed to charge it twice. by the time i got around to returning it for him the 30 day period was over and now i am stuck with the p.o.s.</li>
    <li> Battery does not &amp;#34;hold up&amp;#34;. After 6 mos. the battery would not take a charge.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete waste of money. It is well worth it to pay a few more dollars and get a better quality product. I tried to pinch pennies here and have regretted it ever since.  It doesnt hold a charge, I have kept it oiled and it locks up on me, a couple of the attachments are useless.  Honestly the only thing that was decent was sideburn trimmer, and that was only when it worked.</li>
    <li> This is total trash. The guards dont stay locked in place so if you have it set to 4 next thing you know its on 0 and you have a bald patch and uneven hair length. This is very disapointing that its completly unusable because it&#x27;s so unreliable and you have no idea on how you&#x27;ll look when your done.</li>
    <li> Excelent. As expected. I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> This is easily the worst beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used. It slips and cuts hair much shorter than anticipated, and the teeth on the guard are far too fine.</li>
    <li> On the positive side, I liked the design of this groomer as well as the nice storage box. I did not experience any problem with attaching/removing attachments, like other reviewers have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In terms of actually using this groomer for trimming, I&#x27;m quite disappointed. I bought this trimmer hoping to trim my beard very short. It seems that the spacers are not meant to be used with a short beard, since they do not trim it. On the other hand, using the trimmer without any spacer, almost shaves my beard completely and that is not what I want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another major drawback with this groomer is that the battery drains too quickly. More importantly, when the battery is empty, even if the groomer is attached to a wall socket it does not bypass the battery but rather tries to recharge it again which is of course hopeless when using the trimmer.</li>
    <li> The model PG-100 (i think thats what it is) before this model was much better.  The trimmer on this one sucks.  I trim with the clip setting on #3, however, you have to hold it at a certain angle and go in a certain direction or else it will cut at the #1 setting.  This happens even if you set the clip setting to #4 or #5 or even higher.  With the model before this (and with other trimmers that I have used), you could shave at any angle and go any direction and it would trim at whatever setting you put it on.  The shaver works well enough for something at the $15 price range.</li>
    <li> This is a good personal PRECISION timmer for a good price. I use it almost every day, the foil shaver and the small timmer do short work of any stubble and short facial hair. I cannot comment on the nose hair timmer that much, but it seemed to do a poor job when i tried it twice. Also the big timmer is overkill for me but should serve its&#x27; purpose. I will agree with the others about the attachments for beards as they do tend to slide back to ther lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job for short facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not for longer facial hair, beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes hard to connect to the power cable if used with the base.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments and nose trimmer not very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great of you like a sandpaper stubble or getting rid of facial hair all together, if you have a beard and like to keep it well/pro groomed then look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My wife got me this. It worked \\&quot;all right\\&quot; for about a year. The wire mesh shaver didn&#x27;t really work, even when stubble was very short. But the main reason I got it was to trim my mustache and goatee, and it did so. Frequently the little fragments of my mustache would fly up into my eyes, which was horrible, but I&#x27;m not sure is the trimmer&#x27;s fault. Normally I&#x27;d give it 3 stars for \\&quot;mostly working\\&quot; but being nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is that the battery died after about a year. The light still glows green like it&#x27;s fully charged, and if I take off the attachments I can see the little motor spinning when I switch it on. But it&#x27;s not powerful enough to actually power any of the attachments. In short, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way to open it up and replace the battery. There&#x27;s no way to fix it. Only thing left to do is throw it away, which I will be doing as soon as I finish writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I really that unreasonable to expect to not have to buy a brand new $20 trimmer every year? If I buy a $40 one will it only last 2 years?</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few years ago to replace another similar product from another company.  Although the unit worked fine for me, I did not like the design of the hair trimming attachments.  I thought the two hair trimming attachments were too bulky and did not let me get close enough to trim hairs near the intersections of my nose &amp; cheeks or ear lobes and neck.  Although it cut facial hair fine, I would not buy this unit again due to the design issues that I mentioned.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this! Was looking for replacement from an older model this is just perfect!! Amazon thank you for having this item! Works so great was a gift very pleased!</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. The actual trimmer head is very narrow. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. You can charge it over night but the minute you unplug it, it works for about 30 seconds. I&#x27;d rather opt for one that is not cordless that is good quality.</li>
    <li> I have 2 homes and this is the 2nd. unit I have purchased. Although some reviews may show the consumer is unhappy, consider the cost. I use my for basic cleanup nothing more. Dont expect this unit to meet the standards of a Beauty Parlor. The battery on my 1st. one is 2 yrs. old and still has decent power for my needs.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this razor / trimmer</li>
    <li> This replaced two old electric grooming sets I had; Norelco and Remington. By far the best one I ever had. Used it for over 4 months now. No issues.</li>
    <li> Have had this item for 2 years now - still charges well, blades still sharp - use it to trim my beard and cut what little hair I have on my head    recently bought one for a friend and he likes it too.    highly recommended - you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I would like this if the battery would hold a charge, but even from day 1 the battery only lasted a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I should have returned it, but I just started chemotherapy treatments and trimming my eyebrows didn&#x27;t seem as important at the time.  I&#x27;m all better now and look like Andy Rooney (RIP) but the battery only last a few seconds and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s out of warranty.</li>
    <li> Battery life is nonexistent, even when not using! I unplugged it from the charger an hour before I needed it and it was already DEAD!!! Last use after immediately taking it off charger it didn&#x27;t last long enough to trim my beard. I have another, older Remington that is the complete opposite, it goes 4 to 5 complete trims without needing a charge. They really got this one wrong.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> Had trouble assembling the charger base to the charger. Finally gave up and just pugged the charger directly into the unit and it works fine. Remington needs an improvement  to the charger and base assembly that works.... Jimbo</li>
    <li> Some of the attachments were broken and wasn&#x27;t package correctly.</li>
    <li> the item will not hold a charge. must be old on shelf and the batteries went too long without getting used</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son-in-law and he was very pleased with it.  I would definitely buy it again  Very good value.</li>
    <li> We ordered this to replace one that we had for  a few years.  The whole family uses it.  To trim beards and hair this works great.  When you have 3 teenagers like I do this works great for them.</li>
    <li> The seller was awesome, the product itself isn&#x27;t that great. The trimmer guards could be better. You have to change guards if you want hair shorter than a quarter inch but then the shorter guard isn&#x27;t like you think so you have to learn to use the trimmer in a different manner. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this model again. I had a Philips before this but didn&#x27;t like how they looked and figured this would work the same since it had the hair trimmer attachment. No so.</li>
    <li> very cheap holder for this set, we had a remington set and i could not find one like it so i went with this one, very unsatified</li>
    <li> Works as advertised... The stand is a piece of junk</li>
    <li> Bought this in November.  Stopped working last week.</li>
