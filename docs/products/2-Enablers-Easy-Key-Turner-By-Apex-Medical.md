      <li>She&#x27;d loved them and they are easy for her to use.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY this product, It is very cheaply made and the keys wiggle around in it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are tactile and curved so they are perfect for people with autism, dyspraxia, apraxia or especially dyscalculia as there is a tactile cue on which way to insert and turn the key.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Supplier should describe and spec it better.</li>
      <li>THE POSTAGE WILL COST MORE THAN PRODUCT ITSELF.</li>
      <li>FLIMSY NON FITTING</li>
      <li>It was easy for more able users.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I saw these!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are cheap plastic, I paid four dollars for mine and would not pay more</li>
      <li>However, I can easily write on each with a permanent marker if I need to.</li>
      <li>Works great on a lock who&#x27;s key freely rotates.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>But beware of their cheap quality and work with that.</li>
      <li>This my sound like a lot of work</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t fit with patio door.</li>
      <li>They are cheap pieces of plastic that snap when folded, as they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t fit all keys well.</li>
      <li>they dont fit square keys</li>
      <li>So word to the wise, if you are purchasing these for use in your automobile, make sure that the ignition switch is flat and not curved as these will not work with the curved switches.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product for people like my friend who was going through cancer treatment and did not have the strength and fine motor skills to use her key.</li>
      <li>these snap right off!</li>
      <li>Its true</li>
      <li>However, they break quickly.  </li>
      <li>Actually others in my family have really liked them as well</li>
      <li>She says they aren&#x27;t useful.  </li>
      <li>the end results were well worth the effort.</li>
      <li>Have fun shopping here.</li>
      <li>the price is right.</li>
      <li>I can find THE key easily and have the door unlocked quickly.</li>
      <li>Makes it super easy to open the door.</li>
      <li>I was finally able to find a much better key holder with a flashlight built in at my local hardware store.</li>
      <li>should have known better when my husband put the key in and it rattled around the inside.</li>
      <li>The ignition switch and the Enablers Easy Key Turner were not compatible.  </li>
      <li>The Easy Key Turner worked great for my Mom, she was having trouble starting her car because of arthritis in her hand and wrist.</li>
      <li>I found this to be a nice little device.</li>
      <li>I put one of them on her house key and it works great for turning the door knob and the dead bolt.</li>
      <li>Had a problem and resolved fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Bought them and tossed them out....would have cost too much to return.</li>
      <li>My lock can be very snug at times, but I&#x27;ve not had any problems.</li>
      <li>Unlike some reviewers, I found that my house key fits comfortably, with a minimum of slippage.</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>Fast arrival for all quality appearance?..</li>
      <li>I did have to modify the key to fit properly in the Easy Key Turner and this would not work with the newer ignition keys because the newer cars have electronic components embedded in the top part of the key that I had to modify.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more for other office keys.</li>
      <li>Luckily it was sticking out enough to do this.</li>
      <li>I use these daily and love that I can manipulate the key.  </li>
      <li>If there&#x27;s a &#x27;normal&#x27; size round hole in the top the key may not work, or if the top of the key is large or square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This device really helps my 90 year old mom.</li>
      <li>The hardware person will give you the right key.</li>
      <li>However,  the main reason these were purchased was for my mother (who suffers from arthritis) to be able to better crank her van easier.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very thankful that someone was smart enough to come up with this product.</li>
      <li>It is one of  the things that allow her to still live in her house by herself.</li>
      <li>With the Easy Key Turner I can open the locks with no trouble at all.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a peg in the middle of this device designed to fit through the hole of a key.  </li>
      <li>Kind of hard to get on the key to start with.</li>
      <li>it does not show the thing on a key ring, it does not show the inside if the product and does not show that there are no holes to really put the thing on a keyring.</li>
      <li>In addition, even if it did fit her key, there was no hole in the head of the sheath to hang the key on her key ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My only suggestion is because the key turner works so well, don&#x27;t use a cheap key, I broke one of those flimsy keys in moments.</li>
      <li>It IS very large, so it has made it impossible for me to put my key ring into any but the largest of coat pockets, but  I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
      <li>The only thing was, some of her keys did not fit into it as the tab snaps around the head of the key, so I had to do a little creative carving of the enabler.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This device really helps my 90 year old mom. It is one of  the things that allow her to still live in her house by herself.</li>
    <li> I thought I would do a review of these key turners since I just bought a pair. Its true they dont fit square keys but I found that there is a small plastic knob on the inside in which I pressed into the keyring hole on my keys and they sit in there securely.&lt;br /&gt;They are cheap plastic, I paid four dollars for mine and would not pay more but they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;I NEED adaptive keys and for me these are a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;They are tactile and curved so they are perfect for people with autism, dyspraxia, apraxia or especially dyscalculia as there is a tactile cue on which way to insert and turn the key.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any of the above disorders(which I do) these key turners will work for you. But beware of their cheap quality and work with that. They are also hard to get onto the keyring because of the sheer size of the holes on the sides of the turners so you will need help with that(I used a credit card to hold the keyring open).</li>
    <li> These are just not made for car keys. Way too small for my door keys also. Bought them and tossed them out....would have cost too much to return.</li>
    <li> This enabler does not fit overe the newer car keys with jacketes on them.  It also does not fit normal enry keys to my house.</li>
    <li> the handle of one of the enablers broke off the key, leaving me unable to get into my office.  i found them of limited value for tough keyholes and even for relatively easy ones.</li>
    <li> I have neuropathy in my hands and sometimes metal keys are almost impossible for me to turn. With the Easy Key Turner I can open the locks with no trouble at all. I&#x27;m very thankful that someone was smart enough to come up with this product. I bought a set for my Mother-in law, Father-in-law and my sister.</li>
    <li> I bought this key adapter, as I have rheumatoid arthritis and a door that is hard to open normally. My hand therapist gave me a plastic that I can mold around my keys to adapt the length and width of the key. It was ugly. So when I saw this \\&quot;enabler\\&quot; I thought, well that is lower profile and not too bad of a price.&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better when my husband put the key in and it rattled around the inside. After maybe 20 uses my key broke off in my front door lock! Not a happy girl! And what a waste of money and my poor husband had to pick the key out of the lock. Luckily it was sticking out enough to do this. If it were a single disabled person, they would have had to pay for someone to fix that!&lt;br /&gt;I think that this is not a well enough thought out product. The physics should have been a longer key helper. Amazon has these. I am purchasing one of those instead.[[ASIN:B001368PYS Key Turner Hole-In-One]]</li>
    <li> bought for a friend.  She says they aren&#x27;t useful.  Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described A+ Purchased for a gift.</li>
    <li> I wish this had worked but for my key, my hands and my door it just didn&#x27;t do the trick. I finally found something else that helps. None of the key holders I found here did what I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Difficult for a senior with arthritis to use; awkward. Not as good as I hoped. It was easy for more able users.</li>
    <li> These are a great idea but they don&#x27;t fit all keys well. For my keys I had to drill a new hole to hold the key in place and run a small cable tie through it to keep the key in place. I also had to use some J B Weld to hold my other key in place inside the thing. THEN I had to drill another hole above the key to place it on my keyring as the only other option is to put your key on the ring by the hole on either side of the wing and that makes it difficult to turn the key in the lock! Notice in the picture it does not show the thing on a key ring, it does not show the inside if the product and does not show that there are no holes to really put the thing on a keyring. Great idea but needs revision! Good thing the price is right.</li>
    <li> These Key Turners both broke in the same place. I contacted the merchant and got no response from them. I got a refund from Amazon for them. They are cheap pieces of plastic that snap when folded, as they&#x27;re supposed to be. Bought another product else where. Won&#x27;t be ordering from Apex again because they don&#x27;t respond to their customers.</li>
    <li> This key turner did not fit the head of my mother&#x27;s key.  She has a square-headed key, and it did not fit into the plastic sheath.  In addition, even if it did fit her key, there was no hole in the head of the sheath to hang the key on her key ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a standard key, it might work, but this device definitely does NOT work with square-headed keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money, and I am sad about that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Eliminates a lot of the pain when arthritis is bothering your hands, easing the  pain involved in opening doors with a key.</li>
    <li> My only suggestion is because the key turner works so well, don&#x27;t use a cheap key, I broke one of those flimsy keys in moments. The hardware person will give you the right key.</li>
    <li> I use these daily and love that I can manipulate the key.  However, they break quickly.  I thought I was getting bright pink but got an ugly white and yellow.</li>
    <li> Key keeps moving so can,t turn lock. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom because she has a hard time getting the key to turn in the door.  She&#x27;d loved them and they are easy for her to use.  Actually others in my family have really liked them as well and everyone&#x27;s ask where I purchased them because they want some too!  Great tool!</li>
    <li> Works great on a lock who&#x27;s key freely rotates. If you have a sticky and hard to move key these snap right off!</li>
    <li> Comfy.....pretty.....durable . Use it daily and recommend this to purchase. Fast arrival for all quality appearance?.. Have fun shopping here. They have good customer service. Had a problem and resolved fast. Thanks</li>
    <li> These work very well. Wish it came in a variety of colors. Will be ordering more for other office keys.</li>
    <li> The Easy Key Turner worked great for my Mom, she was having trouble starting her car because of arthritis in her hand and wrist. I did have to modify the key to fit properly in the Easy Key Turner and this would not work with the newer ignition keys because the newer cars have electronic components embedded in the top part of the key that I had to modify. I then had to epoxy the key into the Key Turner to hold it in place. This my sound like a lot of work but it really wasn&#x27;t that bad and the end results were well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I no longer have a lot of strength in my hands. This isn&#x27;t perfect but it does help some. Kind of hard to get on the key to start with.</li>
    <li> FLIMSY NON FITTING AND WHEN YOU SEND IT BACK THE POSTAGE WILL COST MORE THAN PRODUCT ITSELF. Just dont buy it</li>
    <li> . DO NOT BUY this product, It is very cheaply made and the keys wiggle around in it. It is difficult to get off also (in order to use a better product). I was finally able to find a much better key holder with a flashlight built in at my local hardware store. I would not recommend this product to anyone, it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> will not work on car keys. they are to thick. works on door key thickness only. add should point that out</li>
    <li> I found this to be a nice little device. Unlike some reviewers, I found that my house key fits comfortably, with a minimum of slippage. My lock can be very snug at times, but I&#x27;ve not had any problems. It IS very large, so it has made it impossible for me to put my key ring into any but the largest of coat pockets, but  I&#x27;m okay with that. I can find THE key easily and have the door unlocked quickly. I was a little disappointed in that the picture and ad suggested 2 colors in the set, but both of mine are white. However, I can easily write on each with a permanent marker if I need to.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for people like my friend who was going through cancer treatment and did not have the strength and fine motor skills to use her key. The only thing was, some of her keys did not fit into it as the tab snaps around the head of the key, so I had to do a little creative carving of the enabler.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a peg in the middle of this device designed to fit through the hole of a key.  Unfortunately, the peg is too large for my mom&#x27;s house key so the item is worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check your keys!  If there&#x27;s a &#x27;normal&#x27; size round hole in the top the key may not work, or if the top of the key is large or square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea.  Badly designed and cheaply made, so it ended up useless to me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold key securely,so the key slides around and fails to unlock the door. Would not recommend,. When they say &amp;#34;fits standard key&amp;#34; they mean a ROUND top key. If you have a square headed key this will not fit.</li>
    <li> The concept is great!  I was so excited when I saw these!  However,  the main reason these were purchased was for my mother (who suffers from arthritis) to be able to better crank her van easier.  The ignition switch and the Enablers Easy Key Turner were not compatible.  This is my fault for not checking and researching things before I made the purchase.  So word to the wise, if you are purchasing these for use in your automobile, make sure that the ignition switch is flat and not curved as these will not work with the curved switches.  Otherwise,  they would work great.  I put one of them on her house key and it works great for turning the door knob and the dead bolt.</li>
    <li> The enabler does not allow the key to be fully inserted into the lock.  We can not unlock our doors when the enabler is installed!</li>
    <li> I have used these before. Last for years on key, and are sturdy. But I screwed up - doesn&#x27;t fit with patio door. Will have to figure a way to jerry-rig</li>
    <li> immensely helpful.  Makes it super easy to open the door. I don&#x27;t like being forced to write a certain number of words.</li>
    <li> Does not fit all keys.  Would not buy product again.  Wanted to use on a normal front door key but does not fit.  Supplier should describe and spec it better.</li>
