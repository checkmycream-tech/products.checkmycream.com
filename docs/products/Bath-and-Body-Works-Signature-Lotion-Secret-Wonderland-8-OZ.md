      <li>Great for covering up the scent of self pleasure and regret.</li>
      <li>I need to buy more of this!!</li>
      <li>but i have to say i&#x27;m glad I purchased this because it smelled wonderful.</li>
      <li>Smells good and works great.</li>
      <li>and this bottle doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good or fragrant, for that matter, for some reason.</li>
      <li>Well my coworker had this lotion and when she put it on I loved it.</li>
      <li>Its a great price and even better when</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this smell is so popular to most people!</li>
      <li>&gt; All in all, Bath &amp; Body Works is a more wise choice because it contains better ingredients, has better quality packaging, and is a smarter price.</li>
      <li>Very light, but enjoyable scent.</li>
      <li>To get more for your money, Bath &amp; Body Works is the way to go.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>i love there sents and there products.</li>
      <li>but i have used most of it.</li>
      <li>All in all, Bath &amp; Body Works lotion contains more beneficial ingredients than Victoria’s</li>
      <li>I really love its scent.</li>
      <li>Love the way it feels on my skin also...</li>
      <li>This lotion has a refreshing scent, a happy medium scent, not too much flower smell not too fruity.</li>
      <li>buy from this seller,great buy love this body lotion</li>
      <li>But it getting better over time.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>We think this one is so much better than another product from blossom is very sweet</li>
      <li>Whether the lotion makes you feel fun and flirty, or sexy and confident, the question is, what brand of lotion is the better product?</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the labels stay in tact.</li>
      <li>She told me how much she loved the smell</li>
      <li>Its smell is really sweeeeeet and everyone who smells this lotion said it is good.</li>
      <li>hahahaha smells good.</li>
      <li>All of these are listed on the front of the lotion bottles and are easy to access.</li>
      <li>If they do somehow, they are easy to replace at the store.</li>
      <li>my bf never likes alot of the strong smelling girl products i have gotten</li>
      <li>I enjoy other scents from Bath &amp; Body Works Signature Collection, including Twilight Woods and Beautiful Day; however, this one remains my favorite.</li>
      <li>Bath &amp; Body Works bottles are eleven dollars each, but they always have a buy three get two free deal.</li>
      <li>They sometimes have cheap sales.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll make a good present  </li>
      <li>This is probably my favorite scent I bought it like a year ago and use it fairly often and still have a lot left</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they are selling it at 50% off</li>
      <li>and this is such an AWESOME price for this bigger bottle and the smell is my favorite of all time .</li>
      <li>Bath &amp; Body Works is a better lotion because it is clearly the better value within skin care, packaging, and price.</li>
      <li>Each lotion has a unique scent, and it’s own personality to fit you as an individual.  </li>
      <li>This is the only fragrance so far I have been able to find that smells wonderful and that works well with my natural scent.</li>
      <li>Bath &amp; Body Works lotion is a better value than Victoria’s Secret lotion because it contains more beneficial ingredients, is made with durable packaging, and is a better set price.&lt;br /&gt;The most important factor of lotion is the ingredients and how it is going to help moisturize your skin.</li>
      <li>Very feminine!!</li>
      <li>My girlfriend prefers this for a nice back rub</li>
      <li>thanks so much :)</li>
      <li>I love the lotion I have it at work use it everyday happy with the smell and product, will buy it again for the future,</li>
      <li>but I have this exact lotion from a couple years ago</li>
      <li>i would most definitely reccomend this for someone else to buy.</li>
      <li>At first, its smell was like medicine.</li>
      <li>But the scent is long lasting and my husband thinks that it smells very nice, so it&#x27;s a keeper.  </li>
      <li>I bought this lotion only based by reviews, and they were soooo right!!</li>
      <li>What a nice smell, although a little &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; for me.  </li>
      <li>Discontinued scent that I love and haven&#x27;t seen for a long time!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper on here than on the official cite.</li>
      <li>It was another one that I really wanted</li>
      <li>As most don’t know, the two stores are sister stores, meaning they share the same corporate.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>shipment arrived quickly, especially since I ordered them right before the Christmas holiday.</li>
      <li>(he usually criticize my body sprays and lotions because there are very few scents he likes) and well, this is one of them because its smell is good enough to make it noticeable, and yet, doesn&#x27;t smell that strong to cause you an itchy nose.</li>
      <li>Lush creamy lotion with heavenly scent</li>
      <li>Unless you are willing to pay for high priced bottles that are weak and do not provide enough nourishment for skin, Victoria’s Secret is definitely not the best brand.</li>
      <li>And I definitely spent my time pondering what exactly is the difference between the fragrances.</li>
      <li>Last but not least, the price of Bath &amp; Body Works is clearly a better value than Victoria’s Secret.</li>
      <li>The labels fade easily, which makes it hard to tell apart being that all of their bottles look the same.</li>
      <li>Secondly, the packaging of Bath &amp; Body Works is more durable than the Victoria’s Secret bottles.</li>
      <li>Vitamin E helps skin cells and provides a healthier skin, Shea butter provides relief from dry skin, and Jojoba helps bring out the natural oils in our skin.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, Victoria’s Secret all contained shimmer in their lotions, which can easily give rashes to individuals with sensitive skin.</li>

<li> I believe Secret Wonderland has an air of youthfulness and excitement missed in with the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
<li> Secret</li>
<li> i hate it bad!</li>

    <li> One of the best fragrances from Bath and Body works to come out in a while.  I bought a body for my sister for Christmas.  She told me how much she loved the smell so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll make a good present  :)  I can&#x27;t wait to buy a bottle for myself!</li>
    <li> wonderful scent!!! I need to buy more of this!!</li>
    <li> At first, its smell was like medicine. But it getting better over time. Its smell is really sweeeeeet and everyone who smells this lotion said it is good.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite scent I bought it like a year ago and use it fairly often and still have a lot left</li>
    <li> What a nice smell, although a little &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; for me.  But the scent is long lasting and my husband thinks that it smells very nice, so it&#x27;s a keeper.  😊</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year but I forgot to review it. But I will say I accidentally bought this lotion by a mistake. It was another one that I really wanted but i ended up getting this one but i have to say i&#x27;m glad I purchased this because it smelled wonderful.</li>
    <li> it is a great product and with great shipping! i would most definitely reccomend this for someone else to buy. this is my fav fragrance. unforunately its not sold in the stores anymore! SO HAPPY I FOUND IT ONLINE. thanks so much :)</li>
    <li> Unlike some experiences I have had, this product arrived in time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Something is different about this product. Maybe it&#x27;s the size or that it&#x27;s a discontinued item but I have this exact lotion from a couple years ago and this bottle doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good or fragrant, for that matter, for some reason. I&#x27;m not sure if I should return it or not.</li>
    <li> Lush creamy lotion with heavenly scent</li>
    <li> great scent. luxurious feel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this smell is so popular to most people! It smells pissy urgh i hate it bad!</li>
    <li> We think this one is so much better than another product from blossom is very sweet and my wife dont need perfume when she put this lotion on</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion only based by reviews, and they were soooo right!! It smells awesome!! Very feminine!! I use this every night and my husband loves it (he usually criticize my body sprays and lotions because there are very few scents he likes) and well, this is one of them because its smell is good enough to make it noticeable, and yet, doesn&#x27;t smell that strong to cause you an itchy nose.</li>
    <li> i had a mini one of these for a long time and have been wanting a bigger bottle for a long time but its pretty expensive in bath and body so i looked online and this is such an AWESOME price for this bigger bottle and the smell is my favorite of all time . my bf never likes alot of the strong smelling girl products i have gotten but he LOVES this one. great for seducing hahah!</li>
    <li> se recomienda muy buen vendedor llego puntual como lo esperaba, fue el producto que pedi en muy buen estado. gracias</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great. My girlfriend prefers this for a nice back rub</li>
    <li> I enjoy other scents from Bath &amp; Body Works Signature Collection, including Twilight Woods and Beautiful Day; however, this one remains my favorite. And I definitely spent my time pondering what exactly is the difference between the fragrances. I believe Secret Wonderland has an air of youthfulness and excitement missed in with the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment arrived quickly, especially since I ordered them right before the Christmas holiday. The only downside was that a few of the bottles had leaked a small amount. Though, it was not a huge mess, since each lotion was packaged in a separate plastic bag.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it! She couldn&#x27;t believe I had found it</li>
    <li> Discontinued scent that I love and haven&#x27;t seen for a long time!!! Was thrilled to find this on amazon!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> Bath and Body works is getting rid of this fragrance. But don&#x27;t worry it is on June sale! I&#x27;m pretty sure they are selling it at 50% off go buy it there cheaper!!</li>
    <li> Very light, but enjoyable scent.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells GREAT! Doesn&#x27;t last long though!!!!! The price was AWSOME too, cause you can&#x27;t get it from Bath and Body at this price!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a refreshing scent, a happy medium scent, not too much flower smell not too fruity. Love the way it feels on my skin also...Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love its scent. This is the only fragrance so far I have been able to find that smells wonderful and that works well with my natural scent. It&#x27;s much cheaper on here than on the official cite. I do suggest that you keep an eye on the bath and body works wed site. They sometimes have cheap sales. And the best time to go to the store is in Jan. when these is plenty of clearance.</li>
    <li> I started to go to bath and body works about a year or 2 ago. I have been going there ever since. i love there sents and there products. The first time i sent there i got the secret wonderland body spray. i still have just a little bit left. but i have used most of it. Its a great price and even better when its on sale. lol (: but anyways i would tell a friend about it so they can go get them some as well .</li>
    <li> great body lotion will purchase again for gifts&lt;br /&gt;will buy from this seller,great buy love this body lotion</li>
    <li> Smells like sex. Great for covering up the scent of self pleasure and regret.</li>
    <li> Well my coworker had this lotion and when she put it on I loved it. Im a guy. So I used to go in her drawer and use it. wound up using it all so I bought her and myself one. hahahaha smells good.</li>
    <li> I have a collection of Bath &amp; Body Works lotion, as well as Victoria’s Secret lotions. Each lotion has a unique scent, and it’s own personality to fit you as an individual.  Whether the lotion makes you feel fun and flirty, or sexy and confident, the question is, what brand of lotion is the better product? As most don’t know, the two stores are sister stores, meaning they share the same corporate. Wouldn’t that mean their lotions are the same? Not quite. Bath &amp; Body Works lotion is a better value than Victoria’s Secret lotion because it contains more beneficial ingredients, is made with durable packaging, and is a better set price.&lt;br /&gt;The most important factor of lotion is the ingredients and how it is going to help moisturize your skin. Every bottle of Bath &amp; Body Works lotion contains Vitamin E, Shea butter, and Jojoba.  Vitamin E helps skin cells and provides a healthier skin, Shea butter provides relief from dry skin, and Jojoba helps bring out the natural oils in our skin. All of these are listed on the front of the lotion bottles and are easy to access. On the other hand, Victoria’s Secret all contained shimmer in their lotions, which can easily give rashes to individuals with sensitive skin. The Victoria’s Secret lotions also did not contain Shea butter or any vitamins. Of course, the ingredients are on the back or the bottom of the lotion, and are typed so tiny that it isn’t understandable. All in all, Bath &amp; Body Works lotion contains more beneficial ingredients than Victoria’s Secret lotion.&lt;br /&gt; Secondly, the packaging of Bath &amp; Body Works is more durable than the Victoria’s Secret bottles. The Victoria’s Secret bottles are cheaply made. If they are dropped within three feet of the floor, they crack instantly. The labels fade easily, which makes it hard to tell apart being that all of their bottles look the same. Although Victoria’s Secret packaging is pretty, it is not made to last longer than a month after it’s purchase. Unlike Victoria’s Secret bottles, Bath &amp; Body Works lids never get stuck. If they do somehow, they are easy to replace at the store. The bottles will not crack if they are dropped or stepped on. Most importantly, the labels stay in tact. They do not fade over time and are reliable for months later to use.&lt;br /&gt; Last but not least, the price of Bath &amp; Body Works is clearly a better value than Victoria’s Secret. Bath &amp; Body Works bottles are eleven dollars each, but they always have a buy three get two free deal. This includes five bottles for about $6.50 each. Bath &amp; Body Works also always has coupons online or sent through email and mail monthly. On the other hand, Victoria’s Secret lotions are seventeen to twenty-four dollars. Their store sends out coupons only if you hold a credit card with their store, and the lotions are never on sale. Victoria’s Secret is a bit pricey for lotions that do not offer as much as Bath &amp; Body Works. To get more for your money, Bath &amp; Body Works is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt; All in all, Bath &amp; Body Works is a more wise choice because it contains better ingredients, has better quality packaging, and is a smarter price. The Shea butter &amp; Vitamins in the unbreakable Bath &amp; Body Works lotion will last longer while nourishing your skin. At four to six dollars, it is the best way to provide moisture to your body. During the Semi-Annual sale there are even bottles for two to three dollars! Unless you are willing to pay for high priced bottles that are weak and do not provide enough nourishment for skin, Victoria’s Secret is definitely not the best brand. Bath &amp; Body Works is a better lotion because it is clearly the better value within skin care, packaging, and price.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion I have it at work use it everyday happy with the smell and product, will buy it again for the future,</li>
