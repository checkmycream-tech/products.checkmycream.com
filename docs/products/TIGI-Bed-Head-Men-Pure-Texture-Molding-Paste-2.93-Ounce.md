      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It is versatile and effective and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking overdone at all.</li>
      <li>I can make it look nice, but</li>
      <li>Although this dries kind of crusty, it does a nice job of keeping hair under control.</li>
      <li>Get it nice and dry.&lt;br /&gt;7) Finish the hold with hairspray or another product you have</li>
      <li>Holds really nice for shorter hair as well as longer hair without getting all crusty like hair gels do.</li>
      <li>The product smells nice</li>
      <li>you use this product on its own,</li>
      <li>Smells nice.</li>
      <li>This molding paste work almost as good and smells better.  </li>
      <li>I liked the smell of the tube that I used to buy from CVS or Walgreens.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite styling paste.</li>
      <li>you get with most gel products.</li>
      <li>I must say it is a million times better than Fiber.</li>
      <li>(just more polished).  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of hold, its more just for separation.</li>
      <li>I have used many different hair products and this is one of the best.  </li>
      <li>Valeu :)</li>
      <li>I love this product because it makes my hair thicker now that I need that.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, its good at getting some separation in my hair.</li>
      <li>all TIGI products are amazing you just have to find the right one for you..</li>
      <li>But for medium hair the product is too strong.</li>
      <li>I have some sections of hair that wants to do its own thing.</li>
      <li>This is awesome for everyone who wants better hold than a gel without the cheap, wet look of a gel.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery!!!</li>
      <li>at first i wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
      <li>In both longer (4+ inches) and shorter hair styles, this molding paste creates and maintains amazing separation, hold and texture with a natural finish.  </li>
      <li>I make sure to disperse it evenly, so I don&#x27;t style my hair much at this point.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>Good hold without making your hair too sticky/oily/flaky gross.</li>
      <li>I love and highly recommend this stuff!</li>
      <li>With the way stores change out their product inventory most were no longer carrying this particular style of Bed Head.  </li>
      <li>First of all, the delivery was speedy (3 days)!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product just a little bit pricey.  </li>
      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>AND HE SAYS IT IS THE MOST NATURAL FEELING MOLDING PASTE</li>
      <li>You can also put on wet hair for a more gel like look though this product will still be more pliable than gel.  </li>
      <li>Worth the premium price over gels and glues.</li>
      <li>This product is good, And it smells good too, which can also be difficult to find in a hair product.</li>
      <li>i like way better the other product which is more matte finish and its heavier, meaning that the hair has a sensation of thickness and the hairdo is harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of hold for me.</li>
      <li>maybe it just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair.  </li>
      <li>i saw this on youtube and purchased right away.</li>
      <li>The paste gives the right look</li>
      <li>it smells very strong and the hold is different.</li>
      <li>.. came super fast.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy like gel is, but is just as strong a hold.</li>
      <li>If parting, I make sure the part looks right, fixing it with a comb if necessary.</li>
      <li>Works great on my thick, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>but then I discovered Sebastian Microweb Fiber, which has similar appearance in my hair, but holds the shape of my bangs better.</li>
      <li>I was looking for when first applied.</li>
      <li>will be buying more next time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future.</li>
      <li>Have tried many other hair products as well, but this is by far my favorite..</li>
      <li>Smell too much and pretty sticky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a gel and finishes dry unlike a wax.</li>
      <li>Let your hair &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; dry and you get great hold and texture without that wet look</li>
      <li>/&gt;Others have rated this very highly so</li>
      <li>Also, the &amp;#34;molding&amp;#34; quality isn&#x27;t really there.</li>
      <li>paste.&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived timely, packed efficiently, is the real deal and reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like this molding paste by Bed Head.</li>
      <li>He uses this hair paste almost every  day and gives him that look and control he wants without looking dirty/greasy.</li>
      <li>very</li>
      <li>Much cheaper on amazon though compared to the salons.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say, so I will keep typing words until I have reached the twenty count limit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite styling paste. Firm hold, not greasy, and a little goes a long way. Did I mention it doesn&#x27;t flake either?</li>
    <li> I am very happy how this product styles my hair. This is my second tube I&#x27;ve purchased. Not too stiff either.</li>
    <li> First of all, the delivery was speedy (3 days)!  This product is amazing.  It was recommended by my hair stylist but is SO much less expensive buying it from Amazon.com!!!</li>
    <li> The paste gives the right look I was looking for when first applied. Doesn&#x27;t give you the wet look nor does it leave residue in your hair. However, the paste doesn&#x27;t hold as long as some other molding pastes I have used in the past. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for those who want to style their hair without having the rock hard stiff look like you get from hair gel. Makes your hair look natural and loose but still holds your style in place very strongly. I&#x27;m 25 and like to spike my hair up in the front when I go out, highly recommended for club goers, and guidos who want to have that spikey hair and the women at the same time.</li>
    <li> I really like this molding paste by Bed Head. I have fine hair which is a problem when styling because most products are too heavy for my hair and weigh it down. I have used American Crew Fiber for years before being turned onto this product. I must say it is a million times better than Fiber.</li>
    <li> Good quality hair product, but the TIGI Matte hair wax is much better!  This gives your hair a gel look but without the hardness.  I guess it depends on personal preference.  I don&#x27;t like my hair shiny, so the TIGI Matter Hair wax is my go-to hair product.  It can also depend on hair-type.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. It is versatile and effective and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking overdone at all. For those who insist that this product leaves an undesired wet look, I suggest you read the directions on the tube. Used on WET hair, it leaves a wet-look finish; used on dry hair, it leaves a matte finish. I love and highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent hold without the &amp;#34;crunch.&amp;#34;  Works great on my thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> My wife picked this up for me a few years ago and I&#x27;ve been buying it since.  I use it on shorter hair that is moderately dry when I apply it.  You can also put on wet hair for a more gel like look though this product will still be more pliable than gel.  It only takes a small amount, isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t flake, is soft to touch.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Great styling product for a guy who wants a little control over his hair but doesn&#x27;t want it to be slick or shiny (just more polished).  I have relatively short hair and have only applied to dry hair, not wet, and my hair still stays relatively soft.  It tends to lose its hold by the end of the day, but hair just goes back to normal with no flaking or residue.  Solid product.</li>
    <li> Bought this product, read the description, and saw the picture; however, when it arrived it wasn&#x27;t as advertised. It came in a black tube and it was the older version of the molding paste. Its not the strongest hold but for my hair it works well. I like moving my fingers through my hair without having to wash my hands out every time so that is why I gave it two stars. The product smells nice and I don&#x27;t need much of it to style my hair, but because of the false advertising I had to take away three stars. I wanted the product in the picture because when traveling it is much safer to have it in a jar with a lid than in a tube.</li>
    <li> This is the same product I buy from my beautician for a few buck cheaper.  I&#x27;ve used bed head for many years and this product is the best..</li>
    <li> Smells great and molds well. There isn&#x27;t much to say, so I will keep typing words until I have reached the twenty count limit. Hopefully this is enough.</li>
    <li> Apply when wet it holds like a gel without the crunch. Let your hair &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; dry and you get great hold and texture without that wet look you get with most gel products. Definitely going to continue and use.</li>
    <li> Holds really nice for shorter hair as well as longer hair without getting all crusty like hair gels do. Only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> Smell too much and pretty sticky. Not for me. looking for something to control without crusty feel. Is there something out there that controls without wet look?</li>
    <li> Works well and leaves hair soft and not stiff. Unfortunately, I hear that Tigi is discontinuing all men&#x27;s hair products.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. I got the tin yesterday as opposed to the tube. It&#x27;s more like a gel and finishes dry unlike a wax. I prefer that as it won&#x27;t (hopefully) douche my pillows. I haven&#x27;t used a gel in ages. This does not flake and holds the shape but is still flexible. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> My husband had a tube of this that he bought a few years ago.  When it was running out I began looking for it in local stores, with no success.  With the way stores change out their product inventory most were no longer carrying this particular style of Bed Head.  I was so happy to find it online, and my husband was happy he had his favorite hair product again!</li>
    <li> He uses this hair paste almost every  day and gives him that look and control he wants without looking dirty/greasy.</li>
    <li> This is kind of heavy.  It keeps the curl in your hair but it is kind of heavy and you will need to wash your hair the next day to get it out.</li>
    <li> My son has a very sensitive scalp!  This is the ONLY &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t flake!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best texture molding pastes I&#x27;ve used. I have medium-length, extremely thick hair which becomes quickly unmanageable (overly fluffy) without a decent texture paste. I only need to use a small dab and it gives my hair a great texture with a subtle shine but not too greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this product on its own, though, I find that its hold isn&#x27;t so great. I&#x27;m not sure if this product is intended to hold much at all, actually. Therefore I combine with a product that is intended to hold, such as hairspray or TIGI&#x27;s Matte Separation Wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my routine. Your results may vary because everyone&#x27;s hair is different:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) Towel dry my hair moderately, leaving it still a bit moist.&lt;br /&gt;3) Dab a tiny bit of texture molding paste on my finger, then rub and spread it across both of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;4) Using my hands, I work the paste *all* throughout my hair. I make sure to disperse it evenly, so I don&#x27;t style my hair much at this point. It&#x27;s OK if the hair gets a bit messy. Need the texture all over--that&#x27;s the priority.&lt;br /&gt;5) Here is where I start shaping my hair into my preferred style. If parting, I make sure the part looks right, fixing it with a comb if necessary. Optional- I wash any remaining product residue off of my hands, just so it doesn&#x27;t get all over my dryer.&lt;br /&gt;6) Now I blow dry my hair (high heat, but low air) while continuing continuing to shape it into my preferred style. This can take several minutes. Get it nice and dry.&lt;br /&gt;7) Finish the hold with hairspray or another product you have that is intended for hold. Use only a little bit, or your hair will become too heavy and weigh itself down. I use a small amount (even smaller than the paste) of Bed Head Separation Wax, which is also made by TIGI. You can find it on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it makes my hair thicker now that I need that.  It is not too heavy or too crunchy!!</li>
    <li> Its an excellent product with a nice presentation though i was expecting something more like TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not as heavy at the other WAX and this one is brighter. i like way better the other product which is more matte finish and its heavier, meaning that the hair has a sensation of thickness and the hairdo is harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont like the matte finish and prefer a smoother and softer and brighter hairdo this product is for you if you are expecting a matte finish this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW all TIGI products are amazing you just have to find the right one for you..</li>
    <li> I liked the smell of the tube that I used to buy from CVS or Walgreens. I still have the old ones at home and when I compare the scent from the store-bought tube with this product, they smell different. This makes me question the authenticity of this product. That said, this product still works like the store-bought one. For this reason, I have given it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> best stuff. i saw this on youtube and purchased right away. will be buying more next time</li>
    <li> Switched from paste. Good for shorter hair but probably not strong enough for medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Enough hold without being stiff and crusty. I&#x27;ve since bought more for me to use and recommend to other dudes with short,thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Have tried many other hair products as well, but this is by far my favorite.. I put the product in with my hair blown dry or damp.. My second time using this seller. Will continue to buy from them as long as its available.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t have enough hold.  I have course black Asian hair and &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; products ususally work for me.  This one, however, was a disappoinment, especially considering it&#x27;s price, brand name, and other ratings.  There simply wasn&#x27;t enough holding power and if I used lots and lots of it, it would leave my hair stiff and crunchy, like gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have rated this very highly so maybe it just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair.  In any event, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> tried wax, gel, spray...ended up with this Bed Head molding paste- THE BEST product! hard discipline styling plus can&#x27;t be seen or feel on the hair unlike other products, smells good. recommended. 5stars.</li>
    <li> good stuff! Only product that works with my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Not what i was looking for</li>
    <li> This product requires surprisingly little product to maintain it&#x27;s hold. I have very thick hair, and a quarter size amount is enough for each application. It is not heavy like gel is, but is just as strong a hold. I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> great product. smells great.. came super fast.</li>
    <li> I have very thin light hair that stands straight up when it&#x27;s cut short.  After washing my hair I put a little of this paste in my hand and rub it throughout the wet hair.  The paste is waxy, making my wet hair sticky enough to comb down.  After the hair dries in place, it feels hard and crusty and looks like there&#x27;s obviously some product pasting it down.  I then rub my hands through my hair a couple times, which breaks the hairs apart from each other and makes them look normal.  Everything stays how I combed it and looks natural.  At that point my hair feels thicker than natural, but I doubt anyone else could feel my hair and tell that there&#x27;s paste in it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and have searched many years for a product that will keep a firm hold without making my hair crusty, flaky, or sticky. This product is good, And it smells good too, which can also be difficult to find in a hair product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> produto chegou no Brasil em perfeitas condicões, rapido e muito beem embalado. recomendo a loja e o produto. Valeu :)</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY LITTLE BROTHER AND HE SAYS IT IS THE MOST NATURAL FEELING MOLDING PASTE THAT YOU CAN FIND.</li>
    <li> Dries your hair into spikes and settles extremely hard and firm.</li>
    <li> If you have short hair, then this is not bad. But for medium hair the product is too strong. Also, the &amp;#34;molding&amp;#34; quality isn&#x27;t really there. Once you apply the product the hair become stiff!</li>
    <li> Good hold without making your hair too sticky/oily/flaky gross. Worth the premium price over gels and glues.</li>
    <li> This past works good with longer hair that need little control. This is honestly the best smelling product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best what I bought for my hair-style!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect</li>
    <li> I have somewhat shiny hair (according to my hairstylist), and this stuff is quite matte, so it helps keep my hair in place without looking wet. I can make it look nice, but once I leave the house, the look goes away. For reference, I usually use it to try to style my bangs. You can add water to the hair to try to get the shape back, but not too much, obviously. One container lasts for 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be satisfied with this stuff - wet looking, stiff hair is really obvious - but then I discovered Sebastian Microweb Fiber, which has similar appearance in my hair, but holds the shape of my bangs better.</li>
    <li> I believe that this product is a fake...it smells very strong and the hold is different. even the packaging is different than what i have received when i bought it at an authorized salon.....</li>
    <li> I had a bad cowlick.  I bought this to &amp;#34;hold it down&amp;#34;, but found that when my hair starts to get a little longer (#3 on haircut), I use this to fluff out my hair (just work it up with my fingers), let it dry, then brush it.  My cowlick blends in - kinda the Ted Danson/Cheers look  ;-&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for a few years.  I wanted something that had a decent hold without the wet &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; look.  This fulfills that.  However if you are a fan of that more wet look if you apply this to your hair while it&#x27;s still wet you can get that look.  If you apply it to dry hair it provides a strong hold without the wet look.  It&#x27;s a great product just a little bit pricey.  Much cheaper on amazon though compared to the salons.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of hold for me.</li>
    <li> I was using Redkin molding paste and wanted to find an alternative since Redkin is more expensive.  This molding paste work almost as good and smells better.  For the price, it works great.  I will be purchasing again.  It dry matte so your hair does not look wet like other products.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and have searched many years for a product that will keep a firm hold without making my hair crusty, flaky, or sticky. This product is great! And it smells good, which can also be difficult to find in a hair product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Fast delivery!!! Very happy!!! This line is actually very good!!! It gives your hair a very natural aspect. Love it!</li>
    <li> finally a product that works exactly as demonstrated in the video. Great product gives you the desired look and lasts all day. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a product a resisted using for a long time. I have some sections of hair that wants to do its own thing. Although this dries kind of crusty, it does a nice job of keeping hair under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved tigi men&#x27;s texture paste.&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived timely, packed efficiently, is the real deal and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt; Good job!</li>
    <li> perfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
    <li> This is awesome for everyone who wants better hold than a gel without the cheap, wet look of a gel.  Exceptional memory - after it dries you can ruffle your hair for seperation and still retain a specific created style!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is full of cowlicks and whirls which can make styling difficult.  In both longer (4+ inches) and shorter hair styles, this molding paste creates and maintains amazing separation, hold and texture with a natural finish.  The price here is much better than in salons and local stores, especially if you bundle with other items to receive the free shipping.  Totally thrilled to find this on amazon!!!</li>
    <li> i have used this product for few months and then i noticed that my head started itching behind  my ears .... at first i wasn&#x27;t sure why so  I stopped the use of any hair product then the itching stopped .... then i started using other product and have not had any more itching .... i think this is a health concern and they should look at it and not sell it until they find the reason why</li>
    <li> I will buy it again, I can give my hair the shape that I want and it will stay like that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I heard David Tennant say he uses it. This is pretty much the only thing that keeps my hair exactly where I put it without making my hair sharp and pointy.</li>
    <li> This product is awful for my hair. It dries up and leaves white flakes on my hair. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone based on my experience.</li>
    <li> I have used many different hair products and this is one of the best.  holds your hair without a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Just got it in, have only had the chance to use it twice, but it gives my hair that textured look without looking greasy, which is exactly what i wanted from the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, its good at getting some separation in my hair. I have very fine, straight hair that lays flat and limp unless I put some product in it. This product gives it some layers and texture so that the hair looks a little more texturized. It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of hold, its more just for separation. Does its job well though.</li>
