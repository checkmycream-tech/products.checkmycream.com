      <li>The points are very fine - more so than most tweezers.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>These are okay.</li>
      <li>With the cheaper versions sometimes the points don&#x27;t line up perfectly, or they have more width than you&#x27;d expect, and you end up having to get a different pair anyway.  </li>
      <li>These tweezers grab the tiniest hair and for that I love them.</li>

      <li>These tweezers have no problem going under the skin to pull out any hairs smoothly and efficiently.</li>
      <li>Great for getting tiny splinters out of kid fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I had another brand for two years and they worked great - the price when I went to reorder had doubled and was the same as these</li>
      <li>Far superior quality over similar-appearing tweezers, which tend to have duller, thicker, tips.</li>
      <li>WOW.....can you get excited over tweezers?</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get these in the mail.  </li>
      <li>Does work good on fine facial hairs which was my concern.  </li>
      <li>,  these are my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure the tips are clean and clear of any debris to get a nice solid grip on your target.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best for getting those stubborn, stubbly thick hairs.</li>
      <li>Tweezerman brand is absolutely worth the price.</li>
      <li>so well, they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re a bit expensive, and no, the needle tips aren&#x27;t perfect for everything you would need tweezers for -- but they are so precise and work</li>
      <li>Grips hair great, very even sharp ends</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t even need to do very much prodding after breaking the hair to the surface because the grip on the tweezer surface is like a Kung-Fu grip.</li>
      <li>I got several splinters in my hand and this was easily able to get them out.  </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s not that much really), but it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I own other Tweezerman products and have always like them.</li>
      <li>Purchased to use in addition to regular angel shaped Tweezerman tweezers, but they actually don&#x27;t grab as good as my angel ones</li>
      <li>These tweezers are fine enough for him to get them out without gouging his hands to shreds.  </li>
      <li>Very high quality.</li>
      <li>Good tweezers if you&#x27;re looking for more of thinner more narrow pointy tweezers these are not the ones these are a little bit wide</li>
      <li>Never thought I&#x27;d spend this much money</li>
      <li>but it worked better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>Very precise and sharp.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried several other brand tweezers --- not as good as this one.</li>
      <li>I actually use these for my eyebrows as there are no other tweezers as accurate!</li>
      <li>Very sharp and works as expected.very pleased with this tweezer.</li>
      <li>Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
      <li>These are not as precise as I expected.</li>
      <li>They should last a lifetime, but if not, we would certainly buy again!  </li>
      <li>Very sharp and precise.</li>
      <li>Wow...</li>
      <li>Just what I needed for those special little hairs.</li>
      <li>Although they offer a Lifetime Guarantee, the tweezers are never as sharp as when you first purchased them.</li>
      <li>Tweezerman even has a lifetime warranty, so you can send in dull Tweezers and have them sent back to you like new -- free of charge.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I could have done without them in general.</li>
      <li>This is my second pair (lost the first :&#x27;( ) and they are definitely the best you can get for the money.</li>
      <li>Not sure how I ever managed with the cheap pair of tweezers I had for so long.  </li>
      <li>The GEAR version is worth a few extra dollars..</li>

<li> Hard to find these really pointy tweezers anymore.</li>
<li> Sharp enough to penetrate the skin to retrieve ingrown hairs.</li>

<li> Sharp ends on these tweezers do not hold hair well, and slices into skin on use with ingrown hair.</li>

<li> They are very sharp, so be careful when using them.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Grips hair great, very even sharp ends</li>
    <li> These tweezers are terrible. Went dull with-in two weeks and they are not strong enough to pull the hair out. I had another brand for two years and they worked great - the price when I went to reorder had doubled and was the same as these, so I figured I would upgrade to the Tweezerman -- waste of 20 bucks. The yellow ones I had previously used are now back down to 10 bucks a month later, so purchasing. I will never understand why prices on amazon vary so widely depending on the day of purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Gets all ingrown and hard to reach hairs out in no time!</li>
    <li> After just a few months of use, the tips have become dull.</li>
    <li> WOW.....can you get excited over tweezers? YEP!!!! Extremely accurate</li>
    <li> Great tweezers.  I will say that occasionally you will run into a hair too thin and stubborn to pull with these.  Other than that they work for almost any task.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best for getting those stubborn, stubbly thick hairs. Simply put, it cannot be  beat. If you&#x27;re not familiar with the splintertweeze, use with care because you can trap skin in it instead of, or along with, the hair. It doesn&#x27;t get better than this, along with a 10X lighted magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it takes out those darn ingrown hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, had in the past the same Ingrowm Hair Splinter tweezer from tweezerman, which was thinner, sharper and more pointy at the end.</li>
    <li> Did not know  there were tweezers this pointed, at 71, still learning, thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Very small tip.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Ughhhh.  I was so excited to get these in the mail.  But, these tweezers are horrible.  I have had many tweezerman tweezer.  None have been as dull and ineffective as these.  It&#x27;s hard to believe these are actually &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; tweezers.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these really pointy tweezers anymore. The only thing that works for ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> The ultimate tweezer for ingrown hairs. Very precise and sharp.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He&#x27;s a machinist and gets tiny micro wire shards in his hands all the time.  These tweezers are fine enough for him to get them out without gouging his hands to shreds.  Very nice and very well made.  They have a wonderful lifetime sharpening service.  They should last a lifetime, but if not, we would certainly buy again!  I have the regular kind for eyebrow tweezing, and I love them too!</li>
    <li> Pros: Large, sharp, high quality tweezers that narrow down to a very small point. Ends line up perfectly. Great for getting tiny splinters out of kid fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: quality things are expensive?</li>
    <li> Great Tweezers!  They do take some getting used to but they work great on those hairs that are just under the skin.  They are very sharp, so be careful when using them.  But they definitely get the job done.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and works as expected.very pleased with this tweezer. Tweezerman never disappoints. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> Good tweezers if you&#x27;re looking for more of thinner more narrow pointy tweezers these are not the ones these are a little bit wide but they do the job also a bit heavy</li>
    <li> Excellent product, color, performance</li>
    <li> These are a very solid and dependable pair of tweezers. They have a very precise tip and if I can get a hold of a hair it will come out. Just make sure the tips are clean and clear of any debris to get a nice solid grip on your target. These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Tweezerman Products for years.  I have tried other tweezers but none compare to Tweezerman.  My only complaint would be that they no longer sell the tweezers in a case of some sort.  Although they offer a Lifetime Guarantee, the tweezers are never as sharp as when you first purchased them. My advice &amp;#34;Handle with Care&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> We bought these specifically for removing ticks. Thankfully we have not had to use them yet. I&#x27;m sure they will work great for removing splinters etc. too. Well made product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about five or six pairs of ingrown-hair tweezers and these are the best, hands-down!  They are expensive but if you need the ingrown tweezers don&#x27;t waste your money on cheaper versions (like I did) which turn out to be duds.  With the cheaper versions sometimes the points don&#x27;t line up perfectly, or they have more width than you&#x27;d expect, and you end up having to get a different pair anyway.  Save yourself the trouble and go ahead and get these.  This is my second pair (lost the first :&#x27;( ) and they are definitely the best you can get for the money.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I ever managed with the cheap pair of tweezers I had for so long.  The point of this allows you get in there and grab a hair and hold onto it.  It also helps reduce the risk of ripping out other hairs because of the small point at the end.  Never thought I&#x27;d spend this much money (it&#x27;s not that much really), but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great pointy tweezers.  Just the ticket for weeding vinyl</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers for ingrown hairs. I was skeptical at first on spending $20 on a pair of tweezers, but they&#x27;re really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I get a lot of ingrown hairs from shaving because my neck hairs grow in all sorts of crazy directions. These tweezers have no problem going under the skin to pull out any hairs smoothly and efficiently. No more gaping holes in my neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a small amount of force it pierced the supplied rubber stopper. The ends are sharp. So don&#x27;t poke your eye out, however temping it might be.</li>
    <li> Sharp ends on these tweezers do not hold hair well, and slices into skin on use with ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers for removing ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
    <li> Hubby says this is a life saver for those ingrown hairs on his beard.</li>
    <li> had to use this recently, it is perfect for the job!</li>
    <li> I own other Tweezerman products and have always like them. These are not as precise as I expected. Purchased to use in addition to regular angel shaped Tweezerman tweezers, but they actually don&#x27;t grab as good as my angel ones so I could have done without them in general.</li>
    <li> Awesome for ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> Product seems to work but little hairs break a part which is not good that can cause an in grown hair.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant about this but it worked better than I expected.  Does work good on fine facial hairs which was my concern.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> These tweezers grab the tiniest hair and for that I love them. If you&#x27;re not careful they also grab skin too however they are excellent tweezers.</li>
    <li> Really amazing. Sharp enough to penetrate the skin to retrieve ingrown hairs. My husband says i have a tweezer collection,  these are my new favorite.  Tweezerman makes excellent tweezers. Ive been buying their products for the past 10 years. Price is a even less to that of going to ulta and paying.</li>
    <li> You know when you have an ingrown hair, or a blackhead, or a splinter, or a speck of something somewhere it shouldn&#x27;t be? And you know how conventional tweezers, with their lateral slanted edges, are still just too big to grab whatever that bothersome thing is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, fear no more. The Tweezerman G.E.A.R. Ingrown Hair/Splinter Tweezer is here to save the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they&#x27;re a bit expensive, and no, the needle tips aren&#x27;t perfect for everything you would need tweezers for -- but they are so precise and work so well, they&#x27;re worth the money. You have to be careful to keep the ends covered while not in use (it comes with a small silicone &#x27;barrel cover&#x27;) because they are, indeed, very sharp. Even so, the precision and high-tolerance manufacturing of the product make it truly quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these and a regular set of slant-edged tweezers, and you&#x27;re set. Tweezerman even has a lifetime warranty, so you can send in dull Tweezers and have them sent back to you like new -- free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5, and if I ever lose these, you can be sure I&#x27;ll be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Wow...This tweezer does the trick.  I got several splinters in my hand and this was easily able to get them out.  The points are very fine - more so than most tweezers.</li>
    <li> Awesome tweezers I use them to remove slivers of metal from my fingers thst I get at work. Very sharp and precise.</li>
    <li> These are okay. I think I expected them to be as sharp as the other version of these I have and they are not. My skin is tough and it is hard to find tweezers that can get through some parts. These did not work for me, but if you have less thick skin I think these would work just fine.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is a quality brand.  The point is sharp.  We&#x27;ve tried several other brand tweezers --- not as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Great!  Just what I needed for those special little hairs.</li>
    <li> This tweezers is everything it is advertised to be! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> BEST TWEEZER EVER! I actually use these for my eyebrows as there are no other tweezers as accurate!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman brand is absolutely worth the price. Far superior quality over similar-appearing tweezers, which tend to have duller, thicker, tips. This one is great for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Very sharp so be careful!!</li>
    <li> These are the tweezers of mah dreams! Seriously, they really get those stubborn and shy ingrown hair out. You don&#x27;t even need to do very much prodding after breaking the hair to the surface because the grip on the tweezer surface is like a Kung-Fu grip. That hair is not getting away!</li>
    <li> The GEAR version is worth a few extra dollars.. best tweeezers I have ever owned, just bought two more.</li>
