      <li>It smells fabulous and showed up on time .</li>
      <li>But the bottle is fun and for young woman who wants to wear light perfume during the day, this is a perfect gift.  </li>
      <li>I love this scent, it is light, fresh, clean smelling.  </li>

      <li>Light, fresh, clean and feminine.</li>

      <li>I still love it, I tried to glue the little wing/dot (?)</li>
      <li>I love this scent, even though it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>The only reason or reasons it does not get the full five is that I personally feel that perfumes and things of that sort are very over priced.  </li>
      <li>Its not fast wearing, I will put it on in the morning and will still be able to smell it the next day!!</li>
      <li>It was a very generous present</li>
      <li>so it was like two gifts in one as far as she was concerned.</li>
      <li>So good that i randomly smell it when im at work.</li>

    <li> Perfect. Came in great condition and exactly as described. Its not fast wearing, I will put it on in the morning and will still be able to smell it the next day!! Great. Highly recommended if you want the real deal!</li>
    <li> This perfume is a very sexy and seductive fragrance! My husband purchased a small bottle for me when we went on a cruise. The small bottle was much more expensive than the large one. I&#x27;m truly hooked on Marc Jacobs❤️This perfume is a true meaning of sexy. I get lots of compliments when I wear it, but mostly wear it when I&#x27;m with my husband. It&#x27;s a sweet long lasting subtle fragrance that lasts all day and night.</li>
    <li> It smells fabulous and showed up on time . Was well worth it. We are so extrordinarily excited and happy</li>
    <li> Love the smell love the price.  It came all in one piece.  I was worried buying parfum through the mail.  Nice little item with a nice little price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I normally buy it at the department store, but found it on here for less. IT smells great, lasts and I can tell its as fresh as if I bought it at the store!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife for christmas and smells wonderful. So good that i randomly smell it when im at work. :D Makes me think about her even more. I recommend</li>
    <li> I love this scent, it is light, fresh, clean smelling.  The only reason or reasons it does not get the full five is that I personally feel that perfumes and things of that sort are very over priced.  To top it off it was a gift to me from my hubby &amp; 1 of the decorations fell off during shipping.  There is no way the shipper or seller, or even the maker could have known this because it was in a box that still had the cellophane on it.  I kind of wavered on taking that 1 star off but it is not perfect &amp; to me 5 represents perfect.  I still love it, I tried to glue the little wing/dot (?) back on but nope, it would not stick.  I love all of Marc Jacob&#x27;s scents.</li>
    <li> I have received this perfume from my best friend for my birthday.  It was a very generous present and I was delighted because, in general, I love Marc Jacobs brand a lot.  However, I must say that the best thing about this perfume is the bottle.  If you know a woman who likes lady bugs and butterflies, just the bottle alone is the keeper.  I was less impressed with the scent.  For me personally, it wears off quickly.  I used MARC JACOBS perfume (with white flowers - jasmine) and LOVED it.  I cannot say the same for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this perfume for myself.  There are other brands I would rather spend my money on.  But the bottle is fun and for young woman who wants to wear light perfume during the day, this is a perfect gift.  She can keep used bottle as a decoration in her room, or in her office (if she is working).</li>
