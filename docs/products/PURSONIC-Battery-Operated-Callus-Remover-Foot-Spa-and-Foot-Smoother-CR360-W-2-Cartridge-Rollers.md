      <li>this took it off soo easy.</li>
      <li>Cleaning and maintenance is easy.</li>
      <li>Motor is strong but not as strong as i had hoed for.</li>
      <li>fine product, works as advertised.</li>
      <li>It works fine .  </li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s a HUGE difference in my feet.</li>
      <li>I got this for a great price &amp; it&#x27;s already paid for itself several times over.</li>

      <li>well feet are smooth</li>
      <li>works great for smaller jobs.</li>

      <li>Makes footcare so much simpler, cleaner, and more enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>Very useful pedicure tool.</li>
      <li>I bought it when it was highly discounted and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay any more for it.</li>
      <li>easy to use and gets rid of the calluses quickly.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome little callus remover!</li>
      <li>It is so worth the money!</li>
      <li>Works great, and goes a long time on one set of batteries.</li>
      <li>Its great but needs a little more power at times.</li>
      <li>Removes calluses quickly and leaves feet feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because for the continuous use you must do, I would have liked to recieve more replacement cartridges.</li>
      <li>The only problem is it comes back, but the machine is easy to use and does the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>But I did notice a difference right away!</li>
      <li>If you just use a little sense,  this is a very safe and effective device.</li>
      <li>not enough power to really do much good</li>
      <li>im a man, but this really helped my feet feeling better after using it, get them if you can</li>
      <li>Very easy to use,remove callus and dry skin and leave feet very smooth.</li>
      <li>THis helps tremendously to keep that in check.</li>
      <li>I used this after soaking in the bath, my feet were nice soft kind of wrinkly actually and it got the majority of my callus off..</li>
      <li>This really helped me a lot, my heels on my feet were so dry, I used to pick at them, and pull chunks of dry skin off, probably not the best thing to do,  but this smoothed the heels, and it makes the moisturizers work better.  </li>
      <li>I followed up my treatment with O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Foot Cream and WOW</li>
      <li>Just used it a couple of times so far but LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>This has been one of the best product we&#x27;ve invested in the last few months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if you used good rechargeable batteries you would get more current and therefore more torque out of the tiny motor, but then you would probably be more likely to grind past the calluses to live flesh.</li>
      <li>LOVE this, never going back to dr. scholls pads.</li>
      <li>I put 2 batteries in and it had more than enough power to do both my feet with no loss of power.</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>Feet are smooth and soft</li>
      <li>First, the batteries.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this to take the pressure off my hand &amp; still have pretty feet.  </li>
      <li>If your having trouble with dry skin, this is the best.</li>
      <li>My feet were so dry and rough from being on bed rest while pregnant and this helped GREATLY.</li>
      <li>It works very well &amp; keeps my feet soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I like this &amp;#34;foot grinder&amp;#34; as I call it because it certainly does the job.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me since the batteries they require isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
      <li>I suggest you use it dry as oppose to wet, allow both are possible, nice grip, nice size, very sturdy &amp; dutiable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE this, never going back to dr. scholls pads. This is a far, far healthier approach, esp. if you use it after soaking in a nice foot bath.</li>
    <li> works well--easy to operate!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Brand new batteries and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> Works like it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It didn&#x27;t work as efficiently as products of this nature that I had seen advertised on TV.  I couldn&#x27;t get the more expensive version.  As the old saying goes &amp;#34;I got what I paid for&amp;#34; which wasn&#x27;t much.  I should have known something was up when I couldn&#x27;t find replacement grinding wheels for this model.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need pressure.  It does the job well!</li>
    <li> This is the coolest thing.  Removes calluses quickly and leaves feet feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> Lot of callus below big toe from years of wearing boots, figured be there rest of my life. Man this took most of right off , stopped when i could actually feel this on the skin leaving very small section. feet are super smooth even removed small amount of callus on heel i had no idea about. this took it off soo easy. Feet are smooth and soft</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> works better than expected</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough power. You can&#x27;t press too hard or the wheel will stop all together</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best product we&#x27;ve invested in the last few months. Makes footcare so much simpler, cleaner, and more enjoyable.  If it seems too weak at first, change the batteries for fresh ones and there will be a huge difference.</li>
    <li> SO MUCH EASIER than a regular foot file! love it!!</li>
    <li> It works fine .  I wish it had more RPM for quicker job .</li>
    <li> Love it! It works great.</li>
    <li> hate this product does nothing, dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Works great, and goes a long time on one set of batteries.</li>
    <li> Better than expected and it does what is says. I wish it had softer rollers or maybe less coarse.</li>
    <li> This is pretty awesome. It takes lightly calloused feet to smooth in minutes. For rougher feet, it takes a little more work, but still goes right through the yucky stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It does what it says. Don&#x27;t buy the ones for $39.95 in stores. This one is perfect.</li>
    <li> Works well feet are smooth</li>
    <li> Loved it. Was everything I wanted</li>
    <li> every easy to use , and clean up .</li>
    <li> Good but not great - For the price, it works well</li>
    <li> Works great at a much better price than those at the drug store.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  I bought this based on review and a recommendation and it is amazing. I wish I took pictures to prove it. I wear sandals all year and now I can worn out having to go to the saloon to get my feet prettied up.</li>
    <li> Scrapped it!  Shuts off with any kind of pressure at all.</li>
    <li> It works on thick cracky heels but takes FOREVER to do the job. Motor is strong but not as strong as i had hoed for. the grit is awesome however and seems to be lasting well.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Cleaning and maintenance is easy. A GREAT BUY!!  Works wonders on heels !!</li>
    <li> Easy to operate, very efficient for getting rid of dry skin on heels/soles of feet, painless. Love it!</li>
    <li> Not very powerful, would work for child.</li>
    <li> works perfectly, sturdily packaged, prompt delivery. fine product, works as advertised. would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on June 5 and it went into the trash today. I pulled it out to use it and the bottom had come off. I thought I just needed to twist it back one, but something broke on the inside and it wouldn&#x27;t stay on, which means the batteries wouldn&#x27;t stay in either. It was ... ok, but not great. It did help my heels some of the dryness/cracking, but wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as I had hoped. Like a previous user said, if you applied too much pressure (which I thought would help), it stops working. I bought it when it was highly discounted and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay any more for it. I&#x27;ll be looking for something different.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I have big beefy feet even though I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and I tend to get a callous on my left big toe especially with my golf shoes.  THis helps tremendously to keep that in check.</li>
    <li> Worked well until I changed the batteries; case broke and it stopped working</li>
    <li> I used this after soaking in the bath, my feet were nice soft kind of wrinkly actually and it got the majority of my callus off.. the one on my big toe has always been the worse, I will keep working at it over the next couple of days to week. All in all this thing is pretty amazing!!.</li>
    <li> Work real good  a lot better and faster then by hand . Got my daughter one as a gift</li>
    <li> Love this little thing, I was not expecting much, but man oh man it works. I use it every day and is helping me with my foot health.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work at all horrible product.</li>
    <li> The item description, “PURSONIC Battery Operated Callus Remover, Foot Spa and Foot Smoother CR360 W/ 2 Cartridge Rollers” is deceptive as there is only one spare cartridge roller included.</li>
    <li> works great. my girlfriend loves this product.</li>
    <li> Its great but needs a little more power at times.</li>
    <li> Very useful pedicure tool.</li>
    <li> I returned this because it&#x27;s not powerful enough to do the job required.  In an effort to keep you from hurting yourself by rubbing off too much skin, the opposite happens, it stops if too much pressure is applied, it takes forever to make it&#x27;s way through an callus - if it handles it at all, and the directions warn you to only allow 3 seconds for it to touch your skin.  You&#x27;d do better with a dremel.  This thing is made in China, does not come with batteries and is only 3 watts.  Look for something with more power or get out the power tools.  My heels are not that bad because I use the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s hand-held shredder thingy.  Was looking for something automated.  This ain&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> it had a hard time removing my calluses and they were very thin due to pedicure 2 weeks prior to arrival</li>
    <li> Worked well on my very dry and rough feet</li>
    <li> Not too powerful but works if it was more powerful it would be perfect</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;m a big guy with slot of weight on my feet. This is not a magic trick, you must use continually but it does work. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because for the continuous use you must do, I would have liked to recieve more replacement cartridges. I suggest you use it dry as oppose to wet, allow both are possible, nice grip, nice size, very sturdy &amp; dutiable. I got this for a great price &amp; it&#x27;s already paid for itself several times over. Even my 11 year old uses it.</li>
    <li> not enough power to really do much good</li>
    <li> Works well but motor seems to struggle at some points during use. Have only used it once so far don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
    <li> This callus remover is awesome! If you have neglected foot care like I have for years, this is a must. It does exactly what it says and more! If you have problems with it &amp;#34;stopping&amp;#34; that means you are holding it too close to skin. You have to just barely have it close and it will work great! If your feet are REALLY rough you will need to repeat use a lot for awhile. But I did notice a difference right away! This product saves a lot of work compared to &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; options. It is so worth the money! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is tired of their &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; feet getting caught on their socks or wearing holes in their socks a lot!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to use it works wonderfully. Are there any other attachments that an be offered with this product. The current works well on my feet but I think I need a tougher, stronger barrel for my friend</li>
    <li> works great for smaller jobs. I have to use the manual ped-egg first then use this one after or everyday after that. good product.</li>
    <li> Works just like it&#x27;s supposed to. Saves money since I don&#x27;t have to go in for pedicures as often as before. Worth having!!</li>
    <li> This really helped me a lot, my heels on my feet were so dry, I used to pick at them, and pull chunks of dry skin off, probably not the best thing to do,  but this smoothed the heels, and it makes the moisturizers work better.  I was very impressed with this doing such a great job.  If your having trouble with dry skin, this is the best.</li>
    <li> It was great just what i asked for.</li>
    <li> Wife used it and loved it.</li>
    <li> works well I continue to use</li>
    <li> It works - my feet are free of the hard skin that forms on my feet.  The only problem is it comes back, but the machine is easy to use and does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this because it did not work as promised.</li>
    <li> It worked okay but it took a long time. It was not as course as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This is a great pedicure product. My feet were so dry and rough from being on bed rest while pregnant and this helped GREATLY. I am happy I invested in it and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to take the pressure off my hand &amp; still have pretty feet.  It works very well &amp; keeps my feet soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use,remove callus and dry skin and leave feet very smooth.</li>
    <li> If you press on your foot it will shut down.  Needs more power.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life??????? Love this little tool,</li>
    <li> My wife bought this and only used it once.  She said it was underpowered.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I had spots on my feet that was hard to get excess hard skin off and this totaling worked.  Now my feet look and fell great.  Will be recommending this to family and friends</li>
    <li> The Callus remover did not performed as advertised. I found it not powerful enough, and stopped a number of times during the operation.</li>
    <li> Could be a little more sturdier</li>
    <li> This callus remover is great ..... easy to use and gets rid of the calluses quickly.</li>
    <li> These work so well and used them for presents and kept one for myself.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me since the batteries they require isn&#x27;t strong enough. It should take at least 9 batteries.</li>
    <li> Does not cleanly remove and, left rough skin which I had to use a foot file to remove.</li>
    <li> Missing one of the rollers, sent it back. I need to watch and only use products from amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little callus remover! I received this today and just had to try it out (as I&#x27;ve seen a few negative reviews on several brands of these) and from someone who has had REALLY dry feet and nothing has worked - one treatment and there&#x27;s a HUGE difference in my feet. I followed up my treatment with O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Foot Cream and WOW I feel like I just had one of these exclusive pedicures. There is a &#x27;trick&#x27; to using this though - Do Not apply a lot of pressure - but in all honesty, you really don&#x27;t need to anyway. I put 2 batteries in and it had more than enough power to do both my feet with no loss of power. I would suggest you grab yourself a towel and put it on the floor as you will create a lot of &#x27;dust&#x27; - but that&#x27;s really not a bad thing as that&#x27;s the end game here.. to get rid of the dry skin! Can&#x27;t wait to be able to try this after a good foot soak!</li>
    <li> Looks good and packaging good.</li>
    <li> I am a classic male, in as much as I have in the past used power tools such as detail sanders and hand tools like my rasp to take care of my bad calluses.  Not any more though. I like this &amp;#34;foot grinder&amp;#34; as I call it because it certainly does the job. My only issues with it though are in the lack of battery life and lack of power in the motor. First, the batteries.  I&#x27;m sure if you used good rechargeable batteries you would get more current and therefore more torque out of the tiny motor, but then you would probably be more likely to grind past the calluses to live flesh. I have a spinal cord injury so I don&#x27;t have normal feeling in my feet and so I&#x27;ve already done exactly that as I am sitting here watching two spots bleed - totally my fault. If you just use a little sense,  this is a very safe and effective device. My only reason for the three stars is the lack of battery life and lack of rotational torque I personally would like.I guess I will be investing in rechargeable batteries soon but besides that issue I can happily recommend this product to anyone out there wanting to loose the dead skin. Happy grinding!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for calluses or anything but works great for me. You don&#x27;t need to use much pressure you can see it&#x27;s working. After ~3 uses my heels look and feel much better--my feet were a neglected mess!</li>
