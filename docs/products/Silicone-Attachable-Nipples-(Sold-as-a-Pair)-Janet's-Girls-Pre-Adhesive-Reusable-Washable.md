      <li>They are so much fun.</li>
      <li>Center of nipple is good and firm but was hoping outer edges would have been softer and more flexable because they show through some of the tops that are worn.</li>

      <li>I received my nipples fast.</li>
      <li>Very teasing effect.</li>

    <li> Well ladies when everyone else says they are huge... they weren&#x27;t kidding.  Now I am reasonable enough to say that I have big breasts and the nipples to go with them... but these are huge.  FUN!!!!! but huge.  It was a way for my nips to be even for once.  Fun, flirty, especially a great fun laugh</li>
    <li> Center of nipple is good and firm but was hoping outer edges would have been softer and more flexable because they show through some of the tops that are worn.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t really stick that well.  Wish the adheasive was better</li>
    <li> Product isn&#x27;t bad, just way to big! I wasn&#x27;t expecting the erect nipples to be so huge. I did order a XL, they look good, but I need something 1/2 to maybe 2/3 the size. If you have huge breasts, this might be great for you! Very teasing effect. Nice material, and the seller was great with everything. Not worth it to return them, and the large seem to be too small... oh well, still LOTS of fun.</li>
    <li> Large nipples love them</li>
    <li> ordered size XL, very unnatural</li>
    <li> Could not be happier with nipples.  The size was perfect.</li>
    <li> These are HUGE!  The nipple, not the areola, is almost 3/4&amp;#34; across and it sticks up more than 1/2&amp;#34;.  The large size looked flat and the XL size had the look I wanted, but oh my.  These will show through anything other than a heavy winter coat.  As a sissy I relish the attention and there is no hiding these.</li>
    <li> Great Idems!!! fit great!!!</li>
    <li> Okay so the quality is great the color is a little off and these are really hugh like similar to skull candies ear bud numbs but a little bigger. Hugh but the adhesive is really good and the good materal. However does not look like a natural color for a nipple.</li>
    <li> Wow there realy nice nipples i like them.I bought the XL size..Thank you !!</li>
    <li> I received my nipples fast. I tried them out. I didn&#x27;t want to take them off they were so much fun. I wish I could just were them all the time. They are so much fun. They stay on fairly well and I imagine if the sticky stuff wears out it would be pretty easy to refresh. They are a pinkish color I wish I had a slightly darker color but I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> very nice little addition to any outfit to draw attention to your chest under almost any style top or blouse</li>
    <li> Great feel but very delicate....after a month, &amp;#34;the tip&amp;#34; broke off from the base...literally...and i was &amp;#34;so gentle with it&amp;#34;....useless now...!!!</li>
    <li> A realistic feel and they look great!</li>
    <li> It is totally not worth the money.  It is a good idea, but poorly designed.  The adhesive base is flat and does not conform to breast.  The outer edge will stick out and very unnaturally looking.  I may as well just use duct tape and cotton ball......LOL</li>
    <li> Excellent shape but the polyurethane &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; begins to come loose after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;. . . Good for occasion use but not to keep in place.</li>
