    <li> I finally found it my favorte cologne for a  long time.</li>

    <li> Fresh, crisp and pleasant scent. Perfect for men.</li>
    <li> Perfumes are not original, the Fragrances are lost very quickly after applying perfume, I bought the same fragrances in other sites and I last much longer, I feel cheated. Please return my money...Thanks</li>
    <li> es un perfume tradicional le encanta a mi papa, siempre lo ha usado y no lo cambia por ningna otra marca,</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this fragrance after it was featured in a GQ magazine article. Was disappointed to find it smelled like lemon Pine Sol and I literally threw it away after the first use.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! Manly and yet gentle.</li>
    <li> This spirit-citrus perfume reminds me of my late grandfather and still is my favourite fragrance. I wish it came back in the 1 liter presentation. Excelent and timeless product.</li>
    <li> ...that I grew up with! My mom used it on herself and all her children, and I have done the same. I love the cologne&#x27;s freshness and subtle smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for almost 30 years and it hasn&#x27;t changed in all that time. It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great scent Can&#x27;t go wrong with this - it is light, fresh and good for men or women. Reminds me of the south of France.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my Dad. He&#x27;s 82 and been using this product since I can remember. It&#x27;s the smell of gramps !!! He loves it and you cannot find this in Perfumania any longer. TATA.</li>
    <li> This is an old favorite of mine - bringing back memories of a wonderful 3 star Michelin Restaurant/Inn in Joigny, France (Cote Ste Jacque) several years back where a sampler of this was in our room for us to use and take.  It has a refreshingly woody masculine aroma that lasts several hours.  When I finished it earlier this year I vowed to get it again - hence the reason for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rated it one star less than perfect because, along with purchasing this cologne, I did a lot of research on many colognes and purchased 2 others, which from the ratings of women whom have smelled all 3, rate this as 3rd.  I do not want to diminish the attractiveness of this (Roger and Gallet) cologne - it is wonderful and I will purchase it again when it in finished - but I also have to say that the other scents did rank higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your interest, in order of ranking - they are (see my ratings of those products):&lt;br /&gt;1. Nuit del Homme - YSL - long lasting, complex, and fragrant - which has brought many amorous/favorable comments from members of the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Pour L&#x27; Homme - Versace - clean and somewhat flowery - subtle - long lasting with very nice releases of other notes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Roger and Gallet Extra Vieille - wonderful scent - very masculine with woody undertones.</li>
    <li> This is agreat fragrance , I use to buy it in Paris all most every visit .The scent is natural and not overpowering ,so glad to find it again!</li>
