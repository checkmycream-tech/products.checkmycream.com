      <li>They are a good blade for a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Was happy to find them on Amazon and the price was better than any we&#x27;d purchased before.</li>

      <li>I like it and it does a great job doing a smooth shave.</li>

      <li>3 blades were good but 4 seem better.</li>
      <li>The four blades glide across the skin, so I think the aloe strip is effective.  </li>

      <li>they have very fine vertical &amp;#34;wires&amp;#34; or guards that run perpendicular to the blades.</li>
      <li>These refills appear to be as good as the original I purchased with the razor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these are the only way to go for a saftey razor shave</li>
    <li> These blades seem to be less in quality as compared to buying them in a retail store.  They seem to dull quicker and the gel/lubricating strip falls off after a few uses. Yes they work but not as well as when I have bought them at a retail store. Are these rejects or seconds?</li>
    <li> Guys I&#x27;m gonna give you one reason why you should be using the Schick Quattro razors versus any other on the market.... protect the family jewels! SERIOUSLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re gonna use these for basic man grooming there&#x27;s one feature that sets quatteo apart... they have very fine vertical &amp;#34;wires&amp;#34; or guards that run perpendicular to the blades. When you&#x27;re using them on your nether regions that means that you won&#x27;t pinch skin or get knicks!  I&#x27;ve never found a better razor!</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because these razors leave me with a clean smooth shave every time I use them.</li>
    <li> These are SO expensive in the stores.  This was a great bargain.  Will definitely purchase these again in the future.</li>
    <li> Saved me a bunch of money.</li>
    <li> Thank you, everything good!</li>
    <li> These razor blades put Gillette to shame. They last longer and cut better than any other blade i have tried. This is coming from someone who grows a thick full faced beard. Only downside is after every swipe or two, you really have to make sure you run your thumb down the blades and under full force water to keep it from getting clogged. After making this small adjustment, it performs wonderfully. Plus, i don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my face like i do with the straight blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the $$</li>
    <li> This product work just as I expected. The blades last a long time. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> wished i could give it a zero. it does not fit with the current razor head. keeps falling off. tried with a second refill. same prob. in the end, realised it fit well with a gillette razor head instead. madness!</li>
    <li> Great razors and half the price here vs. Target.</li>
    <li> works as expected, great quality</li>
    <li> I hate shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are exactly what I needed and with Prime it could not have been more convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard some people say that anything more than 2 blades is a waste, in my case, that&#x27;s definitely not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cheap twin blades (the blue ones) for years, then one day my girl gave me a couple of packs of the disposable Quattros, six razors in all.  It was quite a revelation and they lasted well over a year and seemed to work great.  When those ran out, I figured I&#x27;d go back to the twin blades because they were cheaper and I&#x27;m a tightwad.  I picked up the Schick ST2s which looked good in the store.  When I went to shave with them in the shower, I couldn&#x27;t get the shaver to knock down the last rough areas no matter how much I ran the shaver over them.  I grabbed the last Quattro I had been using and it promptly knocked down the bristles - no sweat.  I&#x27;m sold on these things, they provide a close comfortable shave and last me for months. Value wise, these things aren&#x27;t bad either, less than $2 blade in larger quantities.  I might even try those Schick 5 bladers after my new batch of Quattros are gone, but I&#x27;m not sure how those could be much better and they are much more expensive.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> After getting a free Schick Quattro to try, I bought a pack of refills as I had a positive experience with the shaver.  However the refills feel like they are of a lower quality, lasting only a fraction of the time the original head lasted.  I feel like I was on the receiving end of a bait-and-switch scam.  Boo.  BOO.  BOOO!</li>
    <li> good refill blades for a fair price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades every since I went bald and i love them.</li>
    <li> Great price! Everything as expected. Need to watch out for price differences and calculate which of the quantities makes the best deal.</li>
    <li> I shave my head, been doing it for years and until I found these razors it was very hit or mis with comfortability vs life. I can get about 5 full face and head shaves from each blade (about 7 days of use). The only down side is the price of these has slowly been going up over the last 6 months a clear indicator that they will no longer be produced soon. *Sad Panda*</li>
    <li> great refills, especially for the money! Works well!</li>
    <li> Fabulous blades. I shave my entire head &amp; face and have thick, quick growing hair. These shave close for a full week before replacement. I was able to get this 8 refill pack online for the same price a 4 pack costs at the store.</li>
    <li> Better than their newer blades.</li>
    <li> I always cringe buying these.  They seem ecologically irresponsible to use.  However, if you have sensitive skin, desire a smooth result, and electric razors don&#x27;t work for you, there&#x27;s not much to choose from out there.  They last me a long time for leg shaving.  My leg hair is pretty fine and blonde, tho.  They last my husband about six shaves with a decently coarse beard, minus the goatee area that he trims separately.</li>
    <li> These razors fit and i&#x27;m glad to have bought it since I didnt have anymore so its a great buy.</li>
    <li> The blades are good but the real genius is frankly in the vibrating razor.  The vibration REALLY makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Cheap fast love shick</li>
    <li> Great Service, good price, Service and product as expected.</li>
    <li> Great value, Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these several times in the past from Amazon and they were great, but this time, they all were dull and it was like shaving with a cheap old fashioned razor blade. New blades gave a horrible shave and I finally threw them in the garbage. I guess Schick has lowered their quality, what a disappointment! I&#x27;ve gone back to Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> Started using a sample razor and found the shave to be great and I&#x27;m nearing a month on the first blade. The replacement blade price is a whole lot lower than the ones from the five blade people and the shave is every bit as good. Give these a try, enjoy the shave and save some bucks over a year of use.</li>
    <li> I found the place to be quite doll and overall a very poor experience</li>
    <li> everywhere ive gone to get more razor blades it has been expensive.. this was a really great deal on these and they work amazingly</li>
    <li> They did what they are suppose to do, good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;so go and buy some of these razors.</li>
    <li> Works great on the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  I like the single edge trimmer.  The 4 blade system gives me a decent shave.  I never really knew how long a blade should last before being changed but I&#x27;ve changed my blade every Friday morning for over 30 years.  Maybe that&#x27;s why these give me such a good shave.  I dunno.</li>
    <li> Nice comfortable shave.  I usually cut my face up with any new blade cartridge - not with this one.  Also, a great price.</li>
    <li> I like this razor and use the cartridges as long as possible because they&#x27;re expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using Schick Quattro blades for 3-4 years.  They gave a close smooth shave with little or no skin irritation.  The life span of the blade was great.  Some seemed to last over a month before needing replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Now, we&#x27;ve got the Quattro Titanium.  What happened???  They&#x27;re more expensive and the blades are much duller right out of the box!  What edge they do have is gone after one or two uses!  I&#x27;ve tried to bear up under the discomfort and pain, but I&#x27;ve had it.&lt;br /&gt;This is an over priced, poor quality product!</li>
    <li> I am on QUATTRO since a year ago, and I will say it is gives even more than I paid,especially I have a sensitive skin but with this one I enjoy shaving without any problem.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best razor blades I&#x27;ve used, always gives me a clean and smooth shave. At 15 plus tax these blades are 5 dollars cheaper than in stores!</li>
    <li> $11 dollars, four cartridges no razor. Not smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick up two &#x27;Quattro Titanium Razor, 2 Cartridge&#x27; starter packs each for $6.00.  Four cartridges, 2 Razors, $13 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quattro TITANIUM blades out perform both Fusion and MACH III lines. Quattro&#x27;s Titanium blade is the silkiest shave from shave to shave. This isn&#x27;t 1889 Mr. Gillette. It&#x27;s 2014. Get with the program!</li>
    <li> Simply love them and at a great price.I have bought these over and over and over and will continue to buy them til I die.</li>
    <li> Best razors for shaving my bald head. I&#x27;ve searched and searched for the perfect razor and this is it for me.</li>
    <li> I get many quality shaves from one blade. I&#x27;ve been using Schick Quattro for years. The comfort can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This is as crappy as some of the cheapest razors I have ever bought. Just goes to show you get what you pay for. I use fusion quatro blades and even though they cost four times as much their ten times better. These blades just get clogged with my hairs in know time, and unlike the fusion quatro the blades are so close together that I find it almost impossible to get my hair out of them. I finally resorted to using my toothbrush(an old one of course) to brush out the hairs from the razor so I can use it again. The good new is since switching to this I only shave twice a week. My face can&#x27;t stand any more irritation than that.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best, longest life, sharpest razor ever!</li>
    <li> Good price and received within 2 days. Nice made blades.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a groupon coupon for these, but the price was much better thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but the Titanium blades seem to last forever (at least, much longer)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints with this purchase...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Quattro for years, and I find it to be the best razor on the market.  The blades stay sharp for a couple of months, so the cost is worth it.  The four blades glide across the skin, so I think the aloe strip is effective.  I just started buying the refills on line, and it looks like I can save some money rather than purchasing them at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> These blades are my husbands favorite. They last him the longest with the best shave. So even though the cost an arm &amp; a leg, to him, they&#x27;re worth the cost in the long run. He does have a stubborn beard growth and sensitive skin, so when he finds something that he likes that works well, we stick with it!</li>
    <li> What can I say...perfect blades and they work great. Never buying blades from the store again. Cheaper by a couple of $$ and I do not have to look for parking. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Although these are getting harder to find in the store, they&#x27;re still my favorite blades. Without doubt, they have proven to me to be the best combination of a close, comfortable shave, while also being reasonable in price and lasting a very long time. I hope they don&#x27;t quit producing these!</li>
    <li> will see if the gift reciever likes them, he is picky and i hope these are not knock offs of the real brand name razor blades</li>
    <li> ...Been using these for years and it does the job well. I would recommend these as in-expensive cartridges compared to the other brands.</li>
    <li> The quality doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same as what I purchase in stores, it has hard plastic edges which make shaving a little uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> What I dislike, is that when I shave twice, through out the week, the blade starts to get dull.  I always pay around $13 for a pack of 4  blades only.  But somehow these blades get dull too fast and I wind up discarding and getting new a blade.  :(</li>
    <li> I used Gillette products from the time I started shaving. Then I got a new box of blades and they tore up my face like an old, dull razor. Realized they were now made in China. Went to the store and found Schick Quattro blades are made in Germany. Made the switch and haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updating review: I started using these, and had the same skin issues with them just not working properly right from the start. Bought a box at full price from my local brick and mortar retailer, back to no problems. Don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s a difference, but there definitely is.</li>
    <li> I tried out several razors before deciding on Schick&#x27;s Quattro Titanium. Compared to all other razors you can get at the market, Quattro simply performs the best--quicker and closer shaves. But last year, out of curiosity, I tried out the dollar shave club. What really sold me was their marketing and their customer-friendly website. I started out with their humble twin, then moved up to the Executive. In many ways the Executive is nice razor, but after 6mos of use, I realized that Quattro&#x27;s blades were better. And now that I switched back to the Quattro, the difference I feel between them is even greater! Also, at $9, the Executive is now pricier than the Quattro (thanks to Amazon!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I&#x27;m still going to order the Shave Butter from the Dollar Shave Club--which is probably the best shave cream/gel at the price ($8). I used to get Anthony&#x27;s Logistics Shave cream (which I&#x27;d highly recommend)--but at almost half the price, shave butter is the way to go. But razor-wise, I came back to Schick&#x27;s Quattro Titanium and I think I&#x27;ll stay here for awhile.</li>
    <li> These are one of my favorite razors, the give me smooth pump free shave. The price on Amazon is always the best I can find!</li>
    <li> The refills where half the price and double the amount of refills.  The refills arrived quickly too.  I am very happy as a customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades for years.  I was a bit concerned when reading some of the reviews that the product quality had changed. I have to say that the blades I received are just as excellent as they have always been.  Sharp blades that fit nicely into my old razor.  Clean close no-nick shave the first time with a four day beard.</li>
    <li> Love these blades.  I believe the very fine vertical wire across the 4 blades reduce the nicks and cuts while giving a great shave.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best buys I have had with this particular blade.  You cannot go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> I searched at various stores and only and finally figured out that I bought it for the best value from Amazon.</li>
    <li> What can I say, There Schick Quattro blades and they work great</li>
    <li> So much better than the ones marketed for women. Girls, get these!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding these locally. Was happy to find them on Amazon and the price was better than any we&#x27;d purchased before. These last a long time and give a great shave.</li>
    <li> better pricing than supermarkets..even without a coupon!&lt;br /&gt;great product and Amazon delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Din&#x27;t find the blades as sharp as Gillete ones</li>
    <li> Does the job i intended it to do.</li>
    <li> Shave me well, boy!  I&#x27;ve been using Quattros for more than 5 years.  I like them.</li>
    <li> very long lasting blades!!1</li>
    <li> These are razor blades - how does anyone rate these?</li>
    <li> everything as expected</li>
    <li> fast delivery. always like it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores at this price. Only razors that I can use on my face and head to prevent razor bumps and nicks. These blades are sharp!</li>
    <li> Just like store bought but a lot cheeper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shaving razors like you would find in a store. Nothing more, nothing less. But, these were a great value.</li>
    <li> Works well for shaving groin where you really don&#x27;t need an 18 blade expensive Fusion blade system. Only problem, I find them a one time use, at least for my needs. Don&#x27;t clog like the more expensive blades</li>
    <li> Proper replacements for the Quattro, and at a good price. This is the best cartridge shaver I&#x27;ve found, to date. These replacement cartridges are becoming hard to find in stores, so you saved me time, and money.</li>
    <li> does the job for my hard to shave beard</li>
    <li> They are the best blades available in the market. I have been using Schick Quattro since its beginning.</li>
    <li> Great deal! I&#x27;ve already recommended these to my friends and they have also purchased some when I told them what a great price they were on here.</li>
    <li> Last pretty long (I get 10-12 shaves per cartridge) and the price is right.  At this price they&#x27;re cheaper than dollar a day shave guys.  I&#x27;ve had Schick Quattro for eight years and don&#x27;t plan on switching.  The sideburn edging blade is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> New and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; shavers come out almost every day. I stopped buying new ones when the Quatro was first introduced. I love it, and like the convenience of ordering refill blades on line in the 8 count.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical that the Titanium blades were worth the extra, I am not skeptical any more. These blades seem to last many weeks longer than the non Titanium Variety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Four blades for a close shave less irritation shave&lt;br /&gt;Single blade for close edging&lt;br /&gt;Titanium makes the blades last longer with less irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Like all razors, they can cause irritation if you shave to fast or without cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these are excellent replacement blades for a good price.</li>
    <li> Must have therefore look for the best pricing.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the longest-lasting, smoothest shave around.  I wish they came in subscribe and save.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> It is all about the price!!</li>
    <li> These are quality razors but I knocked off one star as the pack included only 7 cartridges rather than the advertised 8.</li>
    <li> Same great quality that you would expect from any traditional retailer.  These refills have the lubricating strip to allow for gentle gliding on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Quattro for a number of years now (I think about five?) and have loved it every shave.  I have coarse, fast-growing hair couple with very sensitive skin and the blades usually last me about half a dozen shaves before my skin gets irritated by it. The blades are comparably priced to its competition, it&#x27;s easy to use, and the little trimmer blade is fantastic for right under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Couple this razor with some good shaving soap and a nice boar bristle brush (both CHEAP here on Amazon) and you&#x27;ll get great shaves.</li>
    <li> It seems these days that all replacement razorblades are way more expensive than they should be, so when I was down to my very last blade I actually caught a bit of a break from Amazon.</li>
    <li> These metal blade things are great! When my face becomes hairy, these devices successfully cut the hair off of my face, leaving me with a bald face. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> Got hairs that need cutted? Got a pimple that needs sliced? PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Love the quattro.  Both my husband and I use these ones.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the best Schick blade available.provide a good,close shave abit longer than other Schick blade products. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Affordable go to blade when in a hurry or traveling.  A good preshave oil makes the difference.</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite razor. 3 blades were good but 4 seem better. Edges lasts well. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great price and it&#x27;s delivered to my house.</li>
    <li> Great blades and much cheaper than I can get them locally~</li>
    <li> I get many more shaves without irritation.Well worth shoping for and I like how well the blade rinses clean after I am done shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this razor cartridge but they&#x27;re expensive at the store. You save a couple bucks online and its the same quality and packaging.</li>
    <li> Smoother than most.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very tough beard that grows very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes daily shaving is not even enough.&lt;br /&gt;Surprised these blades don&amp;#34;t last more than a few days.&lt;br /&gt;But, I can usually get one week use from one&lt;br /&gt;The discontinued disposable three blade razors gave me more value for my money.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive and make me want to try the non titanium next time.</li>
    <li> the blades stay sharp longer then the disposables I use to use</li>
    <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  Took long for delivery</li>
    <li> Tried the Quattro several years ago and have used it ever since. They are quite expensive, however, but they last a long time. I get weeks of shaves from each Quattro head so they end up being cheaper than most disposable.</li>
    <li> I order tons of stuff from Amazon.com. This makes life with kids easy. Same as getting in store but easier and more convenient. Buy these blades. I have thick, coarse hair and these are great razors to cut down my face forest.</li>
    <li> Great razors, especially the trimming blade on the back.</li>
    <li> I think they were a little old becuase a couple of them seems not to last as long as normal. THey were slightly dull. That has&lt;br /&gt;happened once in a while thru the grocery store too so it&#x27;s not the sellers fault it was a sealed pack.</li>
    <li> The price is better than locally and the Titanium is smoother than those without the titanium blade.  I don&#x27;t care for the trim blade that faces the other way since it precludes using the back of the razor to remove excess shaving cream from side burns and mustache before shaving that area.</li>
    <li> I could not find these locally; so I ordered it from Amazon.  They came in good time and in good condition.  The blades don&#x27;t seem to cut as well as they used to.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try another product.</li>
    <li> I like it and it does a great job doing a smooth shave. The only thing is after a couple of months of usage the blade goes quite a bit dull.</li>
    <li> best shave I have ever had</li>
    <li> shaves my junk real well</li>
    <li> I have been using Shick Quattro Titanium for years.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow this time, the blade life of this batch can barely last two weeks. The Shick Quattro Titanium I bought from stores in the past all last over a month without any problem.</li>
    <li> Longer life than Hydroshock 5 with comparably smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is the best product on the market, just a bit pricey...</li>
    <li> Try this: let your beard grow a bit, then shave with these blades. If you have good hearing, you&#x27;ll hear it twing as the blades slice through the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s two other major reason I buy these though - the little wires across the blades help protect against excessive razor burn or cuts, and the single blade on the back for trimming.</li>
    <li> Nothing outstanding about the cartridges, other than the fact that they give a good clean shave. Just wish hairs didn&#x27;t get caught in them so easily. I don&#x27;t get quite as many shaves out of each cartridge as I would like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Quattro for years now (around a decade I think); it was my favorite razor until about 6 months ago.  The replacement cartridges are noticeably more flimsy than they have been in the past. They break apart rather quickly before the blades have even become dull.  I kept using different Quattro replacement blades to see if I&#x27;d just gotten a bad batch. I even tried to replace the handle....all to no avail.  These blades are terribly manufactured.  My guess is that they contracted the manufacturing process out to a new company that charges less but uses cheap materials.  I&#x27;ve seen that happen in several industries today.  But, regardless of whether that is the case, the fact remains that these very expensive blades are now total crap.</li>
    <li> Very  good quality razors!</li>
    <li> This is as advertised</li>
    <li> Reorder for my son, who loves these blades. Packaged appropriately and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The easiest way for me to rate the Quattro Titanium is to compare them to their competition - Gillette. For me, the Quattro Titanium blades are better than the Mach 3 but not as good as the Fusion. If the shave from a Fusion was that much better I would go with the Fusion. However, I can barely tell a difference. So for the money you save on blades, I pick the Quattro every time.</li>
    <li> Not much I can say. I have been using these blades for many, many years and I find them the most comfortable and easiest to use. More than 4 blades seems excessive to me. I especially like the one edger blade.</li>
    <li> Yje blades arrives quickly and were a good deal for the price. High quality in a sealed box. I will buy them again</li>
    <li> These seem to be coming off of the market in local stores. They are a good blade for a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I had a chance to purchase some replacement blades at a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. If you wash your face before shaving, you can literally get 6-8 weeks of shaves with them. Also, the Titanium is so stiff that it doesn&#x27;t seem to catch and pull as much as regular blades.</li>
    <li> I used to like the Schick Quanttro blades but I used the Gillette blades for a year before they got too expensive so I bought a eight pack of the Schick Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a terrible mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are nowhere near the quality of the Schick blades I use to buy and in fact, I can prove this point.  In my travel kit I found an old Schick Quanttro shaver and blade that was several years old. This used blade had 100% better edge than the new blades I received last fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new blades do not hold an edge and do not give a good shave. People who have sensitive skin might like these blades as they are not sharp enough to cut themselves...but I have very course facial hair and these blades barely cut the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******These are clearly not the quality of Schick Quanttro blade of the past*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement cartridges are noticeably more flimsy when compared against the old blade I found in my travel kit. These blades are terribly Chinese manufactured crap My guess is that they contracted the manufacturing process out to a company that makes crap under the Schick Quanttro brand. The fact is these very expensive blades are now total crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they are counterfeit and maybe they are crap... Do not buy them</li>
    <li> I find these to be the best razor blades that I have found anywhere.The quality of the shave is close to that with a cut throat razor.</li>
    <li> Again Amazon beats retail price and the convenience. If only Amazon did not abuse its workers.  I will learn one day.</li>
    <li> its cheaper here than in any other place... and its a schick product, how can it be bad?</li>
    <li> I must admit, I took over my husbands razor blades! They give a super close shave on the underarms, legs, etc... might start ordering his instead of mine now.</li>
    <li> These are my husband&#x27;s favorite razor blades. He has a couple moles and sensitive skin, so shaving can be pretty challenging with the wrong razor, but with these he tends to get a nice smooth shave without bleeding all over the place. (I&#x27;ve had to use them on occasion, and I thought they were pretty nice too---just don&#x27;t tell him that. Haha.)</li>
    <li> These refills appear to be as good as the original I purchased with the razor. I have a medium beard and I get several shaves from one razor. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great product but a bit pricy on this web site.  Found the same item in a 4 pack of 8 blades each for $40.00.</li>
    <li> I use these to shave my legs. This razor works quite nicely and gives a smooth shave. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> these blades are huge so you can mow your facial hair down in 4 swipes, max.  You do lose a little bit of control and any sudden yanks will leave you bleeding heavily for awhile.  I do like the single trimming blade on the back.  These keep getting more expensive every few months.  I might need to start considering signing up for DollarShaveClub.com  We shall see....</li>
    <li> I bought these to use in my female battery-operated Schick Quattro razor and I am so glad they fit. These were much cheaper for me to buy than the female ones and I feel they work a lot better. I got the shave I wanted on my legs and they left me feeling nice and smooth. I also use this on my bikini line which really proved they did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint though is they seem to get a little dull quick compared to some disposables I&#x27;ve tried but overall they still last long enough for me that I feel they are worth buying especially being decently priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really never understood why women&#x27;s razors and refills cost more when they do not work as good but in my opinion I will use whatever does the job best and for the best price. I do plan on buying more of these refills when I run out and am glad they fit my razor. The funny thing is though while they fit mine, they do not fit my dad&#x27;s battery operated one and his is a Schick too so be careful when buying because they do not fit all razors, even the mens.</li>
    <li> Mine were no better and lasted no longer than a mid priced disposable</li>
    <li> shave result was a disappointment</li>
    <li> I was VERY skeptical when I first tried a four-blade Quattro Titanium cartridge (I tried it for free as part of a consumer survey). I figured how much better than a 2-blade head could it be, and figured it was a gimmick. Well, I was wrong. The Quattro Titanium gives by far the best shave I have ever had. I mean, to me it was amazing, it is so fast and smooth. Plus, I don&#x27;t think I have ever cut or nicked myself with this cartridge. I don&#x27;t often speak in superlatives, but the shave you get from this is like a whole different thing than shaving with a single or double-blade shaver, IMHO.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted with quick service. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> good deal on my favorite blades...shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> These are great blades for shaving any part of the body.  They give you a good close shave for the money and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I shave my head, so I use a lot of razors. These are just kinda Meh... Back is closed so it keeps the hair and dry skin trapped, which greatly decreases the life of the blades. I won&#x27;t buy them again</li>
    <li> Service was great and I like the product, but I happen to have an allergy to metals, so I can&#x27;t use it with out getting a bad rash on my neck and face.</li>
    <li> Cheap and good... its a shame that the price went up. My husband is not trying the 1 dollar shave club because of the price going up</li>
    <li> I actually have to agree with TDW on this 1 star review.  I&#x27;ve purchased these blades for better part of three years and absolutely loved them.  They are sharp and being titanium coated, they stay sharp for the better part of a month!  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THEN SCHICK CHANGED THE DESIGN.... or someone is importing off-brand blades because they are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I&#x27;ve noticed is in the hair clearing the blades.  Since there are so many blades, there is little room between the blades.  Usually it&#x27;s not a problem to clear the hair.  But if you look closely at the picture there are small vertical connecting bars that are across all of the blades on the front.  This means that the hair doesn&#x27;t clear and stays in the blades.  Hair stuck in the blades means that it doesn&#x27;t shave as well and it&#x27;s difficult to clear the hair.  Bad design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m on the hunt for new blades.</li>
    <li> For my face, these are the best razors out there.  A little pricey but worth it as they work so well. No cuts, bites, or scratches, just smooth long lasting shaves.</li>
    <li> Course full face medium beard and I got 16 shaves before I feel any drag at all.  No cuts, nicks or irritation.  I could get about 20 shaves per cartridge but so far the 16th shave is the one I feel the amount of drag I don&#x27;t like so I change at 16 shaves and think I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth.  I use the prep you&#x27;ll find on the Edge Gel site (with all shaving cream) and I shave against the grain from start to finish with my Quattro; again with no cuts, nicks or irritation and I have sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t say any more than once you try this razor and blades you&#x27;ll never switch.  The Schick Hydro comes in second to the Quattro...a close second.  Schick does a better job at a less expensive price than anything Gillette has on the market.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Brought this as a gift for someone who was always nicking their head when shaving. Since I have given them this razor they have not had any more nicks in their head... I would say this is a great product for the men who shave their head on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> My razor of choice.  I buy them on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I actually find that these last a decent amount of shaves, a good week if I&#x27;m shaving close to daily/one clearing of heavy stubble finished by several good shaves after. I hava relatively coarse hair and sensitive skin, so this fits well as part of my &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; shaving kit along with other premium shave items like Anthony&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really think of too much to say about razors. They work or they don&#x27;t. Below are some highlights of this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick refills fit a variety of Schick handles (always a plus when you have an odd handle lying around)&lt;br /&gt;The blade stays sharp and effective for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for the quality you get.&lt;br /&gt;The blades glide smoothly never leaving a nick.&lt;br /&gt;Great for men or women (perfect for women that don&#x27;t need to mess around with pink handles and fruity scents but want a smooth close shave without razor burn or stubble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend to all who need a reliable razor</li>
    <li> Great blades and an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for the razor.  Could not ask for better</li>
    <li> Great blades. Close shave. I like a straight razor but sometimes don&#x27;t have the time to fiddle with them. These fit the bill nicely.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have ever used. They stay sharp so much longer than Gilette for much less money.</li>
    <li> glad to find. cant find when I need</li>
    <li> These are tearing up my face.  I tried two of them.  They leaves cuts, bumps and burns.  I used the titanium ones a long while ago and they didn&#x27;t do this.  Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up.</li>
    <li> these razors are for my daughter and they work effectively and at a reasonable price. I would recommend this item to any one who uses razors</li>
    <li> not much can go wrong with this product if you have the quattro razor nice close shave every time and seem to last longer then most blades</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but it makes for s really GREAT shave. Well worth it. I would buy this product again.</li>
</ol>
