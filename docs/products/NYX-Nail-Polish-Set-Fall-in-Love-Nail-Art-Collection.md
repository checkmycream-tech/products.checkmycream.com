      <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use this yet, but I did want everyone to know that this item is only $4.99 at Ulta Beauty website and with shipping +plus free gift the total is about $11... much cheaper than the price its sold for here...</li>

<li> These bottles are super small.</li>
<li> Just the packaging alone looks expensive and the colors are just fabulous.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t spill or anything, it was just empty.</li>
<li> The reason why I gave it one star is because when I received my package, my Hunter&#x27;s Green polish was half way empty and the rest that was in the bottle was dried out.</li>
<li> I guess that isn&#x27;t a bad thing since I can barely use a big bottle without it drying up on me.  </li>
<li> It was really weird.</li>

    <li> These bottles are super small. They look like the kiddie nail polishes from the dollar store. The reason why I gave it one star is because when I received my package, my Hunter&#x27;s Green polish was half way empty and the rest that was in the bottle was dried out. It was really weird. It didn&#x27;t spill or anything, it was just empty. Also, the formula of the polish is really cheap. I had to put on three coats just to get a decent color.</li>
    <li> I like the nail polish and I tried it immediately.wonderful colors and very good texture.Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> These bottles are super tiny</li>
    <li> So cute!  Am using them for bridal shower party favors.  Adorable!</li>

    <li> Colors are great,  love the small size as I rarely make it through a full sized bottle of nail polish. This polish for me wears very well toes 1 month fingers 1 1/2 weeks sometimes 2.</li>
    <li> Tinier bottles that I realized but they polish seems to be good.  Nice selection of colors.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast!  Very cool colors and reasonable price. Ordered for young woman and she loved colors. Very &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; with today&#x27;s styles.</li>

    <li> Pretty colors but much smaller than what I expected. I guess that isn&#x27;t a bad thing since I can barely use a big bottle without it drying up on me.  I can&#x27;t wait to use them especially in the fall</li>
    <li> It peels off easily and for some reason when you wash your hands the polish turns a whitish-gray.</li>
    <li> Nice set of nail polish. I like the colors, the size is good and it lasts longer than the other brands I tried before.</li>
    <li> picture is misleading. its so tiny bottle. i was thinking it was the same size of a regular nail polish.</li>
