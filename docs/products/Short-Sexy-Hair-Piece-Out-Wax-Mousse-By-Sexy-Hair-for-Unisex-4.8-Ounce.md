      <li>I really did not like this product.  </li>
      <li>It works well for making spikes in my four year olds hair, but it is very sticky.  </li>

      <li>Not too heavy but just right!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and you just have to use a little bit at a time</li>

<li> It does work really well after I braid my hair and run a little over the braid to keep all those locks in place.</li>
<li> It really does tame the frizzies and help me &amp;#34;piece out&amp;#34; my hairstyle -- plus you only need a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> My former product was by the same company, and it kept my hair where I put it all day long, although a bit sticky.  </li>
<li> I have been using this stuff for a long time on my short, curly, flyaway hair, after the blow dryer.  </li>
<li> and I still have to rinse half of it down the drain - using too much</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for it to go flat after I blow dry it and curl it.  </li>
<li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that since it&#x27;s designed for short hair, less product should come out at once.  </li>
<li> After I blow my hair dry, I use this product per the instructions and it adds volume and style to my hair.  </li>
<li> I use it on dry hair and it gives shine, definition and piecey hold that lasts and lasts.  </li>
<li> So I like it messy/spikey in the back - this does the trick and a little goes a long way which I appreciate on my budget.  </li>
<li> I put it in my hair when it is wet and then blow dry it.</li>
<li> I have also used it a little differently from the given directions in the can...</li>
<li> I have a very short pixie cut that I like to style semi messy spiked.</li>
<li> The only downside, it can make their hair stiff.</li>
<li> The problem is I have baby fine hair that likes to sick flat to my head!  </li>
<li> and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Need only a very little amount to piece it out so it lasts forever.</li>

    <li> Great item, very hard to locate. I can&#x27;t finish my hair without it. Thank you :O)</li>
    <li> love this product!  Use it on dry hair on the first day after washing!  Get the lift I need right away!</li>
    <li> I have a very short pixie cut that I like to style semi messy spiked. The problem is I have baby fine hair that likes to sick flat to my head!  I love this product cause it gives my baby fine hair texture and body with out a lot of product feel.  I put it in my hair when it is wet and then blow dry it. A little goes along way, if you apply too much it will make your hair greasy. It starts to get really sticky as it continues to dry but eventually it stops being sticky and it gives my hair sort of a course feel with lot of body, sort of like you have been at the beach and have salt water in your hair. So glad I found this product! Shaved so much time off my hair styling routine and reduced the amount of products I have to use to get the perfect spike.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair look like short sexy hair.  Just don&#x27;t plan on letting anyone run their fingers through your hair as it&#x27;s very stiff which doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.  This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve come across in years.</li>
    <li> I have two sons that have very fine hair and cowlicks. I&#x27;ve been through about 15 other products hoping that they would hold their hair in place. None of them worked. Until I found this. It works perfectly. My husband even started using to spike his hair. You need just a little to hold all day. The only downside, it can make their hair stiff. But other than that, I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a long time on my short, curly, flyaway hair, after the blow dryer.  It really does tame the frizzies and help me &amp;#34;piece out&amp;#34; my hairstyle -- plus you only need a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the store for quite a while, so I was very happy to see it here.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and this is one product that actually helps give the allusion of having hair. I use several of the short sexy hair products.</li>
    <li> It works well for making spikes in my four year olds hair, but it is very sticky.  I can only use a SMALL amount (less than the size of an almond) for my hair.  Any more and I cannot style it at all and it gets a funky, greasy look.  It does work really well after I braid my hair and run a little over the braid to keep all those locks in place.</li>
    <li> Perfect for achieving a &#x27;piece-y&#x27; look with fine hair.... and a little goes a long way. The first time buyer may want to play with the amount dispensed the first few uses to figure out what works best. I usually purchase two at a time because I never want to be without!!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Works great for short hair!!!</li>
    <li> I have a short sassy hair do and like to flip ends up and show the pieces of my layers.  this works well for showing the pieces.  It doesn&#x27;y hold as well as I would like, by afternoon my hair has flattened out a bit but still looks ok</li>
    <li> great on fine hair after blow drying for style and body.  I use it every day-just a nickel-sized amount.  great.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product to spike my short hairdo. After blow drying, I take a small amount, rub my hands together and then run them through my hair. My hair spikes up and stays that way. I only need a light spritz of hairspray for an all day do.</li>
    <li> My headline title is deliberate not a mistake because this product is the perfect mousse for FINE hair! Gives my hair that piecey, textured look without weighing it down. Not too heavy but just right!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product for short fine hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product. So glad I was able to find it. It&#x27;s been discontinued at our local beauty supply. Told many of my clients to order this from u also as I can no longer get it for them :) thank u</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Don&#x27;t need much of it to style your hair,</li>
    <li> I received Short Sexy Hair Piece Out Wax Mousse and I love it!!! It works great!  The packaging was great and it was received before I thought it was due to come in.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I do love what this does for my pixie cut.  I have it undercut and longer on top graduating from back to front.  So I like it messy/spikey in the back - this does the trick and a little goes a long way which I appreciate on my budget.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that since it&#x27;s designed for short hair, less product should come out at once.  Just a tiny squirt in my hand and I still have to rinse half of it down the drain - using too much makes my hair look greasy.  That&#x27;s the reason I gave it 4 stars.  I&#x27;m essentially washing half the bottle down the drain :-(</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  Should have tried it when I first saw it advertised in a magazine.  Quick shipping from the seller and no hassels whatsoever.  Life should be this easy !!!!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can use on my hair with its short spikey style.  Everyone always asks me what do I use on my hair to make it &amp;#34;do that&amp;#34; and I say &amp;#34;Short Sexy Hair Piece Out&amp;#34;. I love it and so sad that they manufacturer quit making it,, but so glad I still order through Amazon and at such a great price too. I don&#x27;t know what I will do when its no longer available!</li>
    <li> So easy to use; next day, lightly wet and go.</li>
    <li> great product  can&#x27;t compare to anything else. Holds all day. Best for short spikey hair and smells good too. Absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I have short, fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take long for it to go flat after I blow dry it and curl it.  After I blow my hair dry, I use this product per the instructions and it adds volume and style to my hair.  It&#x27;s easy to use and you just have to use a little bit at a time so it lasts a long time. I would definitely recommend this hair product.</li>
    <li> Really really sticky and makes hair crunchy…</li>
    <li> My ex girlfriend was a hairdresser working at a Posh Salon. She used this on my hair to shape and hold it. It&#x27;s got a little shine and looks fantastic. $17 at places like ULTA but online it was a lot cheaper with the shipping included. Great product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now &amp; love it.  I have also used it a little differently from the given directions in the can...I put a little in my palm, then apply it evenly in my towel dried hair after shampooing, then blow dry my hair.  It gives shine, body &amp; pieceyness which I want.  Just experiment with the amount you need to use for your hair type.  Yes, I reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 bottles of this and EVERYONE of them were like water!! I went online to see if I could return them and got a disclaimer about returning hazardous products, it wouldn&#x27;t let me put in any info.</li>
    <li> I have a shorter, perky cut and this product is a dream!!!  I use it on dry hair and it gives shine, definition and piecey hold that lasts and lasts.  I like a messy look and this does the trick.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This product is terrific.  My stylist says it her favorite product in over thirty years in the business, but her distributor doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore.  Shame!  So I order it and bring it with me, so she uses it on my hair only.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great price !</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve found out there.  You just need to use very little.  Otherwise, hair gets gooey.</li>
    <li> i like this product.  has the hold and memory needed for body.  Just need a small amount.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a fauxhawk that I like to style very textured. This stuff creates perfect separation and texture without making my hair feel gunky or heavy. You only need a small amount and be sure to do it on DRY hair. Much better than the wax creams I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Grea product.  Need only a very little amount to piece it out so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I should give it no stars. I shook the can several times and even turned it upside down, but the product came out kind of syrup like, not mousse. I have used this product before, and I know how it should look. This product was defective. I would appreciate a replacement or a refund.</li>
    <li> leaves a sticky residue on your hair</li>
    <li> If you want to add definition to your haircut, this is the product for you!  And, only a dab will do ya!!!  This product emphasizes my layers and curls, but I have a friend with straight hairt who uses it also, and it gives her haircut definition, too!</li>
    <li> I really did not like this product.  I wish I could return it, but it is classified as hazardous waste, so I cannot.  It smells awful and my hair just gets sticky and clumps together.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Very very similar to a product I&#x27;ve looked for for YEARS and because it&#x27;s not made any more, I found this one.  My former product was by the same company, and it kept my hair where I put it all day long, although a bit sticky.  THIS product also keeps my hair where I put it, but does NOT leave it sticky (except at first) over the day.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. I could no longer find locally so glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  Using this I&#x27;m able to spike my fine hair!</li>
</ol>
