      <li>Love how well it works.</li>
      <li>I was so sure it was going to break within a couple uses.</li>
      <li>I think I would have done better with a barrel that is uniformly shaped instead of one that tapers off</li>

      <li>and I love to wear it</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use the gloves...it is very easy to keep your fingers away from the tool, if you can use a curling iron this is fine.</li>

      <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair, and this does the job very quickly and without a bit of frizz.</li>
      <li>It gets nice and hot.</li>
      <li>Super glad it&#x27;s still working after a year too.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Overall good curling wand. It gets super hot and has adjustable heat settings. I still need to master the perfect beach wave with it!! The glove is kinda weird, useful, but weird feeling.</li>
    <li> The barrel is shorter than I thought it would be. It works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair but it&#x27;s a little small for my longer hair</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, fine hair and I love to wear it curly but traditional curling irons or hot rollers just took too much time and never provided long-lasting curls.  But this tapered curling iron is the BEST for long-lasting beautiful curls!  It&#x27;s my go to styling tool when I want curls!</li>
    <li> I have read some pretty good reviews for other brands and thought that it would be very easy to use. I was very wrong. I dont like the fact that I cant curl the end because my fingers would get burnt-even with the glove on. It also took a very long time to do all of my hair. I have shoulder length hair, kind of thick. I am just going to go back to using my regular curling iron. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this 1&amp;#34;wand...</li>
    <li> I had to try this - not sure why.  I can&#x27;t master it so it sits unused.  I recommend using just a regular curling iron</li>
    <li> I think  it&#x27;s perfect for formal hairstyles. Not so much for beach style waves. Creates curls inmediately and if you put hairspray holds a lond time.</li>
    <li> I got the 1.5 inch barrel I think. It gets nice and hot. I can do my whole head in 30 minutes or less and it will stay that way until I wash it.  I barely have to use hairspray. It takes a little getting used to but my hair looked great on the first try. It creates more waves than banana curls&lt;br /&gt;For me. And if you want bigger more loose curls&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting a bigger barrel size.</li>
    <li> i have fine straight hair and this iron curls fast and it holds. the curls are kinky so go a size up if u want looser waves</li>
    <li> Great iron! I use a little styling cream then curl my hair and it lasts all day. I can even sleep on my curls and wake up with them still looking great.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this specific curling iron because it looks like a conehead, pretty funny, and I wanted spiral spiral curlies!! So when I got it, I immediately turned it on, put on the little black glove it came with and attempted to spiral my hairs. first impression was great, I put it on a 1 inch thick strand of hair, and bouncy bounce came down the curl.. showed my sister she thought cool. The second time I wanted to Really use it, all over.. I found it to be extremely time consuming, and ur arms get tired so u end up with a crazy cur hairstyle all over... u have to have great arms to make these look perfect. cuz like I said ur arms get really tired and u end up looking crazy.. more like some crazy waves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so yeah. guess if u have time and muscles this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Hot tools is also my second favorite brand,it gets hot!!!A great tool with good Heat is essential when curling hair and hot tools do a very nice job,it does not burn the hair and creates really nice curls,and the temperature control that can be adjusted for any type of hair..Love the curling wand and you can make your \\&quot;taylor swift hair\\&quot; your self :)</li>
    <li> I do like this curling iron, my only complaint is i bought the wrong size. For the more wavy curls I should have bought 1 size bigger. This makes pretty tight curls. You can get around it, by using thicker pieces of hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived way sooner than expected. Price was also way less than ULTA or another beauty store.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product.  I have no idea how to use it either. I have tried and tried to figure this one it....but I can&#x27;t.  It says it is a curling iron...but how do you use it?!&lt;br /&gt;There is no way I can tell people that this a good product!</li>
    <li> Great price - great product - arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Makes pretty little curls.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this curling iron and she loves it and uses it very morning before school.  thank you ok</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! Heats up quick and creates amazing curls! I like the barrel curler vs the standard ones that have a clip on it. This size gives you tight curls but not too small. Sometimes I&#x27;ll run my hands through my hair at end and pull down on curls a little if I want to stretch them out. All of my friends love using this when they come over to get ready for a girls night out!</li>
    <li> I did not have any issues with the style of the iron and found it easy to get used to working without a clamp.  But I&#x27;m really disappointed in the curls.  Instead of big and bouncy, they look tight and stringy and taper out at the ends.  My hair is on the thin side, so perhaps it is more susceptible to this type of iron.  I tried rolling all the hair around the larger end of the barrel but it doesn&#x27;t fix the problem.  I think I would have done better with a barrel that is uniformly shaped instead of one that tapers off but I was so sold on the reviews that I really wanted it to work.  I do love the adjustable setting and the long cord that swivels as you work.  I don&#x27;t think I will return it but I will likely order a new kind with a bigger barrel in the hopes that it works better.</li>
    <li> Love it, works exactly as described. My hair holds curl very well, and I have baby hair. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in Hot Tools before and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I never knew about this before! I&#x27;ve always had issues curling my hair with regular curling irons, or flat irons that say they can curl hair as well. For the longest time I would waste money by going to the salon to have curls or take the road trip to a good friend who can curl my hair for me. I&#x27;m special, for the life of me I just can&#x27;t curl hair RIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first purchase trying out a wand, and OMGosh.. it makes me feel like a professional! It curls so fast, and it stays on without additional treatment. I straighten my hair everyday and this curling takes almost as much time to straighten. SO SIMPLE and SO EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves were a nice addition as well, overall HIGHLY RECOMMEND! :D</li>
    <li> This tool heats up quickly, and maintains the temperature. Once you get used to using the glove so as not to get burned, it is easy to use. It curls the hair quickly and the curls stay in for days. I love the soft wave/curl that you get with it. Now I understand why so many stars are wearing their hair this way. You don&#x27;t have to take hours to get the look you want.</li>
    <li> Hair Stylist  andi love it. Enough said</li>
    <li> I have really liked this curling iron. The curls last a really long time. I want to get another one that is bigger for a variety but I have loved this. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My hair falls to my bra strap so I wouldn&#x27;t consider it long but its definitely not short. I felt very clumsy trying to wrap my hair around the rod enough so that the end wasn&#x27;t straight. The glove is kind of a mute point. However the curl lasted until I showered!</li>
    <li> My daughter comes home on weekends from college and borrows this curling iron.  She loves it as much as my wife does.  Now I have to buy one for her.  I just ordered, and waiting for delivery!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I loveeeee this curling iron!! It creates tight curls in my long hair. My hair is down to my waist so the curls look beautifully done. It even stays days in my hair since it gets hot up to 450 degrees. I love it!! I bought the medium sized one bc I wanted tighter curls, not wavy ones.</li>
    <li> I love this wand but the glove sucks. The curls and waves I am able to make with this wand are beautiful and I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> A regular curling iron will not hold a curl in my hair, with this tool I can go almost 2 days with super awesome curls! I have pretty long hair and this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love it it works great but after using for awhile it fall apart</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I like the variety of temperatures. I have thick hair and don&#x27;t go above 325 (I think it goes to 400). A little awkward to use at first. The glove doesn&#x27;t offer enough protection to really get your hand around the ends of your hair so they always look undone. I might wear another glove under the one provided and try that.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase but knew it would be! it gets hot fast and curls long thick hair better than the one she had</li>
    <li> heats quickly and retains constant temp...easy to manipulate iron.....highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality curling wand can&#x27;t go wrong with this product</li>
    <li> my hair stylist tried to sell me one of these at twice the price. i was a bit worried because of all the mixed reviews. more or less, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward; although it probably provides better results if someone else is doing it for you. initially, the curls are a bit tight for my liking, but i use a hair dryer to stretch the curls out a bit after i&#x27;m finished curling; and this works fine. i also have a wand of 1-in to 1 1/2-in, which gives good wavy curls; the problem is that the curls fall out by the end of the day. with this smaller one, despite/even with the extra step of stretching the curls w/ my dryer, the curls last for days. this longevity makes the 10 min to 15 min it takes to curl my whole head worth it.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting out of the use.  Maybe because I am not curling my hair right.  Hair looked awful afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love how well it works. Heats up quick and my curls hold for days. I have shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all and I love hot tools products.  The curl on this was not nice...I had better curls with one from the drugstore.  I was disappointed as I usually love all hot tools products.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a curling wand, be warned that it takes some practice and getting used to and can be kind of awkward.  First of all, I have short hair that is just above my shoulders, so it can be a little difficult to use this iron because of the fact that you have to wrap the short strands around it without managing to burn yourself.  Luckily I haven&#x27;t burned myself (yet), but I was paranoid about doing so.  The iron is very hot, so you don&#x27;t have to hold your hair in place very long.  Be sure to use a heat protector so you don&#x27;t fry your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this iron three times, and each time my hair turned out different.  I watched some tutorials on YouTube to give the best tips of how to get the kind of curl you want, which helped a lot!  I&#x27;ve decided to let my hair grow out a little more.  I think the look this wand gives hair is a little better suited for longer hair than mine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift. I researched tapered curling irons in general and this particular iron kept being referenced as the best with the best features! My research led me to Amazon because they had the best price by far from other sites.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has being using it for 6 months and is thrilled!</li>
    <li> easy to use &amp; great price</li>
    <li> My hair never holds a curl with a regular curling iron. This one holds for several hours without any product! Love it!</li>
    <li> This tool is great for getting curls that last. I can style my hair once with this wand and have nice waves for a few days with the occasional touch up. If you have long hair, I would suggest buying a thicker width barrel. You will have to use very small sections when tackling long or thick hair with this particular wand size and that can make the process take a very long time.</li>
    <li> Im one that struggles with keeping curl in her fine, straight hair.  This tool is amazing and the curl will last all day in my hair and get so many compliments about my hair when I&#x27;ve used it.  Its easy to use but I will say I don&#x27;t used the glove because its hard to grab my hair with it and get all the pieces so I have burnt my tip of my finger before on accident. Will definitely recommend this Hot Tools.</li>
    <li> The best I ever had, in fact i bought 2 different sizes, I love them so much!</li>
    <li> This came so fast, love how it works. I got the 1/2 to 1 inch my hair is right above my butt. I was about to spend 100$ on a curling wand but Im glad I found this one first! A+</li>
    <li> Very affordable and good quality!  As a stylist this is a really good easy to use iron that works well.</li>
    <li> My hair looks beautiful after every use. I have been using it for a year now and my hair does not show any damage from the heat. My hair is also very very thin and fine!!  Would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My daughter is still using this a year after I bought it.  Tried a lot of curling irons for her hard to curl hair and this one is by far the best.  Super glad it&#x27;s still working after a year too.  We have been through a lot of curling irons.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I was kind of skeptical about buying it on Amazon especially buying it at almost half the cost of regular retail price (something has to go wrong). I was so sure it was going to break within a couple uses. Its been about a year and it still works great.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my teenage daughter.  She loves it and I paid half of what it costs for the same item at ULTA.  So glad I looked here first!</li>
    <li> Worked great--while it worked. Too bad it only lasted 6 uses before it gave up the ghost.</li>
    <li> Good iron, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t love this curling iron more!  It literally curls my hair better than any other iron I&#x27;ve had.  My stick straight hair typically won&#x27;t hold curls but I was shocked after one use of this iron when my curls stayed all day!  I can really change up how tight or loose I want them by using bigger sections of hair for looser curls.  I have never had an issue with the wand type curling irons and this is no exception.  I don&#x27;t personally use the glove because I&#x27;m smart enough to keep my fingers away from the HOT part... just saying.  Overall, this is an excellent product and I&#x27;m impressed with Hot Tools.</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine straight hair!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps it curly for hours unlike other curling irons/wands&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use, must practice though</li>
    <li> Very hard to get used to. I have used this for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m still trying not to burn myself. It is just a wand without anything to hold your hair. I like the curl that it put in my hair, but my fingers pay the price. It does help to youtube on how to curl with this iron though.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. Having had professional experience with curling tools-that is not a under statement.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i expected works perfect and arrived super fast and ontime</li>
    <li> It was shipped in 2 days because of Amazon Prime ! Yes ! Super awesome !  It reduced time curling my hair to about 30-40 minutes when it used to take 1 ½ - 2 hours !  It gets hot in a matter of second !  My hair is almost to my butt and I am 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; with thick volume full hair and  I am so happy I purchased this curling iron!  You only need to hold it on for about 5 seconds, sometimes less.  The curls last for DAYS!</li>
    <li> Just need to learn how to use this to get the best hair from it. I am still learning, it is a nice hair tool if you know what you are doing.</li>
    <li> I just bought this curling iron in the slightly larger size and LOVE it. It is so easy to use (and I am NOT an expert). I was able to get great wavy curls the first time I used it. AND, because of the cool tip, I did not get burned, even without the glove. Plus, the temperature control is great!</li>
    <li> Great product.  One of the best that I have used.  The ceramic is of hit quality.  Looks real professional too</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever curl my hair as I have naturally wavy hair, but I have been trying to get different types of curls, so I figured I would invest in a curling iron. I am so glad I bought this one! The curls it creates are absolutely beautiful! I tried it today for the first time and got so many compliments on my hair! I&#x27;m not even a pro at using a curling iron,I&#x27;m a total beginner,  and it was so easy to use and the curls were perfect! I def recommend!!</li>
    <li> Super fun curling rod, pretty simple to use. Includes a glove so no burnt fingers</li>
    <li> The 1 inch to 1/2 inch was way too small for my long hair. I returned and purchased the large one. In my opinion the large is more like a medium.</li>
    <li> it was great once my friend taught me how to use it.</li>
    <li> Love how long the curls last!</li>
    <li> I give it only one star..delivery was very fast! But the picture made it seem like the barrel was thick as soon as It arrived I was disappointed it was very small and I have long thick hair..this is a curling iron for women with short hair!</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair, and to add to the mix, my hair is VERY coarse.  Curls were always disastrous for me...my hair would frizz out and poof out about three times its normal size.  Granted, it would stay curled for days, but I looked just ridiculous.  I tried regular ceramic rollers, steam rollers, every size barrel and brand of traditional curling iron imaginable...nothing would give me those beautiful, bouncy curls I so desired!  That is...until now!  I&#x27;m pretty convinced this wand harbors magic powers, because my frizzy, puffy, outrageous hair turned into Taylor Swift wavy ringlets in 20 minutes.  SO easy to use, relatively quick to style, and the curls really do stay for a LONG time!  (I&#x27;m talking all day, night, and next day kind of curls!)  I HIGHLY recommend this wand to anybody.</li>
    <li> This is a great wand. The swivel cord makes things so much easier, and I really like the range of adjustable heat for varying levels of curl definition, because sometimes it&#x27;s nice to be able to wear it a little more like beach waves. I have shoulder length, fine hair, and this does the job very quickly and without a bit of frizz. The 1&amp;#34; size is great, and the wand shape makes it really versatile.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, has a great swivel cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled, and doesn&#x27;t have anything for your hair to get caught in.</li>
    <li> This is the FIRST curling wand I have ever bought that actually curls my hair, and for the price you cant beat it! The glove works great, I wear it as a just-in-case, cause it would suck to have a burn on your hand. Wrap your hair around it, wait about 7 seconds and perfect curl. I have med-long length hair and I curled all of it in about 15-20 minutes. Since the wand is tapered, keep in mind the curls are going to be tighter, almost like beach waves, I would definitely get a larger size if looking for bigger curls, I will probably buy a larger one too, but this one is great, and the temp control is a major plus! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Don&#x27;t use the gloves...it is very easy to keep your fingers away from the tool, if you can use a curling iron this is fine. Heats up quickly and is super easy for beachy waves!</li>
    <li> Love the curler, the heat settings, the cord that rotates, pretty much everything except that I wish the glove was 2 instead of 1 and that the gloves were more heat resistant. Good product especially for the price - much more expensive locally</li>
    <li> Hair always slips off wand. I prefer my &amp;#34;bubble wand&amp;#34; made by Revlon.</li>
