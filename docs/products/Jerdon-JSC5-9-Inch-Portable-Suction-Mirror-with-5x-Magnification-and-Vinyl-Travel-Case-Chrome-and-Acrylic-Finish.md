      <li>This is a fine product.  </li>

      <li>The size is excellent, and allows for a \\&quot;whole face\\&quot; view, if you get close enough!</li>
      <li>Upon arrival I quickly inspected it and the mirror was secure in the case.</li>
      <li>Having left a mirror that I loved in a hotel I&#x27;ve been searching for another.</li>
      <li>And for such a good price.</li>

      <li>my mom can now feel more insecure about herself by the magnification of the pimples and blackheads on her face :D  </li>
      <li>but please Amazon start shipping them in bigger boxes and with more bubble wrap around them!  </li>
      <li>This is ok for the price, but we use it as a hand-held mirror, for which purpose it works fine.</li>
      <li>I really like the mirror itself and other than the problem with the glue, am happy with the product.</li>
      <li>This fogs up right away.... and has spots embedded in the image....</li>
      <li>On paper this is exactly what I needed.....</li>
      <li>The mirror fell the first day and broke into a million shards of glass.  </li>
      <li>Evidently it&#x27;s just a problem with the mirror.</li>
      <li>This suction mirror is exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Mirror fell off the backing during the first week.  </li>
      <li>Immediately after installing the Jerdon First Class 5X Suction Mirror to the tiled wall of my bath, the glass mirror fell out of the plastic housing and shattered in my bathtub.  </li>
      <li>I read all the reviews and I am very thankful that you made people aware of the mirror adhesive issue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to fix that.</li>
      <li>excellant quality and fast delivery  </li>
      <li>Was very releived to find it again as I can&#x27;t imagine travelling without it and am now using it as my makeup mirror at home.</li>
      <li>Be sure to wet the suction cups before attaching.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>it really magnifies.  </li>
      <li>NO PROBLEMS FAST SHIP WOULD RECOMMEND TO FRIEND............</li>
      <li>It held nicely but was messy.</li>
      <li>did not attach it due to the mirror being unglued but it should be ok.</li>
      <li>The manufacturer needs to use a glue that does not come loose so easily.  </li>
      <li>There was a minor problem with the light switch, but when I called service they knowledgeably and quickly provided a simple solution.  </li>
      <li>I had purchased this product previously from Brookstone and when my sister in law fell in love with it I gave it to her.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommemd</li>
      <li>I tested the suction cups on our bathroom mirror, and they seem to work fine, but we decided not to take a chance and only use it as a hand-held mirror.</li>
      <li>I especially like that it is big enough to see most of your face.  </li>
      <li>The mirror was okay as far as the magnifying, but the suction cup was not very good</li>
      <li>Just what I needed  this mirror is clear and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was not seriously injured, but the impact caused a very deep and wide cut on the surface of the tub.  </li>
      <li>Uses it frequently.</li>
      <li>My BIG complaint is that most of the time it is not delivered intact.  </li>
      <li>It finally broke on its last fatal decent, when it fell to the counter, rolled off, and hit the marble floor about 30\\&quot; below.</li>
      <li>Price-wise, this is a very cheap mirror, especially for its large size, but the cheapness of its glass makes it a very poor purchase, indeed.</li>
      <li>I have had to purchase more because I take it with me on vacation and accidentally leave it behind.</li>
      <li>It is way too heavy to hold up during a makeup application, too large to store easily, and I&#x27;m afraid to just stick it to the main mirror after reading the comments about shattered glass in the bathroom.  </li>

<li> All in all, a disappointment that&#x27;s probably too much trouble/expense to return.</li>
<li> I inherited this mirror from my Mom in 1991 and used it until a few months ago when it fell from the bathroom wall mirror, to which it was attached, to the floor and broke.</li>

    <li> Immediately after installing the Jerdon First Class 5X Suction Mirror to the tiled wall of my bath, the glass mirror fell out of the plastic housing and shattered in my bathtub.  Luckily, I was not seriously injured, but the impact caused a very deep and wide cut on the surface of the tub.  I am waiting to hear back from Jerdon Products as to how they plan to remedy my situation.</li>
    <li> Do not buy these, I bought 2 and used the suction cups to put them on 2 showers. By the time I got home a few hours later they both fell off the shower tile and the glass was shattered all over both of my shower floors.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this mirror several times.  All my older relatives love it to shave with etc etc.      My BIG complaint is that most of the time it is not delivered intact.  Amazon has reshipped them to me at no cost but please Amazon start shipping them in bigger boxes and with more bubble wrap around them!  This latest replacement was also broken!  The box was shipped USPS and the box was covered with grease as well!  Yuck!  The grease had seeped into the inside of the box.  AND no big surprise the items were damaged.  One had a fracture on the inside glass and the acrylic frame was damaged too.  The other mirror (glass part) popped out of the acrylic frame.  I called amazon and they refunded my money and told me to order them again.  This is annoying and I&#x27;m not sure I want to risk it.</li>
    <li> I can finally see well enough to wear eye makeup again!</li>
    <li> my mom can now feel more insecure about herself by the magnification of the pimples and blackheads on her face :D  does the job.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product previously from Brookstone and when my sister in law fell in love with it I gave it to her. At that time I didn&#x27;t know that Brookstone was no longer carrying it. Was very releived to find it again as I can&#x27;t imagine travelling without it and am now using it as my makeup mirror at home. What&#x27;s so great about it is you can set it up to suit your own height.</li>
    <li> We had the same mirror for YEARS and the suction cups finally gave out.  The mirror fell &amp; the glass broke.  Went to Amazon, not remembering the brandname, and VOILA!, the mirror of our choice popped up.  The response time was immediate, the product sent within days, and it&#x27;s perfect!  Very impressive.</li>
    <li> Good price and arrived quickly, like most Amazon orders.  However, the product looks like it has been used and repaired before, with moisture behind the mirror and scuffing along the frame.  It is way too heavy to hold up during a makeup application, too large to store easily, and I&#x27;m afraid to just stick it to the main mirror after reading the comments about shattered glass in the bathroom.  It also distorts around the edges, unlike the 6\\&quot; mirror that I was trying to replace.    All in all, a disappointment that&#x27;s probably too much trouble/expense to return.</li>
    <li> This is a greatt little magnifying mirror.  I originally bought it as a travel mirror, but, found it&#x27;s size to be more than adequate for my home needs also.</li>
    <li> This mirror seems to produce somewhat of a distortion when not in the exact position of being centered and right on top of it when looking into it. The size is excellent, and allows for a \\&quot;whole face\\&quot; view, if you get close enough!</li>
    <li> I wish it was anti fog. Also the suction cups aren&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> The mirror fell the first day and broke into a million shards of glass.  I had placed it on a tile wall.</li>
    <li> When the mirror arrived, the mirror had come unglued from its base.  We have reglued it but it is again coming unglued.  The manufacturer needs to use a glue that does not come loose so easily.  I really like the mirror itself and other than the problem with the glue, am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> well made and perfect power for closer viewing</li>
    <li> No problem with the mirror itself but the mirror was unglued from the base. &lt;br /&gt;Rather than return I will use some type of glue to repair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will let Jerdon know of this via their site. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This mirror does the job...it really magnifies.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did not attach it due to the mirror being unglued but it should be ok.</li>
    <li> This is ok for the price, but we use it as a hand-held mirror, for which purpose it works fine. Like other customers, I found that the mirror was unglued from the frame when the product arrived. It&#x27;s easy enough to fix that. I tested the suction cups on our bathroom mirror, and they seem to work fine, but we decided not to take a chance and only use it as a hand-held mirror.</li>
    <li> I inherited this mirror from my Mom in 1991 and used it until a few months ago when it fell from the bathroom wall mirror, to which it was attached, to the floor and broke. It did fall several times over the years but those falls only slightly chipped the acrylic surround. The difference is the distance fallen. It usually only fell about 15\\&quot; from the wall mirror to the granite vanity counter. It finally broke on its last fatal decent, when it fell to the counter, rolled off, and hit the marble floor about 30\\&quot; below. I am buying it again today. Be sure to wet the suction cups before attaching.</li>
    <li> Having left a mirror that I loved in a hotel I&#x27;ve been searching for another. I like that this mirror is big and that it has 3 suction cups so it doesn&#x27;t flop down like another I tried but the image is distorted. I thought maybe I had selected the wrong magnification so I went to a local store to try out different magnifications to see what I needed and the 5x does the trick. Evidently it&#x27;s just a problem with the mirror.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and I am very thankful that you made people aware of the mirror adhesive issue. However, I did order it since this was the perfect mirror for my shower. Upon arrival I quickly inspected it and the mirror was secure in the case. I have it suctioned to a glass shower wall and it has fallen once but the glass did not shatter (thank goodness). I do keep on checking to see if the heat from the shower will separate the mirror from the case but nothing yet. Maybe Jerdon changed the glue they were using after hearing the complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the honest reviews that have been posted.</li>
    <li> I love it, use it every day, couldn&#x27;t see without it.</li>
    <li> While using to shave at the sink, the mirror fell out of bracket and broke into hundreds of pieces on the floor.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Arrived as promised! I would recommend this mirror to a friend. I don&#x27;t dislike anything about this mirror.</li>
    <li> This fogs up right away.... and has spots embedded in the image.... I even bought an anti fog spray hoping this would cure the issue.  it did not. On paper this is exactly what I needed..... in reality it had no value.</li>
    <li> My husband has had this up on the bathroom mirror forever. Uses it frequently. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, and I can&#x27;t lean forward enough to get close enough to use it.</li>
    <li> The product is very nice, but it was not what I needed. Returning it was so easy. thanks</li>
    <li> I ordered two and they were to come in thrie own plastic travel case, well one did the other was in a gallon size ziplock bag...... Hummmm?</li>
    <li> Put it on our camper mirror so I could have magnification. It&#x27;s a good size and the suction is very strong.</li>
    <li> Works great. Good suction cups.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed  this mirror is clear and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend anyone who needs a magnifiing mirror to try this one</li>
    <li> could not be happier with purchase</li>
    <li> Great mirror...exactly what I needed.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> ......LOVE IT GREAT NO PROBLEMS FAST SHIP WOULD RECOMMEND TO FRIEND............</li>
    <li> Mirror came loose from mounting within a week.</li>
    <li> This goes with me everywhere I travel.</li>
    <li> Bought this for travel, works like a charm and is easy to carry.  I especially like that it is big enough to see most of your face.  I&#x27;ve used smaller mirrors for travel and it is hard to apply makeup when you can only see a tiny portion of your face.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  Distortion is so bad I could not use the mirror and returned it.</li>
    <li> Mirror fell off the backing during the first week.  Can still use it but afraid it will fall apart and break with  use.</li>
    <li> excellant quality and fast delivery  I  use it every day 3 suction cups very nice no worries of it falling off mirror i put it on the bathroom morror thank you</li>
    <li> I have two of these! I have one on my husband&#x27;s mirror and one on mine.  I have had to purchase more because I take it with me on vacation and accidentally leave it behind. I hate having to put my make up on without it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Bath Mirror I have ever own, and the most secure mirror with three suction cup, which is great.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for me to put on makeup.</li>
    <li> Such a value.  With my aging eyes, now I can see to put on my makeup.  And for such a good price.</li>
    <li> Love it - just what I wanted !!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travelling with good suction cups.  Shipment arrived sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> This is an Excellent mirror if you can&#x27;t see your self with-out glasses!  I only have vision in one eye and the other eye I don&#x27;t have very good vision.   So, therefore I can&#x27;t say enought about the mirrors since it helps me to put on my makeup and even try to see in my eye if I got something in it.  Its really nice because you can take in any where and stick it on practily any surface.  Great for home or travel!!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks again....</li>
    <li> The mirror was unglued from the backing when I took it out of the package.  I glued it together with Liquid Nails.  It held nicely but was messy. The mirror fell from the tiled shower wall and broke in less than 24 hours from when I installed it.  I can now see my many shower mirror are plastic. This mirror is too heavy to to be held by the suction cups and glass is dangerous in the shower as it will certainly shatter.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 5x magnigying mirror years ago. I love it for applying makeup. When my daughter-in-law was visiting, she liked it too. It suctions onto the existing mirror in the bathroom. I sent her one for her birthday from Amazon along with other gifts. She likes hers as well.    Jeanne Moss</li>
    <li> this Mirror is good for putting on make up</li>
    <li> i Love the size and it sticks to the mirror and doesn&#x27;t fall off even after 1 month. I would highly recommemd</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a mirror that reflects the image at the advertised magnification and sticks well. What else can you say</li>
    <li> Just as pictured works well</li>
    <li> One look into this 5X magnification bathroom mirror told me how poor its quality is. The wavy image of my face looking back reminded me of a funhouse mirror. Price-wise, this is a very cheap mirror, especially for its large size, but the cheapness of its glass makes it a very poor purchase, indeed.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Sometimes scare myself when I look in the mirror because I&#x27;m a giant.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product.  There was a minor problem with the light switch, but when I called service they knowledgeably and quickly provided a simple solution.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The mirror was okay as far as the magnifying, but the suction cup was not very good and it fell and broke.  Don&#x27;t plan to get another one.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought the 10 times magnification, but this does the trick and 10 times would really look scary! (The wrinkles are quite prominent). this definitely helps with applying mascara and eye liner.</li>
    <li> This suction mirror is exactly what we were looking for.  It was shipped very fast and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Mirror was good, but suction cups sucked ... did not hold. Mirror fell off shower wall and shattered. I followed directions to the letter.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. Seems to work well in all types of showers.</li>
