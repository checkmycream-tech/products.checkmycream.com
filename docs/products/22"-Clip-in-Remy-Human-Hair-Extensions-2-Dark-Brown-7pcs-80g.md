<li> Only thing is its a little thin, buy two pack so it can look full but</li>

<li> I have bought one other pair,</li>
<li> These were extremely thin.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
<li> She even shipped them three weeks before the expected date!</li>
<li> Definitely not worth what I paid for.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re thick enough for medium hair.</li>

    <li> The color matched perfectly. Their easy to straighten, the texture is amazing. Only thing is its a little thin, buy two pack so it can look full but other then that there wonderful. %100 human hair</li>
    <li> First pack of hair was thin , bought a second pack it made my hair look alittle better but it still wasn&#x27;t worth it .. Save your money guys buy your hair from the stores</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe they are a hundred percent human hair but they the do well to heat.</li>
    <li> too thin don&#x27;t waste your money this should not be sell on amazon</li>
    <li> Great quality, and heavier weight for the price, easy to style and color. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I liked my hair but the only problem is that there so thin &amp; they have alots of fall out .. other then that its okay.</li>
    <li> Im going to give them a 4 star , if you have thick hair i recommend to buy 3-4 packets for  fuller hair , the ends of the hair are really chopped of bad its 100% remy human hair though , they were a day late other that that great service (:</li>
    <li> I think these are wonderful! I have bought one other pair, the one problem I had was a clip broke, but that was an easy fix! I think that these are amazing for their price! She even shipped them three weeks before the expected date! They are kind of thin, but I have thin hair so it all worked out. i dyed my other pair twice and they still felt amazing and looked completely real.(: I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Love them the hair was beautiful. it is real hair I accidentally burnt it tending a fire stunk like burnt hair and we&#x27;ll burnt like really hair.will order a replacement soon.it was really long and pretty.</li>
    <li> I love everything about the extensions (:&lt;br /&gt;- Just one problem , Needs more hair on clips .</li>
    <li> These are great I wear them all the time they blend perfectly with my hair color and the look and feel of them is so natural. I have even bought a set for a friend and she lo es them.</li>
    <li> Love my hair. Got it preety fast and plus it was cheap at sallys it was like 100 dollars can&#x27;t beat that at all omg I recommend this even. Though its thin but still love it</li>
    <li> I ordered 22 inch hair extensions, and recieved 18 inch hair extensions. The extensions are really thin. Was not happy.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this based on all the poor reviews, but went ahead and bought it anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did. They&#x27;re very nice and blend well with my natural hair. The pieces are thin, but that&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t see clips and so they blend well with your natural hair. Hair came on time, was perfect color and looks amazing in my hair.</li>
    <li> This extensions suuck I dont recommend them to anyone they are really really thin I mean thin like 4 hairs on them</li>
    <li> Waste of money for sure! Was only $28.00 but was not worth it. I bought them looking forward to being great, helk no! Worst purchase I ever made. Sorry not sorry</li>
    <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t look like the picture! Very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> The definitely lose their length and become about 18\\&quot; after a month. they also do not dye very well at all. I tried to lighten them and each time it&#x27;d still be a brown, a pretty brown but still too dark. These are great new though, they just wear out fast.</li>
    <li> These were extremely thin.&lt;br /&gt;When I took them out of the package they didn&#x27;t even have the clips on them.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest waste of money I&#x27;ve ever spent&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would of read the other reviews more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy from this company unless you want to waste your money.</li>
    <li> I could only where this hair once this hair was definitely not 100%  human hair I want a refund or the right brand one that is 100% human hair. The hair matted and became course after one wash. The seller was not true to the product description</li>
    <li> Terrible terrible terrible. NOT clip ins and it&#x27;s all one giant strand so if I want to use them I need to sew the clips in and cut the hair myself, plus the ends are super thin definitely not 22 inches. WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> Good length, not as thick as I expected them to be but they&#x27;re very manageable and in good condition. They&#x27;re thick enough for medium hair.</li>
    <li> Looks great n feels nice n soft</li>
    <li> Its real hair, but its such a small amount.. You can tell you&#x27;re wearing extensions with these.. But they&#x27;re still good.. I&#x27;ve worm then twice so far..</li>
    <li> love this hair. it came earlier than expected and i was plesently supprised by the quality for the price. I will buy again from this seller</li>
    <li> They are not clip in. They are rlly not that long because they thin out at the bottom.</li>
    <li> Some of these are not human hair ...these were. Love them.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I was looking for! I love them! They are the perfect length and color! Very comfortable to wear!</li>
    <li> By far the worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever bought.  They&#x27;re too thin and look nasty I would never wear in public. The sewing of the clip was done poorly.  I threw the extensions in the trash where they belong! !</li>
    <li> I guess for the price they&#x27;re good but I&#x27;ve had them for 3 weeks and they&#x27;re already wearing down.&lt;br /&gt;But again for this price it&#x27;s understandable .</li>
    <li> If I could give it no stars, I would. The clips are too thick, they slip right out. They are so thin, you would need 14 pieces to make this look good. AND there is a reason they don&#x27;t show you the ends of the extensions.. They are so thin, it&#x27;s unreal.</li>
    <li> The clips are big.  I prefer the smaller clips but the hair is good condition.  I had to take out the big clips and buy small clips and sew them in.</li>
    <li> Very thin not worth  the purchase</li>
    <li> I was a little wary about purchasing hair extensions online as I know that they can sometimes not be as high quality but I received these extensions today and they are absolutely beautiful. Soft and true to color; I am in love. They are thin, but so are the ones you can get at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply. Whenever I get a new set of extensions I always buy a clipped set and then tracks so that I can customize my own thickness of extensions. these extensions are beautiful and the clips are not as big as the other reviews had led me to believe. Would definitely purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I got these because they were cheap and I wanted to see how I liked clip-ins and I was highly satisfied. I read reviews and it was questionable mainly because I don&#x27;t have thin hair. I resulted to buying two packs and second will really make a difference.</li>
    <li> The clips are not on the extensions</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking the deal was too good to be true.  Guess what? It was! These extensions were so thin that the entire package of them was mailed to me in a 3x2x1 box. I&#x27;ve bought synthetic before and one-two tracks were equal to the entire package of these. If I were to put these in my hair, I would look awful and like my hair was falling out.Wish I would of never opened the package so I could return to sender.</li>
    <li> Hair was very thin, but it was in great condition. They were about what I would expect for the price.</li>
    <li> Very thin, I had to cut it because the ends were so thin... Haven&#x27;t used once, I feel I need to buy another package to blend better!</li>
    <li> I loved them. They are very real and easy to attach. I died them because the color I selected was wrong and it was ok. The seller was great and she sent them to me 3 weeks before the specified date. She&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Every clip fell out. Sheaded bad!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality and  well used by my girl.</li>
    <li> These are soooo long, I had to trim mine a bit to make them look more natural. They are also very thin, which was fine for me because I have thin hair. I would say that they are worth the money though!</li>
    <li> the hair was not thick as expected it was qjite thin not good gualty.would not reordrer this item very disappointed</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved my extentions! I would highly recommend. If you have thick hair i would suggest two sets, but i have about a medium thickness and they were awesome.</li>
    <li> Not good at all, very thin hair. Looks like i have strands of hair, dont recomend these</li>
    <li> I used hair extensions almost everyday and I bought these extensions for length and thickness however the length was perfect but the extensions were super thin! I took them our one night and they got really tangled so tangled that I cant even use them anymore. Maybe my product was defective or something but I would save my money next time. Invest in better extensions , I was extremely disappointed its not a product I would but again.</li>
    <li> I love these hair extensions. Such a good value, and so pretty. I highly recommend! I don&#x27;t think you could find a better deal!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the cost...</li>
    <li> The description and even the packaging say clip ins but mine did not come with clips, just a long weft. Granted, it&#x27;s only 80g but the ends are way too thin. I&#x27;ve bought the same amount and better quality for way less. Definitely not worth what I paid for. Only reason I&#x27;m not returning is because I have clips to use.</li>
