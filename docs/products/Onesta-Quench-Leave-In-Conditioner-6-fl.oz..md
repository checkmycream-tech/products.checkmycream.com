    <li> Great leave in, makes hair feel silky.  Careful dont spray too much though, or it will make your hair too floppy especially if you have fine straight hair.  If you have curly frizzy hair, you could probably use more.  I love this along with Onesta&lt;br /&gt;Luma applied just to the ends for extra protection.</li>
    <li> After years of using the phytologie leave-in conditioner, I tried this one and am a huge fan! I have color treated hair and have found it difficult for a product to strike the right balance of conditioning without making my hair feel greasy. This product is light and gets the job done! It makes my hair feel very, very soft without getting oily and I often use it alone without other styling products to blow out my hair. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product goes on very light and works great.  It leaves my hair very soft and healthy, high recommend it for fine wavy hair.</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy, flimsy hair like I do, this product will help you immensely!</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural product.</li>
    <li> Really like onesta products.</li>
    <li> I use this leave-in condition on my sisterlocks after washing or as a refresher in-between washes.  It always leaves my hair soft and moisturized.  I discovered this product because my hair stylist uses this product on all her clients.</li>
    <li> Will leave a nice shine and helps control those fly aways. Nice product, love it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels soft, easy to comb and wonderful after using this product. Love the amazing smell also! Great Product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried too many leave-in conditioners, but this one is very nice. The spray is fine, so it covers alot of territory and goes where you want it and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or weighed down. I have long, curly, thick hair so it&#x27;s perfect for me and use it every day before applying any other styling products on my hair.

    <li> I have fine hair. Most conditioners I have used just weigh it down after 2 - 3 uses.  Onesta Leave-in conditioner leaves my hair looking great and plumped.</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes my hair, but NOT my scalp...it may even be causing my dandruff.. looking for another product to replace this one...</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with 4b/c hair, this product is clearly not designed for all hair types. The advertisement claims it is, but it is not. It is loaded with silicones, which irritated my scalp and caused it to itch tremendously. I could not continue use, which was a shame because it smelled very nice.</li>
    <li> the bottles are getting smaller, yet the prices continue to rise. However, Onesta products are the only Product I use. Seller A++++++++</li>
    <li> great product for a humid climate</li>
    <li> I have fine hair.  My hair feels great after using any Onesta product, and I always feel good using these products knowing they are free of many chemicals recommended to avoid. The Leave-In Conditioner is great especially to detangle hair after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Ugh.... That is all...</li>
