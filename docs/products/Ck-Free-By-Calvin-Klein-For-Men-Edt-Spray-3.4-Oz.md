      <li>Liked it so much.</li>
      <li>I have used CK Free, CK Escape, CK BE, CK One.</li>

      <li>The price was much cheaper than I would have paid at the store, and it&#x27;s the same great scent!</li>
      <li>Excellent fragance even thoug it does not last much</li>
      <li>sillage is great early on and then fades after the first hour.  </li>
      <li>Grab some CKFree, it is totally worth every scent!</li>
      <li>It was in the original box, well wrapped in the shear plastic cover as well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite on him, since it&#x27;s the scent I always remember from when we first met.  </li>

      <li>Nice, clean, fresh and decently priced.</li>

      <li>I was sceptical at first because it is roughly $30 cheaper than at Macy&#x27;s, but when I recieved it and compared it with a sample, I found that it is THE CK Free that smells so good.  </li>
      <li>great product, alot of compliments, very light fragrance, not very overpowering, almost a mild soap after shower smell,cant get it anywhere  is only dislike.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price, packaged well, free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I loved the fragrance and it was delivered really fast even with the standard shipping</li>
      <li>/&gt;But next time I would pick a more special one.</li>
      <li>This cologne is very mellow and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>i have been tryin&#x27; to get a nice clean smell that can last the whole day, once i tried this one i felt very sastisfied.</li>
      <li>Well,at least, new to me, very warm fragrance, not at all overpowering, even my mom agrees!</li>
      <li>I smell a strong woody musk and clean white linens.</li>
      <li>The kenneth cole reaction is a better choice if you are looking for something mellow and clean, and want it to last for the whole day.</li>
      <li>Got it as a gift, but honestly it smells like those cheap cologne ,does not last more than few min on the skin.not recommended</li>
      <li>Great smell, subtle and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Well balanced, masculine, clean fresh scent</li>

      <li>My husband likes it and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I bought this  for my son and he is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a show stopper but certainly capable of getting compliments.</li>
      <li>You will have to shell out 10-15 bucks more if you buy in Macy&#x27;s or any other store.</li>
      <li>cant find this product anywhere else cheaper than here, more ounces for less price than department store&lt;br /&gt;reccomend</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for few years now, its pretty good in this price range. You will have to shell out 10-15 bucks more if you buy in Macy&#x27;s or any other store.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I love it. I bought this  for my son and he is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. Thank you</li>
    <li> My wife works in the cosmetics industry and as a result I have access to a constant supply of new fragrances.  This cologne is very mellow and clean smelling.  This would work well as a primary fragrance for someone who doesn&#x27;t want anything too overpowering or remarkable, yet smells very nice.  Everybody likes this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this fragrance is that it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  By lunchtime, if you give your wrist a sniff to see if the scent is still there you will notice that it is gone.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i like this one.  If i had to pay for it though rather than getting it for free, i might not be completely satisfied.  The kenneth cole reaction is a better choice if you are looking for something mellow and clean, and want it to last for the whole day.</li>
    <li> The real deal!  Despite the cheap cost, this is no knock-off; this is the real CK Free in its largest size bottle.  I was sceptical at first because it is roughly $30 cheaper than at Macy&#x27;s, but when I recieved it and compared it with a sample, I found that it is THE CK Free that smells so good.  I highly recomend this, it is the best deal and will save you a pant load.  (At Macy&#x27;s the smallest size, the 1oz. bottle, costs $32 and this, the largest size, 3.4oz. bottle costs $37)</li>
    <li> CK free is my go too cologne whenever i need to be somewhere fast and didnt tidy up before heading out, it is a great scent that should be considered CK&#x27;s top cologne, very nice smell that is not too powerful and not too weak, perfect cologne all year round</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend on mine, and can&#x27;t say how it smells but I believe it is authentic.  It was in the original box, well wrapped in the shear plastic cover as well.  I agree with the other reviews and think this is the original one by CK.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love CK Free. It just smells so fresh and clean, and it&#x27;s never overwhelming or cloying.  If you&#x27;re like me and you prefer to smell fresh rather than musky, this is a great cologne for you.  If you want something that people will notice immediately upon entering the room, though, it may not be the best option for you.  It can be a little subtle, so you won&#x27;t get a ton of attention for wearing it. That being said, people who do notice it will almost universally like it.  Of course, with any scent, you should probably smell it before buying, but this is one I can honestly say just about any guy will not hate. Not every guy will love it, nor will every woman, but I can&#x27;t imagine disliking this scent.  I think it smells like a waterfall looks like, if that makes any sense.</li>
    <li> My husband loved the scent!  It was a Christmas present and it arrived as promised!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Have used for several years........when it cost an arm and leg......still subtle, and not over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great service....ordered he balm also,,,,,,,,,again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love cologne that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;get there b4 you do&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great smell, subtle and fresh.  Best for warm weather. I can&#x27;t say it will last all day but i only want those who get really close to know what i smell like anyways, so this works for me.</li>
    <li> Got for my bfs bday and he loves it! I do too;)</li>
    <li> First bottle, my husband got it as a gift from our son and loved it; this is the second bottle I bought it for his birthday. He likes it very much!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this particular fragrance by CK for some time now, had tried in few CK stores and Perfumania shops, but even after the sale they were offering I found it costly. The price here was great and I ordered it instantly. I loved the fragrance and it was delivered really fast even with the standard shipping</li>
    <li> great product, alot of compliments, very light fragrance, not very overpowering, almost a mild soap after shower smell,cant get it anywhere  is only dislike.</li>
    <li> i have been a CK consumer for the past 5 years &amp; I love the way it smells. its not overpowering fragrance &amp; it will not give you a headache smelling it all day. I have used CK Free, CK Escape, CK BE, CK One.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne as a birthday present for my buddies son. It is what he wanted and it does smell nice.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and the way it smells because it smells nice and will buy it again if I need it&lt;br /&gt;  sam,jacksonville</li>
    <li> For me, this fragrance works well for most any occasion I will find myself in. I use it for work and when going out casually/socializing. It is slightly woodsy, which I prefer, with some herbal &amp; floral notes for a rounding of its overall olfactory impression, good, casual fragrance. The one shortcoming that this fragrance has is that, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long although I have received compliments in the past so someone is noticing.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for me friend&#x27;s birthday.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good quality and good brand.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it a lot.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best cologne ever. The premise of this product is it is a light scent, not strong, non odoriferous, non pungent and just noticeable.......this is the perfect cologne for the office or for men who don&#x27;t want their cologne making contact with people before they do themselves. Well balanced, masculine, clean fresh scent this one.......5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love the clean smell of this cologne.  My husband ran out of it, and I couldn&#x27;t find it at a local store, so I ordered it, and it&#x27;s great!  The price was much cheaper than I would have paid at the store, and it&#x27;s the same great scent!</li>
    <li> I normally purchase all my colognes at stores. This time I gave it a try with Amazon. Same quality as in stores</li>
    <li> I recently bought 3 of these perfumes and I was shocked to find out that the fragrance is completely different that what you get at a departmental stores for $50. Do not fall into this trap. If you dont believe me then order one and do a sniff test yourself...</li>
    <li> As far as my boyfriend and I knew, this cologne had been discontinued.  It&#x27;s my favorite on him, since it&#x27;s the scent I always remember from when we first met.  He began to run low on it and only used it on occasion and he told me it was discontinued.  I was sad and decided to do some research. Lo and behold! Amazon has it!!! I bought him some for Christmas and he was ecstatic (:&lt;br /&gt;I love this scent.</li>
    <li> Its awesome as always.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift, but honestly it smells like those cheap cologne ,does not last more than few min on the skin.not recommended</li>
    <li> Smells like one of Adidas sport perfume, but this one lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a normal smell, just keeping you from smelling bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But next time I would pick a more special one.</li>
    <li> very good fragrance, fresher and lasts over time, I placed it in the morning before going to work and return at night still feels</li>
    <li> Fast delivery at a great price. I absolutely love this stuff and this was the best buy I ever got on it. I hope they can keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I received this the first time as a gift when we were on the way back from the Bahamas.  Amazon price beat the duty free price.  And momma likes the scent of this, so I replaced the empty bottle with a new one.  Cause if momma ain&#x27;t happy....well, you get it.  Reasonable price, packaged well, free shipping.  Amazon is boring me with their customer service and pricing program.  I&#x27;m going to have to find something to gripe about eventually.</li>
    <li> Guys, CK Free is one of my top fragrances... It is almost intoxicating..!!  I only wish it lasted longer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle, Free offers that clean fresh smell with a blend of citrus, juniper, woodsy, and (call me crazy) leather.  It is truly a pleasant scent that will work in all seasons and for any occasion.  The only downside is the longevity - lasting only about 4 hours (at most).  The projection/sillage is great early on and then fades after the first hour.  Our noses are all different - in my opinion, Free differs from the other CK fragrances I own (probably 5 others) in that it is not as \\&quot;sweet\\&quot;, or I detect less floral notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early on, Free has potential \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;. I have not received compliments, but Sweetie gives two thumbs up.  The interesting thing here, she is not a huge fan of the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents - she prefers the \\&quot;musk\\&quot; or \\&quot;spice\\&quot; scents.  To reiterate, it has potential..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the fragrance/scent, the bottle is one of my favorites.  Other than the CK logo, the bottle is totally clear showing the clarity of the fragrance.  It may be my favorite bottle in my collection.  Additionally, the packaging is above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give CK Free 4.2 stars out of 5 stars.  The scent is one of my favorites.  If the longevity were better, Free would clearly be in my Top 5.  It is a long way to the top if you want to rock-n-roll.</li>
    <li> A perfect gift for any occasion. Smells fresh and not too strong. My husband likes it and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered the next day!&lt;br /&gt;AWSOME!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> cant find this product anywhere else cheaper than here, more ounces for less price than department store&lt;br /&gt;reccomend to anyone who like ckfree</li>
    <li> This is the real deal! Good cologne that smells great and last all day. The ladies love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cologne...not overpowering and the price is great. This is the second bottle I have purchased for my 18 year old son (this year) so I know it&#x27;s a favorite of his as well.</li>
    <li> My older son, who is 7 years old, uses this parfum almost every day. It&#x27;s smooth, very light and perfect for a daily usage.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for at a great price.  I would buy this item again when needed.</li>
    <li> I feel the scent is light at first and then it gets into the middle and base notes it becomes much stronger. It seems like it almost disappears shortly after applying which may be some of the negative reviews online. Then it picks up I smell a strong woody musk and clean white linens. There is a hint of sweetness and a background of coffee. I will wear it as a casual fragrance when I want a nice clean scent. The price was great as was the packaging.</li>
    <li> I like very much, my order arrived on time, the item stab as described and an excellent price. I like it.</li>
    <li> i have been tryin&#x27; to get a nice clean smell that can last the whole day, once i tried this one i felt very sastisfied. recomended fragance if you like a clean and nice smell on the morning and afternoon.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Nice size</li>
    <li> Started wearing this fragrance in 2009 or so, after a random stranger (an attractive drunk girl) threw herself at me in a Wal-Mart store and began to tell me how amazing I smelled.  I only had a small sample of this fragrance, so I went to a retailer (Dillards I think) and bought an entire bottle.  Other women started to comment on my fragrance, so I&#x27;ve kept wearing it.  Unfortunately, CKfree has been nearly impossible to find in stores as of late, so thank goodness for Amazon.. I can keep smelling amazing for the ladies.</li>
    <li> Great product would order again from vendor. Had no problems. Item arrived properly packaged without damage. It also arrived&lt;br /&gt;on time as specified by vendor.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is not like the one that I purchased at a Kohl&#x27;s department store, in the past.  There is very little strength to the smell, at all.  Definitely disappointed with this.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to be a fake. Is it outdated?&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.&amp;iexcl;</li>
    <li> Nice smell but not as good as I thought it would be. However, the price &amp; service was great.</li>
    <li> the price is cheaper than outside and this CK perfume smell pretty good, It worse that much money to have it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty darn good. It won&#x27;t wow you. Nice, clean, fresh and decently priced. It&#x27;s not a show stopper but certainly capable of getting compliments.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  is just like I need</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance. Liked it so much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband on his birthday and he really loved this fragrance!!!</li>
    <li> Well,at least, new to me, very warm fragrance, not at all overpowering, even my mom agrees! Grab some CKFree, it is totally worth every scent!</li>
    <li> Excellent fragance even thoug it does not last much</li>
    <li> Indescribably delicious, this stuff smells amazing!  Get compliments all the time.  Remember though, not everyone smells the same way with the same cologne, everyones body chemistry is different so go to store and try a tester first.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto!! se recomienda al 100 % vendedor responsable y muy puntual. Gracias por la venta del producto. Feliz dia</li>
