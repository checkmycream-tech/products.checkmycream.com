<ol>
    <li> Product was recommended by my wound care nurse. It works great around my J-tube for drainage.</li>
    <li> Started using this in the NICU. Haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well. We use it with every diaper change and don&#x27;t have any rashes. Works well for sensitive skin. So glad amazon sells it. Harder to remove because it balls-up a little but it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> Baby had a really bad rash.  Someone mentioned this and said that it is miracle cream!!!  And it is.  Nothing worked even desitin.  It did take a couple more days than I thought but I kept up with it and it finally went away.  I will always get this stuff now.  Thank you - whoever invented this.</li>
    <li> If you need this stuff you need this here stuff. It is expensive but I don&#x27;t know of any other product that works as well.</li>
    <li> Given in the hospital; needed new amount</li>
    <li> I have some postsurgery areas that need protection, and this product is the answer for me. A small amount goes a long way and stays intact. Keeps the skin protected from too much moisture.</li>
    <li> This Moisture Barrier Ointment works well.  It is a bit thicker than the same brand used in the hospital and makes it harder to get out of the tube, but it does a very effective job.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This helped protect my grandchildren&#x27;s bottoms so they could heal...and they healed fast! Great barrier and I have recommended it to friends</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has to use this on a regular basis. It works great. Doctor recommended it for her to use with her medical problem.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS WONDERFULLY JUST LIKE ITS SUPPOSE TO.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my newest grandchild.  I am a nurse and we use this in the hospitals to protect tender skin from breakdown (rash and tenderness as well as sores) from moisture and soiling.  It is wonderful, a small amount really works--think good hand cream-- and it protects the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the skin healing within the twelve hours I&#x27;m caring for the child in the hospital setting.  My other grandchildren all use the cream as well.  It is a wonderful way to protect babies and other tender skin.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this brand. After a surgery this thing helped a lot. Kept my skin from getting too irritated. I&#x27;m not sure what else to say, as it&#x27;s all pretty personal stuff, but I&#x27;ll just say that I still use it.</li>
    <li> we had a half a tube of this from the hospital when we took our babies (twins) home ... one of the little guys has particularly sensitive skin, and while triple paste is the best stuff we&#x27;ve found for one, it just seems to keep the moisture in and make the sensitive one&#x27;s condition worse ... so, we tried using this and it has alleviated the skin irritation.  A small smear of this at every diaper change has made the world of difference to his little sore bottom.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT skin protective ointment.  Will continue to use and buy again.</li>
    <li> ...skin deterioration due to incontinence was a headache since taking care of my Mom who underwent a reanastomosis, skin condition has improved a lot since using this product...</li>
    <li> Although a little pricey, this product is a wonderful barrier cream...thick &amp; luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;Service was fast, product is great &amp; we&#x27;re very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was given a tube of the ointment, after I took my mother from the hospital. I highly recommend it for bed ridden people.</li>
    <li> If you have problems down there this really relieves the pain from irritation</li>
    <li> The Hospital uses this Ointment for Diaper Rash areas on Catheterized Adults. Great for Senior Citizens who get a rash too even at home. Glad to find this product Retail. Very soothing.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to apply, at first a little grit to but goes away and easy to remove. Keeps moisture away.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!!!  Highly recommend this, especially post-surgically.  After trying several other products, I found it the most effective product for post-surgical problems.</li>
