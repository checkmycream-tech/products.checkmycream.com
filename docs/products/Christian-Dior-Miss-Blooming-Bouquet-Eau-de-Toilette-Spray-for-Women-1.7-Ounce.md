    <li> No complaints. Nice, light fragrance</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume in a magazine. Unbelievably, in person, it is very light &amp; flora. Not overpowering but like spring. Sweet peas come to mind. I would definitely give it a try. I also like Passion &amp; Poison.</li>
    <li> I love this item! Unfortunately it is not sold in America. Only in selected European cities and Asia. The sales lady in Paris, FR told me that the product is targeted for the Asian market. I like it because it is light and floral and not as deep as the regular Dior Cherie. I am in my mid 20s and I feel this scent is fitting for my age.</li>
    <li> Perfect and brand new. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is soft &amp; delicate. I like wearing it very much.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, but in the Eau de Toilette it doesn&#x27;t have a long staying power, at least not on me. I have never experienced this with any  other Eau de Toilette fragrances before. It only lasts a few short hours.  When or if they release it in the parfume version, along with a body cream/lotion I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with this product. The perfume fades very quickly - more quickly than when I bought directly from sephora.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I smelled this originally in one of those magazine insert/samples.  I sought it out like a lion its prey!!!  Now that I&#x27;ve been wearing it for several weeks, I think that I will never switch again.  I get many so many compliments on it!  Thanks Dior!!</li>
    <li> I have used the perfume of Dior, I really like its perfume, and this time I changed another smell, and its smell is still good! Do not hesitate, buy  it now!~~~</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance that fades quickly :(&lt;br /&gt;Purchased at quite high price and it simply would not hold it&#x27;s fragrance. Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Feminine, not too strong</li>
    <li> This and daisy by Marc Jacobs are my go to perfumes. I love love love them. This smells like flowers and lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Wife is very satisfied</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume, it&#x27;s light and smells clean with a flower scent. The smell is not overpowering at all. It does not last all day but I don&#x27;t mind since I like it when the perfume smell fades and there is a slight scent.&lt;br /&gt;They do sell this in department stores in the USA, Nordstrom, to be exact, maybe they didn&#x27;t before but I know for a fact that they do now.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> As advertised at a gret price.</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful scent. Crisp, clean and fresh. Perfect for the summer days. My ordered arrived on time and very well packaged. Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I am soooo in love with the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t stay more than 15 minutes. I wish this came in Eau de Parfum. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fabulous fragrance, so feminine, however, unfortunately you put it on and within a half hour the fragrance completely dissipates! What a shame, I don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
