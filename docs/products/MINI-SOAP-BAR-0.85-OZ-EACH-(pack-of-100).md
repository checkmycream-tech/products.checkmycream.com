<li> For fifty cents per bar I can get Irish Spring and Dial full size bars</li>
<li> Cheaply wrapped and too small</li>
<li> Based on prior descriptions I expected these to be tiny.  </li>
<li> Expected them to be rounded in shape as the picture showws but they were flat.</li>
<li> Bigger than the &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; soap bars commonly found in hotels but not real big.</li>
<li> We expected the bars to be the size found in hotel rooms, but they are about 1/4 that size.</li>
<li> Usable, but not as expected.</li>
<li> so this was a total waste for me.  </li>
<li> I got these to donate to a homeless resource center where I volunteer.  </li>
<li> They are small and probably will last for a day or two on vacation.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t actually measure) and less than 1cm thick.</li>
<li> Little soaps for the bathroom and sink</li>
<li> I did not return them as it would have been too much trouble, so I used the rest.  </li>
<li> No more wasted bars at the lodge.</li>
<li> These are WAY too small.  </li>
<li> small hotel soaps.</li>
<li> These, unfortunately, were smaller!!!</li>
<li> I use them for my BNB and their small size</li>
<li> After using the rest of the bars I found another 13 broken ones for a total of 25 (or a quarter of them) broken and unusable.  </li>
<li> you probably can&#x27;t keep a grip on them to wash with, and half of them were broken upon receipt.  </li>
<li> This is not the crappy little wax soaps that break apart found often in poor hotel rooms.</li>
<li> Like others said, a few pieces were broken.  </li>
<li> When they arrived at least 12 of the bars were broken and had to be discarded.  </li>
<li> Not a good buy.</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> VERY SMALL!  </li>

    <li> These are WAY too small.  Will have to put 2 in each bathroom per weekend visitor...</li>
    <li> I use these to pack in &#x27;care packages&#x27; for the homeless in our area. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is not the crappy little wax soaps that break apart found often in poor hotel rooms. It&#x27;s good soap. They are small and probably will last for a day or two on vacation. If you own a camp, own a hotel or B&amp;B you will be happy with these. For the price and there are 100 of them they are what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Like others said, a few pieces were broken.  But at such a great price, I dont care.  I use them for my BNB and their small size is perfect - no one goes through an entire one of these bars in their stay.  It would take a couple weeks to go through an entire bar.</li>
    <li> Good fresh scent soap for hotels</li>
    <li> I got these to donate to a homeless resource center where I volunteer.  For the price they are not even worth it.  The bars are so teeny tiny you probably can&#x27;t keep a grip on them to wash with, and half of them were broken upon receipt.  For fifty cents per bar I can get Irish Spring and Dial full size bars so this was a total waste for me.  If you want them as hand soaps for guests or a motel it might work but again, a lot of them were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are maybe 4cm x 2cm (estimate...I didn&#x27;t actually measure) and less than 1cm thick.</li>
    <li> Cheaply wrapped and too small</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my B&amp;B guest rooms.  When they arrived at least 12 of the bars were broken and had to be discarded.  I did not return them as it would have been too much trouble, so I used the rest.  9/09/14  After using the rest of the bars I found another 13 broken ones for a total of 25 (or a quarter of them) broken and unusable.  Would not recommend. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> perfect  travel size and individually wrapped,  great item to donate  to the poor as well as use for travel</li>
    <li> These are tiny tiny soap bars.  We have to use two per bathroom for our vacation rental cabins and that raises the price to fifty cents per bathroom, where we could buy one big bar for thirty three scents from the Dollar Tree.  Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect purchase for us as we needed it for a specific purchase.  It was the perfect purchase.Thank you again!</li>
    <li> Bigger than the &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; soap bars commonly found in hotels but not real big. Good Price/deal&lt;br /&gt;I use them for my condo I rent out.</li>
    <li> Great small size. No more wasted bars at the lodge.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Florida rental!</li>
    <li> I used these bars of soap to make a mini survival kit.  Some of the youth had an allergic reaction to the soap.</li>
    <li> We expected the bars to be the size found in hotel rooms, but they are about 1/4 that size. Usable, but not as expected.</li>
    <li> nothing special, just nice for my vacation rental</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Clean smelling soap in a handy size. Just right for inclusion in the Days for Girls kits I am putting together.</li>
    <li> nice addition for my guest house.</li>
    <li> These soaps were to be used to make felted soaps with children.  There were no dimensions given for the soaps, only for the package the 100 soaps were shipped in!  I (mis-) judged by the photo that they would be the size of hotel soaps.  These, unfortunately, were smaller!!!, about 50-66% the size of hotel soaps!  VERY SMALL!  We had to double them up (thus, instead of 100, only could make 50 felted soaps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be helpful to have the soap dimension listed on the site.</li>
    <li> Little soaps for the bathroom and sink</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great seller</li>
    <li> small hotel soaps. makes perfect soap for guests</li>
    <li> Another great buy for the Salvation Army needs for those less fortunate.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted. It arrived on time and fulfilled my need. I would order again if I needed more.</li>
    <li> Based on prior descriptions I expected these to be tiny.  They&#x27;re the size of hotel soaps and I wanted something smaller.  Other than that, soap is okay.</li>
    <li> Perfect small size to minimize guest waste. Nicely wrapped.</li>
    <li> Expected them to be rounded in shape as the picture showws but they were flat. Used them for a project for the kids in Vacation Bible school. Worked out ok. Thanks</li>
    <li> No problems. Seems Great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this order! We run a B&amp;B and this is just what I was looking for! Perfect</li>
