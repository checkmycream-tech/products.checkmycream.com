<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Terrible! Don&#x27;t order from this seller or this brand!!! Cheap and falls apart instantly! I ordered several of these Sanitizers for gifts and was embarrassed they couldn&#x27;t even use them! The one received never even turned on, even with fresh batteries never worked! Then the others either the latch was broken or broke immediately then the lights on all of them stopped working within two weeks as well!! I tried exchanging these items but the seller argued back saying I waited to long!!! They were gifts! Hence did not open every package to see if they worked properly ahead of time!!</li>
    <li> Purchased 3- 2 worked need to return one for another one.</li>
    <li> I love this case! In the past 7 years I have owned 3 different sanitizing cases and this is by far, the best one yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel quite often. (&amp;#62;5 days out of the month) This has extended the life of my brushes and keeps them fresh. I have no complaints. I do not have to worry about letting my brush air dry. I can throw it in this case and pack it away. While using this product, I have not had a brush get moldy. My brushes always dry inside the case. The case never builds up any mold. The batteries last a favorable amount of time. I am happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Expectations as advertised</li>
    <li> This sanitizer kill the bacteria on your toothbrush and even that is a good case carrier is you travel. I will buy couple of this for gift to my family.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t recieved this product, and checked with my leasing office stuff, no one see it, it might be lost, I wonder if you can resend it, thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I travel on the weekends and hated using the plastic toothbrush holders because they would leave an odor on the toothbrush.  This product is working fine and the toothbrush stays much cleaner and does not smell.</li>
    <li> A great product. I initially had trouble with the light turning on, but I noticed that if I SLOWLY closed the lid, the light turned on EVERYTIME. That is the key to getting this product to work if you are one of those having trouble.    The size is great and is a great place to store your toothbrush whether you travel or not. Yes, a long time ago, you would just store your toothbrush in a special holder, but would you want to keep all that bacteria in your mouth. Doctors have recently discovered that not only is it important to keep your teeth clean, but this also gives you an insight into your personal health.    Enjoy and happy brushing!</li>
    <li> The Violight travel toothbrush sanitizer works well. So there&#x27;s no reason to give it a bad rating for the actual use of it and what you&#x27;re buying it for. However I find it hard to use it when after only a couple of months the UV light stops turning on the way it should. And in an even shorter amount of time after that it just completely stops working. I got about three and a half months use out of this item before it completely gave out. Is it the batteries? No. Is it the bulb? Possibly, but that wouldn&#x27;t make sense with a statement from Violight saying that it is a \\&quot;lifetime bulb.\\&quot; Either way, it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spending $30 on this item isn&#x27;t a big deal to me in the slightest. But with it&#x27;s shoddy design (which I&#x27;m not even going to mention) and even more pathetic lifespan it isn&#x27;t worth a tenth of that.</li>
    <li> What a great idea. What a poor execution of an idea. Who was in charge of product development? I would recommend they actually should have tried to use the device before they put it on the market. Zero stars.    Key points:  * Wastes batteries. I&#x27;m not sure how this happens since it doesn&#x27;t work most of the time.  * The light, insert point for the neck grip, and pretty much any other access point that water can get through, it will and does. Which makes the actual usage intermitent. I found that if you let it dry out for a few days it will usually dry enough for it to work again. Shaking helps - sometimes. But, isn&#x27;t the point to be using it every time you use your toothbrush? Critics may say, \\&quot;shake the toothbrush off before you put it away\\&quot;. Been there. Done that. As carefull as I am, water leaks in, accumulates and compromises the usability. I have opened the battery compartment more than once to find moisture.  * For the money this costs it should have a life span of more than a few weeks. A disclaimer should be included as to how long the unit will actually operate in regular use. This unit is virtually disposable given it&#x27;s life span.    I recieved one as a gift some time after the one I purchased gave out - which lasted about 5 weeks. The new one was no better and lasted about 6 weeks. I also recieved the Zapi UV Toothbrush Sanitizer, also by Violight, as a gift; it lasted about 4 weeks. They didn&#x27;t learn anything from the failures of the first effort. Still leaks water into the unit and makes for build up of moisture and subsequently mold/mildew if you don&#x27;t take it apart frequently to clean it. The opening for the toothbrush won&#x27;t easily accept wider head brushes. Horrible design because as my brush scrapes through the opening I think \\&quot;great it&#x27;s going to be cleaned off... but what about when I pull it back through?\\&quot;...    Final review - Violight, go back to the drawing board. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Think about it for just a minute. These gizmos are absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth. Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you aren&#x27;t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head in this gizmo. Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo&#x27;s electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting \\&quot;Hard 8\\&quot; at the Craps table in Vegas.</li>
    <li> I just received this product for a holiday gift and while I am sure it will sanitize your toothbrush as promised, there are a couple of hiccups that should sway your purchasing this model.    The worst problem is that there is no \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; switch, you simply shut the case and six minutes later the violight is done working.  This is problematic when you wish to take out the toothbrush and close it for a later use, the light comes back on and you are left to either a. keep the case open or b. remove the batteries after each use.    Second, it is not nearly as small as the picture would indicate, and thus perhaps not the best travel companion.</li>
    <li> I have a regular Violight for my husband&#x27;s and my standard toothbrushes, but because I have so much bridgework, I also require a brush with an odd-shaped head.  It doesn&#x27;t fit easily into the regular Violight, but works beautifully in this portable travel model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Violight products and have the same no-fit problem I do, this model will solve the problem.</li>
    <li> My first Violight stopped working after a year (yes, I tried changing the batteries)--but I have a tendancy toward gum disease so in addition to a Sonicare toothbrush, this is a very convenient alternative when traveling.  I also use it to sanitize the toothbrush I use to clean my mouthguard.</li>
    <li> If the data is correct, my toothbrush is always germ-free.  I change the battery once a month.  My toothbrush is always dry before the next use. Great size.</li>
    <li> I am on my second one of these and I absolutely love it! Yes, they don&#x27;t last all that long, about 2 years, but they aren&#x27;t that expensive to replace. We had a sunbeam brand one and it lasted only 2 months.</li>
    <li> I have the stand up version as well, so using batteries was something I was used to.  I take one batt out when I&#x27;m not using it.  Great sanitizer as billed!</li>
    <li> super item to own.  i bought one for everyone in my family  When people see me with this item they ask me about it.  I tell them to go to your web sight.Best item I have ever owned</li>
    <li> This is a very compact, well designed product that replaces another travel toothbrush sanitizer that I&#x27;ve used for several years.  I use it every day and not just traveling.  It is well made and very convenient.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have their toothbrush sanitized after each brushing.</li>
    <li> After traveling with it abroad the darn thing stopped working.  The light does not come on anymore.  It did not last very long.  Save your money!!</li>
    <li> Everyone needs one of these toothbrush sanitizers.I gave them as Christmas presents this past year and everyone really loved them.</li>
    <li> I have had my toothbrush for several years now and have NO complaints. We travel frequently and I take it on every trip and I have yet to replace the battery. My only problem has been finding a replacement tooth brush. Has  anyone found one?</li>
    <li> It is worth every penny. It is a wonderful useful item.</li>
    <li> I myself am a clean freak and I saw this on HGTV. I&#x27;ve been wanting something to store my toothbrush in (and while the whole thing doesn&#x27;t fit because I have a mechanical one, the head does). This is a convenient size and I don&#x27;t have to worry about re-cleaning it (although I do dry off the brush after use ). I wouldn&#x27;t trust it enough to drop the head in a toilet and \\&quot;UV\\&quot; it through the sanitizer but it&#x27;s a great device for travel.</li>
    <li> Used the travel sanitizer just 3 times and it stopped working.  Unfortunately, I received it as a gift for Christmas and didn&#x27;t use it until vacation in April so it was past the 90 day warranty.  The battery compartment is too large so the batteries are not making good contact with each other.  Tried expanding the spring inside, but the spring is rusted out, which is really weird since I wiped the toothbrush off with a towel before putting it in the holder.  Don&#x27;t Waste your Money.</li>
    <li> Not good. Lasted 3 months, then simply stopped working. Changed batteries, didn&#x27;t matter.     Bulb issue?  Don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care. Another company that makes a shoddy product and doesn&#x27;t stand behind it.     Waste of $30.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to someone who travels weekly for work. It was well received.</li>
    <li> Good news, it works well for the first 11 months and it apparently kills the bacteria.  I haven&#x27;t got a cold or sore throat in the last year, so this may have helped.  The bad news is that this unit doesn&#x27;t last.  After 11 months it started to require a hard shake to turn it on and then it finally died.  I think the moisture from the toothbrush and the vapor particles from the residual toothpaste are corrosive to the electronic components.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used it for about six weeks before it stopped working even with new batteries.  I just saw  a review from someone who said she was on her third one.  I think I will look for something that isn&#x27;t disposable.  Seems like a waste to me.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be a God send. I travel to far away countries like India, Turkey, Maylaysia, etc. where the water supply is often questionable. I&#x27;ve always worried about the cleanliness of my toothbrush where I have questioned the germs and bacteria that may live in the water in some these places.  &lt;br /&gt;So when my Mother-in-law  gave me this as a gift it was a great solution to storing, sanitizing my toothbrush  while traveling.</li>
    <li> Here is what you need to keep the germs off your toothbrush!  Ever wonder what falls onto it when you&#x27;re not using your toothbrush, or if someone sneezes around it! Well this sanitizes it!  An ultraviolet light goes on for seven minutes after you put it inside and close it.  Leaving the toothbrush clean and ready for the next use!  Uses two AA Batteries.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see what it is killing, but I know the effect of UV rays on killing germs.  I love this thing!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. Gave the first to my husband. So compact and easy to carry when traveling.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. They have improved the drip tray which was my only concern regarding the first purchase. Love it!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my Brother&#x27;s 75th birthday.  He loved it so much that I want to order more for other gifts at Christmas.</li>
    <li> I find that I don&#x27;t really use this unless I travel so I guess it works well for that.  It&#x27;s hard to tell if it does anything or not because none of the old caked on toothpaste falls off or anything.  At home I soak my toothbrushes in hydrogen peroxide and that removes/dissolves all the old gunk.</li>
    <li> So perfect for travel and I don&#x27;t have to put my toothbrush on a counter in the hotel or ship&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have had two other brands of UV toothbrush sanitizers and neither of them worked as well as the Violight VIO200.  I really love that it has the little suction cup on the end of the toothbrush too.  It does exactly what it said it would and very well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it uses AA batteries too.  The other two used AAA&#x27;s and they would not last over two weeks and I&#x27;d be replacing the batteries.  So far I haven&#x27;t had to change batteries once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased overall.</li>
    <li> Really good product for what it is needed for.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It appears to be working most of the time; however, it appears to have \\&quot;the switch issue\\&quot; that has been mentioned in other reviews.  Sometimes, when I close the lid, the UV light source does not activate.  However, if I smack the entire unit into the palm of my hand a couple of times, it usually turns on.  Hopefully, it won&#x27;t just crap out in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wish that it was somehow open to a little more air circulation.  While I like the idea of the UV light source as a disinfectant, I remain concerned about the toothbrush staying damp in the case and have often discovered little droplets of water that have formed inside the case.</li>
    <li> THis is a great item. Excellent protection for toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Toothbrush seems to stay good as new but the inside of the toothbrush sanitizer has been discolered by the light.</li>
    <li> I purchased this several months ago and have been generally pleased with it.  I do not use it to travel with, but rather have it on my bathroom counter and periodically clean my toothbrush with it once a week or so.  At times when I place a toothbrush in it takes awhile for the light to activate.  I sometimes have to shake it gently back and forth or open and shut the top before it activates.  Minor inconvenience and overall it seems to do its job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Violight VIO200 Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer for a couple years and the hinge just broke.  Looked it up on Amazon and ordered another one, received it just when I was promised!  These things work well!!!</li>
    <li> ordered 2.  opened 1 only to realize that it is much to big and bulky for travel.  for $30 each, i&#x27;d rather get a regular toothbrush and dispose of it when it gets nasty!   i&#x27;m returning the items.</li>
    <li> These are helpful and appear to work.  A bit large and heavier than normal toothbrush holder.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written as I feel strongly enough to complain.  I bought the travel sanitizer and had my doubts because of other complaints.  First off the people at the company said any odd sized toothbrush would fit, completely untrue as can&#x27;t use my radius large sized toothbrush.  Second, it is too bulky and fragile to travel well.  MOST ANNOYING, is that if you are not storing the toothbrush inside the case you have no way to turn off the little light.  The light comes on each time you close the case.  So its designed to keep your toothbrush inside.  Fine after sanitizing, but it can&#x27;t continue to airdry if you want to keep it outside withoout the little light coming on.  As to the light bulb, am just waiting for it to flunk out, have only had the product a few months but the light does not come on unless I shake it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aside from air drying how about leaving a toothbrush in the sun or soaking it in hydrogen peroxide.  And because I bought from Amazon to save a few bucks it is not really returnable after 30 days, and then I have to take the loss of the large shipping and hendling fee.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working fine.  In my humble opinion, the size of the item is as compact as it can be with relation to toothbrush size and the size of the light mechanism that has to effectively kill germs.  Again, I&#x27;m just stating my opinion even though others have complained.</li>
    <li> Great when it works and your teeth feel very clean but it did not last long enough by far.</li>
    <li> Im on my 3rd one in less than a year. They just stop working. I have replaced it twice. The latest has now stopped working. Im shocked. I will not be replacing again. This thing is complete junk and the company does not stand by their product.</li>
    <li> Many standard toothbrushes won&#x27;t fit.  Unit not durable enough for constant travel, my switch has become intermittent.  Violight products have nice cosmetic design however lack basic engineering to be able to work more than a short number of months.  Have owned 4 Violight and only this one sort-of still works.</li>
    <li> This product started off great. Then, within about 4 weeks, it would only come on if you shook it a little. Replaced the batteries. Worked great for a couple days, then would only come on with a little shake. Changed batteries again but still would only work if shaken a little. Now, completely dead after just 10 weeks.</li>
    <li> I spend 150+ days a year on the road so having this bad boy in the hotels to help fight off colds has been awesome.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 4 weeks.  I shook it a couple times and it came on but then stopped working completely.  Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I use the standard VIO Sanitizer at home and find the travel version an easy way to keep my brush clean and myself less concerned about bacteria etc in the bathrooms etc occupied when I travel.</li>
    <li> this product requires battery change after 2.5 weeks -- that seemed high to me --otherwise I like the product</li>
    <li> I am about to buy a third one of these in as many years.  First, the good:  This is a great product that sanitizes my toothbrush.  Also, it helps with drying (I shake off excess water, then I put it in, when the light is done it is almost completely dry and an hour later the bristles are stiff and dry, which helps against mold buildup which is a problem when you put your toothbrush in a case like this).  It is small enough to travel with (fits in my travel toiletry kit at only 1\\&quot; longer than my toothbrush; although it is not as small as a plain holder, you couldn&#x27;t build this any smaller because of the parts inside).  It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day, which means that my example of how long it lasts is an extreme one, but here&#x27;s the bad:  THe first one lasted about 18 months.  The second a year.  As the batteries get low (about 3-6 months on a pair of AAs), you will notice that the unit needs a shake to turn on.  After 9 months or so, it will always need this.  Then it will start to use a pair of batteries every month, finally it will completely die.  The first one, which lasted longer, was much better built (one part that was metal is now plastic like the rest, the paint was better, the unit lasted longer, and the batteries lasted longer).  The paint is also an issue, after a month it seemed like the unit was dirty, but when I went to clean it I found that the paint was changing color in splotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product that would do much better if they would put some more research into it.  They need to make the piece under the toothbrush head out of a better material (like the original metal part was), they need to make the case a bit studier, they need to improve the life (I don&#x27;t know if it is cheap parts or if the bulb is going, but if it is the bulb it should be replacable like their larger unit&#x27;s is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is the final factor.  If this lasted 5 years or more, $30 would be reasonable.  But since this lasts only a year or so, they should lower the price to the $10 range (including shipping).d lower the price to the $10 range (including shipping).</li>
    <li> It lasted almost 1 month. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had another Violight Toothbrush Sanitizer but it got old and worn out.  When I bought this one, I expected the same quality.  it was not ... it must have been a reject or something.  The inside rubber thing that holds the toothbrush was placed in the middle so the toothbrush bristles were pressed against the ultraviolet light window.  I looked at my old sanitizer and it shows the rubber thing is offset so when the toothbrush is placed in it, the bristles are not touching the ultraviolet window.</li>
    <li> Great and sanitary way to carry my toothbrush when traveling.  Product will eventually wear out when the door latch loosens and the connection for the light becomes unstable.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t attest to how well this item performs, as I purchased it for a gift. I can tell you that my \\&quot;germ freak\\&quot; daughter is delighted!</li>
    <li> Great product.... Quick shipper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine since these came out. I don&#x27;t even know how many years it&#x27;s been and it&#x27;s still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that if I leave it on the sink, sometimes it gets water into the battery compartment since the thin door is flush against the sink surface. I store it raised up now, but it&#x27;s been through some water logging and still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like how this one has a plate that you can remove to clean where the toothbrush rests. There was a period where I didn&#x27;t put batteries in it and just used it as a storage case and mold grew on that removable plate. Once I started using batteries in it again the mold went away so I know the UV is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the new one has a shiny plate for better reflection of the UV light. Mine is the older white plate, but it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always dried the toothbrush (below the brush area) on a towel before putting it in.</li>
    <li> I have been using my first one for a couple years, not on a daily basis, though, but even after all this time of never opening it up to air out my toothbrush, everything is still mold free.  I decided to get another one because the first one is in my drawer at work, and I need another one to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;If I had one request, it would be to have an on/off switch, since the unit will automatically turn on when it is closed, whether or not there is a toothbrush inside.  But I guess such a switch would make it heavier/bulkier.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a replacement for my original that I used daily for about 8 years. I expect to get at least 8 years from this one also. I am not happy with our tap water so I like the idea of sanitizing my toothbrush even though I rinse it thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit, and this is great for keeping your toothbrush clean.  I use it home as well.  No issues with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this without looking at the dimensions. It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected. The picture shows a higher quality look and finish than the real deal. However, I like it regardless, especially for traveling.</li>
    <li> I would give this zero stars... but cannot. This product arrived and I installed new batteries and the unit is dead. It&#x27;s always great to buy a product and have it not work right out of the box. Amazon is great with returns and makes it really easy, the only bright spot with this transaction.</li>
    <li> I love the Violight VI0200 Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer.  I use it at home because it fits easily in my cabinet.  I travel at least 1 time a month and just put it in my suitcase.  I am going to purchase a second one to keep in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Love these Vio&#x27;s as I travel a lot and use them often.  Feel more comfortable knowing it is being carried safely and germ free!</li>
    <li> These are nice don&#x27;t get me wrong, but for the price and size the steripods work great !!,  I had issues with the light shutting off only after a couple of months on these.  Good idea but again they dint work long term.</li>
    <li> Its a great way to sanitize your toothbrush and is so convenient. Its also travel friendly and I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Mine lasted about six months.  Then I had to shake it in order to get the UV light to come on.  Then it died altogether.  Even with fresh new batteries, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I like the concept, but the bristles on this toothbrush come out easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take to Iraq.  I would have to echo the reviews that state the product quits working after a few weeks.  After about a week, I had to change the batteries.  After 2 weeks, I had to start shaking it to get the light to turn on.  Now, I&#x27;m just waiting for it to quit working all together.  I haven&#x27;t become sick of anything yet, so in that light the product works.  Other than that, if you have other means to sanitize your toothbrush, use those instead.</li>
    <li> This is my third.  I love the product but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should.  After a bit, the light won&#x27;t come on without a shake or wack.  Eventually it stops working altogether.</li>
    <li> This item works as advertised and is great for anyone who travels.  It really helps keep you toothbrush relatively clean, is compact, and provides good battery life.  This is actually a replacement for my original, which I lost while travelling.....</li>
    <li> Love this product- the second one I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. I bought one for each of my girls for Christmas; my husband already has one.</li>
    <li> Great way to keep your toothbrush clean and ready for use when you are traveling - Don&#x27;t leave home without it</li>
    <li> love the idea of ensuring travel toothbrush isn&#x27;t gathering more germs than neccessary. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I keep one in my office drawer and another one in my travel back. It is really easy to use and can fit my own toothbrush.</li>
    <li> After about two years it stopped working.  Toward the end it was eating through batteries faster than when I first got it; and now it does not work at all.</li>
    <li> It works, but it has a) battery issues and b) the paint comes off in splotches. I used one for 6 months while traveling; it started fading a few months in. By the end of it the paint was turning white. Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s moisture or whatever, but it doesn&#x27;t pass the longevity test. Buy a different one.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Purchased this as a replacement for my first one that lasted 5 years.</li>
    <li> I thought the container would be mental vs plastic.</li>
    <li> great to have something sanitize your toothbrush when you are in a third world country and the water is questionable....</li>
    <li> It works well, this is my second purchase of this.  This purchase is for my husband.  My Violight Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer has been many places out side of the US with me and I believe it has worked well, because I have not gotten sick in any of the places I have visited.  Especially in places I was told not to drink the water!</li>
    <li> Love it. Bought Xmas gift for family.</li>
    <li> no one in my family bothered with it.  I&#x27;m sure it works well, we just didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just fine</li>
    <li> Easy to store when traveling.  Nice that it turns on automatically so I can just pack up and go without needing to do anything else!</li>
    <li> I feel like it really keeps my toothbrush germ free.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these tooth sanitizers. One worked, the other never turned off after 7 minutes, 20 minutes, 12 hours. I could only assume whatever sanitizing needed to be done, was done in 7 minutes on my toothbrush, but my wife&#x27;s toothbrush needed some serious sanitizing, because hers never turned off. Made me wonder where her mouth has been that this unit never stopped sanitizing. &lt;br /&gt;I did believe this sanitizing crap was doing its thing. But I can&#x27;t help but believe in fairies and Santa Claus.  &lt;br /&gt;Basically on review of the two products I purcased, one works I suppose, the other is defective! I didn&#x27;t get any flu or viruses but can we assume it was a disinfective tooth brush that saved me or was it the zinc tablets, airborne tablets, sauerkraut, garlic, vitamin c or the zillion times I washed my hands.</li>
    <li> The case is big and bulky.  The Violight stopped working after two trips.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> i really liked this toothbruch sanitizer.  I took it on my two week vacation and it was pretty lightweight for having to use batteries.  It even came with a toothbrush that can stand on a hard surface on its own.  It stopped working for a few days, but I swapped batteries and it worked fine for the rest of the trip.  The light came on for a few minutes and automatically turned off. so easy to use!!! The funny part, is that when I came back from vacation and used a toothbrush that I have in a toothbrush stand in my very clean bathroom I ended up getting a tiny mouth sore.  I think I will continue using the Violight even when I am not on vacation!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time in March when I went on vacation. It kept the tooth brush nice and clean. It comes with a toothbrush. The toothbrush seem to be more on the hard side than the softer one I use at home. You can replace it with one that has a small head and slim handle. My husband was able to put his inside to sanitize his toothbrush. It comes on when you close the lid. It turns off after the sanitize cycle.</li>
    <li> We bought several through the years . They work well and come in several styles. My wife likes the purse one.</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s not made out of metal, but shiny plastic. You knew that already. Only really expensive stuff is made out of metal anymore. Having used a UVC product similar to this one for over two years, I was curious to see how the Violight would work. I had passed on it previously due to \\&quot;died on me\\&quot; reviews and the greater expense. This time, I decided to go the Violight route, since my last one worked, but not well. I have been pleasantly surprised.    I find it easier to clean than the UVC. It uses AA batteries, and I have plenty of rechargables since I use them with my XBox 360 controllers. So far, I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and I have yet to change the batteries. I think the larger battery just works much better with UV lighting. It does not need to be tapped, prodded, shaken or jiggled to get the light to come on. You just close the cover and it works the way it is supposed to.    I don&#x27;t like the fact that it uses a clear screen instead of a protective screen for the cover, but you&#x27;ll train yourself to \\&quot;not look at the pretty blue light.\\&quot;    Overall, an improvement over my last UV sanitizer.    The final update -- it continued to work for about three years. I finally retired it in October of 2014 due to total failure. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s satisfactory, given the initial price on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I actually use this as a daily toothbrush holder and purchased a second one to use when traveling. Great product!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, have invisiline, so I needed something that I could take with me EVERYWHERE I go, and this little guy gets the job done to say at the least. And it looks pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> PRESENT FOR ONE OF MY SONS.  GREAT.</li>
    <li> I love the Violighttravel toothbrush sanitizer. It&#x27;s very useful when traveling, and much more sanitary than a regular toothbrush case.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered this product last week, expecting it to be better than the other travel toothbrush sanitizer (the Stericlean one), and I must say that I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.  It came to me inoperable.  The sanitizing light would not come on, despite my many exchanges of batteries.  I will keep trying different batteries, but I would heed the side of caution on this product, and instead recommend the Oral Stericlean UV travel sanitizer.  The QA on their product is more sound, and I never encountered a time purchasing that one where it didn&#x27;t work (I have bought two, both broke by my own hand through traveling).</li>
    <li> I bought one over 5 years ago and when it finally quit. I couldn&#x27;t live without one. I love to sanitize my toothbrush and&lt;br /&gt;have it with me when I travel so it is protected and clean</li>
    <li> Works well with, obviously, certain size toothbrushes. Recommend considering this.</li>
    <li> Third one I&#x27;ve owned.  First one died after about 4 years. Replaced recently.  Purchased the extra for travel.  This is a better solution than a large appliance sitting on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I love it!</li>
    <li> Violight VIO200 Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer did meet my expectations. I liked it so much I used it all of the time not just when I traveled. It’s now back to when I travel because my new electric toothbrush won’t fit. I would again purchase this product in the future if I could find one that would fix my current toothbrush.</li>
    <li> it works as promised and it doubles as a carry case, very nice product.  only complaint is it is hard to open, other than that, nice product.</li>
    <li> Worked out very well on our last trip. I felt that both myself and my husband were germ free. Would recommend it to friends that travel.</li>
    <li> I was given this Sanitizer as a gift for a trip.  Since I had been told that one of the ways that people get colds is from the bacteria that remain on one&#x27;s toothbrush, I was pleased with this gift. Unfortunately, mine did not turn off automatically after the 7 minute period needed for sanitizing, so when I returned home I called Violight.  The person who answered the phone spoke clear English and was very helpful. All I had to do was repackage the Sanitizer and put it outside  my front door, as they ordered a prepaid slip, so UPS just came and picked it up.  It is a pleasure to do business with a company that will live up to their warranty (with no hassle)  and either repair or replace it. She even said they would do their best to get it back to me before my next trip date.  This is a good-looking item as well, and has a built-in drain for water drippings, which is a breeze to clean.  I have already bought one to give to my traveling adult daughter, who seems prone to catching colds. I plan to use mine at home as well. It uses two AA batteries, so bring spares if you take it on a long trip, as I cannot even estimate how frequently you will need to replace them at this writing. Had I not had to return this item, I would have given it 5 stars, as I am pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - June 2012.  I am still using my Violight and have given several as gifts.  I have not had to replace the batteries more than 4 times in the 6+ years I have owned this nifty item.  This product goes with me wherever I travel. I am \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; my review to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> At the rate it&#x27;s going, it&#x27;ll use about 50/year.  And then there&#x27;s always the nagging question ... did I buy snake oil?  I can&#x27;t think of anything else I own where there&#x27;s NO evidence to tell if it&#x27;s REALLY doing what it claims it&#x27;s doing! So the reason for 4 stars?  Blind faith, optimism and the high tech box.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really doing anything but it makes me feel better about my tooth brush, maybe it&#x27;s just me, I think we all get into buying dumb things at times. It looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
    <li> Company does not stand behind their products, which break frequently.</li>
    <li> This is in daily use. So guess what everyone got for Christmas! :)</li>
    <li> I had an old toothbrush sanitizer that collected mold, even though I cleaned it regularly.  This one works great and I wouldn&#x27;t travel without it.  There is only one prong to hold the toothbrush, which makes it easy to use with any of our toothbrushes.  This would make a great present.</li>
    <li> This is good item!&lt;br /&gt;I like it :).&lt;br /&gt;Packing is perfect.</li>
    <li> After one time use the uv light does not go on anymore, I changed the batteries but still not lighting up.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Been great! Thought i would break the plastic case but have not.  I have flown with it about 30 times, in checked suitcase. No issues at all.</li>
    <li> ensures using a clean toothbrush when travelling and at home.  This is the second one I have purchased since the light went out on the first one.  The only thing that would have made it better would be if you could replace the ultraviolet light.</li>
    <li> I have had and used mine for years and wanted to share the health benefits with family. Especially useful and necessary for travel but also for leaving one&#x27;s toothbrush out in the home bathroom.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrush sanitizers.  My wife and I each have one.  They do a great job, and they make a good toothbrush holder when traveling also.</li>
    <li> The switch that turns the UV light on is a little pin that is supposed to push the little button inside body of the case. The problem is that after few days of use it started missing the button and therefore stopped turning the light on. I&#x27;ve tried to move the button so it&#x27;ll sit right under the pin, but it works for a day or two and again goes back to the wrong place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate....</li>
    <li> After purchasing VIO200 used the saniatizer only twice when the clasp on the container broke.  The container will not stay closed.</li>
    <li> This seems to do everything is promises, my only complaint is that my Sonicare toothbrush head won&#x27;t fit into it, so when I travel I use a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Actually got this as a gift for my SIL who is a bit of a germaphobe and who had plans to travel shortly after I gave it to her. She loved it- like seriously said it was one of her favorite presents. It at least lasted her through her 2 week trip. She mentioned one time it didn&#x27;t turn on when it was closed, but when she did it again it worked.</li>
    <li> Take heed to the negative reviews.  I ignored them and I regret it dearly.  Do not buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short.  I bought this in April of 2012 by July 2012 product would not come on.  I changed the batteries.  It worked for a few days and then would go dead on me.  After a month of running out and buying new batteries, the unit finally stopped working all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never dropped this unit nor had it submerged in water.  I would ALWAYS shake my toothbrush vigorously before I put it in the unit.  Still, this thing died on me.  What a waste of money and time!</li>
    <li> I have this at work in my desk drawer. It&#x27;s great cause its covered and getting sanitized after use. I know it&#x27;s not 100 percent, but its way better than nothing at all. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and its still going strong.</li>
    <li> Second one that I&#x27;ve had. It works well and is used daily. It is a fair value for the money. I like what it does and it seems to sterilize the toothbrush bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought a violight travel toothbrush container many years ago.  i love it. I put my toothbrush in it everyday not just for travel.  Since that time a have bought at least 20 more.  I have given many as gifts, and everyone tells me the like the fact that their toothbrush is staying clean. I know my son likes his, he let me know he need another, which he got for another Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have bought because I do like them, but for some reason they don&#x27;t want to work right after a while. Changing the batteries helps, but mostly I have to take the batteries out, put them in, tap, tap, tap &amp; hope the light comes on. But I like the idea of the ultraviolet light enough to grit my teeth &amp; keep on trying.</li>
    <li> My second one in 10 years. Wonderful for travel and campong</li>
    <li> I will not buy anything from violight agin.The toothbrush sanitizer did not work.  The toothbrush sanitizer did not work.  The toothbrush sanitizer did not work.</li>
    <li> It really does seem to help keep me from getting sick!</li>
    <li> I was grossed out when I saw the mold buildup inside the case of our travel toothbrushes.  So far, after 5 nights of use, we are very happy with the Violight and think it is a great product.  I&#x27;m glad I bought an extra one to use as a gift.</li>
    <li> The slim feature allows for easy fitting into any compartment.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this during her freshman year at college and loved it.  It lasted for the entire year, into the summer of that first year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for many years and just bought my husband one.  Works very well and keeps the toothbrush clean. I like that you can fit most toothbrushes in it.</li>
