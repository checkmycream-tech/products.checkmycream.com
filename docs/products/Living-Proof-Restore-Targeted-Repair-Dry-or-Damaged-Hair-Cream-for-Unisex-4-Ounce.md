      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Received this item as a sample and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>I love how my hair feels when it dries</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t recovered all the hair I lost with the breakage, but it looks healthy again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, but it definitely ain&#x27;t magic.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair manageable and soft.  </li>
      <li>, my hair looks again full of life!</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I saw immediate results, it looked AMAZING</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine hair that tangles easily, and this always makes my hair look greasy</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m planning to be loyal to living proof for a looooong time!</li>
      <li>Makes a huge difference</li>
      <li>a week so important to me to have a product that makes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fine, but there is just so so much of it.</li>
      <li>(brushes out really easily) but the tradeoff of having greasy hair isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the way it conditions without too much weight.  </li>
      <li>but i found that KMS California Moist Repair worked much better for me repaired my hair fast ,</li>
      <li>and I really wanted it to be magical.</li>
      <li>Great price compared to other sellers.  </li>
      <li>Just want to add i do use other Living Proof products that work great for me that i will still buy.</li>
      <li>My last resource after buying countless of products and spending lots of money was this amazing product!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>but it is effective enough that it tames the frizz, detangles and makes my hair look super.  </li>
      <li>One use of the targeted repair cream - literally I used it for the first time today, and my hair is softer and more moisturized than it has been in months, as soft as it was before I bleached.</li>
      <li>Because it is incredibly prone to splitting and damage, I only wash it 2 or 3 times per week, and just spritz with dry shampoo as needed.</li>
      <li>Like this product very much, I use it every morning and occasionaly at night.  </li>
      <li>I used Kerastase and Frederic Fekkai prior to purchasing this product and I like this one better.  </li>
      <li>have tried so many products but the change did not stay&lt;br /&gt;through until next shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I decided to check on Amazon to see if I could find it since many of our local stores did not.</li>
      <li>tried it today and my hair is so smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Some woman staffer raved about this conditioner: the first one that ever worked for her out of control hair.</li>
      <li>hair texture and shine changed with the first application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>At first I used too much and my roots were greasy, even though I&#x27;d just washed my hair.</li>
      <li>She received this surprising gift with a kindly but very skeptical</li>
      <li>It does improve certain aspects of my hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use on wet or dry hair (although wet is the best application) and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
      <li>You will think that the women who works there has absolutely knowledge of what she is doing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whatever conditioners do, this does very well.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to put some life into \\&quot;tired\\&quot; hair.</li>
      <li>and I went from bright red to blonde in one day (with the use of Olaplex to protect it) and have slowly been lightening it more for months.</li>
      <li>Everyone has different hair so may work better for others than myself,for now i will finish what i have left and continue to use the KMS Moist Repair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It feels high quality.</li>
      <li>i put about a dime or a little more and run it through my hair</li>
      <li>I apply to the most of my hairs length since mine is a big dry mess :)</li>
      <li>It smells fine, if a little herbal for my taste, and the ends are in the same kind of shape as with any other leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I have the hair of a 18 year old again!  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft.  </li>
      <li>I am over 60 years old, and I color my hair.  </li>
      <li>Take it from a the Clueless Guy, this stuff is great for hard to tame, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my wavy dry hair shiny and easy to comb through when wet.  </li>
      <li>This product really helps out of shower and even on dry hair.</li>
      <li>this made my hair very soft, but left it without any body or curl.  </li>
      <li>I totally recommend this product, is a complete miracle!</li>
      <li>Buying any kind of cosmetic/hair product for my wife is laughable.</li>
      <li>My hair was healthy and beautiful, unfortunately after a bad hair dye job they totally ruined my hair!!</li>
      <li>She loves it and says it is amazingly effective on her very long, very thick hair!</li>

<li> She loves it and says it is amazingly effective on her very long, very thick hair!</li>
<li> So then I was very careful only to apply to the tips, but the same thing happened.</li>
<li> I have very long and very dry wavy hair which is not coarse.</li>
<li> My hair was trashed..extremely dry and brittle.</li>
<li> ,i let air dry since thats</li>
<li> I have dry hair and shampoo&lt;</li>
<li> way less frizz ,not dry and helped fix my split ends.</li>
<li> Only need a little so 4 ounces goes a long way.</li>
<li> Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic after all of these reviews, but it seems like a pretty standard leave in conditioner.</li>
<li> I have relaxed hair which gets very dry</li>
<li> This is definitely not the life-changing product it&#x27;s been made out to be in a few places.</li>
<li> Be careful though.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Money well spent in my opinion!</li>
<li> At first, I was rather hesitant since it is rather expensive...</li>
<li> why i bought this for my dry Frizzy hair ,Has helped a little</li>
<li> Just a small amount worked through wet hair, then I blow dry</li>
<li> So I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and bought a little pink bottle of this goo for my Queen.</li>
<li> Probably thinner hair should apply very little on dry hair.</li>
<li> It only took a very small amount</li>
<li> I am the typical husband.</li>
<li> Those 2 facts mean that my hair tends to be dry and lifeless at times.</li>
<li> Maybe I am just so used to damage that proper conditioning makes my hair texture and color seem weird to me?</li>
<li> No more tangles and frizz</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair texture and shine changed with the first application.&lt;br /&gt;I now use it after every shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have no tangles and styling is easy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Living Proof Restore to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many products but the change did not stay&lt;br /&gt;through until next shampoo.  I have dry hair and shampoo&lt;br /&gt;once a week so important to me to have a product that makes&lt;br /&gt;my hair look good until I shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  Makes my wavy dry hair shiny and easy to comb through when wet.  I love how my hair feels when it dries and I get lots of compliments on the shine.</li>
    <li> I had read several magazines that gave this product rave reviews. I decided to check on Amazon to see if I could find it since many of our local stores did not. At first, I was rather hesitant since it is rather expensive...then, just gave in and decided to give it a try. Boy, am I glad that I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just tried it today and my hair is so smooth, soft and shiny. I really am shocked that it worked so well. It only took a very small amount so it looks like this cream is going to last a while. Money well spent in my opinion! I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to put some life into \\&quot;tired\\&quot; hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after I read a glowing review on a blog where the writer described her hair as \\&quot;vast and fragile\\&quot; - MY hair is vast and fragile, too! It&#x27;s very fine, but there is just so so much of it. Because it is incredibly prone to splitting and damage, I only wash it 2 or 3 times per week, and just spritz with dry shampoo as needed. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic after all of these reviews, but it seems like a pretty standard leave in conditioner. At first I used too much and my roots were greasy, even though I&#x27;d just washed my hair. Okay. So then I was very careful only to apply to the tips, but the same thing happened. I applied it only to the tips and rinsed, and still with the greasiness. Maybe I am just so used to damage that proper conditioning makes my hair texture and color seem weird to me? It smells fine, if a little herbal for my taste, and the ends are in the same kind of shape as with any other leave-in conditioner. I am disappointed because this is expensive stuff and I really wanted it to be magical. It&#x27;s fine, but it definitely ain&#x27;t magic.</li>
    <li> I am the typical husband. I shave, I comb my hair, I&#x27;m done. Buying any kind of cosmetic/hair product for my wife is laughable. Never going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I read the Cnet tech blog and Jezebel, its sister site. Some woman staffer raved about this conditioner: the first one that ever worked for her out of control hair. So I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and bought a little pink bottle of this goo for my Queen. She received this surprising gift with a kindly but very skeptical smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she loved it! She&#x27;s recommending it to her Mom! &amp;#34;And who turned you on to this conditioner?&amp;#34; She is asked. &amp;#34;Why, Mr. Bozo over there&amp;#34; she replies, pointing at me as I beam proudly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever conditioners do, this does very well. Take it from a the Clueless Guy, this stuff is great for hard to tame, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I went from bright red to blonde in one day (with the use of Olaplex to protect it) and have slowly been lightening it more for months. My hair was trashed..extremely dry and brittle. One use of the targeted repair cream - literally I used it for the first time today, and my hair is softer and more moisturized than it has been in months, as soft as it was before I bleached. This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> My hair was healthy and beautiful, unfortunately after a bad hair dye job they totally ruined my hair!! It all broke and looked terrible. The worst part is that I went to a high end salon and pay 200 dollars for it. You will think that the women who works there has absolutely knowledge of what she is doing. Anyways I dyed  back dark to hide the damage,, but even like that you could still see how horrible my hair looked. My last resource after buying countless of products and spending lots of money was this amazing product!!!!!!  The first time I used it, I saw immediate results, it looked AMAZING, my hair looks again full of life! I didn&#x27;t recovered all the hair I lost with the breakage, but it looks healthy again. I totally recommend this product, is a complete miracle! Since this one worked so spectacularly I decided to purchase too the &amp;#34;restore recovery regimen&amp;#34; of living proof and I&#x27;m planning to be loyal to living proof for a looooong time!</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the life-changing product it&#x27;s been made out to be in a few places. I have a lot of fine hair that tangles easily, and this always makes my hair look greasy no matter how I apply it. It does improve certain aspects of my hair (brushes out really easily) but the tradeoff of having greasy hair isn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;m not going to buy more of this, though I probably am going to try the rinse-out conditioner. Could just be that leave-in products don&#x27;t work well for my hair type. I do like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to other sellers.  This product is amazing. I have relaxed hair which gets very dry and this is my go-to product.  Wonderful stuff, doesn&#x27;t build up, and is very moisturizing.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Can&#x27;t repair split ends. Companycustomer care greatly lacking. Not impressed with any Living Proof product</li>
    <li> this made my hair very soft, but left it without any body or curl.  so it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Well after trying at least 20 products to help manage my frizzies and tangling issues I have finally found something that works.  This product works wonders.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy but it is effective enough that it tames the frizz, detangles and makes my hair look super.  It&#x27;s easy to use on wet or dry hair (although wet is the best application) and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.  No more tangles and frizz...just what I expect from Living Proof, as all their products perform well. This one is a definite every day must.</li>
    <li> Like this product very much, I use it every morning and occasionaly at night.  It does seems to add body and I like the result.</li>
    <li> Received this item as a sample and fell in love with it.  My hair is over processed from coloring and Living Proof makes it shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used Kerastase and Frederic Fekkai prior to purchasing this product and I like this one better.  It smells great and leaves my hair manageable and soft.  I will definitely try their shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> Great price and effective</li>
    <li> Keeps my thinning hair in check.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot. Infuses my hair with moisture immediately upon applying. Be careful though. A little goes a long way. Just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive. Does not keep my hair from frizzing in wet weather though, so I am disappointed in that.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of coloring and blow drying with diffuser so I need all the help I can get. I love these products!</li>
    <li> Great, I sleep with it on about once a week.  Makes a huge difference</li>
    <li> I have very long and very dry wavy hair which is not coarse. I was seriously considering a trim because if I don&#x27;t use any products on my hair is feels like a broom. This product really helps out of shower and even on dry hair. Probably thinner hair should apply very little on dry hair. I apply to the most of my hairs length since mine is a big dry mess :)</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair conditioner - it is a leave in &amp; doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy - would recommend</li>
    <li> I have used this several times. I like this product. It feels high quality. I dont use many hair products but I would recommend this one, I like the living proof line and all their products</li>
    <li> I am over 60 years old, and I color my hair.  Those 2 facts mean that my hair tends to be dry and lifeless at times. That is, until I found this amazing product.  Just a small amount worked through wet hair, then I blow dry and I have the hair of a 18 year old again!  &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34; is truly a perfect name for this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it conditions without too much weight.  Only need a little so 4 ounces goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It takes the frizz away.  Not greasy.  Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Seems to take some of the dryness and frizz out of my hair...</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life.  Finally something that actually works. It makes my hair so soft.  Love it</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter; it was something she had been wanting, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. She loves it and says it is amazingly effective on her very long, very thick hair!</li>
    <li> This is not the best i have used but since i have it i plan on using all of it,I use this at night after i shower i put about a dime or a little more and run it through my hair,i let air dry since thats why i bought this for my dry Frizzy hair ,Has helped a little but i found that KMS California Moist Repair worked much better for me repaired my hair fast ,way less frizz ,not dry and helped fix my split ends.Everyone has different hair so may work better for others than myself,for now i will finish what i have left and continue to use the KMS Moist Repair.Just want to add i do use other Living Proof products that work great for me that i will still buy.</li>
