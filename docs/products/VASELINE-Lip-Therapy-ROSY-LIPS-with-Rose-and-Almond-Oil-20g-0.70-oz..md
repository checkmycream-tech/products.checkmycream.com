      <li>This lip balm is amazing.</li>
      <li>Based on reviews, this sounded really nice to me</li>
      <li>Nice color, and</li>
      <li>It smells very lightly of rose, which is nice because it&#x27;s not too overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I love to use it over lip stain for nice moisture.</li>

      <li>most people probably wouldnt even notice.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I went to Amazon again to order some more for my sister but</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize there was a US version, but in any case I&#x27;m glad I purchased this version cause of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>but  still I do believe that this is a safe purchase after all this one has an name that is established.</li>
      <li>Better than the U.S. collection; not as sticky, you get a lot more in the container</li>
      <li>but I know that there are a lot of lip gloss that does a better job.</li>
      <li>For me, this is just okay.  </li>
      <li>keep lips healthy and protected from the elements .</li>
      <li>Will be buying more and will will be buying them more often :)</li>
      <li>and so I was extremely  excited to be able to find this!</li>
      <li>cant decide if it&#x27;s better than smith&#x27;s</li>
      <li>My favorite is the rosy lips version.</li>
      <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This feels wonderful on my lips and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It is funny that I should make a review on this product,but anyway this lip gloss is as good as it get as a lip gloss.</li>
      <li>and it worked just fine, but turned to more sophisticated products as i grew up.well</li>
      <li>I do love that I was able to get it for just under $3 with free shipping all the way from England (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still the case now).</li>
      <li>I love the texture, its comparable to the original Vaseline lip therapy.  </li>
      <li>The seller provided an email with tracking number in which I can easily track my items during the shipping process.</li>
      <li>now im back to the basics, vaseline with a sophisticated touch of rose and almond oil!  </li>
      <li>It does works fine</li>
      <li>Yes, it is moisturizing &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>You dab your finger(I use the pad of my ring finger) &amp; then lightly coat my lips.</li>
      <li>I goes on so smooth.</li>
      <li>A hint of color and a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is very smooth and makes your lips very very shiney.</li>
      <li>I will say that it seems very nice and moisturizing on the lips, but I simply can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
      <li>It comes off quickly and easily and has to be reapplied every 10 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>I am a sucker for chap stick and good lip balms, and haven&#x27;t been able to find one that works better than this!   </li>
      <li>The color is also very lovely; it enhances my natural lip color rather than covers it up.</li>
      <li>Overall, good product</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing without being goopy and has a lovely smell.</li>
      <li>Like it just absorbs so quick after each application I feel like I have to apply every hour.</li>
      <li>It is super moisturizing and exfoliating.</li>
      <li>It coats the lips pretty well, but in the description it says \\&quot;light tint.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Apparently, this product is all over in the UK, I wish it was more available here.  </li>
      <li>Great lip balm with a little added color.</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth it to order this online.</li>
      <li>I hope it will be available more and constantly soon.</li>
      <li>Also fun because it&#x27;s not something you can get here.  </li>
      <li>The color is pale pink and the light rose flavor is great.</li>
      <li>this right after I saw on Amazon,</li>
      <li>I had hoped the tint would have been greater-it is very subtle at best.</li>
      <li>I usually like the smell of rose and almond, but I find the fragrance of this overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This tin of rosy lips feels more moisturising that the US mini pot which tends to feel a little more waxy.</li>
      <li>I would certainly call this a MUST BUY!</li>
      <li>Finally, I love that it has a light pink tint upon application.</li>
      <li>but with a touch of pink and a nice smell.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>I know several people who really love this stuff, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>The products smells exactly like insect-repellent.</li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time.</li>
      <li>it glides on easier and leaves a pretty rosy tint.  </li>
      <li>Just like with any product that is housed in metal like this one, I warn: do not get this too hot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rich on your lips and definitely moisturizes them well.</li>
      <li>I prefer the way regular petroleum jelly feels on my lips, the way it seems to go on more smoothly and slightly more thickly.  </li>
      <li>I receive this item fairly quick given it was coming from so far away</li>
      <li>I have the rose one and it has a slight tint to it.</li>
      <li>My ONLY wish is that it had SPF in it since my lips burn easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Kept my lips moisturized for more than two days.  Excellent product for the lips.  I have been using this product for more than three months....will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it while I was overseas and ever since have been looking for a way to purchase it. It was definitely worth it to order this online. I love the texture, its comparable to the original Vaseline lip therapy.  It smells very lightly of rose, which is nice because it&#x27;s not too overpowering.  Finally, I love that it has a light pink tint upon application. Some days rather than putting on chaptstick and lipstick, I&#x27;ll just use this instead!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the perfect thing to keep in a coat pocket for cold days. It&#x27;s easy to open without dropping, even with gloves on, and my lips feel less abused from the wind and sleet. Nice color, and I like that the container allows one to basically dip their puckered lips into it (vs the style that looks like a miniature tub of Vaseline).</li>
    <li> I love this version of Rosy Lips. I much prefer this version to the US Mini Rosy Lips. This tin of rosy lips feels more moisturising that the US mini pot which tends to feel a little more waxy.</li>
    <li> My FAV! A friend of mine bought these out of country, and fell in love! They don&#x27;t sell in the US so I&#x27;m happy I found on amazon</li>
    <li> i suffer from dry lips.ive used just about everything that sold out there.when i saw this online, i took a chance and purchased it.for me, it was an expensive speculation.  this item came from europe and i live in new york city.  i paid altogether $14. too much..I know! BUT...i LOVE it!!!!!  I am now remembering that i used to use vaseline as a child and it worked just fine, but turned to more sophisticated products as i grew up.well now im back to the basics, vaseline with a sophisticated touch of rose and almond oil!  Fantastic!  now i need to  scour the city for this item. Somebody must carry it!</li>
    <li> A friend let me try hers and raved about it. I immediately got online and purchased several. A hint of color and a light fragrance. Also fun because it&#x27;s not something you can get here.  Will be giving these to friends too.</li>
    <li> It is just petroleum jelly with a hint of pink tint.  Goes on softly, not hurting your sore and chapped lips, and I LOVE the faint pink color; like your natural color only better!!</li>
    <li> I know several people who really love this stuff, so I decided to give it a try. I usually like the smell of rose and almond, but I find the fragrance of this overwhelming. I will say that it seems very nice and moisturizing on the lips, but I simply can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. Smells amazing and moisturizes with a hint of color.  Does get very soft if the temp. is too warm though so don&#x27;t leave it in your car (at least not in FL!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a long time because seems like this product is just available in Europe. I just purchased 2 of this right after I saw on Amazon, and it&#x27;s just perfect!!! It moisterizes lips, give quite color pay off, non-sticky, and the smell is so good. I also realized that the Vaseline Rosy Lips works on my lips better than my Mac Tinted lip balm or even the Benefit tinted lip balm ( which is much more expensive). I went to Amazon again to order some more for my sister but so sad it&#x27;s not in stock anymore. This is a disaster!!! I hope it will be available more and constantly soon. Thanks for bringing this to the US trade mark (^__^) If you want a lipbalm which is unexpensive and works perfectly, Vaseline Rosy Lips would not disapoint you!</li>
    <li> Too much petroleum product in it. Really thin and nothing special. Would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Better products out there with easier to get at lids and contents.</li>
    <li> i really don&#x27;t like to use any kind of lip balm just because how sticky and heavy they usually felt on my lips.  i bought this only because i like the packaging... yes... i&#x27;m odd.  but am i happy i did!!  it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it gives such a cute pink hue on my lips!  i will only use this from now on.</li>
    <li> This large container is very cumbersome to open -- The lid slips and has to be pried open awkwardly. The products smells exactly like insect-repellent. After wiping it from my lips, I can&#x27;t get rid of this chemical / bug spray smell :(  Yucky stuff. (I also didn&#x27;t find the color or gloss effect to be attractive or comfortable on the lips). You get what you pay for. This product is a complete waste.</li>
    <li> This was a little greasier than I expected it would be.  Also, I thought it would have a stronger Rose/Almond smell than it did.  The lid is impossibly hard to get off so I can&#x27;t carry it in my purse because I need a pair of pliers to open the lid.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing. My favorite is the rosy lips version. It is super moisturizing and exfoliating. Smells great, not sticky or greasy. In a pinch you can also use as a hand moisturizer or for whatever else you would use vaseline for. Perfect for winter. My ONLY wish is that it had SPF in it since my lips burn easily.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, this sounded really nice to me and so I wanted to try it. For me, this is just okay.  I prefer the way regular petroleum jelly feels on my lips, the way it seems to go on more smoothly and slightly more thickly.  I do love that I was able to get it for just under $3 with free shipping all the way from England (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still the case now).</li>
    <li> It is funny that I should make a review on this product,but anyway this lip gloss is as good as it get as a lip gloss. It does works fine I do not think that vaseline would make a noneffective lip gloss but I know that there are a lot of lip gloss that does a better job. but  still I do believe that this is a safe purchase after all this one has an name that is established.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this since, but I didn&#x27;t, at least not as a lip balm. It&#x27;s not especially moisturizing (it has a matte finish), the color is pretty but doesn&#x27;t last long...and the fragrance was too much. I guess I got used to being fragrance-free for work, but this stuff was overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...this does act as a decent highlighter! I&#x27;ve been using it in lieu of blush during these cold dry months and it looks really dewy. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me as a much when it&#x27;s not right under my nose.</li>
    <li> I have the rose one and it has a slight tint to it. Strong on rosy scent and not much staying power. Like it just absorbs so quick after each application I feel like I have to apply every hour. But I just really like this tint so I might purchase again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the quality of this product. It&#x27;s very rich on your lips and definitely moisturizes them well. The color is also very lovely; it enhances my natural lip color rather than covers it up. It isn&#x27;t too strongly scented, but there is the faintest hint of almond and rose. Very pleasant. I had to give it four stars just because the tin is a pain in the butt to get open, but it could just be that mine warped slightly or something during shipping.</li>
    <li> Very good lip balm and has a nice, very sheer tint.</li>
    <li> Came from England. The color is pale pink and the light rose flavor is great. Makes my lips very soft.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm with a little added color.</li>
    <li> This product is beautifully designed, I just adore the light rose shade of the case &amp; its presentation. The case is easy to keep in your purse or pockets because it is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. One down side-I had ordered on August 29th &amp; it finally arrived September 20th. It&#x27;s not a huge deal but it would have been better if there wasn&#x27;t such a delay. Now onto the actual product. Yes, it is moisturizing &amp; smooth. You dab your finger(I use the pad of my ring finger) &amp; then lightly coat my lips. You might want to wash/rub the jelly off after because there it leaves an oily reside. I had hoped the tint would have been greater-it is very subtle at best. Also, it feels like I have to reapply often because either my lips absorb it or it comes off within 5-10 minutes of wear. Either way, I can tell they are hydrated so it is doing its job. It has a faint but sweet scent that is pleasant. I had assumed that this was a lip-tint so the only negative was that it could have been a little bit starker but overall, a very nice product that I think you will like!</li>
    <li> I am a sucker for chap stick and good lip balms, and haven&#x27;t been able to find one that works better than this!   I have been an avid user of Vasseline products since I was young, and was introduced to this one by my friend  who lived in London for a year. It smells and tastes wonderful and looks great on your lips! It also moisturizes  them and makes them perfectly! She told me, however, that it was only available in Europe and so I was extremely  excited to be able to find this! I bought 2! I would certainly call this a MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> Nice subtle color, and lasts for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product. I carry it everywhere. I goes on so smooth. My lips are always soft. I do like the tint in it. It&#x27;s not to dark. I would recommend it to everyone. Vaseline is a old and reliable product!</li>
    <li> keep lips healthy and protected from the elements .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product all that much.  I am use to a more solid form of lip therapy and this is slimy and slick.  I didn&#x27;t care for the feeling on my lips.  I guess this is purely personal preference.  If you like the gloss feeling that you would probably like this  item.  It does help to sooth the lips and it definitely does the job but I don&#x27;t care for the feeling.  Your preference.</li>
    <li> Better than the U.S. collection; not as sticky, you get a lot more in the container and you don&#x27;t need a lot to apply.</li>
    <li> the delivery delay and all product in  so bad situation , i didn&#x27;t like it .&lt;br /&gt;i will not buy again .</li>
    <li> Wish they has this in Canada</li>
    <li> Apparently, this product is all over in the UK, I wish it was more available here.  I really REALLY wanted to try it and my friend went to the UK for a trip.  I convinced her to buy me on of these lil guys and I&#x27;m so friggin happy.  It coats the lips pretty well, but in the description it says \\&quot;light tint.\\&quot;  Well, that&#x27;s not true.  I haven&#x27;t seen my lips tint at all...so that&#x27;s a let down.  Also, it smells like roses, but it tastes like petroleum jelly.  Either way, it makes my lips really soft in the harsh winters (its 25 degrees here, this is california WHAT is going on).  I just use it when I&#x27;m at home on the couch, not when I go out at all..  Just like with any product that is housed in metal like this one, I warn: do not get this too hot.  The product will melt and even after it gets hard again, it won&#x27;t be the same consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, side note, in the UK these are about 2 dollar a piece, so the amazon price seems really expensive!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing without being goopy and has a lovely smell.</li>
    <li> Love these. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I purchased the rosy lips. I do like it and use it, but I am not sure if I would repurchase it. It adds a pretty color to your lips that looks very natural and it does have a nice scent, but the texture is a little thin and doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as regular vaseline is. It also is a little messy in the tin and turns your finger a little pink. Overall, good product but I would probably try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve placed an order for 2 Vaseline Lip Therapy Rosy Lips. The seller provided an email with tracking number in which I can easily track my items during the shipping process. I was fascinated with the time it took for them to reply to my email (about where my items were because I&#x27;m very impatient) and the friendly response. The product came in a seal envelop undamaged. It&#x27;s like the regular Vaseline but with a touch of pink and a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I receive this item fairly quick given it was coming from so far away lol! I like it! It is very smooth and makes your lips very very shiney. I just wished it came in a tube and it also gives u a lil hint of color. Good price for the size and quality. I would order again. Thank u</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great, it keeps my lips from getting chapped even in the Cold North, and it isn&#x27;t a stick, so I can&#x27;t forget it in my jeans and send it through the wash.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! The rosy tint is the perfect color snd perfect amount of shiny  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on a very long time.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff.  cant decide if it&#x27;s better than smith&#x27;s but i&#x27;m leaning towards yes.  it glides on easier and leaves a pretty rosy tint.  my only tiny tiny problem with it is after a while, you start to smell the petroleum smell (vaseline smell) but its very very faint and most people probably wouldnt even notice.  afterall, it IS vaseline.</li>
    <li> I have been using this periodically (only when I am too lazy to go get my other lip balm). It comes off quickly and easily and has to be reapplied every 10 minutes or so. But it&#x27;s really good for a chapped finger!!! :)</li>
    <li> Love the taste, the smell, and the color (rose)!!!  Will be buying more and will will be buying them more often :)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses it and she just loves it.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time. I didn&#x27;t realize there was a US version, but in any case I&#x27;m glad I purchased this version cause of the ingredients. My lips are soft and moisturized and love that the Rosy Lips version gives a slight tint. My only complaint is that it goes on light and the shine only lasts a few minutes, but other than that I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful on my lips and lasts a long time. I love to use it over lip stain for nice moisture. You do have to re-apply after eating and drinking but you have to do that with other products too. I will be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> The lip therapy works great. It doesn&#x27;t have to be applied as often as chap stick. It doesn&#x27;t feel goopy or heavy. It also gives just a hint of color. I love it.</li>
    <li> I rather just use carmex.... I like the weight of it and does not need to be re-applied all the time.</li>
