      <li>Alright, my hair looks amazing after using this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I ordered this set, and did my own BB at home.</li>
      <li>As my hair is often colored, I required a hair product which could work effectively on all hair types including colored hair.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more it sticks in hair</li>
      <li>and I was nervous about ironing each strand as many times as the directions called for.</li>
      <li>I am an ardent admirer of the latest fashion trends and I love reflecting them in my styling quotient, including my hair.</li>

      <li>Very helpful!!!</li>
      <li>if I can I will leave feedback after my first wash in 4 tdays :)</li>
      <li>So I had to go and get another hair cut, my hair dresser, bless her heart, fit me right away and gave me a free hair cut</li>
      <li>Realistically this is good for all hair types that are colored and permed; it will restore the balance of your hair with softening techniques giving you an overall opulent look with no lurking raindrops to infiltrate your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have curly hair but on top of being curly my hair is very frizzy.</li>
      <li>After a quick search I found it and ordered it on Amazon and after one treatment I could already see a difference.</li>
      <li>I quickly turned to my stylist for advice and she recommended this product.</li>
      <li>but I had better results with iq natural.</li>
      <li>right away gave me compliments.  </li>
      <li>If you want improve your hair the right way then you&#x27;re going to want to use this product.</li>
      <li>There is enough product in the set for several applications making the L&#x27;emarie set even more cost effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros: Clean, restores, and softens; all types of hair with keratin enhanced nutriments; economical pricing; No-frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A rare to find item mostly available through online purchase, not found in local retailer stores</li>
      <li>but I had such great results with this product that I thought I would come back and give my feedback.</li>
      <li>This is the first keratin treatment I have used in my hair.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had compliments on my hair, well since 2004, before I had my first baby.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>L&#x27;emaria Brazilian Keratin Treatment has a new way of setting an individuals hair straight with some omissions to courser hair that many people have though it does not mean it is not pertinent for all hair types.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try to do a better and braver job using the flat iron.</li>
      <li>Once I applied the product per the instructions and followed the whole step by step process, my hair was straight and very manageable.</li>
      <li>It did get my hair straight for about 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>and it stayed straight and combs through with ease.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But when I apply this hair treatment my hair grows so much shinny and softy as well.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is very watery, I never used this products before so</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, I color my hair too much, because I work out a lot</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m getting ready to give myself another treatment.</li>
      <li>My hair is not very curly, and I was hopping that the product was going to do a better work on me.</li>
      <li>I will be trying other products to see which ones are better and cheaper, but I do recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Not only are the instructions clear and simple, but the end result is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I enjoy experimenting with my hair and this habit of mine, at times, makes my hair dry, damaged, and without shine.</li>
      <li>when i boought it was 59.99 more or less and now it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Highly recommended as a leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I might have had my iron and too high heat.</li>
      <li>I think my ends fried because they were already damaged from all the coloring and the high heat did not help.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of hard with your eyes.</li>
      <li>The bottle will last 6 to 12 months when used this way, so I figure it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I don´t know if that´s normal.</li>
      <li>Confession: I pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything productive for my hair last year.</li>
      <li>I purchased the product based on other reviews and was not disappointed with my decision.</li>
      <li>this is a hard product to come by in many retailer stores and salons which only allows for you to find the right stuff online.</li>
      <li>To my surprise, the keratin treatment remedy started showing positive results within a few days itself.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of my hair has improved tremendously today</li>
      <li>Amazingly, this treatment remedy goes deep down the shaft of the hair and supplies the much required moisture, which lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>After my first wash I blew my hair out and flat ironed it</li>
      <li>first day I flat ironed this to my hair</li>
      <li>I have had a hard time finding the right kind of keratin treatment for my tousled hair and cynical about the product yet over time I have come to use L&#x27;emaria more than any other therapy available.</li>
      <li>So I suggest get a dry hair cut right after using this product.  </li>
      <li>I thought I ruined it, but after washing once (day after) WOWOWOW so soft and</li>
      <li>and I was so surprised with the results.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want them to go away completely</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shine and frizz is gone.</li>
      <li>, I can apply it at least 6 more times and that saves me a ton.</li>
      <li>My curly, dry, damaged hair looks much better after using L´emarie Brazilian Keratin Treatment, now my hair is shiny and less frizzy.</li>
      <li>Very surprised by the results, which leads me to believe some of the reviews were fabricated a bit to get sales started.  </li>
      <li>and I sweat like no other and sweat eats my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The next time I went to get a color touch up, my stylist commented on how soft my hair was.  </li>
      <li>I have tried both the in-salon Brazilian blowout, and also have done the DIY at home using a different brand (which worked well), but this did not reduce fizziness, and made my hair overall feel stiff (even after washing for the first time).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length curly hair that has gotten frizzy as I have gotten older. It&#x27;s also hard to control in the S. Florida humidity so I usually wear it in a french twist or in nape pony tail. My stylist recommended a Keratin treatment but they are expensive. After reading the reviews, I got the L&#x27;emarie set. It certainly made a difference but the result wasn&#x27;t perfect. That may be pilot error as it&#x27;s very hard for me to flat iron my hair myself.  Also,  my iron only goes up to 350 degrees--the minimum recommended-- and I was nervous about ironing each strand as many times as the directions called for. My hair wasn&#x27;t damaged,  my color seemed to last longer after the treatment, and I still had some waves. I didn&#x27;t want them to go away completely so that was good. The next time I went to get a color touch up, my stylist commented on how soft my hair was.  It&#x27;s been a couple of months and I&#x27;m getting ready to give myself another treatment. I&#x27;ll try to do a better and braver job using the flat iron. There is enough product in the set for several applications making the L&#x27;emarie set even more cost effective.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product based on other reviews and was not disappointed with my decision. The product was relatively easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> This Brazilian Hair Kit is simply awesome.This hair product helps all types of hair.Even for curly hair..My hair become rough and dry during few months.But when I apply this hair treatment my hair grows so much shinny and softy as well.So I recommend you to buy this product and then see its remarkable result.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better results from this Keratin treatment. Have used different kinds in the past and this time after using the product didn&#x27;t see the result. Right after ordering this products I ordered another kind as I wasn&#x27;t satifiled with the results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any results yet. My hair is still frizzy. What was expected is not delivered. What&#x27;s more it sticks in hair</li>
    <li> I love this product !!!! it really works, bad thing is unavailable right now because I need to buy another one.</li>
    <li> i love this product. it works! i used a month ago, my hair has no frizz it&#x27;s really soft. when you apply the traerment it&#x27;s kind of hard with your eyes. you should be in a open place. i wanna know why it&#x27;s so expensive now. when i boought it was 59.99 more or less and now it&#x27;s 90 us$. Anyway i will buy it again but for a lowest price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for two years! I seriously can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this long to find it. All in all, this is the perfect product for anyone looking to revitalize their hair and bring it back to what it USED to look like. Not only are the instructions clear and simple, but the end result is AMAZING. After using this product successfully I couldn&#x27;t live without it. Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> I have had Brazilian Blowouts done at the salon, but could no longer justify spending the big bucks for it. So I ordered this set, and did my own BB at home. The results were not as good as the salon version. Instead I have started using it as a leave in conditioner, placing one to two quarter sized dollops in wet hair after a shower. I have noticed a huge difference in my hair. Highly recommended as a leave in conditioner. The bottle will last 6 to 12 months when used this way, so I figure it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the first keratin treatment I have used in my hair. It seems to have done what it was supposed to do. I have very tight spiral curls. Once I applied the product per the instructions and followed the whole step by step process, my hair was straight and very manageable. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a week after like the instructions say. After my first wash I blew my hair out and flat ironed it and it stayed straight and combs through with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got bored with wearing my hair straight after a month so I stopped flat ironing it and just washed and lets my hair air dry. My curls were looser and hair was still manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products do not come with instructions so you will have to read them off the amazon description of the item. It also doesn&#x27;t say how often you should touch up with the product but I assume it can be redone every few months. One thing i did not like about the item was that it left flakes in my hair after initial application. I might have had my iron and too high heat. I&#x27;ll have to see how it works the next time I apply it.</li>
    <li> I am an ardent admirer of the latest fashion trends and I love reflecting them in my styling quotient, including my hair. I enjoy experimenting with my hair and this habit of mine, at times, makes my hair dry, damaged, and without shine. Of late, I had been looking out for a product, which could potentially rejuvenate my hair and restore their shine and strength. As my hair is often colored, I required a hair product which could work effectively on all hair types including colored hair. One day, my colleague advised me to use L&#x27;emarie keratin plus protein for my hair. A little reluctant initially, I finally bought the product and started using it. To my surprise, the keratin treatment remedy started showing positive results within a few days itself.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of my hair has improved tremendously today and I feel free to experiment now, without any worries of damaging my hair. Amazingly, this treatment remedy goes deep down the shaft of the hair and supplies the much required moisture, which lasts for a long time. My hair has a strong body structure now and is full of shine. They are bouncy, long, and beautiful. The frizz is reduced and my hair is not dry anymore due to my fashion experiments!</li>
    <li> My curly, dry, damaged hair looks much better after using L´emarie Brazilian Keratin Treatment, now my hair is shiny and less frizzy. The shampoo is very watery, I never used this products before so I don´t know if that´s normal.</li>
    <li> I have tried both the in-salon Brazilian blowout, and also have done the DIY at home using a different brand (which worked well), but this did not reduce fizziness, and made my hair overall feel stiff (even after washing for the first time). Very surprised by the results, which leads me to believe some of the reviews were fabricated a bit to get sales started.  Just saying...</li>
    <li> I bought this to do my moms hair it took 4 hours her hair is healthier looking and 50percent straighter u can get two treatments out of it</li>
    <li> Alright, my hair looks amazing after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I color my hair too much, because I work out a lot and I sweat like no other and sweat eats my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;I got a hair cut a day before using this product, figured the ends will not fry, I took 2.5 inches off. Then I used the treatment and I used Remington pearl iron 450 degrees to flatten my hair.  I am not sure what happened but my ends fried, beyond fried, 1.5 or 2 of them.  So I had to go and get another hair cut, my hair dresser, bless her heart, fit me right away and gave me a free hair cut, I felt terrible, she did all this work a day before for nothing.  I think my ends fried because they were already damaged from all the coloring and the high heat did not help.  But my hair looks amazing!!!!!!  So I suggest get a dry hair cut right after using this product.  I went to the gym and two people right away gave me compliments.  I haven&#x27;t had compliments on my hair, well since 2004, before I had my first baby.  I will be trying other products to see which ones are better and cheaper, but I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I had such great results with this product that I thought I would come back and give my feedback. I have curly hair but on top of being curly my hair is very frizzy. I have tried so many products to try to get rid of the friz and nothing worked. I finally decided to give this product a try and I was so surprised with the results. I could never just wash my hair and go. I always had to either put tons of products to leave it curly or blow dry it and flat iron it. Now I can wash my hair and style it in minutes and the friz is finally gone. I already recommended this product to my sisters who have hair just like me and they&#x27;re also very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This product was ok, nothing to brag about. It did get my hair straight for about 4 weeks. I expected the product to stayed on my hair longer since I only wash my hair once a week (big dissapoinment on that part!)&lt;br /&gt;It damaged my hair ALOT too, I had to cut at least 1 inch off my hair. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product to others.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;emaria Brazilian Keratin Treatment has a new way of setting an individuals hair straight with some omissions to courser hair that many people have though it does not mean it is not pertinent for all hair types. I raised an eyebrow at the 3 pc Treatment seeing it in the beginning as just another way to waste money on another product that will break and brittle your hair ,but as it turns out that is not the case. I have had a hard time finding the right kind of keratin treatment for my tousled hair and cynical about the product yet over time I have come to use L&#x27;emaria more than any other therapy available. Customers should take note this is a hard product to come by in many retailer stores and salons which only allows for you to find the right stuff online. Realistically this is good for all hair types that are colored and permed; it will restore the balance of your hair with softening techniques giving you an overall opulent look with no lurking raindrops to infiltrate your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Clean, restores, and softens; all types of hair with keratin enhanced nutriments; economical pricing; No-frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A rare to find item mostly available through online purchase, not found in local retailer stores</li>
    <li> I love that it comes in 12 oz bottles but I had better results with iq natural. my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to dry any faster. it is healthy though and did loosen up my curls.</li>
    <li> dated  june 27th&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product despite some of the feed back saying it was false. I applied this product the same way you would the brazilian blowout only I added a little olive oil to my hair after shampooing it 3 times. so far so good and my hair looks just like it would after I would get the blowout. if I can I will leave feedback after my first wash in 4 tdays :) I have no doubt that it works.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 1st So, I am very pleased with the product and I will use it from here on out. It looks great after the 4 day wash. My hair looks just like I did a $200 brazilian and I going to be saving money with this product, I can apply it at least 6 more times and that saves me a ton. I don&#x27;t understand why the review says there might be some false reviews cause i&#x27;m here to say It works great, didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry at all. maybe the other reviews did not apply it right, not really sure.</li>
    <li> Confession: I pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything productive for my hair last year. Trust me when I say it was bad. I quickly turned to my stylist for advice and she recommended this product. Specifically, she said \\&quot;there&#x27;s nothing as good and as affordable as L&#x27;emarie\\&quot;. After a quick search I found it and ordered it on Amazon and after one treatment I could already see a difference. Two weeks later and my hair was back to its former glory. If you want improve your hair the right way then you&#x27;re going to want to use this product. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> My hair fell and changed dramatically after medications/bleaching treatment and an \\&quot;at-home\\&quot; kit. I went from having beautiful silky hair to NOTHING to brag about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept seeing people come in my office with \\&quot;salon\\&quot; keratin treatments, but $300.00? No thanks! Then, I found L&#x27;emarie. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I flat ironed this to my hair it was like straw. I thought I ruined it, but after washing once (day after) WOWOWOW so soft and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend watching youtube to learn how to self apply. Very helpful!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good treatment but it doesn&#x27;t stays a long time. My hair is not very curly, and I was hopping that the product was going to do a better work on me.</li>
    <li> the product is good easy to use good price just be sure to follow the care after treatment as indicated by the specifications with the same products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fabulous! Easy to apply and safe to use at home. My hair is soft, shine and frizz is gone.I would recommend to any one. After I wash my hair, just a little blow dry and that&#x27;s it.</li>
