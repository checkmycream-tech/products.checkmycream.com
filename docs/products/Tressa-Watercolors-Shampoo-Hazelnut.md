### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The PRICE was very good!</li>
      <li>Best color depositing shampoo that I have ever found.</li>
      <li>Not just color: great conditioning!  </li>
      <li>I no longer have to color my hair every month because of this shampoo and that makes me a very happy man!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy I did!</li>
      <li>and it works great!</li>
      <li>I have to say in my experience with this product that I am impressed!</li>
      <li>Brilliant product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great color depositing shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This does an outstanding job with preventing it and leaves my hair feeling great!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>meaning warm or gold tones</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo; hair shines.  </li>
      <li>Good for refreshing between coloring</li>
      <li>My partner brought some of this home from the beautician and, after trying it, bought my own through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>; tones highlights nicely.</li>
      <li>and it made a huge difference!</li>
      <li>But, for the most part, I would say my color is 90%-95% corrected.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this</li>
      <li>It is one of the better products that I have used for this purpose.</li>
      <li>Great product.. Leave your hair so soft..</li>
      <li>It is sulfate free and is therefore safe for color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I am like others and wish a conditioner was also available with the tinting but that hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause any problem with how it works from what I can tell.  </li>
      <li>The professional glaze corrected it by maybe 50% - a noticeable improvement but far from perfect.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much shampoo to get a nice head full of soapy suds.  </li>
      <li>Gives my very light gray/blonde hair just enough color to look more &amp;#34;golden / brown / blonde&amp;#34; than gray.  </li>
      <li>The red/orange/copper was reduced, but still very visible in certain light (mainly sunlight and bright</li>
      <li>It has a slight floral fragrance that is very nice</li>
      <li>Not only is this an amazing shampoo</li>
      <li>I used as directed and am pleased with the results-- evens out hair tones and leaves my hair soft and bouncey.</li>
      <li>I would say the John Frieda Gloss (that I only used once and is not designed for this kind of hair catastrophe) corrected the warmth by 0%.  </li>
      <li>not so with Tressa Hazelnut - it really is a NATURAL cool light brown.  </li>
      <li>It is a good shampoo - doesn&#x27;t come off on towels, feel waxy or weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>but she was reluctant to do very much processing b/c</li>
      <li>I had grown it out as much as I could stand, which was 3 months worth.</li>
      <li>or if it looks like color deposits from this first treatment are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>old hairdresser (who I LOVE) was able to correct the problem partially with a no-amonia glaze</li>
      <li>First, some background on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny,</li>
      <li>Glad my one and only hair dresser (first time getting my hair done BTW) gave me this color wheel lesson for my hair.</li>
      <li>Recently got my second session this week, went from orange-copper hair to ash-brown/blonde hair and can honestly say it helped out a lot!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was searching for.  </li>
      <li>the hazelnut did seem to have some effect after first shampoo in that the grays around my temples do seem a bit darkened.  </li>
      <li>It toned it down to the perfect color and even eliminated some of the orange red in my natural color!</li>
      <li>There is still a little warmth (which actually looks kind of nice at this point) especially in brighter light.</li>
      <li>I used one for cool blonds and one for cool brunettes and mixed them together.</li>
      <li>I love that its sulfate free and low lathering (those that are used to regular shampoo may dislike that aspect).</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny and full of body.  </li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair that tends to pull red tones easily between colors.  </li>
      <li>This works really well to tone down the overly warm tones in my brown-red hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>and it lathers really well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously, do a patch and strand test before shampooing your whole head.</li>
      <li>and that is precisely what I want to stay away from so back to Amazon</li>
      <li>The shampoo is very moisturizing by itself.</li>
      <li>But I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt much either.</li>
      <li>First, I did a strand test to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair green or something.</li>
      <li>I then rinsed and conditioned my hair as normal, then blew it out with a pump of Wen and some pure Jojoba oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not have alot of the offending grays yet (less than 5%) but every single one of them is unwelcome and this shampoo is very effective at covering them up.</li>
      <li>I alternate with 3 other Tressa Watercolors Shampoos in Cocoa, Molten Bronze, and Golden Mist - or sometimes a mix of 2 or more together.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t leave any color in my hair like I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
      <li>My colorist only had to put dye on the blonde part and it stayed pretty true.</li>
      <li>Surprised me, though, it looks like ink!</li>
      <li>The first session was color correcting and bleaching so the undertones of red (orange/copper) began to show.</li>
      <li>Red Hot loreal hi color (reds meant for dark hair) for 3 years and decided to go light for my brother&#x27;s wedding.</li>
      <li>I first bought Cocoa thinking that it would be natural looking, forgetting that natural actually means neutral in the color world</li>
      <li>It left me with really copper/red/orange hair.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used my semi-permanent blonde / golden blonde combo colors in over a year now.</li>
      <li>This is the first color shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I lather twice if the red tones are particularly bothersome.  </li>
      <li>normally use Wen Cleansing Conditioner which doesn&#x27;t strip moisture or color from hair, so I plan on using Tressa Watercolors in Hazelnut again only if I feel I want to tone out the rest of the warmth completely</li>
      <li>Since my hair is naturally on the oily side I barely need conditioner, even on the ends.</li>
      <li>For those of you that are new to coloring/toning...green is opposite orange/red in the color wheel and helps to counteract that shade.</li>
      <li>the highlights were initially ashy white but much lighter than I wanted.</li>
      <li>I hope my experience can help anyone like me who wants an inexpensive way to tone out red and copper colors in their hair with an at-home, deposit only, no ammonia</li>
      <li>and I know of no other shampoo that does what this one does.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels and looks soft and shiny and the color is revitalized for that 2 or 3 weeks prior to another salon visit.</li>
      <li>I had my blonde hair professionally dyed back to my natural color, medium ash brown, 2 months after giving birth.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical, as not even a professional glaze was able to neutralize all of the heat in my hair.</li>
      <li>Most brunette color shampoos do very little except to highlight your gray/white hairs with garish shades of red or pink when you actually wanted to tone them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>This shampoo is a green-based brown that is barely detectable in the actual color of the shampoo.  </li>

<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews for how well the red colors in this shampoo line work to deposit or correct color, but not very many for correcting warmth with a brown shade like Hazelnut.</li>
<li> This shampoo adds green tones that neutralize the red tones in my hair.  </li>
<li> I only use this shampoo a few times per week and leave it on for 5 minutes</li>
<li> Granted, I have tried a few different processes to correct the color</li>
<li> People find it hard to believe it&#x27;s from color back shampoos.  </li>
<li> the brassiness did not seem toned down.  </li>
<li> so I bought this shampoo to enrich the existing brown until all of the previously dyed hair has grown out.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
<li> but anyone having sensitivities to chemicals and products, i would use this with caution, it causes a little itchiness.  </li>
<li> i am hoping that after a few weeks of shampooing there will be a buildup effect</li>
<li> I went on a limb and tried this product to hide a few gray hairs.  </li>
<li> My hair has always pulled orange,red and gold tones which I hate and after recently highlighting my hair it was very gold</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not as bad as the hair color salons use that really burn and itch.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works really well to tone down the overly warm tones in my brown-red hair. It is one of the better products that I have used for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I have highlighted blonde hair and ended up with &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; roots. This added just enough depth to blend everything together.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Glad my one and only hair dresser (first time getting my hair done BTW) gave me this color wheel lesson for my hair. I been rockin&#x27; Red Hot loreal hi color (reds meant for dark hair) for 3 years and decided to go light for my brother&#x27;s wedding. The first session was color correcting and bleaching so the undertones of red (orange/copper) began to show. She told me to use this once a week while until my next section. Recently got my second session this week, went from orange-copper hair to ash-brown/blonde hair and can honestly say it helped out a lot! LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I alternate with 3 other Tressa Watercolors Shampoos in Cocoa, Molten Bronze, and Golden Mist - or sometimes a mix of 2 or more together.  Gives my very light gray/blonde hair just enough color to look more &amp;#34;golden / brown / blonde&amp;#34; than gray.  I get lots of compliments on the color.  People find it hard to believe it&#x27;s from color back shampoos.  I haven&#x27;t used my semi-permanent blonde / golden blonde combo colors in over a year now.</li>
    <li> I recently went blonder and unfortunately my hair had quite a bit of that &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; color no one likes. I tried color kites (purple shampoo), but it didn&#x27;t touch that orangy color at all. I used this once and it made a huge difference! I&#x27;ll be using this going forward. I also ordered violet, but haven&#x27;t tried it yet. I&#x27;ll post the before (L) and after (R) so you can see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I went on a limb and tried this product to hide a few gray hairs.  It was not effective at all.  It must only work on colored hair only, not natural?</li>
    <li> I had my blonde hair professionally dyed back to my natural color, medium ash brown, 2 months after giving birth. I had grown it out as much as I could stand, which was 3 months worth. My colorist only had to put dye on the blonde part and it stayed pretty true. It&#x27;s been 6 months and I didn&#x27;t want anymore permanent hair color so I bought this shampoo to enrich the existing brown until all of the previously dyed hair has grown out. The shampoo is very moisturizing by itself. Since my hair is naturally on the oily side I barely need conditioner, even on the ends. All in all is does what is says, I will probably buy a darker shade of brown next time and I have had to use it the past 3 days, consecutively, to start to notice it working. But I would recommend it for someone who has gone from blonde to brown, as I have. Also, it does not stain my hands, nails, skin or shower. Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> Really does put a slight temporary tint to my hair - takes the red/gold down a bit.  Doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  Nice shampoo; hair shines.  Good for refreshing between coloring; tones highlights nicely.</li>
    <li> This shampoo adds green tones that neutralize the red tones in my hair.  I colored my hair recently and after a while, the tone of the color changes and my red/orange undertones appear.  I use this shampoo a couple of times a week to take care of the ugly reddish undertones.  I haven&#x27;t found a shampoo that could do this until I found this one quite by accident.  It is sulfate free and is therefore safe for color treated hair.  It has a slight floral fragrance that is very nice and it lathers really well.  It doesn&#x27;t take much shampoo to get a nice head full of soapy suds.  I leave it on for 10-15 minutes while I finish my shower.  Sometimes I lather twice if the red tones are particularly bothersome.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny and full of body.  I really like this product and I know of no other shampoo that does what this one does.  I highly recommend it if you want to cancel out nasty reddish tones in light/medium brown hair.</li>
    <li> First, some background on my hair.  I am a dark, wavy brunette that recently started highlighting my hair blonde to hide grays. I have had blonde highlights several times throughout my life and have always pulled that awful brassy/orange color despite toners. I have tried several purple shampoos including Clairol shimmerlights, Joico&#x27;s, and Ion.  They helped, but my hair is not really yellow, as it is orange/coppery. This shampoo is a green-based brown that is barely detectable in the actual color of the shampoo.  However, it really delivers when it comes to toning down the awful coppery hue in the bottom part of my hair. For those of you that are new to coloring/toning...green is opposite orange/red in the color wheel and helps to counteract that shade. I love that its sulfate free and low lathering (those that are used to regular shampoo may dislike that aspect). I do not use sulfates in my hair care.  I only wish there was a matching conditioner as well!</li>
    <li> This is the first color shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  My hair feels and looks soft and shiny and the color is revitalized for that 2 or 3 weeks prior to another salon visit.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well on my hair, My hair stylist used it on my hair to enhance my color. I love it!</li>
    <li> the blonde color shampoos did nothing for me.  guess my hair is just too mousy/dark.  the hazelnut did seem to have some effect after first shampoo in that the grays around my temples do seem a bit darkened.  the brassiness did not seem toned down.  i am hoping that after a few weeks of shampooing there will be a buildup effect and i will see these changes.  if so, i will report back.  it definitely was drying to my hair and scalp.  i did not use a conditioner because i didn&#x27;t want to risk losing the color deposit made from the shampoo.  after air drying, i used some moisturizing balm and that helped.  but anyone having sensitivities to chemicals and products, i would use this with caution, it causes a little itchiness.  but it&#x27;s not as bad as the hair color salons use that really burn and itch.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was searching for.  The PRICE was very good!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It actually does what it says - doesn&#x27;t fade the color and keeps the reddish hues out.  Surprised me, though, it looks like ink!</li>
    <li> My hair has always pulled orange,red and gold tones which I hate and after recently highlighting my hair it was very gold so decided to give this product a try and I&#x27;m happy I did! It toned it down to the perfect color and even eliminated some of the orange red in my natural color! I only use it once a week and it works great! The only downside is that it is a tad drying to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great color depositing shampoo.  Most brunette color shampoos do very little except to highlight your gray/white hairs with garish shades of red or pink when you actually wanted to tone them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well not so with Tressa Hazelnut - it really is a NATURAL cool light brown.  I do not have alot of the offending grays yet (less than 5%) but every single one of them is unwelcome and this shampoo is very effective at covering them up. I use this every second wash, concentrating on the hairline and part and it&#x27;s almost impossible to detect any grays now. It is a good shampoo - doesn&#x27;t come off on towels, feel waxy or weigh my hair down. Brilliant product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Paint this on with a brush and leave it to soak for an hour for a gray concealing kickstart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t leave any color in my hair like I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> Not just color: great conditioning!  My partner brought some of this home from the beautician and, after trying it, bought my own through Amazon.  I use it 2 times a week...</li>
    <li> I got a bad highlight job from a hairdresser I had never been to before. It left me with really copper/red/orange hair. It&#x27;s funny, b/c the highlights were initially ashy white but much lighter than I wanted. Her correction was to &amp;#34;warm it up&amp;#34;, leaving me with orange/copper hair which looks horrible on my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried the new(ish) John Frieda color glosses that are designed to refresh colored hair between colorings. I used one for cool blonds and one for cool brunettes and mixed them together. I used them after shampooing and conditioning. I know they&#x27;re supposed to build up color over time, but after one application I saw zero difference. I was getting impatient and wasn&#x27;t convinced that these glosses would build enough color to correct my warmth any time soon, so I tracked down my old hairstylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old hairdresser (who I LOVE) was able to correct the problem partially with a no-amonia glaze but she was reluctant to do very much processing b/c my hair was so damaged from the over processed highlights. The red/orange/copper was reduced, but still very visible in certain light (mainly sunlight and bright incandescent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the point of this review. I purchased Tressa Watercolors Shampoo in Hazelnut b/c it&#x27;s got a green base that&#x27;s supposed to cancel out red/copper tones. I was skeptical, as not even a professional glaze was able to neutralize all of the heat in my hair. But I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt much either. First, I did a strand test to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair green or something. It didn&#x27;t, so I lathered and rinsed twice in a row. I added gobs of Wen re-moist conditioner to the lathered hair with the shampoo still in it b/c my hair was too dry and it felt horrible otherwise. I don&#x27;t know if that affected the results, but I saw someone blog about using Tressa Watercolors mixed with regular Wen Cleansing Conditioner and it worked for her, so I gave it a shot. I then rinsed and conditioned my hair as normal, then blew it out with a pump of Wen and some pure Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat is almost all gone. There is still a little warmth (which actually looks kind of nice at this point) especially in brighter light. But, for the most part, I would say my color is 90%-95% corrected.  Granted, I have tried a few different processes to correct the color so I can&#x27;t attribute all of the correction to the shampoo. I would say the John Frieda Gloss (that I only used once and is not designed for this kind of hair catastrophe) corrected the warmth by 0%.  The professional glaze corrected it by maybe 50% - a noticeable improvement but far from perfect.  The Tressa Watercolors corrected it the rest of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Wen Cleansing Conditioner which doesn&#x27;t strip moisture or color from hair, so I plan on using Tressa Watercolors in Hazelnut again only if I feel I want to tone out the rest of the warmth completely or if it looks like color deposits from this first treatment are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews for how well the red colors in this shampoo line work to deposit or correct color, but not very many for correcting warmth with a brown shade like Hazelnut. I hope my experience can help anyone like me who wants an inexpensive way to tone out red and copper colors in their hair with an at-home, deposit only, no ammonia solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, do a patch and strand test before shampooing your whole head. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair that tends to pull red tones easily between colors.  This does an outstanding job with preventing it and leaves my hair feeling great!  I am like others and wish a conditioner was also available with the tinting but that hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause any problem with how it works from what I can tell.  So glad I found this and now I order 2 bottles at a time to keep stocked up.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely helps preserve my highlight color and prevents brassiness. I will purchase this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Leave your hair so soft.. u dont need use conditioner</li>
    <li> Best color depositing shampoo that I have ever found. I used to use quantum browns from Sallys until it was discontinued. Not only is this an amazing shampoo but it also comes in several colors so you can customise your end result. I first bought Cocoa thinking that it would be natural looking, forgetting that natural actually means neutral in the color world meaning warm or gold tones and that is precisely what I want to stay away from so back to Amazon I went and found hazelnut from Tressa Watercolors. I have to say in my experience with this product that I am impressed! I no longer have to color my hair every month because of this shampoo and that makes me a very happy man! I only use this shampoo a few times per week and leave it on for 5 minutes and I&#x27;m only graying on my sides FYI. Now if they only had a color shampoo for my beard...sigh</li>
    <li> I ordered this in both the Hazelnut and Violet wash.  I used as directed and am pleased with the results-- evens out hair tones and leaves my hair soft and bouncey.</li>
