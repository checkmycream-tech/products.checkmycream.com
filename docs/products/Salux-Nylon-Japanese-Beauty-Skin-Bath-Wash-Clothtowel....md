<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> if you&#x27;re looking for real exfoliation - this is the one for you. i&#x27;ve used these for years and can&#x27;t find any other product that holds a candle.</li>
    <li> My family have been using these Salux Wash Cloths for about 7 years.  Each cloth lasts about 12 months with daily use and provides a comfortable bath or shower.  Like the instructions on the package explains, wet the cloth, apply soap (bar of liquid) work up a lather and wash your body with it.  The texture of the cloth exfoliates your skin and makes for smooth skin.  Recommend running the cloths through the laundry weekly, but not the dryer only air dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using these washcloths for since I was a child and love how it exfoliates the skin. It creates great lather and the length is perfect for scrubbing your back. I like the stiffer/rougher texture of this cloth, but may be too much for those with very sensitive skin. Its very hygienic - nylon air dries quickly and can be thrown in the washing machine.</li>
    <li> The best thing since sliced bread.  This  product makes so much sense.</li>
    <li> Love these for exfoliating, will last for years!!!</li>
    <li> It took me a while to figure out what these were even called (my half Japanese boyfriend introduced me to them, but his mom was bringing them back from Japan....) and then to find them anywhere after that. I&#x27;ll put it plainly: This is like a loofa on steroids. It&#x27;s unraveled - so just a long rectangular strip, which is awesome because its makes it a lot easier to reach your own back, and the abrasion is much heavier - way better at exfoliating than those pansy little balls of fluff most people use.  :) Easier to wash out the soap afterward as well!</li>
    <li> These are great, long exfoliating washing towels. 3 pack is nice as you can toss one in the washer and have another for a back-up or share these.</li>
    <li> For me, this cloth changed my skin.  It is softer and smoother and when I apply lotion after bathing, it is even more so.&lt;br /&gt;We should be sloughing all the time and this really does the trick.  I like the long size, but I also wish there were some square ones.  The seller took a while, but did call and did send a trinket for my wait.</li>
    <li> nice exfoliating wash cloth.  my skin is nice and smooth now.</li>
    <li> Love this wash cloth!</li>
    <li> These are so much better than regular washcloths.  I feel so much cleaner!</li>
    <li> You can get amazing amounts of lather with this wash cloth, plus scrubbing your back is easy if you don&#x27;t have a friend to do it for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered these &amp;#34;Sold by JapanSuperMall and Fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; and they are in fact the real deal, Made in Japan Salux cloths.  Not really much to say about them that hasn&#x27;t been said already, but these are a definite five star product - I&#x27;m about as far from &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; or worried about &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; as you can get, but these are still my go to skin maintenance cloth.  Far superior to the scrubby puff things and so vastly superior to a cotton washcloth that I don&#x27;t even own any of the latter anymore.  It was a sad day when my local Asian grocery stopped carrying these, but fortunately Amazon is there to take care of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a better product out there I&#x27;m willing to try it, but so far this is the very very best that I have found, anywhere.</li>
    <li> Since I loved how my skin felt after use, I decided to give as gifts to family members.  I hope they love them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> These are great, it&#x27;s amazing how the soap suds cling to them,</li>
    <li> I ran out and I want more. I love taking my showers using this exfoliation cloth. You get a real good scrub and a really good lather with this cloth in plus I can actually scrub my back because it has a nice good stretch to it.</li>
    <li> You will never go back to a conventional wash cloth after using a Salux towel.  Soap foams better, your skin feels cleaner - it is amazing!  I would give this 10 stars if I could!!!</li>
    <li> THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY AAAHHHMMMAAZZZZINNNG!! I already was using a kissi glove &amp; exfoliating gloves but THIS right here is THE BEST!! I felt way more cleaner with these &amp; my skin feels amazing! I used coconut oil on my skin after &amp; it just melted right into my skin! I&#x27;ll be purchasing more to have as stock &amp; to give away as gifts!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great product and service from source.  This is a reorder for holiday gifts to introduce more to the product that I am so pleased to have received and use almost daily.</li>
    <li> I love this item. It scrubs amazingly. It is washable, but it discolors. Would be much better if it came without being dyed (natural color).</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product. Really scrubs your skin clean. Look for the Salux brand. Other knockoff products I have used are too soft.</li>
    <li> These are great for exfoliating at home! Nice enough to use on your face too.</li>
    <li> The cloths are excellent.  Noticeably cleaner . My wife believe&#x27;s this as well.  If you do painting  you know how hard it is to remove from your body.  This with some liquid soap does it quickly.  First use I thought it to be too rough.  I&#x27;m now use to it.  Washing your back is a breeze.  I have my 9 year old daughter use  this. I actually heard of this washcloth from a teen girl on youtube.  She was telling about her beauty secrets.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Better than a buff puff by far.  My whole family loves them, we would definitely recommend! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  I&#x27;ve just used it on my shower tonight and wow! Does my skin absorb that body lotion  so fast or I&#x27;m wrong? Because usually my skin feels sticky after applying lotion  after shower but not with the Salux! My skin feels so soft! Me like!</li>
    <li> Super product and we use them daily she we shower.</li>
    <li> I love these towels! I&#x27;ve tried exfoliation things like this before and nothing has even compared to the strength of these towels. Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried everything to work on the dry, flaky skin all over my body and this is a god send. My skin is soft, no longer flaky, and it feels like lotion actually absorbs!</li>
    <li> I love them.they are awesome.Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy</li>
    <li> I have brought these other places cheaper and sometimes even more expensive but no matter what I have never found one as scrubby as this brand</li>
    <li> These exfoliating wash cloths are just amazing! It works better than any other form of exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s works very well at exfoliating all of the dead skin cells off. Leaves your skin softer and renewed. It can be very abrasive, so dont scrub too hard. Im not sure if it would be a great option for sensitive skin, but I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> These are the only real japanese beauty cloths I have been able to find. Love em!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I&#x27;m glad to have discovered them.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a washcloth. It is thin and scratchy but does an amazing job at buffing your skin. I like that it is nonporous so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting funky. A good deal</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite remember where I first heard about these bath towels, but I am so glad that I came across them. I have suffered from a terrible complexion for most of my life. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of creams and gels to help with endless breakouts, and nothing worked. All I was left with was red, raw skin. I&#x27;ve always known that my excessively oily skin was to blame, but I didn&#x27;t know how to combat the clogged pores that would lead to blemishes. Using this cloth every night in the shower has been the answer. My skin has NEVER been clearer. It&#x27;s still oily as heck, but it&#x27;s CLEAR! And best of all, now that I&#x27;ve stopped using the medicated face washes and creams, I don&#x27;t suffer from horrible redness anymore. If you suffer from blemishes, blackheads or &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t caused by hormones, I highly suggest that you give these towels a try. Be gentle at first because they are definitely more abrasive that anything you&#x27;ve used before, but you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;ll acclimate to them pretty quickly. Remember pain does not equal gain; use just enough pressure to clean your skin, and be careful around sensitive areas like the eyes and bonier areas like the cheekbone or forehead (where you might suffer from &amp;#34;road rash&amp;#34; if you scrub too hard).</li>
    <li> I grew up using this product and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best exfoliating bath towel after. Even better and more well-made than that of Body Shop&#x27;s which I used to splurge over years back. It&#x27;s very long so reaching all areas is fairly easy. It&#x27;s really exfoliating and rough, the good kind of rough, and I really feel very clean every after bath whenever I use this. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cloth, it has all but cured my KP and my skin is SO smooth now! The backs of my legs have always been covered in tiny bumps and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything but this cloth works the best! I thought using it *almost* every day would irritate my skin but it hasn&#x27;t. Definitely going to be something I use for a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to my exfoliation arsenal. Works up a nice lather with a bar of soap and I feel so clean after.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, appears to be the genuine Salux.</li>
    <li> Great but way over priced!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these towels. If you like to massage your skin and get the blood circulating this is what you should have. When I have finished showering my skin tingles. Oh what a feeling</li>
    <li> These are just fantastic for exfoliation!  I love them and they are rather large.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Does make it difference on your skin.  It feels smoother and noticeable cleaner after you use it.  Would buy it again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, does what it claims and removes tons of dead skin and CAN help those with folliculitis. www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find a negative thing about it...ditch the old wash cloth..save time ,  and get cleaner..</li>
    <li> I have frequently seen these recommended, and decided to try them.  I just love them!  I really feel that my skin is not only cleaned but exfoliated.  No more dry elbows--use these in the shower and add cream later.  Even in the harsh winter, my skin is great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I never feel clean if I don&#x27;t use this and I will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> These are great - work well, last forever!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these type of wash cloths for many years. Once you use them, you won&#x27;t switch back to a regular wash cloth.  They make you feel so clean and are refreshed. The only reason I rated as a 4, the ones directly from Japan work better. Not the ones made in Japan for America but the country itself. If I had never had the opportunity to use the ones in Japan, I would have rated these a 5.</li>
    <li> These are great! I used to buy the ones from The Body Shop but these seem similar and comes in more favorable colors. They&#x27;re sturdier than the ones from The Body Shop. Those start to unweave but these have been perfect. I also feel like these may be rougher or made with s thicker material.</li>
    <li> I love these things. To me they are so much better than a body pouf as those things never seem to dry and I can never get all the soap out of them. These work up a great lather, rinse well, dry quickly, and you can matching wash them!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend not putting them in the dryer though. It doesn&#x27;t melt but if you use dryer sheets it can coat your wash cloth and make it less effective at lathering and rinsing out.&lt;br /&gt;My whole family uses them and I always keep one on hand for guests too. I love the feel of my skin after. It feels smooth and exfoliated. I won&#x27;t switch for anything!</li>
    <li> Large wash cloth - which allows scrubbing of the back.  Foams up soap really well and cleans easily after use.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower every day; even on my face. It leves ny skin feeling smooth.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I read about these in one of my magazines. I&#x27;m always looking for a spa type experience in the bathroom so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. First, this is definitely not like a soft washcloth. The cloth has a rough texture and is intended to massage as it cleans. I like the massaging feel of it and it definitely feels like I&#x27;m getting clean. I do a lot of gardening and get dirt everywhere and I honestly feel like this cloth gets me completely clean. My skin does feel exfoliated and clean with the cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably don&#x27;t want to use these on a child or if you have super sensitive skin because a child would definitely not like it and someone with sensitive skin might exacerbate whatever their condition is.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. My skin feels great. Last much longer and better value than the sponge poofs I used to use. A bit abrasive at first but you adapt quickly.</li>
    <li> so fresh and clean now.</li>
    <li> You will go through a lot of soap but this brand is the one to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered the first one about 40 years ago when a hotel guest put it into the washing machine.  DON&#x27;T DO THAT!  It ended up wound around the base of the inner tub and one end stopped the pump.&lt;br /&gt;This one rinses out clean in seconds so it never needs to leave the shower until it is worn out.  I usually get about 2000 showers or 5 years out of one. Where I live these are for sale in most stores that stock bath tools, but the convenience of  Amazon makes that trip unnecessary.</li>
    <li> Buy it. Right now.It gives me such soft skin.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They are a good exfoliant, and very helpful with hard to reach places. It&#x27;s going to take me a while to work throughout the three pack.</li>
    <li> I had a Korean body scrub in Los Angeles and fell in love with the concept. I love these since they do a great job scrubbing all over and they are long enough to fill your back. I have washed them a few times and they hold up well.</li>
    <li> Good length and width. It&#x27;s durable. My order was delivered on time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now. Once you start using Salux Nylon Wash Towel you&#x27;ll never go back to using a rag. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this is better than i expected. allows you to use very little soap, much less than regular loofah. i use it with shower gel and it helps to create lots of foam. the exfoliation effect is fantastic. easy to wash your back too. with the first use it leaves the skin quite itchy so use lots of lotion. did not see the same issue with further uses thou. the cloth is large but thin, dries really fast.</li>
    <li> I have read many reviews about the Chinese fakes.  These seem to be the real deal from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used them for years and are a great scrubber without removing your skin.</li>
    <li> My first was a gift from Japanese friends and I have used them exclusively for the last 30 years. They exfoliate without using force.  They are long, dry quickly for packing.  Just can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
    <li> I started using these in Korea when I lived there for several years, and these are the only ones I could find that were comparable and washable.  I really like them, and will continue to use them because they are well-made and do the job they are supposed to!</li>
    <li> Nice and scratchy for exfoliating, also dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> Once you have these you&#x27;ll never go back to poofs again! They work well and can be used everywhere with little soap. Buy the 3 pack and replace every few months, the scratchyness does go away with everyday use. These things are life changers for travelers,campers, active, and avid outdoors people!</li>
    <li> Nice big size and my skin feels super soft!</li>
    <li> These are large, washable, &amp; SUPER sudsy.  You do not have to scrub yourself too hard with this as it is VERY scrubby.  I use this every couple of days for exfoliation.  They make great gifts, as well!</li>
    <li> So glad I found u!! Best shower I ever have!</li>
    <li> These things are great, full stop. I have tried and thrown away many kinds of scrubbing cloths and pads, either because they were ineffective or too irritating, or because they became unsanitary in the damp environment of the shower room. These cloths have just the perfect level of abrasiveness to exfoliate without irritation (they feel stimulating rather than scratchy). The mesh-like fabric rinses completely clean and drains and dries quickly. I bunch up the soapy cloth to scrub arms, legs and feet (they are wonderful for scrubbing feet) and use it at full length to wash my back and neck. I purchased the set of three so I can rotate them and run them through the laundry weekly, but I think that if you wash the cloth out thoroughly after every use, with fresh soap, and hang it where it will dry completely, you might not have to launder it at all. My skin feels like silk after using these for just one week: all the flakiness is gone. I have paid a lot of money for full-body exfoliation at spas, and this cloth did the job just as well. (I received what appears to be the authentic Japanese product. The packages are labeled at the top with the name of a distributor based in Hawaii.)</li>
    <li> I decided to place a video review. hope its helpful for you...enjoy. I honestly can&#x27;t use nothing else when taking my bath /shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> They feel so good on your skin. I want a pink and blue two pack, but oh well.</li>
    <li> These are great to do a fine exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend these bath wash clothes to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried them. I have been using them for many years and have been having trouble finding them lately. Glad to see they are right here. Nice!</li>
    <li> How did I not know about these before now?  These are great for cleaning my back.  I love that they are so long and I love how my skin feels after I use them!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this weather my shower gel and will never go back to using a regular washcloth again!  It makes a small amount of product go a long way and has done a great job at helping clear up my KP.  I usually fold it up and get it wet, then put product on it and use it to scrub my arms and legs and then unfold it so that I can get all of my back.</li>
    <li> This is the bomb!  I have everyone I know hooked on this stuff.  Will never go back to a loofah or anything else.</li>
    <li> These are great for exfoliation!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Japanese wash clothes for over 35 years!  They&#x27;re wonderful for the skin and I always feel squeaky clean after using them.  Over the years I&#x27;ve had many friends give up wash clothes for these Japanese clothes.  My best friend in high school who is half Japanese suggested I try using one back in the 70&#x27;s.  Back in those days I had mild acne which it improved and my skin became smoother and healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought something similar to these at Walgreens, and I liked it well enough. But then I came across these on amazon, read the reviews and decided to try them,WOW!....am I glad I did!. These are far superior to the ones I got at Walgreens!, bigger size, heavier material, better quality construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband absolutly adores them and won&#x27;t use anything else now because he can finally wash his back the way he wants to. I adore them because I can even use them on my face, no more buying seperate scrubs or pads (sorry St.Ives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work way better and are much more sanitary then a shower poof or loofa, they dry within minutes and you can toss them right in the wash with hot water, I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I purchased this deal and shared the two other cloths and we all love them.  They dry quickly.  They lather beautifully.  They make your skin feel very smooth.  I&#x27;m glad I stumbled upon this product.  I will always use them. Highly recommend. (I did purchase cloths manufactured in Japan.)</li>
    <li> I am not ordering today but have been looking for these for years as I have only been able to find them in Hawaii and my last one is on its last legs as I have had it for 15 years so I can&#x27;t wait for these to come to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too large for a washcloth, and has no absorbent qualities to use as a towel.  I&#x27;m trying to cut the cloth to size, and that will hopefully work better.</li>
    <li> Overall it was a good purchase and I would recommend to others.  Item was delivered in a timely manner with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I just moved here from Asia where she had a similar washcloth.  She had been looking for one of these since we moved here since she hadn&#x27;t brought her old ones with us.  Overall she does like these.  Her only complaint is that it&#x27;s not as soft as the ones she used to buy.  But she is still happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you will wonder how you ever lived without it. I&#x27;ve used other body scrubbers, but these are the most durable and abrasive.  Some people might find it too abrasive at first, but once you get used to, it&#x27;s hard to go back to anything else. You just feel so much cleaner using this scrubber. Your skin will feel smoother too!</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of these as Christmas gifts and everyone loves them! They needed to be convinced, but they got used to them quickly and like the length. The texture took a bit of getting used to because they are a bit rough.</li>
    <li> Great cheap cloths if you love that &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; feeling after a shower!</li>
    <li> These washcloths are VERY rough. I had to return these. They are also very long which would make it good for washing your back. But they are too rough to use on my skin. Maybe a tough, rugged man would benefit from these. I can&#x27;t use them due to the roughness. They might be good to use for house cleaning or car cleaning jobs. Just not good for skin.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time tonight. It was not as comfortable as I would have liked it to be. If you have very sensitive skin it will probably be a painful experience, especially if you&#x27;re used to a soft wash cloth. I think it may have scratched my back and sides too much because it was burning after drying off. I believe I didn&#x27;t have enough soap on it initially, which created more friction than needed, so I added more soap and it was a little more tolerable. Although uncomfortable, I endured, and my face and body came out with really smooth, soft skin. After slathering on some lotion my skin feels a little better. It&#x27;s always a good idea to moisturize after exfoliating. I&#x27;ll probably use this twice a week. Not sure I would use this before going to bed though, my irritated skin definitely wasn&#x27;t helping me fall asleep. It is a large, rectangular shape, dries quickly, feels durable, and hopefully will last a long time. I would recommend this. People with very sensitive skin might want to look for something a little softer though.</li>
    <li> Nice exfoliating scrubbie wash cloths for the bath. Great to have different colors in a pack so everyone has their own!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over 30 years. Always thrilled with them but I did buy some fakes years ago, by accident. The genuine brand, Salux is the only one to get.</li>
    <li> I give these as gifts, I love mine so much.  It is awesome at sloughing rough,dead skin.  Its like a backscratcher from heaven - the length is the key.  I can hold both ends and it is big enough to wash my back, long enough to wash my feet and my privates.  It is a touch scratchier than I&#x27;d like, but I am not going to complain.  It makes me feel confidently clean and refreshed, all over.</li>
    <li> Salux is the first and the best maker of this type of cloth. If you use body wash, this cloth will give you LOTS of lather and allow you to use less wash.  I fold the cloth into a pad, wet it down, drip the body wash on to the pad, fold it again, wash the parts of me that I can reach (getting LOTS of lather in the process). Then, I open up the sudsy cloth and use it to scrub my back. The Salux bath cloth enables me to get REALLY clean! I&#x27;ve been using them for years and if I&#x27;m traveling, it&#x27;s a minor crisis if I forget to bring it.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these.  I won&#x27;t lie though it does feel like ur scrubbing ur skin with a Brillo pad, but excellent for exfoliation.  I found no problems with it keeping a lather with my body wash.  It&#x27;s long enough so with the right maneuvering u can scrub ur shoulders, back and butt too. I thought considering it came in a pack of three I&#x27;d share them with my family and they love them too. Oh and those of you with sensitive skin,  I myself have very sensitive skin and use this daily and besides looking pinkish when i get out of the shower I&#x27;m fine.  Whats that old saying?  &amp;#34;No pain no gain&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! Its perfect for scrubbing your back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit rough, but that is part of the exfoliating process. You do have to use it outside of the water, since it doesn&#x27;t hold the soap like a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend not using it on your face as it is a bit too rough for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the other reviews and made sure it was from Japan. I am quite satisfied with this product :)</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years. Everyone I have given them to is hooked as well. Great for dry skin. My local Asian store was out of these so got them online. Target has some that I though might be the same, but they are thinner and softer so didn&#x27;t work at all for my skin.</li>
    <li> These are the best things I have ever had the pleasure of cleaning my body with. Just the perfect size. Easy to use on my back. They absorb and lather soap VERY efficiently, you will save money if that is the intent. The texture is just great, not too rough but still has a bite. I can comfortably apply more pressure to exfoliate my skin. Love It!</li>
    <li> Love  these thing. The first time I only bought one. When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t see any of the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; come off but the second time I did and it was a lot. Do I &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; it every time no but that doesn&#x27;t mean its not working. Plus I like these way better than cotton wash cloth I feel way cleaner with these.  I left mine at a friend&#x27;s and now she wants one so I bought the three pack. Never shower without it. Plus you don&#x27;t need a lot of body wash. I know you shouldn&#x27;t use it on your face but I have not a lot and VERY VERY VERY gently. Just what ever product you use, use a NICE amount. * also I checked online to make sure I was getting the real ones...I did!!</li>
    <li> Good Product. Good material.</li>
    <li> Great massages while taking a bath/shower. Get your skin clean, and feeling great. They last about two months before fraying at the edges, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have sensitive skin but this seems too rough.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use them to scrub sinks or shower walls.  :(</li>
    <li> I have been using these since I was a kid.  My weight has fluctuated so much over the course of my life that I should have severe stretch marks, but I don&#x27;t because I use these every time I shower.</li>
    <li> One of the best wash clothes out there. Like most reviewers love how it makes my skin glow, the size of the cloth and I have the real Salux, this company sells the real brand not the knock off. You&#x27;ll have to try it to understand. :)</li>
    <li> As someone else said already, you really don&#x27;t need those top few layers of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are surprisingly rough but you feel silky smooth afterwards. Unlike most exfoliating clothes, the scrub is completely effortless. The material alone provides the exfoliation so you don&#x27;t have to put any work into it which is nice. The cloths themselves were a little bigger than I expected. This isn&#x27;t a washrag size, it&#x27;s more like a hand towel.</li>
    <li> Too harsh.  Not a pleasant way to wash.</li>
    <li> My Mom admired mine and I got her some as gifts. She says she will never buy a pouf again!</li>
    <li> Great price and product. Its a bit rough right out the package so just toss them in the washer and they will be just right. Back scrubbers are useless compared to these you can get every section of your back no problem, for a fraction of the cost, and have 3 of them. Satisfied, I will never buy a wooden brush again.</li>
    <li> This is a game-changing scrub-a-dub. Get the 3-pack and share with family, friends, etc. Pretty much great for everyone...and now you can reach your back without a loofa on a stick!</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s long enough for me scrub my back and the roughness of it is perfect for exfoliating. It&#x27;s sold for almost $5 a piece at my local Asian market.</li>
    <li> I love my Salux bath cloths, so does my husband. We use these instead of regular washcloths and have for years. No other loofah, pouf, or fancy sugar scrub compares to what the Salux can do for my skin.</li>
    <li> The perfect length for washing your back!</li>
    <li> Works great, so glad I ordered these.</li>
    <li> I have used these for a long time and I love them.  They&#x27;re strong, wide, long and do a great job in covering every inch of my body with soap when i&#x27;m showering. This is a great value package because you get three.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love these towel like cloths. it is easy to use to wash your back and has a good texture for exfoliating your skin.  I have used for a number of years and was happy to find this sturdier version.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> These are amazing, they scrub and lather better than a loufah but are more durable.  I&#x27;ve been using the same one for over a month with no sign of wearing out.  My skin feels so much cleaner after using these magic little towels.</li>
    <li> I adore these. I am ridiculously soft, but only if I use them! Pro tip: be sure you&#x27;re moisturizing afterwords. Otherwise, this kind of exfoliation had actually dry you out further.</li>
    <li> I love these.  My Japanese exchange student gave me one a long time ago and now I&#x27;ve found them myself! I give them as gifts.</li>
    <li> On opening the package I was skeptical, the material feels awful to the hand, rather like nylons made with pot scrubber material. However, lathered up with soap it did an outstanding job. The oversized hand towel size was the right volume to fill my hand so my grasping problem was eliminated and the width was suitable for a five-foot-four-inch frame which therefore eliminated my limited motion problem. I also used it immediately after my shower for additional exfoliation when it was magically almost dry. I see no problems sanitizing the cloth as I do with loofas, puffs or exfoliators on sticks. If you can wash without injurying your skin, I recommend this to disabled people.</li>
    <li> Love to use this on my body. I recommend to my friends. Excellent product ordering more as gifts for family</li>
    <li> The product is awesome and the delivery was really fast!</li>
    <li> The first time you use this you will be AMAZED at how soft your skin can be. I use this almost every day. My skin is smooth and soft! After a while they get worn out and you replace them. You can wash them like regular washcloth, and reuse often.</li>
    <li> I started looking into exfoliating cloths/towels when I decided to start using a sunless tanner and needed to do some extreme exfoliating. I ordered this product after reading all of the rave reviews and to be quite honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much from them, but I am amazed! I&#x27;m lucky not to have any acne on my face but I do have quite a bit all over my back. After a couple weeks of usage, my back is looking so much better! I just feel so clean and fresh every single time I use it and I cannot see myself not using one in the future. I&#x27;m only mad that I&#x27;m just now discovering them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, they do take some getting used to and may feel a bit rough at first, but believe me, your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> I received 3 authentic Salux bath sheets (wash cloth just doesn&#x27;t sound right). The package says made in Japan and the tag on the cloth says made in japan. I love these thing! They take a little soap a long LONG way and dry very quickly. They can be machine washed but should be hung to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For those who have not heard of these, they are not a terry towel wash cloth. They are very long (in length) exfoliating cloths made from nylon and polyester. They are a lot tougher than the ones you will find at a dollar store/ beauty supply store and last a lot longer. Also they can be very rough when you first use one, in short, it feels like a good back scratching. I don&#x27;t recommend using it on you face or privets as it can be too rough.</li>
    <li> AT the beginning it was rough but after a few uses it was better.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!! My skin has never been this soft before. I have bought these for friends &amp; family after discovering them for myself - everyone loves them!! It&#x27;s a very soft exfoliator that does some serious work in creating baby smooth skin. I tend to have sensitive skin myself &amp; have never had any issues with these. I use just a couple of pumps of my Neutrogena Rainbath body wash &amp; it creates such a rich lather that using the body wash alone could never do. I highly recommend this product to any &amp; everyone.</li>
    <li> Terrific product, washes well in the washing machine. I am going to order more !</li>
    <li> awesome!!! Love it!!! :)</li>
    <li> These things work great. Really easy to make sure you reach your entire back without dislocating a shoulder. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rough surface is ideal for getting dirt and stench off of me-bath time is not play time. The length (3 feet or 36 inches), and the luxurious lathering saves soap and facilitates cleaning the hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> By far the best exfoliating tool to have in my shower. My showers take half the time, and I actually feel cleaner after using a Salux cloth. Try it, it&#x27;s awesome. They last about 6 months, maybe longer, just keep them clean and dry when not in use.</li>
    <li> If you have the urge to slough off dead skin in your usual cleaning routine, this product is the best &#x27;scrubby&#x27; device I&#x27;ve had. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried the mits, and scrunchies and random loofahs, but nothing works quite as well as this product. This will be a product that I plan on giving as a gift from now on.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  I have used this product for at least 15 years  Excellent product, wears easy.  Highly recommend.  Removes dry skin and leaves body smooth.</li>
    <li> They are very exfoliating, and you can get a lot of suds with them. They wash easily in the machine.</li>
    <li> Purchased these as replacements for another brand that I had been using for years. Wow! They are very scratchy. If you can get through the first few uses then you will actually begin to like them. You definitely get exfoliated and feel refreshed after your shower. Would not recommend for anyone with tender or sensitive skin. Also they are very large compared to the typical store bought ones.</li>
    <li> These are the best wash cloths that I have ever used!  They  smooth my rough elbows and knees.  They remove dead skin and make my skin as soft as butter.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever return to cotton washcloths.  They also  scrub my skin better than body brushes that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  This is just a wonderful product that I never want to be without.</li>
    <li> I love how big these are, you can scrub your own back! I have dry, itchy skin and this cloth just absolutely kicks flakies to the curb.</li>
    <li> Whats all the hype about? Its no different than any other exfoliator i&#x27;ve tried.  The reviews sold me the product... Nice job&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it, I though, experienced no Magic</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in stores in the US. Product performs as expected. I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Package contains three skin cloths as described.  However, they all smelled very bad regardless how thoroughly and repeatedly I washed them.  The bottom line - You get what you paid for;  I paid $2.90 including shipping for three pieces and thus I have no regret.  Therefore, I gave it 2 stars as the items were delivered promptly about 2 weeks by seller from oversea (China).  These are not genuine Salux beauty skin cloth since I have been using true genuine Salux skin cloth #100 (60% nylon &amp; 40% polyester) for a long time and I purchased them from local reputable Asian market.  Items I received are 100% nylon and also picture of lady on package is different than what shown online and/or genuine Salux package.  I don&#x27;t mind they are not genuine Salux but I just cannot stand the bad odor (Note: some other reviews have mentioned this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like to know what counterfeit Salux is, the following website has detailed info.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated - Upgraded from 2 to 3 stars based on the strong odor is fading after several days of use.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across the reviews for these and was intrigued by how many people loved them. I figured they were inexpensive, so I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. My skin from head-to-toe is pretty much a mess. Cystic acne on my face cheeks and occasionally jawline. Bacne always! Ingrown hairs on my legs. I decided to try these with Dr. Woods Black Soap as my body wash. I&#x27;m dead serious when I say the improvements to my skin were almost instaneous. Within a week my bacne (back acne) was gone, kaput, never to return. I want you to read that sentence over and over, so you can really understand the impact this has made in my life, You see, I can&#x27;t recall a time in my life since puberty where my back didn&#x27;t feel completely bumpy, from shoulders to rump. Now I rub my own shoulders and back several times a day because I still can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin is. And my legs shine! Again, this is a new concept for me. My husband and I always say our youngest child could win for world&#x27;s softest baby skin, but I&#x27;m seriously in the running for that title now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these! Now!</li>
    <li> These japanese wash cloths are great to smooth out rough skin and feels great!  Try em you&#x27;ll like em!  :-)</li>
    <li> I always feel clean after showering with these.  All the other scrubbies that I have purchased everywhere else suck; these are nice.</li>
    <li> These wash cloths are wonderful.  You feel so clean after using one.  Everything squeaks and all the dead skin is down the drain.  I highly recommend.  (I give these as *small* gifts to people I really care about.)</li>
    <li> These are the best washing cloth I ever used.  I will buy thee again.  They last for more than one year.</li>
    <li> Exfoliating cloths, go right to the limit of what I can stand, but feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I don&#x27;t wish to be required to write more than a few words, as a vendor could you share that with Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy</li>
    <li> Well-made product but takes awhile to get soft enough to use regularly. At first use every other day and eventually can use all the time. Although I heard exfoliating every day is not really good for skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product from this manufacturer! It lasts forever! It&#x27;s super thick and creates lots of soap action! Awesome exfoliating experience! Mrs.Z</li>
    <li> Exfoliates skin, Make great suds. Rinses clean. Can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. Feel so refreshed and clean. Makes a wonderful gift with nice soap. They will love it! It won a great invention award in Japan and I can see why. Have tried knock offs when Asian store was out of stock. Not the same. Honestly, you won&#x27;t want to shower or bathe without it!</li>
    <li> Among all the nylon wash clothes there is only one Salux. It is made in Japan. Don&#x27;t waste money on cheaper Chinese knock offs. They look the same but they don&#x27;t work the same. Only Salux is rough and stays rough time after time, giving you this clean feeling.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live with out them, they clean you so good an it relaxes you so much.</li>
    <li> Years ago I got a similar product from qvc. It was thinner, but with the same texture -- just not as rough. I mistakenly thought this was the same thing. If you have sensitive skin, this is not a good idea.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!! Removes all dead skin off. I suggest using with a mild soap as this can irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> Holy moly. Want to wash off dead skin? This will work! I am a repeat customer of this product and will always have a few of these in the house. I like it!</li>
    <li> Have you been dropping money for years on those little puff balls? You know the ones that fall apart and untangle after maybe a week. Get this instead. I have been using this over a year and it&#x27;s been amazing. I haven&#x27;t measured it but I believe it&#x27;s about 36x12 or so. How I use it is I grab it and kind of wad it up in my hands holding it under water. Squeeze it a few good times to get the water going through really good. I actually use a bar soap which I just rub all over it while it&#x27;s still balled up in my hand. I will then just squeeze while turning until the soap just starts literally foaming out. And wash as normal. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that rough, but it does exfoliate very well. Using this on your back is what really sold me. It&#x27;s pretty big, so you can just hold it like a towel and shimmy yourself clean. I have traveled with this several times. It dries really fast. I will just shake the heck out of it and kind of whip the thing around a few times and fold it into a ziploc baggie. Just remember it is pretty big, so hand an idea where you want to hang this after your shower. A big towel rack will do fine for 2 of them side by side. If you take good care if it this can probably last a really long time. I&#x27;ve never machine washed mine only hand washed it. But I think you can put it in the washer. I just didn&#x27;t want it to get beat up. After a year of use it still looks pretty much exactly the same. I had to cut maybe 2 frayed strands and comparing it to a new one it&#x27;s lighter in color. I didn&#x27;t think it would last me as long as it did and I bought a 6 pack. I wound up giving some away to friends.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years. They last and rinse clean and leave you skin smooth and really feel clean after a hard days work.</li>
    <li> These are the best - I keep plenty on hand because I tend to give them to friends and family so they can see for themselves why I like these so much.</li>
    <li> This wash netting is the best for your skin takes off all the rough spots and it is not too rough just right and big enough to wash your back with no effort.  Both my husband and I use it.</li>
    <li> I tend to lose these things a lot so I don&#x27;t pay a lot for them.  These are nice and rough enough to do a good job exfoliating.  They&#x27;re a good size so you can scrub your back with them too.  I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These are the best scrub towels EVER!! You feel 7.34 years younger just using it for one shower. After two you are practically 10 years younger!....but seriously, these are a great product. They shipped out quickly and were delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never felt this clean!</li>
    <li> the real thing. works so great. I use it everytime.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the washcloths.  I was replacing an old one for myself and gave one as a gift.  The product was exactly as advertised and was delivered one day earlier than expected.  I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This cloth leaves my skin soft and clean. It&#x27;s a great back scrubber, much better than a loofa. I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The best body scrubber I have ever used and it lasts FOREVER!  I used to buy these at longs when I lived in Hawaii, so happy they are accessible on amazon</li>
    <li> These are great for removing &amp;#34;barnacles&amp;#34; from my back.  They are long enough to grab both ends and pull across your back.  My husband noticed the results immediately.  It is a little uncomfortable at first but you get great results quickly.  I use it with the soap on my chest, legs, and back. I apply the lotion only in the reas that I can reach.  Not sure that you need the lotion.  I keep a second one just for my face.  On the face I am very gentle...takes the place of expensive microdermabrasion products.</li>
    <li> Two days after I placed the order, my Salux arrived!  How is it I have just learned of these?!  I will never go without one again.  I was able to scrub my entire back and later in the day my boyfriend commented how nice my back felt.  I have battled back acne for years and feel my new salux is the solution.  I purchased a pack of 3 - one for my boyfriend and the other two for home and work.  I will probably buy another for my mother and am thinking of cutting one up into smaller pieces for face, elbows, etc.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could say these are too rough - you decide how much scrubbing you do and how harshly you scrub.  Given the feel of the material, I believe these will last a long time and they are huge.  Excellent product, excellent price, excellent seller!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE THINSG---SHOULD HAVE BEEN USING THEM BEFORE.  THANKS AGAIN AMAZON.</li>
    <li> These are honestly life changing. Just click the button, but it now and you&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I am so clean. If you like an abrasive scrub like I do, buy these. They dry quickly. Once in a awhile I soak them in very hot water to keep them bacteria free. Good product.</li>
    <li> Love these clothes. Best exfoliating cloth out there. Durable, fun colors and great quality, no fraying.</li>
    <li> Love these for the shower.  Able to get my back with no problem.  Leaves skin feeling so good.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Just sad that I did not know of this product much earlier. Much better than a wash rag, or wash towel, much more durable, and because of its texture it does help to get rid of dead skin, that appears are always present, in less or greater quantities. Dries fairly soon, and because of its tiny pores and antibacterial capabilities, it barely hold on to odors as long as it is properly washed and rinsed before hanging. Nice invention, pretty darn smart, if you ask me. Long enough for a person to do their own back, and works like one with liquid soap creating plenty of clean foam. 4 Stars for this japanese product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like the real Salux scrubbers</li>
    <li> These are sooo much better than those mesh scubbies. I wish I knew about these sooner. I have only started using these for a couple weeks now but even after the first use I felt so clean. I</li>
    <li> Love these, if your wanting a deep clean pick you up a pack of these, wife and I both use everyday, I bought these to attempt to cut down on ingrown hairs as I man scape----- it works , I have had much fewer ingrown hairs since switching to this product. you can really deep clean. If you having issues with ingrown then try this as it cleans away the dead skin cells that cover the follicle.</li>
    <li> they work very good on the skin...</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s self seems to be of quality construction. They are just too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I found these.  Can&#x27;t live without one, used one for years till I lost it.  Started using them after daughter brought them back from Japan, M y friends benefit from receiving the other two, now they order them for friends and families.</li>
    <li> I inadvertently stumbled upon these while browsing Amazons beauty section.  Seriously, I&#x27;ve never ever heard of these Japanese bath towels.  Anywho, I read the reviews and decided to purchase them and OH WOW...I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!  After my first use, scrubbing away in the shower and rinsing off....my skin feels...oh gosh...it feels ah-freaking-mazing!  I mean it, it feels better than touchably soft.  Outstanding 5 star product...so happy I stumbled :)</li>
    <li> I love Japanese wash cloths.  They make your skin smooth and silky and they last forever.  They dry quickly and I use them for gifts as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered Salux without realizing that my skin is already pretty soft and doesn&#x27;t need to be exfoliated as often as I thought.  However, I use Salux on my face and body once a week and I do notice a small difference.  Even my boyfriend noticed!</li>
    <li> Received one of these years ago and needed to replace it - These are great shower clothes that make washing your back easy and they dry fast</li>
    <li> I gave up wearing blouses that reveal my arms and/or back because I was so self conscious of my of acne scars, Years later I discovered this GEM! Now my scars are minimal to none and I wear whatever kind of top I want without the least bit of self consciousness. The more I use it, the better my skin looks. I found it on Amazon this past spring and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
    <li> I like these but LOVE Cure Series Japanese Exfoliating Bath Towel From OHE - Super Hard Weave. It is larger and wider and longer and a nice HARD weave. It exfoliates better.</li>
    <li> Rough like desired even when wet, 11 by 36,&amp;#34; shorter than some others previously purchased (?brand),, hemmed on short ends, pink, blue &amp; yellow all look &amp; feel the same degree of roughness, 60/40 nylon/polyester, made in Japan</li>
    <li> It makes mass quanities of suds and is just the right amount of rough to make you feel really clean! Bought extras for gifts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fully grown man (LOL) and I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this product is so amazing! I have sensitive skin and have used just about every kind of bath product out there and this Salux cloth knocks all of them out of the box. I&#x27;ve also tried some similar nylon washcloths that are thinner, lighter, and less coarse which are decent, but did not really compare to this Salux cloth. The Salux really invigorates your skin, gives your circulation a boost, and leaves you with silky smooth clean skin all over your body. I like the heavier weight and coarse design which easily wraps around your back and is better than any back scrubber I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s seriously like having a massage in the shower and it just feels great. When I travel and use other wash clothes, I just don&#x27;t feel totally clean until I get back home and can use the Salux cloth again. It leaves you feeling totally clean, smooth, and invigorated for hours after using it. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Oh my god these are the best things ever. They are the best for exfoliating.. I cant tell you how much my skin has improved by using these.</li>
    <li> These is better than any one, try it you will love it</li>
    <li> I have given these as gifts as well as use them myself. Just as described and gives your back a good scrub.</li>
    <li> As a man who never much cared for &amp;#34;bath products&amp;#34; I was not excited when I got this as a gift from my daughter. Well I tried it because she said I would love it, wow she was right. It feels great. Who knew?</li>
    <li> I love these towels, I feel cleaner using them than normal towels and they only need a little soap.&lt;br /&gt;They are also amazing to use to clean with, absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> Works great! I use it every night, it helps a little body wash go a long way and really gets the days grime off you.</li>
    <li> So glad I took a chance and got these. These are the only kind of body scrubber/wash cloth we have used for years. Moving from Hawaii to a small town in Oregon we couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere but ours were several years old and ready to be replaced. The quality is great and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I love these! I gave one to my daughter and she loves it! These are the best!!! This is one product that&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel awesome!  Can not live without!</li>
    <li> I gave these as gifts after trying one myself. I love them. Everyone who received one just stared at me like I was a nut. We&#x27;ll see if they use them and &amp;#34;get it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is they are great exfoliaters of the skin. Soap spreads through them quickly. You get a cloth full of soap in no time at all. You would think they would use more soap since they exfoliate the soap as well, but soap seems to last longer with these things. They work great in a large shower. All the people I gave them to have small showers so they are probably going to wonder why I gave them wash clothes that are too big for their showers (another strike against me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like using these things. They work great. I have extra ones and I am trying to get my wife to use them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus tip: I clean the nether regions using the end with the tag on it. That way I can know which side parts are forbidden to touch the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They dry super fast. Like in less than an hour so they would be great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years but can&#x27;t run to the store and grab one right now. Tada, found them on Amazon and handed out two of them. They have two new fans. They scrub some of that dry flaky, dusty stuff off your skin without being too rough. Works better than a shower puff.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They do such a great job of scrubbing my skin.  I had my mom cut them into wash cloth size so they&#x27;d last longer.  They are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> these are my go to wash cloths</li>
    <li> These are my favorite wash cloths.  They have changed over the time; 15 yrs ago they were harsher on the skin, really rubbing the dead skin off and then some (the way I like).  It seems there are more soft fibers weaved in which makes them more popular with average users and not as study in construction, but still very effective at exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I received my Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath wash cloth/towel 2 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 2 times and love it. It uses such little soap to lather up and is&lt;br /&gt;a generous size to use on your back. Skin is sooooo soft afterwards. I highly re-&lt;br /&gt;commend the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash cloth for years.  I&#x27;ve always had to ask someone to send it to me from home.  thank you Amazon for carrying this product.  My skin is so soft, best part, I have several of the guys that I work with wanting to use it too.  Once you start using this wash cloth, you won&#x27;t be able to use anything else, nothing will make you feel clean enough.</li>
    <li> Best wash towel I ever used! I stumbled upon it by accident, I was looking for another product and read a review about this. Try it ,you&#x27;ll LOVE it...</li>
    <li> very rough-but works to remove rough skin</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  It works just as I expected it.  It doesn&#x27;t stink at all like some complained.  I&#x27;ve used it for a while.  It rinses well.  It stays clean.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It works beautifully well, they are not kidding about the blood circulation thing, you feel 10 times better after using this cloth , what other loofahs get in 30 mins this one can get it in 10 mins , it really does exfoliate leaves no dirt behind. Not to mention the feel and glow of the skin after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;THIS is  absolutely  a great product</li>
    <li> I started using these while living in Asia and I think everyone needs to discover these. So much better than a loofah puff. Slightly abrasive and big enough to wrap around yourself making it easy to wash your back</li>
    <li> These are great bath products. I gave one to everyone I knew for christmas. helps you get to all the spots in the shower effortlessly. Gently exfoliates and gets a great lather on whatever cleanser you are using. I use this daily. Excellent for cleaning the feet without having to sit down or bend over.</li>
    <li> These bath clothes are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. They exfoliate better than anything else and they&#x27;re long so you can do your back. Invigorating.</li>
    <li> The best, makes your skin feel so good after using.</li>
    <li> Its coarse. Its rough. Its exactly what you need in your battle of life. Long enough to grab both ends and get those hard to reach places. Amazing feeling of clean.</li>
    <li> These cloths do a great job of exfoliating and cleaning your skin.  They are generously sized and when fully unfolded are great for scrubbing your back. Leaves your skin amazingly smooth.</li>
    <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH THIS REVIEW)!&lt;br /&gt;If you DO receive a look-alike from an unscrupulous merchant and the package says &amp;#34;Made In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, &amp;#34;spent&amp;#34; cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It usually fully-dries in less then a couple of hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT!! (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
    <li> The best bath scrubbers anywhere. These are the real ones. I&#x27;m not fond of the colors but they work and me and the kids know whose is whose.</li>
    <li> For me this product works very well, the fabric is l little rough when cleaning my face but all in all I like this towel cloth.</li>
    <li> Love the cloths.  Awesome to get 3 in a bundle.  Will definitely buy more works so much better than wash cloths or other comparable items.  So happy to find online!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin didn&#x27;t need exfoliation, if I am using them right, or if the reviews are just BS...I do not notice my skin exfoliating. My skin is soft, naturally so maybe I will never get those results. One positive is they do dry quickly and feel cleaner than regular facecloths. I like the ability to use them on my back as well.</li>
    <li> These work incredibly well, I&#x27;ve been using the same one for two months now. The length allows you to scrub your back with relative ease.&lt;br /&gt;They lather incredibly well and DO NOT leave an odor unlike sponges!!! I recommend to use a soap that laters very well with this</li>
    <li> Growing up in an Asian household, these were the only type of wash cloths and loofahs I&#x27;ve ever known. They come in different degrees of exfoliation and I prefer the strongest. Although it can feel rough at first, it exfoliates your skin and does a great job getting off any dead skin, dirt, and even tougher messes like paint. It lathers soap very well, both bar and body washes. The length is great for washing your back, unlike standard loofahs. The material is also quick to dry, much faster than any loofah I&#x27;ve used, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about moisture issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My non-Asian boyfriend is a handyman so he&#x27;s always covered in paint, dirt, sawdust, you name it. His loofah could never get any of that stuff off so I bought him one of these Japanese wash cloths and his initial reaction was that it felt too rough but it did an amazing job getting the mess off. After about 4 uses, he became comfortable with the roughness and found the wash cloth soothing AND his skin is visibly nicer!!! We threw away his loofahs and replaced it with these awesome wash cloths.</li>
    <li> Just a great way to clean that skin clean. I usually have back acne and this has helped my skin a lot. Also doesn&#x27;t get dirty and really gets those soaps sudsy.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest washcloths EVER. Just the right amount of &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; - they exfoliate well, and feel GREAT on my back</li>
    <li> Best wash cloth ever! I bought them for all my family members and they are very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are very high-quality wash towels.  My bf and I use them and we love them.  They are washable so we re-use them and they clean very well.  I would highly recommend these for anyone that wants that extra clean feeling.  Scrubs well, I use it with my regular Dove liquid soap wash and it cleanses well.  I feel extra clean after my showers now, and can scrub my back as well.  I cannot praise these enough, they really are a must have and do a good job.</li>
    <li> I loooooove the feeling of clean smooth skin. This product exceeded my expectations and I like the fact that you just need to rinse when done and hang to dry! Will certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> This is one of many others I have ordered in the past. My family uses this and I renew them every couple of months. A great exfoliator. I only could find this in Hawaii, now I don&#x27;t have to travel so far. ;)</li>
    <li> I have my silky skin back, thank you Salux and thank you Mighty Gadgets storefront.  This cloth really gets the job done and dries fast.  Guess what? It is also excellent to use as a back scratcher! No more 1 inch wide back scratcher, trying to get the &#x27;job&#x27; done!  I did have a problem with my order not showing up, however.  I contacted the storefront and was met with the fastest response.  Mighty Gadgets went up and beyond the call of duty to make this customer happy.  They were delightful to deal with and I would not hesitate to do business with them, again.  Thank you Mighty Gadgets for making me one happy lady. Your generosity is deeply appreciated!</li>
    <li> I JUST ORDERED ANOTHER SET, I GAVE 1 TO EACH OF MY SONS AND HAVE 1 FOR MYSELF.  BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE MORE JUST IN CASE LOL.  I WILL ORDER ANOTHER NEXT MONTH, I WANT TO HAVE A DOZEN.  I CAN ALSO MAKE A GIFT BASKET AND ADD 1 INTO IT.  I LOVE IT, I FEEL SO CLEAN WHEN I GET OUT OF THE SHOWER, I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS SINCE I WAS VERY YOUNG.  I AM FROM THE ISLAND OF GUAM AND NOW LIVE IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, AND FINDING THIS IN AMAZON.COM WAS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Received order promptly cloths were brand new in package and actually made where they said they were in Japan.This particular brand name was well made just the right size and width good strong material and just the right amount of coarness body felt really clean</li>
    <li> I got mine and unlike some reviewers mine didn&#x27;t smell or say made in China so I&#x27;m happy with my product.</li>
    <li> There are three \\&quot;towels\\&quot; in the package, as shown in the picture. A couple of things to note: (1) It&#x27;s a long, flat loofah. 11 x 35 inches. To put that into perspective, imagine a long winter scarf, but in loofah-style material. (2) It&#x27;s not a towel and has no drying properties. (3) All three items in the package have the same degree of coarseness (the different colors are not an indication of varying coarseness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, especially for hard-to-reach areas on the back. It&#x27;s more coarse than the loofah poufs that are commonly sold in drugstores, but not so coarse that it&#x27;s uncomfortable. You can vary the sensation of coarseness by varying the pressure used when washing. It holds suds very well while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: It has an awful chemical smell and no amount of use has made the smell go away (washing it in the washer didn&#x27;t help, either). It&#x27;s impractical to store. With loofah poufs, you can hang them on a hook or rest them on the edge of the tub or counter. Not so with these. They have to be draped over a towel rack or shower rod/door. And they&#x27;re not particularly attractive so I fold and put mine away once it has dried...which limits its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I really like it and if it weren&#x27;t for the chemical smell, it would get four stars.</li>
    <li> I came across these while searching for a replacement loofah and based on the reviews I decided to give them a try.  I must say they really are fantastic. They do a great job scrubbing my skin, I&#x27;ve never felt cleaner after taking a shower. I also like that they are long enough to easily scrub my back. I&#x27;m totally sold on these towels.</li>
    <li> Love these! For years I was buying a different brand which was much more expensive. This pack of 3 is very economical and a great value. The size is perfect because it allows you to get your back very easily. It&#x27;s a bit rough at first, but I feel like it&#x27;s working better than my other brand. My husband and daughter use these too and really like them. Easy to clean and hang to dry between use.</li>
    <li> Love these - my family and I have been using for over 20 years.  Be sure to order the ones that are 50% polyester/50% cotton if you like the &#x27;luffa&#x27; like feel - and they last much longer - and, stay cleaner.</li>
    <li> These are rather lovely. Wonderfully exfoliating, long enough to scrub your back, rinses out easily. The only drawback, very minor, is that I noticed that they shed with use. I discovered little blue bits in my drain</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it is great at exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Top notch, make sure you get the ones made in Japan as the Chinese ones are a very poor imitation. I have given several of these as gifts and my friends are still thanking me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Works very well my skin is way better now. It gets rid of dirt and dead skin and you feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; afterwards. It takes getting use to but once your used to it feels great after every use. Do yourself a favor get this. It&#x27;s more hygienic than a sponge more effective than a wash cloth and if you don&#x27;t use any of these you&#x27;ve never been cleaner in you life! It also exfoliate like no other, I notice more tiny hair folical and less bumpy skin after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! I never take a shower without them. They are a staple in my beauty routine. Makes your skin super soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been exclusively using this brand of loofa towel since summer of 2012. I was given one as a present and it changed my shower experience forever. I&#x27;ve tried similar loofa towels but this one just takes the cake. Yes, it&#x27;s a little more expensive than the others but they last a long time and the others don&#x27;t even compare in feel. I always loose them before they wear out, but the longest I&#x27;ve held onto one was a little over a year. It was still in useable shape when I left it in a hotel. Love this thing</li>
    <li> my son loves using these.</li>
    <li> Amazing. This is exactly what I was looking for. Provides the best exfoliation and makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve never felt my skin as smooth as it is now. Do not hesitate to buy! Applying lotion post shower was much easier and didn&#x27;t leave my skin as sticky. It seems lotion can penetrate the skin better after using this product.</li>
    <li> This  is a fantastic product for keeping the skin clean. Take it with me on road and always feel clean and refreshed after using in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love these clothes because I feel clean and can scrub without being left raw. At the same time, they are not too soft. Perfect for feeling exfoliated. Also, they work up a nice bubbly lather w/any soap. What good is a soapy bath w/o some bubbly fun?</li>
    <li> love these  they are big enough to hold and scrub your back with.  just a little bit of scrubbie to them and they are gentle but great to use....wish there were more colors , rather than pastels.</li>
    <li> Unravel it, each end in each hand, and start scrubbing the back side... HHHNNNNNnnnnnnnnnggggggg!!!!!  So great!</li>
    <li> These things are AMAZING. i will never use anything else. It really lathers and exfoliates without irritating you. This is the second time i purchase. Great buy. You wont be dissapointed</li>
    <li> Excellent item, myself and family utilizes these Japanese wash cloths for many years. We love these items, which is much better than a regular wash cloth. Would purchase again in the future. Aloha from Hawaii!!!</li>
    <li> These things are great for mites which you can pick up in public places. They unfold to get your back but the best ones can be bought in department stores in Japan. There they are more abrasive and come in stripes. I also used these towels to scrub on permethrin 10% shampoo after showering. Soaking clothes under water overnight also works wonders.Spread the word.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Great product!</li>
    <li> These are great. My body skin is in the best shape it has ever been. You can&#x27;t be a wimp - they feel very different when you first use them, but the reward is the best skin of your life!</li>
    <li> The quality itself is as it should be (nice and rough/exfoliating), and I do like the colors. My main issue is with the fact that this isn&#x27;t nearly as long as the same type of wash cloths sold at a nearby Japanese dollar store here. I was expecting the same length and these are a good 1/4 of the length shorter. Still possible to reach your back and all, but just a bit less comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I got 3 for 11 dollars which for me was great. However, I also found the same ones at the dollar store… so I could&#x27;ve spent 3 dollars. But that&#x27;s my own ignorance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, you control how hard you press on your skin using these. It&#x27;s easy to get anywhere on your entire body which is fantastic. I don&#x27;t see how you could use these incorrectly in any way other than scrubbing too hard. Otherwise, awesome product.</li>
    <li> The best scrubber ever my ex introduced me to them and when we split she kept ours so I was searching all over the place on where to get it and I had finally found it it&#x27;s really great that it comes in a pack if three, that way you can share it with the family</li>
    <li> Even my 85 year old mom loves this cloth! It is not so abrasive as to hurt your skin,yet it removes all the old, dulling, skin cells. It leaves nothing behind! It will make your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s skin!  And it rinses clean in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have not used the products I ordered yet,  I have been using a similar product I purchased in Japan, I purchased this product as back up so I would not have to wait when my present bath towel is no longer serviceable to me.</li>
    <li> At first I thought these were too abrasive, much rougher than a loofah, but after a few uses I was hooked. They leave your skin feeling soft and refreshed and as the package shows make it easy to clean your back and other hard to reach places. I haven&#x27;t felt this clean in a long time, and the Japanese build quality inspires confident bathing for a long time. These also won&#x27;t fall apart like a regular loofah.</li>
    <li> In a word, awful.  Hard and scratchy.  Find a plan B</li>
    <li> These make me feel baby soft and clean.</li>
    <li> If you grew up in Hawaii, this is probably the one you used growing up. And it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Netter than any Loofah! you can buy in the store and honestly to me it feels like it suds up better too!</li>
    <li> Grew up using these and still use them to this day. I&#x27;ve tried other brands from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and other retailers and nothing compares to the original Salux brand.</li>
    <li> These make your skin so soft. I have sensitive skin so I only use it 2-3 times a week, but the exfoliating is wonderful.  Its really long so that your able to wash your back etc. but I found the length to be cumbersome. I ended up cutting it into smaller wash cloth sizes so it stores better in my shower.  No need for body scrubs when you have one of these!</li>
    <li> Wish you could leave 0 stars. These are disgusting. Yes, it says towel and I was looking for wash cloth. They weren&#x27;t kidding. It&#x27;s a towel. Who needs a towel made out of nylon? They stink so bad. I couldn&#x27;t even take it out of the package. They use such harsh chemicals on it. I should have known if it was coming from the Orient. The company Cloud 9 takes forever to email you back, when you want to return. Their email states to wrap carefully and they won&#x27;t refund damaged goods, blah, blah. I think we know that. I get it but most companies accept that as a given and tend not to ram it down your throat. They could not have paid me to use this product. Stay away from orders coming from the far east.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this Japanese bath cloth then your skin is missing out.  My skin has never felt so clean and refreshed.  I bought the 3 pack, because I&#x27;ll never buy a loofa again!</li>
    <li> Great exfoliator -- for body dirt it&#x27;s a terminator, removes dead skin and grease with ease until squeaky clean (something that most products fail to bring).</li>
    <li> love the way these make my skin feel after a shower. really great for reaching those sometimes itchy spot in the middle of your back. Durable and washable pluses all around</li>
    <li> I love this thing. At first i was a little dubious, but this makes be feel cleaner than ever! Will Buy again for sure</li>
    <li> These are the best wash rags. At first, they feel a bit abrasive if you have never used one of these before. However, after a few days of use it feels great. Nothing leaves you feeling clean like one of these. I usually replace mine after about a year of use. Make sure you get this brand. There are a lot of knock offs.</li>
    <li> These are the best scrubbing wash clothes. I&#x27;ve given them out to friends to try and have stocked up on them, in case I can&#x27;t find them in the future. Especially good to know they don&#x27;t hurt the environment, like the plastic &amp;#34;micobeads&amp;#34; in scrubbing soaps are doing (and eventually, they will all have to be made illegal). Besides, those plastic microbeads are NOTHING compared to how well these wash clothes work. I LOVE that they are so long. Great way to get a really good back scrub because, even folded in half, I can pull it around my back and saw away.</li>
    <li> Able to back scrub easily.  Helps to exfoliate.  Leaves a person feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> Love this! This makes my skin really soft and gives it a nice smooth, silky feeling when I step out of the shower. The texture feels nice on the skin and exfoliates well. I have no longer have issues with ingrown hair on my legs after hair removal also.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Showed up and as described. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not the fakes you see other places selling.</li>
    <li> I spent 14 years in Japan and was very happy to discover these.  These seem a little courser than I was used to, but still highly recommend.  5-Stars for my taste!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Best &amp;#34;scrubbie&amp;#34; thing ever!&lt;br /&gt;I cut one up so I&#x27;d have a couple facial size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d order again...for me and for gifts..</li>
    <li> Seller sent what I ordered in a timely manner.  I love these wash cloths, I have been using them for years. They make great gifts too,</li>
    <li> Best wash cloth I have used!  Wash &amp; exfoliate with it, and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> They do the job and make your skin feel cleaner and softer.</li>
    <li> These cloths really get your circulation going.  They are &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;.. but didn&#x27;t scratch me and they are great for getting rid of dry, dead skin all over your body.  the cloths were large and seem durable and well made.  they are a good value too.</li>
    <li> This is the best bathing tool ever. It reaches the right parts, it has the right texture. I am extremely satisfied. I will order more to give as presents for my family.</li>
    <li> These were just what I was looking for.  Nice exfoliation with the cloth. Nice size. Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine ordered these and gave me one to try out - and I&#x27;m thankful that she did. These cloths are fantastic! I will admit it was a bit too rough at the first try-but it&#x27;s worth it. It leaves your skin feeling exquisitely smooth - as if you just applied body lotion.  Yeah, that smooth. Also, lathers quite well with small amount of body wash applied. Great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I cleaned my body before I started using these. Now i don&#x27;t feel clean unless I use this. Its just abrasive enough to exfoliate and make my skin smooth. Good bye bacne cause these make washing your back easy. Its good to travel with too because it dries really fast.</li>
    <li> I can scrub my skin, my skin feels better, the clothes are awesome!</li>
    <li> I first encountered this product in Taipei, and was disturbed when I was not able to find it in the states. Now, finally, we are able to get it. Highly recommended – it works just as described. It is indispensable Indispensable  for a thorough cleansing!</li>
    <li> Trade in your back brushes and buy these.  I go through all three towels in a week.  If you have long hair, pin it up in the shower or it will get caught when you&#x27;re trying to use these in the shower.  Use it just like you&#x27;re drying off your back.  You put some bodywash on and it really helps.  This is probably the only product that has helped the most in getting rid of the pimples on my back.  The number of small bumps on my back has greatly decreased and the size of the bigger bumps has gone way down.  These towels are very versatile and allow you to get at your back from multiple angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also not just for backs!  If you have any bumps on your arms (like I have, my whole life) this is really great for that, too.  You can use this anywhere on your body.  It&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> A family member got me attached to these over lufas (spelling?).  The one she provided me was too soft and broke apart easily,  this one feels almost like a brillo pad in that it&#x27;ll give a rough scrub.  It&#x27;s also very durable,  my first one lasted what seems like forever.</li>
    <li> The question and answer section for this item said that two of these we&#x27;re medium (200), and one was hard (100).  Not true with the set I received. All three are hard or 100.</li>
    <li> Who would think something so simple could be good--it has scrub power and it makes it easy to reach your back and it dries super fast--I like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since I was a kid.  A shower just isn&#x27;t the same if I don&#x27;t have one...I don&#x27;t feel as clean.  Generally same effects as a loofah but much easier to use and they don&#x27;t ever get smelly!!</li>
    <li> Having always struggled to clean my back, this salux cloth is  wonderful. Does the job very effectively. Lathers extremely well. Very quick to dry besides being light for travel purposes.</li>
    <li> Not the most comfortable of washcloths, but that&#x27;s not the point! It&#x27;s good at exfoliating and washes out well. I feel like each one will last a good long while.</li>
    <li> The beauty shop closed down, and my wash clothes like this were getting old (ca. 10 years they lasted, though). I am so glad I found them here on Amazon. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is by far the very best body scubber for us. My husband and use it each day instead of soft wash clothes that leaves dead skin cells and grease on your body. Keeps your skin looking young and really  feeling clean. Its just like the facial scrubber that exfoliates dead skin cells off the face but this is for the body and you can control the pressure by intense scrubbing or just light pressure. I use it on my face as well along with my facial scrubbers. Once you experience this scrubber&#x27;s cleanliness, you will feel like your body just isn&#x27;t as clean with regular soft wash clothes.</li>
    <li> Arrived early, product is great quality. Great for exfoliating skin. May be a bit long for some; I keep one full length and cut one in half.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this - do your skin a favor and buy one. I have used these for years and when I recently ran out I was in a state of anxiety till my shipment arrived. My skin does not feel clean unless I use this cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Some find them too abrasive but if you can tolerate body scrubs with salt/sugar you can use this cloth.</li>
    <li> Great price for the three.</li>
    <li> This keeps my skin SO soft it is unreal!  You will never want to use a washcloth again!!!!</li>
    <li> Great exfoliator for your body.</li>
    <li> This was a great find.  After you shower with this you feel cleaner and tingly.  I will shower without one in the future.  Saves water.</li>
    <li> These are simple and awesome.  Great to scrub/exfoliate the back and leave it soft and smooth.  Sometimes a little breaking in time is necessary.  Pretty intensely rough right out of the package!</li>
    <li> Heard about these and thought they were great, so I bought them and they are just wonderful. Much better than the typical loofah. Loofahs dont clean like the Salux does. I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using these now for over 6 years, no change in quality at all, just price. As with everything with this lousy economy and high inflation, this is to be expected..... Unfortunately. But the product rocks. Head to toe exfoliation with every shower!</li>
    <li> Used to live in Japan and used these daily to scrub. Best thing ever for full body exfoliation!</li>
    <li> If I could give this product a 10 I would!! I have used these most of my life and I cannot use any other company. If you use this product you will never use a regular washcloth again...it takes some getting to used to.</li>
    <li> You can use these to scour the pots if you ever run out of brillo pads. They are abrasive and I see the difference on my face. Please use gently.</li>
    <li> These are a ton better than your standard bath pouf.  Very exfoliating without being scratchy, plus you can hang them up to dry so they don&#x27;t get moldy and gross. Never going back to poufs.</li>
    <li> Very coarse so its hard on the over all skin.  It might soften as you continually used it but my skin is quite sensitive and I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Fabulous for getting suds and exfoliating my skin.  Easy to scrub your entire back because its long enough to do the reach.  Once you use these you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I read about these cloths on Makeupalley where they are nearly universally praised. After reading the reviews there, I bought one on eBay about a year ago. Before using the Salux cloth, I typically used poofs or one of those scrubby washcloths that are sold at Wal-Mart. Neither can compare to these cloths!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this cloth, it felt a bit harsh because I wasn&#x27;t quite used to it. After the second day, my skin had adjusted and I&#x27;ve since never felt even slightly uncomfortable when using it. It is tough enjoy to really get read of the dead skin on your body without feeling like you&#x27;re washing with a piece of sandpaper. It works beautifully with just about every cleanser or soap you use. Unlike some cloths, you don&#x27;t have to use a huge amount of product to get a good lather. They&#x27;re also long enough to use when washing your back which eliminates the need for a back brush. These cloths also last forever and a day. The one I bought last year was still in good condition but I was forced to buy another one after my cat decided to steal it out of my shower and use it as a toy. You can typically find a pack of three for under $10 on various sites and, if you&#x27;re lucky, you can find them at Japanese stores for $1 or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these cloths are a fantastic find as they are long lasting and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I love these, I use the pink one daily and this is a great bargain. My skin is so much softer now.</li>
    <li> The product arrived before excepted. Glad to find a product that I was introduced by my mom years ago and be able to use it today!</li>
    <li> perfect! i can never go back to normal loofas. this is my forever go to scrubber!!!</li>
    <li> Wish Salux made these great &amp;#34;towels&amp;#34; in &amp;#34;super hard weave&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These wash towels are the best! I am amazed!  It made my face/body feel soft and smooth after the first use. I gave my husband one to try and he is amazed also! I will order more in the future!</li>
    <li> OMG I love these towels! Gave them as gifts and all my friends feel the same!</li>
    <li> Love using these. Publix stopped carrying a version like these and I am so happy to have found them on here.</li>
    <li> its easy to use, and effective. Haven&#x27;t used it more than twice as I got them recently. But this certainly is a cheaper version than going to a spa spending $$</li>
    <li> Awesome flesh tearing abrasion to remove dead skin. Only can use it every other day, or else I just get raw. But it exfoliates like no other loofah can do. Skin is baby soft.</li>
    <li> We had a few of these already. 3 pack is a nice family pack size. Highly recommend these cloths! Having several different colors is nice as well.</li>
    <li> An absolute necessity!! I have had one my entire life. I can not live without. The best skin scrubber in the world. Borderline obsesive I make everyone I know have one in their home and even travel bags (just in case your normal one is wet who wants to pack that an who wants to forget it😀)</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES these things! They&#x27;ll leave your skin red if you&#x27;re not careful! Great for people who didn&#x27;t want that top layer of skin, anyway. In all seriousness, these things are awesome. Definitely no joke. Come out of the shower feeling super-clean!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these</li>
    <li> Great buy. Really exfoliates your skin. Not harsh at all even though it feels like it would be when you take it out of the bag.  Needs very little to get a good lather. Soap rinses out of it really well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!  My skin looks and feels great.  My husband loves them as well.</li>
    <li> My roommate uses these and got me hooked on them. I can&#x27;t use anything else now. I love them. Great for exfoliating, and I feel really clean.</li>
    <li> These were the genuine Salux ones. Have used them for years and will never go to any other cloth. Extremely soft for an exfoliating cloth and with proper body wash, it really helps against bacne.</li>
    <li> I love these. exfoliates very nicely...</li>
    <li> Have you ever found yourself discussing your wash cloth at dinner? Well, you haven&#x27;t tried these yet! The Salux delivers baby soft skin after just one use so I had to tell my gal pals all about it. This is by far the best beauty buy I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Not only does the magic of Salux leave your skin feeling smooth and exfoliated, it saves on body wash, delivering foamy suds for your entire shower head to toe from a quarter size amount of body wash.  No need to buy an exfoliating body wash as the cloth is so effective (besides those plastic beads are terrible for the environment.)  I&#x27;m buying a bunch of these for stocking stuffers. If you aren&#x27;t on my Xmas list, buy yourself one of these babies now.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Good for washing your back, spreading lotion, or just getting that itch where you can not reach. Long, wide netting. I keep one in the shower for washing my back. And one in the bedroom for relieving my itchy back. Use it for &amp;#34;dry brushing&amp;#34; your skin.</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliation!!! it&#x27;s not the softest thing in the world, but that&#x27;s why you would buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;It will keep your skin smooth and soft and even out your skin texture.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Just hop on over to the hardware store and buy some fine grain sandpaper! These &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; cloths will rip your skin if your skin is at all sensitive.  Really, the people who said they have sensitive skin and use this product truly don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  I tired it with tons of soap and it still felt like sandpaper.  I can&#x27;t imagine the damage you could really do to your skin if you are not very careful.</li>
    <li> Excellent for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> They were just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I kept one and gave one to my daughter we both agree these make your skin feel super smooth.</li>
    <li> These things are great for scrubbing yourself. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. Ummm, they don&#x27;t hold water, and therefore don&#x27;t smell funky. Are rough enough to work without stripping your hide.</li>
    <li> Careful, very abrasive. Good product.</li>
    <li> Works great! Follow the directions on the package,  wet it, add soap then squeeze and watch the suds appear. The exfoliation is awesome and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Anyone that has never tried one of these nylon exfoliating cloths is missing out on the smoothest skin EVER.  I shun to shower without one.  Gets all that nasty dead skin OFF - Wonderful feeling</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me some of the little things in life that make me so happy.  These bath scrubbers fall into that category! I ordered three to try then ordered 15 more.  I keep giving them to friends.  Somebody stop me...apparently the good ones are from japan, don&#x27;t buy them if they&#x27;re from china (they probably glow in the dark).  Anyway, this is a very heavy duty scrubber material and so far the one in my shower still looks and feels new, after a month.  The ones I bought at target would last a couple of weeks and were very thin and almost twice the price. These are the greatest. Buy them now in large quantities.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Body wash works great with these, you no longer need a wash cloth, or back scrubber.  We wash ours in the washer with the towels and hang to dry.  Last forever.</li>
    <li> Really invigorating feeling.  Nice product to exfoliate skin.  Dries really quickly.</li>
    <li> Very nice and great for exfoliation  of dry skin.  Priced reasonably, shipped quickly and will last a long time  Thanks</li>
    <li> Perfect, just like the picture</li>
    <li> Nothing exfoliates as well as this! My skin is so smooth.</li>
    <li> I feel so clean afterwards!!!</li>
    <li> You will never go back to anything else.  pretty colors, great size, dries fast, and works just like it says.</li>
    <li> These are rougher than a cob . . . painful to use.  I don&#x27;t recommend these sandpaper sheets to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was a repeat ord. Really like these and they keep my skin in good condition and my dermatologist is pleased.</li>
    <li> I love these body cloths. Scrubby material of some kind, they dry fast, and gently scrub away any ruff skin. My skin is soft and smooth after using. It seems to absorb lotion better, I also use one on my face, I like it better than my Clarisonic. This is a must have if you self tan. Scrub your body, especially knees, ankles and elbows! It gives a smooth even self tan application. These also last a very long time. I have used one for about a year, then I recycle it into a scrub cloth for cleaning the shower etc....&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat these!</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them for dry brushing purposes- I&#x27;ve been dry brushing to help with both circulation (I have cellulite, and since I started dry brushing last year I noticed a *slight* improvement, which is better than nothing) and the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms. I love dry brushing, it feels great, but there were quite a few days when I missed it and would get in the shower to use a soft washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now these babies...on the days when I don&#x27;t dry brush before taking a shower, I use these intensively in the areas I would while dry brushing. My kp is gone from my arms (and butt!) and I have smooth skin. Before these I had dry, sensitive skin and now my arms still feel smooth even when I don&#x27;t moisturize. I was worried about using this on sensitive areas like my neck and chest, but I just use a lighter hand in those areas and still get great results (never tried it on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with kp, I&#x27;m throwing out another product recommendation: Mario Badescu AHA Botanical Body Wash. Using that, with these towels, has rid me of kp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, these were essential to help me with a botched (user-error) self-tan job. I&#x27;ll be buying these as long as they&#x27;ll manufacture them!</li>
    <li> Long lasting, awesome length, washable, nice gritty texture for maximum elimination of dead skin over body. Feels amazing and lathers with soap beautifully.  These in my opinion are the best on the market--all others pale by comparison.</li>
    <li> It is a little crude.</li>
    <li> You will realize that you have never been clean before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the real Salux brand that are rough.  These are not the imitation, fall apart easily, relatively soft cloths.</li>
    <li> The real deal. Authentic Japanese product. I&#x27;m never going back to wash rags again. You feel so much cleaner after using these. It does take some getting used to because of the texture but in about a week it felt quite comfortable. I was looking for something to use with my shower gels other than the pouf because i could never get a good grip on those things....well this is what I&#x27;ve been needing all along. I&#x27;m not sure how long you&#x27;re supposed to use the Salux but I plan to use a new one every 30 days or so.</li>
    <li> Love these! Exfoliating and exhilarating. Say good bye to the dry itchy winter skin. I will say that not everyone will appreciate the texture but I find it just right.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I love my salux towel! My skin is so ridiculously smooth! Every time I shower I wet the cloth, rub some soap bar on it, turn off the water, and scrub my whole body, including face and neck, with my salux. I wash it off and feel my skin much smoother.</li>
    <li> Started using this these washcloths as a teenager, buying them in Hawaii at a Japanese department store.  It wasn&#x27;t until recently that I&#x27;ve been able to find these washcloths here on the mainland.  Although similar washcloths are now commercially available, these are still the best--they last a long time, and the texture does not &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Im not japanese yet it felt like it did better a job than other products</li>
    <li> I really had low expectations for this product but OMG - GAME CHANGER FOR SKIN CARE! I can&#x27;t believe how useless loofas seem now. At first I thought it was too long, but after a few washes, I realized how rarely I was actually washing my whole back. The texture of this cloth is pretty rough if you aren&#x27;t use to exfoliants, but it really does change the terrain of your skin to be much softer. I even dared to use it on my face. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it felt. It made me realize how much dead skin I&#x27;ve been uselessly hanging on to. I&#x27;m a HUGE fan and am so grateful it&#x27;s sold as a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  I&#x27;ve bought other \\&quot;Korean Washcloths\\&quot; in the past, all of which turned out to be too fine-woven and flimsy to scrub well.  The blue Salux scrubbers I bought are perfect; they have enough \\&quot;body\\&quot; not to just bunch up into a skinny rope when I try to scrub my back, and the texture is aggressive enough to feel that they&#x27;re really doing something.&lt;br /&gt;  Besides being thicker than the others I&#x27;ve bought, the Salux is at least 6\\&quot; longer too.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t know whether the different colors mean anything or not; all mine are blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The one improvement I could suggest is to mold a soft rubber bead across each end to help&lt;br /&gt;keep it spread out flat while I do my back.  (I tried doing that with silicone glue, which seemed to work but was too slippery to hold onto...)&lt;br /&gt;  Also, it does shed a few threads from time to time.</li>
    <li> These have just the right texture for me.  They are long-lasting and a generous size as well.</li>
    <li> These are dynamos. Don&#x27;t let the crenlin feel fool you, they can do damage if you are too exuberant in scrubbing. Use on your legs first, then on more sensitive areas if you dare.</li>
    <li> Love these scrubbers, used it since I was a kid. great for deep cleans and scrubbing my back.</li>
    <li> Too scratchy for me, but my boyfriend really likes it.</li>
    <li> I found these exfoliating washcloths on my first trip to Japan. They leave my skin soft and very smooth. Create tons of lather! Simply rinse them clean and hang to dry! Long enough to give your back a good scrubbing! I feel so clean after I use  a Salux! I would never go back to terry wash cloths again!  Wonderful as gifts and stocking stuffers!  Do give them a try!</li>
    <li> Also a quality product and good price. Use as gift and pass on this item. Men, women, kids all like this product. Replaces back scratcher, &amp;#34;luffa&amp;#34; and bath brush.</li>
    <li> Love these.  They are so big you can scrub your whole back all by yourself.  And I feel so clean after using this.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how I ever felt clean before using this product.  It is outstanding!  Scrubs the body very without leaving scratch marks and exfoliates like nothing else.  Works up a great lather too!</li>
