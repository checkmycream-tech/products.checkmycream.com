      <li>/&gt;Edited April 2014:  Evidently they&#x27;ve changed this bottle to have the flip-top instead of the nozzle.  </li>
      <li>I did lose one unfortunately, not a product defect but a very ornery puppy!</li>
      <li>The bottle received has a snap-on top that can be jarred open during transport, leading to leaks.</li>
      <li>Mine are marked but aren&#x27;t black like the picture; but they&#x27;re still great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that the plastic eventually breaks on the \\&quot;hinge\\&quot; of the lid on those, and wanted the kind where a little nozzle flips up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I definitely would not feel comfortable traveling with these bottles.  </li>

      <li>I keep toner, travel shampoo and isopropyl alcohol in this type of flip-top bottle, and had been looking for new ones for a while.  </li>
      <li>-There is clearly some misrepresentation going on here.</li>
      <li>They are made of soft plastic.</li>
      <li>Easy to fill and then a small dispenser as you lift up the opening in the cap.  </li>
      <li>bottle shown would have been useful to me, since it has a spout that can be folded down and will prevent leaks and spills.</li>
      <li>I am very picky with toiletry products, with very long hair</li>
      <li>Others I&#x27;ve used were very rigid, did not squeeze well and ended up actually creasing the plastic and warping the bottle after a single use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These bottles serve well for my business. I mix several water-based paint solvents in the 4 oz. size for illustration, and the flip-tops are very convenient for dispensing the amounts of liquid needed. The embossed volumes marks are very convenient for measuring as well.</li>
    <li> -There is clearly some misrepresentation going on here. The bottle being shown in the photo on the product webpage, is NOT the bottle you will receive when you order this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle shown would have been useful to me, since it has a spout that can be folded down and will prevent leaks and spills. The bottle received has a snap-on top that can be jarred open during transport, leading to leaks. The bottle that I received is useless to me for my original intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The time and cost of returning this item makes it not worth the effort, so I&#x27;m just writing this review instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Unless you&#x27;re not picky about the top configuration, I would advise caution about buying these bottles.</li>
    <li> These are just weird. They&#x27;re not flip-tops and they&#x27;re definitely not the the nozzle-top (either of which I would have been fine with since I read the reviews before hand) these are awkward dispensers definitely meant for liquids. Mine did have the measurements on them (no biggy there).</li>
    <li> This product description is not what I received. I received plastic bottles without measuring lines. Do not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I keep toner, travel shampoo and isopropyl alcohol in this type of flip-top bottle, and had been looking for new ones for a while.  The ones I found in drug stores and Walmart had lids like hand sanitizer, where the entire lid flips up.  I&#x27;ve found that the plastic eventually breaks on the \\&quot;hinge\\&quot; of the lid on those, and wanted the kind where a little nozzle flips up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect, and a good value too.  The bottle is a flexible plastic with marking to show the ounces.  They didn&#x27;t leak in my luggage when we went to the beach last weekend, but I also put a piece of saran wrap under the lid and put the bottles in a ziplock bag just to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six bottles will last quite a while, and I&#x27;m happy to recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited April 2014:  Evidently they&#x27;ve changed this bottle to have the flip-top instead of the nozzle.  I&#x27;m disappointed!  Removing one star</li>
    <li> What I ordered showed a cylinder bottle with a flip cap. What I got sent was a rounded bottle with a spout cap that flips up. I didn&#x27;t even get all 6... I got 5. Not what I expected and promptly returned them.</li>
    <li> My mom wanted squeeze drip bottles to use for her vanilla and other extracts.  She has trouble pouring too much when making small dishes.  We put her vanilla extract and almond extract into these to start, and used a label maker thing for labeling the bottles.  She said they work fantastic and she is able to squeeze it drop by drop into a bowl of rice pudding or into a teaspoon for recipes.  It came with 6 so I&#x27;m going to snag a couple for my vanilla too.</li>
    <li> not what I needed, but the product was really good and as advertised. I ended up having to buy a jar type containr.</li>
    <li> When I bought these they were a bargain for the price (I am not sure if I&#x27;m allowed to write the price in this review). I currently use them to hold my homemade shampoos, face wash, and oils for oil cleansing. I have yet to use them for when I travel to see if they leak or not but the cap seems to screw on tightly and when I turn the bottle upside down (when the cap is on and spout in the closed position), nothing comes out. The measurements along the side are also helpful.    Edited 12/22/2014: The item pictured no longer matches the items I bought. The items I purchased were rounded plastic containers with a flip spout and measurements along the side.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these bottles. They will work great for mixing my airbrush paint in, and they look like they would be safe to store paint in for short periods of time. I would have given 5 stars, but it looks like the bottles have the measurement marks printed on the bottle on the web site. The bottles I recieved were not printed. At my age with my failing eye sight, I was hoping for printed markers like the bottle in there listing. No real big deal. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed with these bottles !!</li>
    <li> The original picture that shows the flip top is the correct picture for these bottles.  The picture thats shown once you click on it with the lift up spout is not what I received and I&#x27;m very thankful.  I have reordered these 3 times now and love these bottles.  They don&#x27;t leak and my dye comes out slow enough that I dont make a mess.</li>
    <li> Fit for purpose. The quality was not fantastic but it will do. I use it to distribute some of my oil mixes.</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles to mix oil for cleansing my face.  They work great as long as you do not tip them onto their side.  I definitely would not feel comfortable traveling with these bottles.  I laid them down one night after I was done using them and the next morning I had oil leaking all over the place.  I would not recommend these bottles if you are planning on using them with oil or any other type of liquid as they leak.</li>
    <li> The bottles pictured are not the bottles you will receive.  I wish I had paid attention to the reviews before purchasing.  If you are looking for whole lid flip top, then this is for you.  If you are looking for what is pictured, stay away.  Will not serve intended purpose, but a waste of time to return.</li>
    <li> These tubes are perfect for my handmade skin cream.  Easy to fill and then a small dispenser as you lift up the opening in the cap.  They would also be perfect for travel size shampoos, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought these to hold denatured alcohol for my alcohol stove that I use when backpacking.  The critical point is they don&#x27;t leak and it&#x27;s nice haveing the ounces marked on the bottle.  Mine are marked but aren&#x27;t black like the picture; but they&#x27;re still great.  They&#x27;re simply perfect fuel bottles.  Mine weighed 22 grams so they may not be the lightest but they&#x27;re really good fuel bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gideon</li>
    <li> Only received one bottle with 6 lids, item received was completely different lid and container from picture. Unfortunately, not worth the hassle of returning or requesting replacement.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to hold fuel for an alcohol stove while hiking/camping so my biggest concern was leakage.  I&#x27;ve been toting these around for several weeks with water in my EDC bag that gets thrown around a bit and not one has leaked.  I like the measurement markings on the side of the bottle, but they are not colored like in the picture.  They are just raised plastic.  I may just sharpie them to make them easier to see.</li>
    <li> I am very picky with toiletry products, with very long hair I have my go to conditioners, my smell good shower gel, made for my skin type facial wash etc. lol! I have always filled my own bottles from my home products and have used a variety of types. These went with me on international travel. They held up great and being a nozzle flip top zero chance of leaking as long as the lid is screwed on tight. Others I&#x27;ve used were very rigid, did not squeeze well and ended up actually creasing the plastic and warping the bottle after a single use. I did lose one unfortunately, not a product defect but a very ornery puppy! I will continue to use these and buy another set for my husband. Cheaper over all than trying to buy travel size things that I&#x27;m not all that fond of product wise anyway.</li>
    <li> These are great little bottles for making my own lotion and bath oil.  Rec&#x27;d soon and yes buy this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these bottles for shampoo, body wash etc..  They are great for travel and just every day use. The bottles are not stiff and come with the style of flip top that I prefer.  Shipping was fast and they arrived in good shape.</li>
    <li> Sturdy little plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottles for travel. They are made of soft plastic. Easy to squeeze.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
