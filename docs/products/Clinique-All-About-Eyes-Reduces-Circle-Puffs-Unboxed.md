      <li>The product came in the original box in good shape.</li>
      <li>The travel set is very fit for the travel for  3 days to 1 week.</li>
      <li>but more like a very light gel</li>
      <li>I love me some clinque products</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this product，and</li>
      <li>Unless I find a better product, I&#x27;ll keep it around.</li>
      <li>I bought the travel size because I wasn&#x27;t sure what I needed.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have used Clinique products for more than thirty years...</li>
      <li>This is nothing more than a sample \\&quot;not to be sold individually\\&quot; and it sure don&#x27;t come in any box.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will love this as well.</li>
      <li>I used this eyes cream for many years.</li>
      <li>Works better than anything I have tried.</li>
      <li>So glad I can get it on Amazon without going out to store.</li>
      <li>I love Clinique products...</li>
      <li>I love the softness this product brings to my eye area.</li>
      <li>I added more to my wish list because I do see some benefits using this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the miracle we all look for, but it does help with the fine lines.</li>
      <li>If used regularly this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>This is a light eye cream that does what it says.  </li>
      <li>In the original Amazon listing it didn&#x27;t say travel size.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product fulfilled all my expectations in terms of quality and price is a great product I highly recommend  </li>
      <li>but I gave it more time and still didnt notice much.</li>
      <li>Purchased this product for the first time!  </li>
      <li>It also seems to smooth very well with a silky finish.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be light enough for my face.  </li>
      <li>It is light and fresh, not heavy cream.  </li>
      <li>and I can say this vendor does exactly what they say they are going to do..</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t use cosmetics that quickly so smaller quantities are much fresher and more affordable.</li>
      <li>I bought it to use mainly under my eyes for puffiness and it did not help!  </li>
      <li>Clinique tried to copy it--but too much alcohol, etc.  </li>
      <li>Not seen too much difference</li>
      <li>I had tried this before and it didnt seem to work much</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>However comparing prices &amp; having to spend $27 to get the kit, it was reasonable.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I did use it but didn&#x27;t notice much.</li>
      <li>gave this product 4 stars I liked that it wasn&#x27;t a heavy cream</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eczema-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>but I love Clinique and of their other products.  </li>
      <li>It definitely was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>It probably is still a good value but not a great one.</li>
      <li>and you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot it does last a while .</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin around my eyes</li>
      <li>so just keep that in mind ,it clearly states that info about the product.</li>
      <li>It may have been because there&#x27;s not enough to really tell.</li>
      <li>and I light not too heavy.</li>
      <li>this is a very efective product in a very few time the dark circles around my eyes get into a nice colour and younger  skin aspect.</li>
      <li>as have no other eye product that I have used.</li>
      <li>I will be buying the full sized one as soon as this little jar is done!</li>
      <li>If not carefully blended, it will leave streaks.</li>
      <li>but it certainly cools it down and de-puffs somewhat.</li>

<li> I have only used this product a few times, but like it so far.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and the dark circle are much lighter</li>
<li> This didn&#x27;t work as well for me as other, similar, products.</li>
<li> I have such dark eyes and just started this product to just see if it helps.</li>
<li> All about eyes is not a instant cure for dark circles</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize the product size was so small,  smaller than the samples Clinique gives in its 7 piece sample kit.</li>
<li> eyes felt releied after use and also reduces dark circles..</li>
<li> Fake, not the real product.</li>
<li> Sent in a container labled &#x27;sample&#x27; and watered down to the point of it not being usable.</li>
<li> But, I will still use it around my eyelids, that seems to smooth out any tiny wrinkles, too bad it doesn&#x27;t work on the under-eye puffiness!</li>
<li> but my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy and that the dark circles have faded a little not sure if it&#x27;s because I use Retinol cream during the night and Clinique during the day.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want a heavy cream.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of their products.  </li>
<li> I have allergies pretty bad</li>
<li> It&#x27;s almost as small as one of the samples you get when purchasing their products.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not helpful at all, it didn&#x27;t work and dried my eyes so badly and had to use alot of moisturizer to get my eyes back</li>
<li> but the size is very small.  </li>
<li> Sorry but never got it and now I don,t care if I ever do.</li>
<li> Maybe my circles are just too bad?</li>

    <li> I love me some clinque products</li>
    <li> Excellent price &amp; item for the item I need!</li>
    <li> This product did not decrease under eye puffiness...as have no other eye product that I have used. So no improvement.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet but I love Clinique and of their other products.  I am sure I will love this as well.</li>
    <li> I had tried this before and it didnt seem to work much but I gave it more time and still didnt notice much. Maybe my circles are just too bad?</li>

    <li> I am satisfied with this product，and the seller is very nice ，thank you</li>
    <li> This is a light eye cream that does what it says.  Does not leave eyes puffy and keeps area around eyes nice and moist. Doesn&#x27;t interfere with make-up.</li>
    <li> This is nothing more than a sample \\&quot;not to be sold individually\\&quot; and it sure don&#x27;t come in any box. It&#x27;s a tiny jar. I did use it but didn&#x27;t notice much. It may have been because there&#x27;s not enough to really tell. My recommendation would be don&#x27;t buy it from these people.&lt;br /&gt;I consider this to be a rip off.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me and I light not too heavy. It visibly reduces puffiness anytime of day I use it.</li>
    <li> I like the cream but the size is very small.  It&#x27;s almost as small as one of the samples you get when purchasing their products.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the miracle we all look for, but it does help with the fine lines. It also seems to smooth very well with a silky finish. I&#x27;m almost out of it and will order it again. Unless I find a better product, I&#x27;ll keep it around. (Unless I have to pay retail!)</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for almost 20 years. I&#x27;m closer to 60 now and no crows feet!</li>
    <li> The product came in the original box in good shape. I didn&#x27;t realize the product size was so small,  smaller than the samples Clinique gives in its 7 piece sample kit. However comparing prices &amp; having to spend $27 to get the kit, it was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Fake, not the real product. Sent in a container labled &#x27;sample&#x27; and watered down to the point of it not being usable. BEWARE. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It is light and fresh, not heavy cream.  Works better than anything I have tried. So glad I can get it on Amazon without going out to store.</li>
    <li> highly recommend this product fulfilled all my expectations in terms of quality and price is a great product I highly recommend  great  great  great ¡¡¡  its terrific  its  great ggod  good good good good good good goiod good good</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and h ave loved the effect.</li>
    <li> Not seen too much difference but it certainly cools it down and de-puffs somewhat.</li>
    <li> If used regularly this stuff is great.  I have very sensitive skin around my eyes (some products make the skin around my eyes burn-like a chemical burn).  There is no burning or irritation with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, questions as to selling products labeled &amp;#34;not for sale&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> All about eyes is not a instant cure for dark circles ,A lot of people know it costs thousands of dollars to have this done at dermatologist .I gave this product 4 stars I liked that it wasn&#x27;t a heavy cream but more like a very light gel ,I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference but my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy and that the dark circles have faded a little not sure if it&#x27;s because I use Retinol cream during the night and Clinique during the day. I added more to my wish list because I do see some benefits using this. When I placed my order I knew this was 5ml so just keep that in mind ,it clearly states that info about the product. Great for traveling and you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot it does last a while .</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well for me as other, similar, products.</li>
    <li> I could use more help with lines than puffiness but this stuff feels soooo good. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> this is a very efective product in a very few time the dark circles around my eyes get into a nice colour and younger  skin aspect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for yrs, buying in dept store or getting as a bonus gift.  In the original Amazon listing it didn&#x27;t say travel size.  It probably is still a good value but not a great one.</li>
    <li> I used this eyes cream for many years.The travel set is very fit for the travel for  3 days to 1 week.I love it.</li>
    <li> No improvement noted after two weeks. If not carefully blended, it will leave streaks. Will not buy it again</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not helpful at all, it didn&#x27;t work and dried my eyes so badly and had to use alot of moisturizer to get my eyes back</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s okay.  Clinique has been around awhile.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of their products.  I was using Erno Laszlo years ago--that stuff was great.  Clinique tried to copy it--but too much alcohol, etc.  I&#x27;ll purchase a different product next time.</li>
    <li> Have not seen improvement...</li>
    <li> Ademas de los exelentes resultados que se obtienen con el producto la presentacion es ideal.  fácil de  manejar en casa o para viaje</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and I use it all the time.  Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique products for more than thirty years...and I can say this vendor does exactly what they say they are going to do..</li>
    <li> es una crema perfecta para el contorno de ojos me da una frescura y losania todas las mañanas la coloco antes del maquillaje</li>
    <li> I bought the travel size because I wasn&#x27;t sure what I needed.  It is excellent!  Does exactly what it says and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eczema-prone skin.  I will be buying the full sized one as soon as this little jar is done!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my eyes.  Maybe I&#x27;m using it incorrectly, I don&#x27;t know.  It did not come with instructions.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times, but like it so far.</li>
    <li> lamentablemente la compania no tenia envio a los angeles y por ello no recibi en producto, deberian indicarlo al momento de colocar la direccion</li>
    <li> I love the softness this product brings to my eye area. It leaves the under eye area prepared for concealer.</li>
    <li> I love Clinique products...I have been using this product for a few weeks and the dark circle are much lighter</li>
    <li> Sorry but never got it and now I don,t care if I ever do.It,s not on my list to reorder.</li>
    <li> bought dis 4 my wife,&lt;br /&gt;her eyes felt releied after use and also reduces dark circles..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M buying 1oz now to save money</li>
    <li> This jar is tiny, a sample size!  I bought it to use mainly under my eyes for puffiness and it did not help!  But, I will still use it around my eyelids, that seems to smooth out any tiny wrinkles, too bad it doesn&#x27;t work on the under-eye puffiness!</li>
    <li> Received the product as promised. I have such dark eyes and just started this product to just see if it helps. This product is very nice around the eye area. I use every evening and my eyes feel great in the am. I have allergies pretty bad but this product is wonderful to calm my eyes without hurting them at all.</li>
