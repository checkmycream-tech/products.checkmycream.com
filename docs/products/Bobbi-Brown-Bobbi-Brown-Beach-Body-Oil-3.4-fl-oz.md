      <li>Smells exactly like cheap sunblock.</li>

      <li>This was a gift for a friend of mine who absolutely  loves this.</li>

      <li>They have this same bottle size-3.4 oz on Nordstrom online for $30 with free shipping.</li>
      <li>It really does make you think of summers on the beach when you smell it.</li>

      <li>Great, casual, summer scent.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s in a glass bottle, which normally I&#x27;m a fan of, but in a body oil it&#x27;s a major flaw.</li>
      <li>Soft skin.</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is how this pours out fast .Too</li>

<li> So delicate and fresh!</li>
<li> simply because the smell/fragrance does not last long at all.</li>
<li> I would the definitely try some other scents and the oil</li>
<li> Wet body + oily hands +</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> So for the price it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure it lasts as long on me, though I can&#x27;t tell,</li>
<li> so less is wasted.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small a 3.4 fl oz bottles is.</li>
<li> However, when I saw the long list of scary chemicals used to formulate this yummy stuff, I tried to cancel my order.</li>
<li> It smells just like a day on the beach minus the sand in awkward places.</li>
<li> The scent does not even linger on skin, it seems to evaporate into the skin without leaving any of a scent… which is a bit of a bummer considering that was my intention behind purchasing this product.</li>
<li> I hope they are doing that with the intention of taking out the scary stuff like Oxybenzone, which you can read about here:</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive for the quantity.</li>
<li> bad</li>
<li> It stinks !</li>
<li> and I was a bit disappointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the product but the only complaint is that the fragrance in it does not last at all. Only for about 30 minutes.  Other than that, it&#x27;s good.  I love the beach fragrance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this body oil, even though it&#x27;s expensive, because I love the perfume so much I figured using the body oil would extend the life of the fragrance - layering, it&#x27;s called. However, the body oil doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as wonderful nor does it layer the perfume, so I wont be purchasing it again. The perfume is a keeper, though</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells but the scent does not last.  I can rub it on and the scent has all but disappeared in a matter of minutes.  Wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Heavenly scent. Soft skin. pretty pink color. The only issue is the price. It&#x27;s a bit expensive for the quantity. It is, after all, just skin oil. I love it as a splurge but it is not an every day item for me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough I really enjoy this lovely scent , great to use before getting out of shower you can smell it in you well into the day.</li>
    <li> While the scent in beachy it doesn&#x27;t hold the scent for longer than 20 minutes thereby making it pricey because you have to keep reapplying. I should have heeded the reviews.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my daughter who loves it!</li>
    <li> Great scent however should have a pump with it; can be messy with the wide opening.</li>
    <li> I really like body oils, and this smells so fresh.  I&#x27;m not sure it lasts as long on me, though I can&#x27;t tell, because I know I get acclimated to the smell, once I have put some on.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love using body oils In The shower, love Beach perfume, so this was a win from the get go. My beef is the price. I didn&#x27;t realize how small a 3.4 fl oz bottles is. So for the price it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s in a glass bottle, which normally I&#x27;m a fan of, but in a body oil it&#x27;s a major flaw. Wet body + oily hands + glass bottle &#x3D; disaster in the making.&lt;br /&gt;I recycled the glass bottle and poured this into a plastic bottle I purchased for 99 cents at Sally Beauty Supply. That made this much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I will simply mix a drop or two of Beach perfume in with unscented body oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I love the product, but no I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend of mine who absolutely  loves this. Arrived in a beautiful box with black and white big bow  which I didn&#x27;t expect but was so happy saved me from wrapping.She was so surprised when she opened this I did smell it and did smell beachy but too strong for me.The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is how this pours out fast .Too bad they don&#x27;t add a pump or spray NOZZEL so less is wasted.Other than that she was super happy and I was also because this is one gift I knew she would love.She says her skin is so smooth and silky and this preserves her tan.</li>
    <li> Very oily, but very moisturizing and I love the smell</li>

    <li> This literally smells like the Beach... So delicate and fresh! Very Cali Style! I would the definitely try some other scents and the oil it&#x27;s better absorbed by the body, which makes the odor last longer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the scent of Beach.  However, when I saw the long list of scary chemicals used to formulate this yummy stuff, I tried to cancel my order. Once the Oil arrived I elected to keep it, but I will not buy it again.  I heard a rumor they were re-formulating the whole Beach line.  I hope they are doing that with the intention of taking out the scary stuff like Oxybenzone, which you can read about here: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient.php?ingred06&#x3D;704372#</li>
    <li> Bobbi Brown Beach is a lovely smell and I have bought the body lotion before. This is the first time buying the oil and I was a bit disappointed simply because the smell/fragrance does not last long at all.</li>
    <li> Is the $60 price a misprint? They have this same bottle size-3.4 oz on Nordstrom online for $30 with free shipping. Amazon usually has the best deals for many of my online purchases. I even went back and double checked to make sure I was comparing Apples to apples. Yep 1/2 the price @ Nord online.? Just FYI. This is my 2nd bottle of this and love it. Great, casual, summer scent. Scent is what it says- beach- but, not tropical island beach, more cape cod, Florida, California coppertone beachy fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just as described...if you love the smell of summer then this fragrance is for you!  The oil gives you a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I searched for a long time to find this scent and was so happy to see it available on Amazon.  It really does make you think of summers on the beach when you smell it.</li>
    <li> Smells adorable once it sets and your body heat kicks in.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels great. I love it.... And I&#x27;m super picky. Definitely going to be a staple for me from now on.</li>
    <li> With the exception of the bottle (specifically the inability to control how much product comes out) I absolutely love this product. Moisturizing but not greasy, beautiful scent but not perfume-y. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, but, not for a cologne for men.  More a roses smell that women would like that is fresh.  A hint of the suntan lotion Coppertone - but, not a lot.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of the summer</li>
    <li> Great product and scent - really reminds you of the beach and leaves your skin feeling so soft!</li>
    <li> It stinks ! Smells exactly like cheap sunblock. No tropical. No Hawaiian tropic. Yuck!!!</li>
    <li> Light and Summery, and just lovely.  Smooths over the skin and moisturizes and it fragrances.  I love to wear it on a hot, Summer night.  I feel like I smell like Summertime.  :)</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my mom and I have fallen in love with the smell. It smells just like a day on the beach minus the sand in awkward places.</li>
    <li> Bought for my sister. Very, very strong sent. Like sunblock and flowers.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, but it does smell a lot like Coppertone.  If you like Coppertone, you&#x27;ll like this oil.</li>
