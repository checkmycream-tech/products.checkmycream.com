      <li>More experienced DIY waxers would probably like this product.</li>
      <li>The price is good and like I said it does a nice Brazilian</li>

      <li>but you do have to buy your own strips.</li>
      <li>You do have to remove the wax while it&#x27;s still somewhat warm though.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this product has recieved so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>You have to keep re-heating the jar to keep the wax warm.</li>
      <li>worth  it!!!  </li>
      <li>I love this wax, smells so lovely!</li>
      <li>As far as over the counter waxes and strips to buy and do it yourself, this one works the best.  </li>
      <li>But overall really effective and smells delicious!</li>
      <li>It is by far the best I have ever used ( and trust me I have tested out MANY).  </li>
      <li>It is very good for sensitive skins.  </li>
      <li>They would also rip off my top layer of skin with the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a product.  </li>
      <li>The kit comes with everything you need and the results are fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love the ease of not needing to use strips.  </li>
      <li>all I really love this product and will be ordering it again.</li>
      <li>but if you want to continue waxing year get a better kit.</li>
      <li>I may spring for a wax warmer and cans though since I would like to do this more often.</li>
      <li>Smells okay.</li>
      <li>Personally I think this is probably one of the best home waxing kits</li>
      <li>I will but it again and would recommend it but wish it was better quality or cheaper price :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products (microwavable waxing systems, waxing strips, epilators, and depilatory creams) to remove hair from my bikini line.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d like to see more of this in stores</li>
      <li>I wish they disclosure more for this product , regarding the smell and the color.</li>
      <li>if you use the oil they give you the wax will not even apply where there is not enough hair, fantastic!!!!</li>
      <li>The wax dries too quick for this product to be effective.  </li>
      <li>Good texture , good grip , i think it is too blue</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying this again, and I&#x27;d be happy to pay a tidy sum of money for it.</li>
      <li>Overall great product and the smell is nice too</li>
      <li>loved the pre-epilation oil and calming oil; both do what they are supposed to do and very well.</li>
      <li>Thus: very gentle, easy to use and excellent for sensitive skins.</li>
      <li>This stuff is relatively easy to use and comes with some numbing stuff.</li>
      <li>had.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, satisfied.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This wax is so easy to use</li>
      <li>I used it for underarms and bikini area and worked just fine.</li>
      <li>leaves you hair free for weeks.</li>
      <li>wax is clean, easy to remove</li>
      <li>You have to apply the oil in the kit first, apply the wax in the correct thickness and peel it off when it just barely stops being tacky but works great.  </li>
      <li>I still think its super cool this wax is cruelty free, NOT cruelty wax?</li>
      <li>fast so you better not accidentally leave it on too long!&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>wax is considerably more gentle on you.  </li>
      <li>If you let it cool fully, it will hurt like hell to remove!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>and luckily Amazon does</li>
      <li>im sticking to a natural wax that washes off with water and comes with strips! :)</li>
      <li>Overall I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>I bought this to use and I love that it is natural and works well.</li>
      <li>This is nice to try for a beginner, I bought this several times and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>and if I do not receive a full refund I without returning the garbage I will persue with legal actions for my  hospitalization</li>
      <li>I even accidentally got some wax on some sensitive areas and was able to remove it without much difficulty or any pain.</li>
      <li>It is simple, clean and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you trim your hair before waxing and don&#x27;t let the wax cool for to long on your skin or it will hurt.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been paying more than $40 a month for bikini waxes when I could be doing it myself this easily for less than $9.</li>
      <li>I have since bought a kit you plug in that heats up and stays a consistent temperature</li>
      <li>sure to get some wax outside the border, on a non-hairy part, to hold on to when you rip.</li>
      <li>that has some pretty effed up implications :</li>
      <li>additional of the soothing oil made such a difference, and it comes with way more than you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
      <li>so I can see exactly where everything is.</li>
      <li>couple things I would like to mention is not to let it get too hard before pulling it off and make sure some of the wax is on bare skin in order to get a good grip for pulling.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s start off with the positive...</li>
      <li>It certainly hurts just as much as anything else, but it got the job done like nothing else had done.  </li>
      <li>Much easier than strips.</li>
      <li>wow!!!</li>
      <li>Waxing requires some experience and it is not fun but with the right wax, it is easy.  </li>
      <li>I have nothing but high praise for this wax.  </li>
      <li>Super easy to use but can be hard to pull off if there is oil on your fingers.</li>
      <li>Often I find myself picking little pieces off at a time instead of being able to pull it off like the directions say to.</li>
      <li>strip free, easy to wax, ready for stripping in less than 5 secs, less mess, love the oils, does not hurt  much</li>
      <li>I started at 60sec for the whole jar, then ended up putting it back in 3 more times, 30 sec each.&lt;br /&gt;Hardens</li>
      <li>The blueberry smell is a little strong, but I like blueberries</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay the right temperature for very long</li>
      <li>This product goes on nicely but can be hard to get back off.</li>
      <li>Others damage or irritate the skin or dont come off completely when pulling off.  </li>
      <li>and I really like the blue color</li>
      <li>The only thing I would complain about it the wax hardens fast.</li>
      <li>Nothing worked and I was beginning to think I&#x27;d just have to suck it up and get the job professionally done.  </li>
      <li>, no strips, with some practice it becomes nearly painless.</li>
      <li>but it only took off some of the hair and not the whole area.</li>
      <li>I did exactly what I was supposed to do and tried a small section on my leg first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s major drawback is the microwaving part.</li>
      <li>Enough for me to not go get it professionally done.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled and found it difficult, probably because I&#x27;m just a wimp.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> wow!!! I don&#x27;t know what trick the others had to perform this waxing successfully, but whoa!  This was would not come off in one piece.  Sadly, I can see that it works, but the half hour torturous removal of small bits of wax from a 1 inch  square with actual tears, not  worth  it!!!  I&#x27;m no punk, I have pierced myself,this was crazy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products (microwavable waxing systems, waxing strips, epilators, and depilatory creams) to remove hair from my bikini line.  Nothing worked and I was beginning to think I&#x27;d just have to suck it up and get the job professionally done.  I found Andrea Naturals Brazilian Bikini Wax on sale at the pharmacy one day and decided to give it a try.  There are no strips here--the wax goes onto your skin in a thick paste.  After thirty seconds, it is solid, but pliable.  You lift up the edge of it and pull it off just as you&#x27;d pull of the cloth strip in other waxing kits.  It certainly hurts just as much as anything else, but it got the job done like nothing else had done.  I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a product.  I will definitely be buying this again, and I&#x27;d be happy to pay a tidy sum of money for it.</li>
    <li> As far as over the counter waxes and strips to buy and do it yourself, this one works the best.  Others damage or irritate the skin or dont come off completely when pulling off.  It works great! Enough for me to not go get it professionally done.</li>
    <li> super bad experience with this product!!! it was very painful... and smells like crap..  says blueberry banana but smells like chemicals and bananas.. ugh.. and does not come off skin well.  im sticking to a natural wax that washes off with water and comes with strips! :)</li>
    <li> I have nightmare stories about encounters with waxing.  I have nothing but high praise for this wax.  It is by far the best I have ever used ( and trust me I have tested out MANY).  It is simple, clean and easy to use.  Plus the results are amazing.  I used to buy it from a local store but they stopped carrying, thank you amazon for not failing me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very easy to use! I have ordered this many times!!</li>
    <li> I was fooled by the previous reviews that praised this product but they are wrong.  The wax dries too quick for this product to be effective.  I didn&#x27;t even wax a majority of the area I was hoping would be waxed.  I do like the pre-wax oil and after wax oil but you do have to buy your own strips.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been paying more than $40 a month for bikini waxes when I could be doing it myself this easily for less than $9. I have horribly sensitive skin and a long list of allergies, but this all-natural wax didn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the slightest. Plus, the before and after oils the kit provides made waxing a lot less painful, and soothed the redness from waxing in just a few hours. I would recommend this wax to ANYONE, even people who have a bad history with other wax products (traditional &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; wax with strips causes me to break out). The kit comes with everything you need and the results are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Overall I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: strip free, easy to wax, ready for stripping in less than 5 secs, less mess, love the oils, does not hurt  much, no strong smells&lt;br /&gt;cons: it took 2 minutes to get wax to honey like consistency, would not recommend for first time users because you have to know how to spread wax in minimum strokes w/o getting it messy and before it gets hard. Needs heating the wax multiple times. I used it for underarms and bikini area and worked just fine. I wish the wax stayed at honey consistency longer.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the pre-epilation oil and calming oil; both do what they are supposed to do and very well. I will but it again and would recommend it but wish it was better quality or cheaper price :)</li>
    <li> Personally I think this is probably one of the best home waxing kits and I&#x27;d like to see more of this in stores (I can only find this on amazon?).  Pros: smells good, no strips, with some practice it becomes nearly painless. Cons: have to keep reheating in microwave because it hardens back up if you take a while doing it, hard to use in hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> Holy crap was this a bad idea. I followed the instructions. And i am a licensed cosmologist. I know how to wax. Ive waxed before in my pubic region. This was was terrible. Removing the wax was more painful than child birth. I don&#x27;t know how this product has recieved so many good reviews. I will never use it again. I had to go to the emergency room for skin Lacerations. and if I do not receive a full refund I without returning the garbage I will persue with legal actions for my  hospitalization</li>
    <li> Super easy to use but can be hard to pull off if there is oil on your fingers. You have to keep re-heating the jar to keep the wax warm. But overall really effective and smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now! Just love it!</li>
    <li> Waxing requires some experience and it is not fun but with the right wax, it is easy.  This wax is so easy to use that makes the painful process easy and fast.  It is very good for sensitive skins.  Thus: very gentle, easy to use and excellent for sensitive skins.</li>
    <li> this is the best hair removal system i have ever used!!! i found it years ago at cvs but they stopped carrying it. i use it all over my body and can get multiple uses out of one jar. if you use the oil they give you the wax will not even apply where there is not enough hair, fantastic!!!! i have peace of mind using this product, just don&#x27;t let the wax harden! Its a hard wax!!! i apply the product and then tap the area until it is tacky but not sticking to my hand.  i have used other products that in just testing took layers of skin off my wrist, ouch! learn to use this product and you will never go searching for another hair removal product(i use this on my legs, armpits, and my tiny) my sister decided to use this stuff under my recommendation but after applying decided she could do things in the kitchen.......absolutely a terrible idea.</li>
    <li> The waxing stuff you buy at the drug store does not work and makes a horrible mess. This stuff is relatively easy to use and comes with some numbing stuff.</li>
    <li> this product was my go to until I found cocojojo sugaring gel, its less painful and quick once you get the hang of it. I still think its super cool this wax is cruelty free, NOT cruelty wax? that has some pretty effed up implications :c Anywhoo this product worked well for me, if you&#x27;re looking for quality wax here it is.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start off with the positive...this does do a good job at removing hair. On the other hand, it is the most painful wax I have ever used. Plus it&#x27;s extremely messy. The wax gets on everything &amp; is impossible to remove. I will stick with my Nair Spa Clay Wax...much more pleasant waxing experience</li>
    <li> This product did it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s major drawback is the microwaving part. What a pain! It doesn&#x27;t stay the right temperature for very long so you are constantly running back and forth from bathroom to microwave. Because of this it took forever (2+ hours!). I have since bought a kit you plug in that heats up and stays a consistent temperature and it takes me less than an hour. The price is good and like I said it does a nice Brazilian but if you want to continue waxing year get a better kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use and I love that it is natural and works well. The oils it comes with do the job great and the smell of the wax is good as well. The only thing I would complain about it the wax hardens fast.</li>
    <li> Hard to use, very sticky, and painful. I tried tips that have been posted but they didn&#x27;t work for me. It just irritated my skin and pulled out a couple of hairs, definitely missing at least 90% of my hair. Smells okay. If you get this under your nails you&#x27;ll have to snip them off so be a little careful of that.</li>
    <li> This is nice to try for a beginner, I bought this several times and would recommend it. I may spring for a wax warmer and cans though since I would like to do this more often. Just make sure you trim your hair before waxing and don&#x27;t let the wax cool for to long on your skin or it will hurt. Overall great product and the smell is nice too</li>
    <li> Good texture , good grip , i think it is too blue and I am afraid there are horrible artificial coloring and scents to it. I wish they disclosure more for this product , regarding the smell and the color.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of trouble finding a bikini wax that didn&#x27;t destroy my sensitive skin in the waxing process.  Wax with strips were  very painful and never thorough enough.  They would also rip off my top layer of skin with the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This wax is considerably more gentle on you.  It doesn&#x27;t bind to your skin, and grips the hair instead.  You do have to remove the wax while it&#x27;s still somewhat warm though.  If you let it cool fully, it will hurt like hell to remove!&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order of this same wax from Amazon, because I can&#x27;t find it in any pharmacy near me.  I plan on always keeping some on hand.</li>
    <li> This was the easiest wax to use.  You have to apply the oil in the kit first, apply the wax in the correct thickness and peel it off when it just barely stops being tacky but works great.  Much easier than strips.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good!&lt;br /&gt;Pain level: 6/10 - lower than any other wax experience I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons/Good-to-know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer in my microwave(1500w) than it says on the jar. I started at 60sec for the whole jar, then ended up putting it back in 3 more times, 30 sec each.&lt;br /&gt;Hardens fast so you better not accidentally leave it on too long!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to get some wax outside the border, on a non-hairy part, to hold on to when you rip.</li>
    <li> Uhgggg! It HURT so bad! I will never in a million years try to wax my own vagina again! It was horrible and painful.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package it had leaked a little in the box but didn&#x27;t ruin anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax smelled really good though. That was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;So not worth the pain - get a professional.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of different waxes with strips and they were all miserable; sticky and messy and I was never able to to finish the job. This was a completely different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is clean, easy to remove and I really like the blue color so I can see exactly where everything is. I even accidentally got some wax on some sensitive areas and was able to remove it without much difficulty or any pain. The wax itself has a great grip and leaves little to no hair behind, unlike other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried that were too soft and didn&#x27;t get it all in one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things I would like to mention is not to let it get too hard before pulling it off and make sure some of the wax is on bare skin in order to get a good grip for pulling. I had one or two instances of real agony because I had to pull it up slowly with a really thick patch of hair. Don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I really love this product and will be ordering it again. The blueberry smell is a little strong, but I like blueberries so I didn&#x27;t mind. It goes away when you&#x27;re done anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional of the soothing oil made such a difference, and it comes with way more than you&#x27;ll ever need. I had little to no irritation or pain afterwards.</li>
    <li> This product goes on nicely but can be hard to get back off. Often I find myself picking little pieces off at a time instead of being able to pull it off like the directions say to. When you have to pick at it to get it off it leaves your skin raw.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. No strips involved, is a wax that hardens on your skin that you are suppose to pull off. Use a thick layer, my first layer was to thin and I had to peel away little bits at a time, it was very tedious and painful. This was my second at home attempt at waxing. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled and found it difficult, probably because I&#x27;m just a wimp. More experienced DIY waxers would probably like this product.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. I did exactly what I was supposed to do and tried a small section on my leg first but it only took off some of the hair and not the whole area. Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong but I haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time. However i did not like it. It did not remove all the hair. I&#x27;d rather shave then use this again.</li>
    <li> I do my own waxing and I use to buy this at my local CVS. They don&#x27;t carry it anymore and luckily Amazon does and for 1/2 the price I use to buy it for! Love the ease of not needing to use strips.  Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this wax, smells so lovely!</li>
    <li> This is the only wax that I use.  It works great, is virtually painless and has an awesome scent...leaves you hair free for weeks.</li>
