      <li>A very good investment.</li>
      <li>Have also used this merchant as well; good service.</li>
      <li>My stomach is very sensitive, but this product is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This product was okay.  </li>
      <li>will know more as time goes on.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I threw them away and have been taking these as recommended, and every thing has been okay.</li>
      <li>Saw this product on Dr. Oz show and thought I&#x27;d try it, works well and easy  on the stomach,I would reccomend for any one to try, well pleased.</li>
      <li>With a healthy diet and exercise, they have helped me with my weight and very rarely do I crave that sugar-filled, calorie-filled &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Ordering was easy and delivery was very quick on the product.  </li>
      <li>However I was very pleased with the overall transaction.</li>
      <li>Dr. Oz reviewed this product on his show quite a while ago, and everything positive that was said about Irvingia has been true.  </li>
      <li>so I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Will try to come back when I know more.</li>
      <li>The higher dose caused my heart to race and my blood pressure to rise to unacceptable levels.  </li>
      <li>without making much effort to change my eating habits.  </li>
      <li>Not to be overly up-front, but these capsules keep me regular like no amount of Metamucil and fresh fruits and veggies ever have.  </li>
      <li>Being over 60 getting the upper body fat to work off is difficult and this might work better for 40&#x27;s or younger with higher metabolism but not for the older folks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been taking this product for over a month.  I think it is working.  I have lost some weight but I have not gained any weight either.  I think it has improved my metabolism.</li>
    <li> Had been following a diet and doing well.  As always the weight comes off slower than you would like so I thought this product might help.  It did nothing.  Also they zing you on the shipping.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t taken this product long enough to know it&#x27;s effects, I will review this product at a later date.  However I was very pleased with the overall transaction.</li>
    <li> Bought two bottles - my friend and I took them for a month. Neither of us lost a pound and we both dieted and worked out. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product before and I believe it works well. Have also used this merchant as well; good service.</li>
    <li> Short term, this seems to be making a little difference to me -- my energy and commitment levels have increased.  I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how it works long term.  I&#x27;ve actually lost 6 lbs. without making much effort to change my eating habits.  Please heed the warning not to exceed the levels recdommended.  I bought another brand with a highter mg. at Walmart before I ordered these.  The higher dose caused my heart to race and my blood pressure to rise to unacceptable levels.  I threw them away and have been taking these as recommended, and every thing has been okay.</li>
    <li> I read in a magazine that Dr. Oz recommended this to aide in weight loss so I was willing to give it a try.  How did it work?  It didn&#x27;t.  I lost no weight and did not experience any increased energy or decreases appetite.  I guess Dr. Oz isn&#x27;t the be all end all everyone seems to think he is.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz reviewed this product on his show quite a while ago, and everything positive that was said about Irvingia has been true.  My stomach is very sensitive, but this product is wonderful.  With a healthy diet and exercise, they have helped me with my weight and very rarely do I crave that sugar-filled, calorie-filled &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34;.  A very good investment.</li>
    <li> Did not realize that this product contains corn which I am allergic. Did not use it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t Lose Any Weight.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to see if it would help with trying to reduce weight - I have to admit I was not as hungry but I did not see the results even with exercise and watching food intake I thought I would see with its boasting of results.  Being over 60 getting the upper body fat to work off is difficult and this might work better for 40&#x27;s or younger with higher metabolism but not for the older folks.</li>
    <li> Saw this product on Dr. Oz show and thought I&#x27;d try it, works well and easy  on the stomach,I would reccomend for any one to try, well pleased.</li>
    <li> Purchased these supplelments to help lose weight; they had no appreciable value in doing that.</li>
    <li> I can only say it gives me gas. I will finish it, but in two weeks that is all I can say.</li>
    <li> I have not had this product long enough to see any results yet.  It has no side effects that I can tell and I take it twice a day.  Will try to come back when I know more.</li>
    <li> This product did not work.......</li>
    <li> The product helps curb my appetite and seems to give me energy. It doesnt make you jittery.  Ordering was easy and delivery was very quick on the product.  I have ordered several times.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this after seeing something on a TV doctor show (will go nameless). We both used this until all the caps were gone and there were no noticeable results/effects. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product was okay.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the user or the product, but it did not do what I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for awhile and I do believe it makes a diffrence.  I&#x27;m still testing so will know more as time goes on.</li>
    <li> Not to be overly up-front, but these capsules keep me regular like no amount of Metamucil and fresh fruits and veggies ever have.  It has also helped me to lose about 7 pounds of fat.  This took about 6 months but was done without adding to my workout or decreasing my calories.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all for me a waste of money.  Would not every purchase again and would not recommend.</li>
