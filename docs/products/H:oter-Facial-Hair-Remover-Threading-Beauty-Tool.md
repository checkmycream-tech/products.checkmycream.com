      <li>It works great</li>

      <li>:).. It works..</li>
      <li>After reading many, many reviews, I decide to buy this thing......</li>
      <li>Better than waxing or shaving?</li>
      <li>So on to the product:    I love it.</li>
      <li>But I love this product</li>
      <li>u make sure u wont get any bumps</li>
      <li>Not too sure why this product is advertised as a \\&quot;Twist-N-Roll\\&quot; tweezer, if there&#x27;s nothing of that sort written on the box.    </li>
      <li>and it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have seen this tool being used on TV and it seemed easy.</li>
      <li>one more thing clean it with alcohol before us every time, so</li>
      <li>This has been easy to use and pretty effective.</li>
      <li>well it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure u will love it one you learn how to roll it on.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be peach fuzz free in no time</li>
      <li>After using it, my face is smooth.</li>
      <li>When I opened the bag at the top, the tool fell right out of the bottom onto the floor.</li>
      <li>cool product easy hair removal.</li>
      <li>It is better than a tweezer for large area hair removal, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like a tweezer, easy to use.</li>
      <li>Good for fine facial hair.</li>
      <li>if instructions dont come, just ask and they send it right away!</li>
      <li>this is a really cool item, it works well when you know how to use it....</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better than tweezing because it pulls more than 1 strand if hair it pulls multiple strands of hair!</li>
      <li>Hurts quite a bit at first, but hey, you&#x27;re tweezing!</li>
      <li>This is worth every bit of its price.</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s a nice way to same money.</li>
      <li>It removes the hair pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>but once you get the Hang it is very easy to use and removes facial hair with ease.</li>
      <li>bcuz I would like it to last more then 6 months..</li>
      <li>Finally satisfied with a hair removal product, and after only one day of use!</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this brand threading tool to anyone because it broke upon first use.</li>
      <li>Of course I want to make it clear that it is cheap because the product is sort of flimsy around the handles.</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>It plugs your facial hair not one at a time more like 10 at a time.</li>
      <li>Okay, so my product came in a box that was written in Japanese letterings but was made in China.</li>
      <li>She shared it with my niece, and now she wants one too!</li>
      <li>that how I feel hahaha;)...</li>
      <li>this is a nice little product.</li>
      <li>like I said it take no time really, fast fast fast</li>
      <li>Does the job very well.</li>
      <li>I had to get used to the flexibility of the spring since it is very liberal.</li>
      <li>I have a high pain tolerance, but this really hurts.</li>
      <li>its a great tool to use if you&#x27;re uncomfortable with strangers waxing off your hair.</li>
      <li>It was under $7, so it wasn&#x27;t even worth sending back.</li>
      <li>BUT the more you use it, the less sensitive you are to it.</li>
      <li>A tiny accessory that gets the job done right.  </li>
      <li>The end plastic piece ripped off which caused the spring to actually pinch and smack me right on the lip.</li>
      <li>, then you have order a new one</li>
      <li>Simple you can do it on your own, after rolling it on a few time it doesn&#x27;t hurts, well</li>
      <li>It is too big and the outer pink parts snatch off easily.</li>
      <li>Ok let&#x27;s get real, hair removal is never pleasant.</li>
      <li>you have a sensitive skin</li>
      <li>the ones I really want to pull out (upper lip and chin) are the ones this thing didnt touch.</li>
      <li>Probably because it grabs several hairs at once, and its kind of like tearing off a band-aid very slowly.</li>
      <li>I ended up with bumps, that turned into pimples, that took forever to go away and then left a whole lot of marks on my skin that also took me several weeks to fade, using a fade cream.....</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive and easy way to remove facial hair without harsh chemicals or expensive salon treatments, etc. :)</li>
      <li>I had to practice a little at first</li>
      <li>think the first one I bought had a tighter coil, and might have been a little longer.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommed this to women looking to get rid of their facial hair without using hot wax or harsh chemicals.</li>

<li> I would definitely recommed this to women looking to get rid of their facial hair without using hot wax or harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> I may just not be getting the learning curve, but I have to tweeze the area after using this tool, so I usually just go straight for the tweezers.</li>
<li> I recently used Nair Spa Clay Facial Hair Removal Creme Trio and it removed parts of my upper lip peach fuzz and basically trimmed other parts.</li>
<li> On a crazy whim I decided to give this a try based on its reviews, I basically got it for facial hair since I am going thru that lovely perimenopausal stage in life.</li>
<li> our of 5 stars b/c its kind of painful</li>
<li> I expected the pain from this product to be almost intolerable; however, that was definitely not the case!</li>
<li> This product does remove hair, but it removes a few at a time, and takes a lot of going over the same area multiple times.  </li>
<li> Secondly, if you were expecting a black case for it, forget it.     </li>
<li> I would feel better if it caught a lot of the hairs and was painful instead of just a few and making the task last so long.</li>
<li> Of course it hurts but only for a few seconds.</li>
<li> There is some pain, but it is expected.</li>
<li> I use it every other day wile sitting and watching TV.</li>
<li> This spring worked just like a charm and did not really hurt at all!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
<li> Before I purchased this idome I viewed a few reviews on you tube...</li>
<li> If I place an ice pack on my skin for a few minutes I can tolerate two to four passes....</li>
<li> It did hurt a little bit in a few spots but definitely not many!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well and is painful.</li>
<li> It is difficult to pluck a specific hair that might be a problem</li>
<li> i felt slow.</li>
<li> and I was never satisfied!</li>
<li> Barely gets any hair and the ones it does get are so awfully painful.  </li>
<li> duh!</li>
<li> I didnt work as I has expected it to, the hair removal is sporadic and painful and</li>
<li> but it hurts so badly that I hardly ever use it.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t difficult for me to use at all.</li>
<li> Will not  tweeze hair completely, is  painful and breaks hair.&lt;br</li>
<li> Quite painful but not the pain</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a tab bit painful</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It takes a lot longer than doing in home waxing and you need a second person too ue the tool while you strech your skin</li>
    <li> this is a nice little product. however you paid for what you get, last for a minute, then you have order a new one</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this idome I viewed a few reviews on you tube... N when I use my spring it duh! It does hurt, just like when you wax it hurts but it does the job. It plugs your facial hair not one at a time more like 10 at a time. It works great, I think it&#x27;s a nice way to same money. Simple you can do it on your own, after rolling it on a few time it doesn&#x27;t hurts, well that how I feel hahaha;)... Just try it n if you like it like I did you can have your own opinion about it.:).. It works.. N I rate 4starts bcuz I would like it to last more then 6 months.. But for the price well it&#x27;s fine I guess.     Ooh n one more thing clean it with alcohol before us every time, so u make sure u wont get any bumps n wash your face before n after us.. It&#x27;s really simple like I said it take no time really, fast fast fast.. I&#x27;m pretty sure u will love it one you learn how to roll it on.</li>
    <li> I have seen this tool being used on TV and it seemed easy. Better than waxing or shaving? I cannot get the hang of it. I suppose it takes time and patience to learn how which I don&#x27;t have. It is berried in a drawer, I do not use it.</li>
    <li> A tiny accessory that gets the job done right.  It requires some skills in the beginning but once you got the hang of it  then you can appreciate its efficiency.</li>
    <li> this product does what it says, it does a very good job of removing the hair. but it hurts so badly that I hardly ever use it. If I place an ice pack on my skin for a few minutes I can tolerate two to four passes.... thats it. I read that baby orajel can be used on the skin before hair removal to help with the pain. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but plan to this week.  I have a high pain tolerance, but this really hurts. Probably because it grabs several hairs at once, and its kind of like tearing off a band-aid very slowly. I can just feel every hair as it is removed. ouch.</li>
    <li> Ok let&#x27;s get real, hair removal is never pleasant. This tool gets easier each time you use it and it WORKS! At a fraction of the $ on that big shopping channel! I also bought one for a friend and she loves it too. Watch the video on how to use it on YouTube and you&#x27;ll be peach fuzz free in no time</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 4 our of 5 stars b/c its kind of painful the 1st couple of times you use it. BUT the more you use it, the less sensitive you are to it. It works great! It removes the hair pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought it so I could remove my excess facial hair, it hurts when removing hair at times but it works like a charm! And a friend of mine always said beauty is pain. lol! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive and easy way to remove facial hair without harsh chemicals or expensive salon treatments, etc. :)</li>
    <li> Does the job very well. You have to make multiple passes and maybe pluck a hair or two here and there but it does work!</li>
    <li> Okay, so my product came in a box that was written in Japanese letterings but was made in China. Hmm... Not too sure why this product is advertised as a \\&quot;Twist-N-Roll\\&quot; tweezer, if there&#x27;s nothing of that sort written on the box.    Secondly, if you were expecting a black case for it, forget it.     Basically I wasn&#x27;t sent anything that was pictured or advertised as \\&quot;Twist-N-Roll\\&quot; tweezers... however, I forgive them. Why? Simply because the product that was sent works. It was under $7, so it wasn&#x27;t even worth sending back. Of course I want to make it clear that it is cheap because the product is sort of flimsy around the handles. You get what you pay for.    So on to the product:    I love it. I don&#x27;t understand why people complain about pain when it comes to hair removal, with an exception of shaving. There is some pain, but it is expected. It wasn&#x27;t difficult for me to use at all. I didn&#x27;t even use a mirror-- just experimented by using different techniques.     Would have given 5 stars had I been sent the correct product... but either way, it works for me... so there you go!</li>
    <li> this is a really cool item, it works well when you know how to use it....if instructions dont come, just ask and they send it right away!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this brand threading tool to anyone because it broke upon first use. The end plastic piece ripped off which caused the spring to actually pinch and smack me right on the lip. Quite painful but not the pain I was imagining... I was expecting the discomfort of hair removal. This item is only $1.35 for a reason. Purchase with caution.</li>
    <li> This has been easy to use and pretty effective. It is difficult to pluck a specific hair that might be a problem so I still need those tweezers.</li>
    <li> I finally figured out how to use it. i felt slow. its a great tool to use if you&#x27;re uncomfortable with strangers waxing off your hair. it&#x27;s a tab bit painful but that&#x27;s the price of beauty. I definitely reccomend it. look up how to use it when you receive the package.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a fair price for what it promises. have not tested it, but from what I read will work perfectly.</li>
    <li> On a crazy whim I decided to give this a try based on its reviews, I basically got it for facial hair since I am going thru that lovely perimenopausal stage in life. I didnt work as I has expected it to, the hair removal is sporadic and painful and the ones I really want to pull out (upper lip and chin) are the ones this thing didnt touch.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Very disappointing. It also hurts when it does pick up a hair here and there, but DOES NOT do a good job at all.</li>
    <li> Does not work as promised. Will not  tweeze hair completely, is  painful and breaks hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend or buy this  again.</li>
    <li> I havent used a shaver/razor since I got this well over a yr ago.  I use it while I watch TV and  I dont have to worry about that hairy upper lip that we get as we age. I have recommended it to others, who also love this method of hair removing for the face.  Get this you will also love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it works pretty good. It does take some time to get everything, but it does the work I want it to do</li>
    <li> This product does remove hair, but it removes a few at a time, and takes a lot of going over the same area multiple times.  I may just not be getting the learning curve, but I have to tweeze the area after using this tool, so I usually just go straight for the tweezers.</li>
    <li> cool product easy hair removal. though a lot of pain&lt;br /&gt;If you have a sensitive skin do not think about it</li>
    <li> Works really well! Hurts quite a bit at first, but hey, you&#x27;re tweezing!</li>
    <li> It was not as efficient as one I bought in Haida Gwaii last year, which I have lost, but I can&#x27;t remember the name of that one.&lt;br /&gt;I think the first one I bought had a tighter coil, and might have been a little longer.</li>
    <li> This is worth every bit of its price. After using it, my face is smooth. I use it every other day wile sitting and watching TV.</li>
    <li> Just got this today and LOVE IT!!!!! I have tried just about everything you can think of to get rid of my mustache and I was never satisfied! I expected the pain from this product to be almost intolerable; however, that was definitely not the case! I recently used Nair Spa Clay Facial Hair Removal Creme Trio and it removed parts of my upper lip peach fuzz and basically trimmed other parts. This spring worked just like a charm and did not really hurt at all! It did hurt a little bit in a few spots but definitely not many! I was worried about irritation after using it so I used the moisturizing lotion that came with my Nair Trio... No irritation whatsoever! Finally satisfied with a hair removal product, and after only one day of use!</li>
    <li> Barely gets any hair and the ones it does get are so awfully painful.  I would feel better if it caught a lot of the hairs and was painful instead of just a few and making the task last so long.</li>
    <li> The pain is the same as using the threading method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the velvet drawstring bag it comes in had no bottom because someone forgot to sew up the opening.  When I opened the bag at the top, the tool fell right out of the bottom onto the floor.</li>
    <li> This product works great. Of course it hurts but only for a few seconds. I would definitely recommed this to women looking to get rid of their facial hair without using hot wax or harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> It took some getting used too! But I love this product it&#x27;s better than tweezing because it pulls more than 1 strand if hair it pulls multiple strands of hair! I just use it around my lips and chin! Not for eyebrows!! Totally recommend it! :D</li>
    <li> My friend does not have facial hair but imagines that she does when she is nervous.  This tool eliminates any doubts.</li>
    <li> It is too big and the outer pink parts snatch off easily. It doesn&#x27;t work very well and is painful. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had to practice a little at first but once you get the Hang it is very easy to use and removes facial hair with ease.</li>
    <li> came on time and ive had it for seven months and it still works great. i will purchase again soon</li>
    <li> I like this tool, only thing  I had to get used to the flexibility of the spring since it is very liberal. It is better than a tweezer for large area hair removal, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like a tweezer, easy to use. Good for fine facial hair.</li>
    <li> After reading many, many reviews, I decide to buy this thing......BIG MISTAKE! I ended up with bumps, that turned into pimples, that took forever to go away and then left a whole lot of marks on my skin that also took me several weeks to fade, using a fade cream.....never again!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter.  She loves it.  She shared it with my niece, and now she wants one too!</li>
