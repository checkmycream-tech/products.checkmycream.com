      <li>Great quality</li>
      <li>I love using it...and it makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
      <li>Well, upon recommendation of a good friend, I gave this a try</li>
      <li>good to buy for yourself or someone else.</li>
      <li>This smells so good.</li>
      <li>You need to mix it up really good before you scoop out a good handful of the sugar and the oil and then use circular motions to rub it into and exfoliate the skin.</li>
      <li>so* good and is so relaxing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s because of the incredible scent and aroma which will leave you feeling like you&#x27;re in a fine spa.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, great for feeling relaxed in shower.</li>
      <li>Love it makes me feel invigorated !</li>
      <li>Love it tho!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and makes you feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>smells amazing so realizing I feel like I am in a Vegas Spa when I use this.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
      <li>I just love this body scrub.</li>
      <li>&#x27;Scrubbies&#x27; are the size of sea salt but feel fantastic!</li>
      <li>/&gt;But the reason I recommend this the most?</li>
      <li>and I love the lingering smell of spearmint and eucalyptus.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love, love this aromatherapy sugar...</li>
      <li>Short of that, it&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I steam up my shower and as soon as I open the jar, I get that wonderful relaxing spa sensation.</li>
      <li>I love using this in the shower, and I use the lotion afterward too.</li>
      <li>Stress relief is most definitely an accurate label for this.</li>
      <li>It is strong, and if you don&#x27;t do well with mint products, like peppermint or spearmint, this might &#x27;burn&#x27; your skin, but I&#x27;m a fair skinned red-head, and I have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t ever bothered me.</li>
      <li>Plus if you can score coupon codes on-line or print (which they have quite often) has free shipping and free gift too.</li>
      <li>However Amazon sells it for $24 which is over-price even with no tax and free shipping.</li>
      <li>Very soothing when added to your warm bath water..</li>
      <li>Great for winter, helps with dry winter skin.  </li>
      <li>It works great on elbows and knees and rough patches of skin.</li>
      <li>I had never used a sugar scrub before although I had heard such good things about them.</li>
      <li>This one in particular smells fantastic and is so calming and soothing!</li>
      <li>(I highly recommend Slip Doctors non-slip spray, see my review for more information.)</li>
      <li>Not only does this sugar scrub feel insanely wonderful on your body, but it&#x27;s also fantastic for your mental health.</li>
      <li>Do no use this in the shower or bath tub, unless you clean it up first.  </li>
      <li>It is so calming and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>Invigorating and wakes you right up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You just scoop out a bit of the crystals (soaked in the oil) on your fingers and start rubbing them into your skin and see it exfoliate and plump the skin right up.</li>
      <li>love sugar scrubs, more than salt scrubs, because they don&#x27;t feel as harsh.</li>
      <li>Leaves shower floor VERY slippery!</li>
      <li>but I find I only need to use it once or twice a week at most.</li>
      <li>This product is great especially for dry climates or sandal season!  </li>
      <li>This sugar scrub has made showers a positive experience for me</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin super soft.</li>
      <li>It makes me think of a man fresh from the shower, like Irish Spring soap with a kick... the way it feels on my skin is slightly tingly and exhilarating, but with a scent that calms and soothes frazzled nerves.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>You would want, of course, to keep it away from intimate body parts, because the likelihood of burning would exist.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these aromatherapy body scrubs!</li>
      <li>I had never used a sugar scrub before and now that I have, my life is absolutely changed.</li>
      <li>Very relaxing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The oils and sugar work really well together.  </li>
      <li>Product is exactly what is says it is and was worth the money -- I would definitely purchase from the vendor again!</li>
      <li>product itself feels really oily, so you want to be super careful in the shower.</li>
      <li>so I won&#x27;t slip but the oil residue seems to wash down easily.  </li>
      <li>I do not use every day, but skin is soft after each use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheaper to get it directly from the source.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft</li>
      <li>the eucalyptus spearmint is energizing and the oil makes your skin really soft.</li>
      <li>I use it on a thin 2-in-1 loofa body buff (since the sugar/oil get lost in a typical shower puff), and my skin is soft and amazing.</li>
      <li>It is is soft scrub and yet leave behind a smooth finish on your skin.  </li>

<li> The sugar crystals are bigger, but somehow seem to be less abrasive and dissolve easier, so they don&#x27;t damage the skin as much as slough off the rough stuff and soothe.</li>
<li> The oils leaves a soothing smoothness behind, instead of leaving it dried out, but the oils also will rinse off onto the floor of your tub or shower, so be super careful when getting out or walking in your bathroom with those oils on your feet.</li>
<li> Be careful in the shower if you don&#x27;t already have a non-skid surface as it can get quite slippery.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last long because every shower is like a spa treatment (including the relaxing scent left behind) and it takes a lot to cover the body.</li>
<li> This body scrub turns your shower into a little piece of Heaven.</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t imagine how other delicate places might feel.</li>
<li> it will be slick.</li>
<li> It leaves a thin, thin sheen of oil on your skin, so you can smell it and feel it for hours after a bath or shower.</li>
<li> As somebody who suffers form anxiety, taking showers can be a bit difficult.</li>

    <li> Adore this body scrub. Very relaxing and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Leaves shower floor VERY slippery!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hands. It makes my skin soft and I love the lingering smell of spearmint and eucalyptus. good to buy for yourself or someone else.</li>
    <li> The scent is HEAVENLY! I use it on a thin 2-in-1 loofa body buff (since the sugar/oil get lost in a typical shower puff), and my skin is soft and amazing. The essential oils add aromatherapy for a luxurious touch. Be careful in the shower if you don&#x27;t already have a non-skid surface as it can get quite slippery. (I highly recommend Slip Doctors non-slip spray, see my review for more information.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too oily for me.  Do no use this in the shower or bath tub, unless you clean it up first.  It is slippery!</li>
    <li> &#x27;Scrubbies&#x27; are the size of sea salt but feel fantastic! Doesn&#x27;t last long because every shower is like a spa treatment (including the relaxing scent left behind) and it takes a lot to cover the body. Love it tho!</li>
    <li> This body scrub turns your shower into a little piece of Heaven. I adore this stuff. I had never used a sugar scrub before and now that I have, my life is absolutely changed. Not only does this sugar scrub feel insanely wonderful on your body, but it&#x27;s also fantastic for your mental health. As somebody who suffers form anxiety, taking showers can be a bit difficult. Under the water, you tend to have a lot of time to think about a lot of things. This sugar scrub has made showers a positive experience for me and I&#x27;m so incredibly thankful. Stress relief is most definitely an accurate label for this. Once you start washing yourself, you can take a deep breath and the aroma will melt away your worries. It&#x27;s a truly beautiful thing.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love, love this aromatherapy sugar...the eucalyptus spearmint is energizing and the oil makes your skin really soft. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This awesome product. Shipped to me immediately.Very soothing when added to your warm bath water..Love it makes me feel invigorated !</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites that I ask for at Christmas.  Love, love, love it!  Take caution getting out of tub.....it will be slick.</li>
    <li> This product is great especially for dry climates or sandal season!  It is is soft scrub and yet leave behind a smooth finish on your skin.  I do pay attention in the shower so I won&#x27;t slip but the oil residue seems to wash down easily.  I think the shower basin like it too!  I would give it 10 stars if possible!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! Smells amazing and makes you feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
    <li> This sugar scrub smells *so* good and is so relaxing. It leaves my skin super soft. It leaves a thin, thin sheen of oil on your skin, so you can smell it and feel it for hours after a bath or shower.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Invigorating and wakes you right up. However Amazon sells it for $24 which is over-price even with no tax and free shipping. Its only $16 at Bath and body work on-line and in store. Even with tax it&#x27;s cheaper to get it directly from the source. Plus if you can score coupon codes on-line or print (which they have quite often) has free shipping and free gift too.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what is says it is and was worth the money -- I would definitely purchase from the vendor again!</li>
    <li> This smells so good. I love using it...and it makes your skin feel wonderful. I will definitely have to order this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, great for feeling relaxed in shower.</li>

Instant gratification!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reason I recommend this the most? It&#x27;s because of the incredible scent and aroma which will leave you feeling like you&#x27;re in a fine spa. I steam up my shower and as soon as I open the jar, I get that wonderful relaxing spa sensation. There&#x27;s just something about the combination of eucalyptus and spearmint - it&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s on the pricey side,  but I find I only need to use it once or twice a week at most. This one tub can last me months and months.</li>
    <li> A wonderful gift. My wife loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is so calming and fresh smelling.

You would want, of course, to keep it away from intimate body parts, because the likelihood of burning would exist. I got some in my eyes once, and regretted that, so I can&#x27;t imagine how other delicate places might feel. Short of that, it&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself feels really oily, so you want to be super careful in the shower.
