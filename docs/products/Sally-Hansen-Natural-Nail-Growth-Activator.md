<li> but it&#x27;s too thick and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the nail as much.</li>
<li> It has the consistency of water, has no smell, and as a person who is highly allergic to various products, I can attest to the fact that I have not experienced any skin contact issues with this product.  </li>
<li> So, I stubbed my big toenail and half of the nail came off.</li>
<li> I think this product works very well and that others with weak, bitten nails should use it, too.</li>
<li> Although my nails do seem a tiny bit stronger and less prone to breakage, I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no growth at all.  </li>
<li> My nails did get harder and gradually longer.</li>
<li> Its not really a polish...more like a treatment..which is probably what is it.</li>
<li> I got it the other day.</li>
<li> The other nail growth stuff works</li>
<li> After using this for a few weeks, I noticed my nails were getting long</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time growing their nails out at least long enough to put polish on.  </li>
<li> but I previously ordered a bunch of nail polishes</li>
<li> I would have given this product at least 3 starts for that fact, except that the bottle was half empty when I received it.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t have to remove this after a few days, you just put it on and it soaks into your nail.</li>
<li> What a waste of my money!</li>
<li> and they were hard, too, no more splitting, etc.  </li>
<li> I hope Sally Hansen does not quit making this product beings it seem hard to locate.</li>
<li> This item is hard to find in stores.  </li>
<li> When I received this product in the mail, it DID look like it was a return product as the front sticker was coming off and there was a piece of lint/hair stuck on it (for that, it loses a star).</li>
<li> Since I did not want that to happen to me, I desperately searched for a solution to fully grow my toe nail back.   </li>
<li> I also used the Miracle Grow in the gold bottle but that became really thick and sticky within 2 weeks</li>
<li> but it was only the box that was in bad condition.</li>
<li> Nothing i&#x27;ll get angry over</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had splitting, peeling, cracking, awful nails my entire life.  </li>
<li> Oh well, like I said I was desperate.</li>
<li> I had a very bad nail biting habit until I decided to use this product.</li>
<li> SO DOES NOT HAVE THAT NASTY SMELL.</li>
<li> Absolutely awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because I bite my nails a lot but I previously ordered a bunch of nail polishes so I wanted my nails to grow FAST. It looks and feels like oil. Its not really a polish...more like a treatment..which is probably what is it. My nails did get harder and gradually longer. I also used the Miracle Grow in the gold bottle but that became really thick and sticky within 2 weeks so I could not use it anymore.     I give this 4 stars because the package (the actual box of the product) was sticky and had several tears. I thought the seller used it then sent it but it was only the box that was in bad condition. The product itself looked un-touched (kind of) with the liquid filled all the way to the top with some handprints on the handle/applicator. Nothing i&#x27;ll get angry over but it was ..annoying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had splitting, peeling, cracking, awful nails my entire life.  This is an amazing product.  The first time you apply it, you can feel it somehow seal your nails.  You have to apply it twice a day, morning and night and I now wear protective gloves when doing dishes.  What a joy it is to not snag nylons or other things on my nails.  You can&#x27;t find this product in many retail stores and I am pleased as punch I&#x27;ve been able to find it on line.  It has the consistency of water, has no smell, and as a person who is highly allergic to various products, I can attest to the fact that I have not experienced any skin contact issues with this product.  If you use it twice a day as directed it should work for you.  I am an artist and use my hands a lot.  My goal isn&#x27;t to grow claws, but to have healthy looking nails that don&#x27;t catch on everything.  I don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photo, and this is my right hand I photographed, but you&#x27;ll get the idea.  My nails look healthy and groomed and the length works well for my lifestyle.  Never in a million years would I have thought it was possible to have healthy looking nails.  Well I tried to add a photo of my nails but for this review site has not allowed me to upload a photo.  You&#x27;ll have to take my word for it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for me. I did, however, notice that although my nails did not grow longer, they did not chip and split as much. I would have given this product at least 3 starts for that fact, except that the bottle was half empty when I received it. I did not get the promised .45 oz.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I decided to try this product I have been a nail biter for several years and recently stopped so I bought this product its 7 dys nw and no result the Miracle growth in the gold bottle worked better in 5dys my nails were longer with that product I guess everyone is different.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work!!! I&#x27;ve been trying for week now, but i got nothing!! i followed the instruction, but my nails still the same</li>
    <li> The Sally Hansen Nail Growth Activator is the only product that works.  I&#x27;ve tried many others - but this product really does work.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it faithfully, but when i had received it, it came in a nice plastic cosmetic bag with a free box of tiny emergency emery boards. So although I can&#x27;t review the product itself, I did have a great experience when it came to delivery.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HELPS KEEP MY NAILS STRONGER AND PREVENTS CHIPPING.  IT IS NOT A NAIL POLISH SO DOES NOT HAVE THAT NASTY SMELL.</li>
    <li> I bought this only 4 days before it was delivered! I was so excited when it came, because i really do want the best for my nails! I apply it 2-3 times a day, and rub it in! It works great at night... After literally 3 days my nails have grown significantly and are much stronger!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Nails grow so fast. I like that it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34;. Your nails absorbs it. Have always bit my nails, but once I decided to grow them, this product made noticeable grow so it was easier not to bite because I could see progress!</li>
    <li> I had a very bad nail biting habit until I decided to use this product. After a few days my nails had grown and were significantly stronger. I think this product works very well and that others with weak, bitten nails should use it, too.</li>
    <li> I got it the other day. First and foremost, when I opened the package the bottle was cracked and leaking some. It messed up the label some. I tried it and It didn&#x27;t work for my nails. It actually made one of my nails break. It didn&#x27;t make my nails grow at all. What a waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t doing what I&#x27;d hoped for.  Although my nails do seem a tiny bit stronger and less prone to breakage, I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no growth at all.  None.  In fact, my nails seem to grow much faster when I just wear normal nail polish, not this stuff.  On the plus side, packaging was good and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Out of all the nail growth products, I really like this the best.  It feels good and like it&#x27;s working (a cooling feeling).  Also, after I use it, my nails look better and \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot;.  And they do grow.  The other nail growth stuff works but it&#x27;s too thick and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the nail as much.</li>
    <li> Have used this before and it really helps my mails which split into two layers and peel apart. It seems to have disappeared from the shops.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the speed and efficiency in getting this product.</li>
    <li> I have very brittle nails so I use this with the combination of Biotin supplements. I can feel my nails are growing way faster than before, but my ails still break easily though, maybe not like before but it still not as strong as I had hope.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. Simply does not work. My nails chrip everywhere-no just the tip. Chips the polish multiple times and sporadic sites where polish chips.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  I have nails that are very brittle and peel and break easily.  I use this on them as often as I can and it really helps the peeling.  This isn&#x27;t a regular top coat.  You don&#x27;t have to remove this after a few days, you just put it on and it soaks into your nail.</li>
    <li> I did not believe that my nails were going to grow this fast. I have been wearing this product for only one week. I put it on my nails right when I am ready to walk out the door, and when I am ready to go to sleep. I am amazed to see how fast my nails have grown since.</li>
    <li> I bought it and it&#x27;s great perfect!!</li>
    <li> These magic fixes are the same as those amazing fat pills. I used it, nothing happened, so I put it in my nail polish drawer.</li>
    <li> This item is hard to find in stores.  I could only find it online.  This is the only product that I have ever used that actually makes my nails grow longer more quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time growing their nails out at least long enough to put polish on.  I hope Sally Hansen does not quit making this product beings it seem hard to locate.</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world for nails,  splitting, brittle, dry, cracking, etc.,  My nails were awful,  really hard to get them to grow more than 1/8&amp;#34; without getting little splits in the ends and snagging or ripping the very end off.  I just glob this stuff on my nails, all over, under the tip and around the cuticle.  After using this for a few weeks, I noticed my nails were getting long and they were hard, too, no more splitting, etc.  I have been using this for at least 10 years and love it. THIS IS NOT A POLISH OR LAQUER, BUT A CONDITIONER that really works.</li>
    <li> really helps my nails grow</li>
    <li> So, I stubbed my big toenail and half of the nail came off. Gross, I know, but I definitely freaked out as I have heard stories about people losing their toenails and fingernails completely. Since I did not want that to happen to me, I desperately searched for a solution to fully grow my toe nail back.   I came across this and decided to give it a try. When I received this product in the mail, it DID look like it was a return product as the front sticker was coming off and there was a piece of lint/hair stuck on it (for that, it loses a star). Oh well, like I said I was desperate. I applied the polish onto my toenail a couple times a day and I think within 2 weeks I had my toenail back! *WHEW*  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> After I started using this product all of my nails broke. I was really upset with this product Instead of helping my nails grow it broke them.</li>
    <li> I love this product but am finding a very hard time locating a retailer that still carries it.</li>
    <li> 5 star because I looked for this product for over a year.  one day i thought to look it up and there it was.  My order arrived promptly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> It been just a week and i can see the difference. my nails are more longer and im just using this so i guess it worked</li>
    <li> I like all types of Sally Hansen&#x27;s treatments - be it nails or lips - they are all good and working. This particular product works as well - my nails grow faster than growing naturally.</li>
