<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As someone that loves using skincare products to keep my skin looking healthy and young I was super excited to receive this Derma-nu Firming Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the mail!! After testing this product out for myself I have to say I really do love how this product made my skin look and feel after using it!! This Serum is guaranteed to firm &amp; tone your skin leaving it healthy and looking great!! This Hyaluronic Acid serum is also proven to reduce fine lines and wrinkles from your skin!! This serum has many amazing benefits for your skin and it will definitely firm and hydrate your skin. Hyaluronic acid holds up to 1000 times its weight in water so it effectively plumps the skin!! This Derma-nu Serum is infused with vitamin c + vitamin e and green tea extract as well, these are all known for there anti aging benefits!! This serum activates collagen production and penetrates deeply so your skin will have a fresh, younger, firmer and brighter complexion!! This serum is also paraben free, non comedogenic and organic!! This Derma-nu serum is definitely all around a great serum and I definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Not really seeing the results claimed!</li>
    <li> I just love the firming serum. But somehow Amazon messed up the label and covered it with an ugly bar code right over the Name on the label.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. Very disappointed.  It&#x27;s like they put water in a bottle and put fancy words on the label. I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I got a dark red rash in my neck..had to quit using it.</li>
    <li> This will b my second review of this product after several weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;Definitely see smoother skin....soooo&lt;br /&gt;Soft to the touch!&lt;br /&gt;Glow to face is beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Also love the way it absorbs quickly into the skin&lt;br /&gt;Definite keeper</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about the collection of products I received from Derma-Nu. They came highly recommended by a friend so I had to try them and I am very glad I did. Don&#x27;t let the simple packaging fool you. These products are packed with wonderful ingredients which my sensitive, dry skin loved and the light natural smell is very pleasing. You definitely want to buy the complete set. Your skin will feel firmer, moisturized and pampered, like you just had a spa treatment. So pleased with all 5 of these products! - (I will leave the same review for all the products with the specific product at the top)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum is amazing! My skin felt firm and toned the very 1st time I used it. After about 2 weeks I can really see a difference in my fina lines and my face has a nice glow from the Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Moisturizing Skin Cream is super rich &amp; emollient! It is a delicious tub of yummy moisture that lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Regenerating Moisturizing Skin Cream is just wonderful! My dry face loves it! I love it as a night cream - my face still feels hydrated in the morning. After 1 week I noticed a more evenness in skin tone, moisture and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Activating Eye Gel is so great! I love that it comes in a gel form because it is so soothing. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all. As soon as I put it on the eye area looks firmer and my little lines seem to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Body Scrub is heavenly! I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the spa after I use it. It smells wonderful and is so versatile. I use it on my face, hands and body. My skin feels so smooth and pampered after using it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum. I have tried expensive creams and serums before but this is the most effective I have used.  It works great around my eyes too.  You can see a difference in just one use.  A friend bought some and she likes it too!  I will reorder when I run out.  It arrived quickly too!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Love the tightening effects it has on my face, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have pale sensitive skin, and have to be very careful in selecting skin care products. Derma-nu serum works for me. Really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I do not have wrinkles yet, but I also do not want them! I figured it would be easier to prevent wrinkles than to get rid of them. I was given Derma-nu Firming Serum to quality test and give my honest opinion of it. The first time I used it I immediately noticed how refreshing it feels on your face. It kind of has a nice cooling effect. The gel is lightweight and does not leave your face feeling greasy or sticky. It tightens your pores without making you face feel too tight to move. It absorbs quickly. I applied it before applying make up and my make up went on smoothly over it. After using it for a week the biggest improvement I noticed was under my eyes. The dark circles under my eyes and several dark spots are now visually lighter. I definitely recommend giving this a try. There is a 100% satisfaction guarantee so you have nothing to lose except a couple wrinkles and some dark spots which yo probably didn&#x27;t want anyway.</li>
    <li> i have used this now for about a week, and i do see s difference around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;i am very pleased with this product and the amazing price i was able to get this for.</li>
    <li> Light weight and does seem to firm. Good for sensitive skin. Would recommend</li>
    <li> I will definitely be purchases more of this product</li>
    <li> This is by far the best firming solution I have every used.  I was a bit unsure as I first purchased at an Arts and Crafts Show but the Seller was so friendly and allowed me to use the product on site.  I felt it working right there! I purchased a set deal that included the eye gel, firming serum, aloe cream, facial moisturizer, and dead sea scrub.  I see a huge difference in the lines on my forehead and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.  The difference in the before and after is unbelievable. I use it in combination with the product line&#x27;s  dead sea scrub, which is unbelievable in itself, and I believe it is what has transformed my skin.  Unfortunately, too much sun and too little sunscreen on my chest has left me with premature aging lines.  After many, many product purchases, this is what has really made the difference.  If you want to transform your skin, buy this combination.</li>
    <li> Remarkable and wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says ..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, I will continue to use it :)</li>
    <li> It gives my neck skin definitely a slight tightening feel after application.There are no heavy fragrances and it works  very well with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and if the results continue will definitely order again.  There&#x27;s no sticky residue left on the face, like alot of serums.  It definitely seems to tighten, firm and plump my skin.!</li>
    <li> I have not seen any inprovement. In other words not the miracle. I will continue to use but will not reorder</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister. She says it makes her look younger. Her boyfriend seems to agree!</li>
    <li> I am in my upper 30s and I have had dry and what feel is aging skin for a few years. I have tried alot of firming serum type products this one is so worth the money! Smoothed thelines and reduced puffiness. Let me tell you one of them I used I put on and then put my make up on and you could see when I put the lotion under my eyes after I put makeup on. It was frustrating. This serum is awesome. Smooth my lines, and soaks into the skin wonderfully. I have a drawer full of half empty bottles this one will be used and repurchased at any time. This was truly wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am very happy to be able to get this product with a good discount. Forming serum is very good clinical formulation for anti aging.When I apply it in my face I feel like is pulling my face and it makes it look smooth and shiny. I can&#x27;t live without my makeup so I just apply it after my make up and I love it. And is really good for your skin too because it has vitamin C and green tea.This is a Good product, get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and it works great. The only issue is the size of the bottle V the amount recommended that is used. Increase the bottle size and charge a little more the product will still sell only because it works.</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you! But first, I wanted to point out that this has an identical ingredient list to another serum I just tested, Body Merry&#x27;s Hyaluronic Dew Serum. They are virtually the same product in different packaging (I prefer the packaging of this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Witch hazel is the dominant fragrance. No fragrance when dry.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Like thick water. Very refreshing and cooling.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Smooth and soft. No film.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Would be a good toner for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No. Also, vegan.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Nice looking 1.25oz airless pump, which makes it easy to dispense exactly how much you want.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* None.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* This is really more of a thickened toner than a serum in my opinion. Contains little in the way of active ingredients; hyaluronic acid, a little vitamin C, geranium essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very pleasant serum to put on your face, and leaves a nice soft feeling. It’s like a thick version of a good toner. It’s not going to do much long-term for your skin or have any immediate cosmetic results, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.ive no incentives or rewards for doing so.

    <li> I really like the way this applies to my skin.  It feels so good after I put it on.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product through a terrific promotion.  The product arrived quickly and I began to use it at once.  With first use my skin appeared and felt firmer.  Friends commented that I looked great and &amp;#34;something is different&amp;#34; .  This is a product I will continue to purchase and use!</li>
    <li> I have not used this very much. I like it because it is not oily. Leaves your skin soft. I did not get it the first time. But the seller gave me a bottle and a skin moisture too. Good service. Hope to use it more.</li>
    <li> another great product from Derma-nu. My skin feels great when I apply this serum , I feel my skin is more plumped and it has a radiant glow. it is absorbed quickly with no stickiness and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I dont write many reviews and I don&#x27;t think I have ever reviewed a beauty product before. I have been using different beauty products on my face since I have been fourteen and I&#x27;m really impressed with this serum so far. I don&#x27;t have alot of lines or wrinkles to begin with but the expression lines on my forhead are definitely less noticeable and my poors are tighter. I have been using this serum in conjunction with a Derma roller and I think this has really helped the product absorption.  The price is great do as long as it stays affordable ill be buying it.</li>
    <li> Amazing products . They really work and have helped even my skin tone and produce a genuine improvement in lines and texture too.. Love it</li>
    <li> no miracle here either.probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the end of April 2015.  I noticed my sagging jaw line firm up a bit and overall health of face improve.  My friend said she has also noticed a difference in my appearance so she ordered it, likes its effects and is ready to try the other products as well.  I use the eye serum and love that too. I especially love that everything is organic.  I used expensive over the counter products for years that are likely full of chemicals  so this is a welcoming change because it seems to be working.  I already placed my 2nd order and I&#x27;m not finished with my first yet. Give it a try and be patient.</li>
    <li> husband noticed a change in my face within days of using this product... He said to order a second bottle because he loved the results he saw on my face.  the changes are noticeable.  the feeling on your face is priceless</li>
    <li> I was given  the opportunity  to try this product  for discount  in exchange  of a my honest opinion.  I  was happy to try this product  because it is organic (label states  72% only). This product  is okay...not great , in my opinion . I would say I honestly  did not noticed any change /difference  on my skin. It  was a little too  watery for me , its a clear serum , no  scent.  The serum did feel somewhat refreshing on my skin, but  with overtime use  you can&#x27;t seem to tell anymore. This also made  my skin  bit sticky when not dried. It did leave it soft once it dried 100%. My overall  experience  With this product is  I would not buy, due quality  and results.  I bought and tried other products that do seem to work, this one was not  for me.  ....I am thankful  for the opportunity  to try this - i just did not see any difference and maybe its a product that needs to be used  on continuous  basis for real results.</li>
    <li> Results were just ok AND PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE PRICEY</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this</li>
    <li> great product does what is advertised</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but it does seem to&lt;br /&gt;Minimize the lines on my forehead</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to see results the first morning. My skin was clear taught, and soft.  I am eager to try it additional days and nights it will be exciting to see what more it might do for me</li>
    <li> Wow!!! You can feel this stuff working right a way! It actually does make your face feel tighter and brightens it as well! I will be checking back in with this review in a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> This facial serum is amazing it tightens and get rid of fine line.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a small bottle and goes fast that being said, this goes on smoothly. it doesn&#x27;t absorb right away but it&#x27;s ok. i did not see any great change but thats what i found to be true about all these type skin improvement things. so, goes on nice, no smell, didn&#x27;t cause blemishes and a great price.</li>
    <li> Not exactly as demonstrated but ok</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference.  I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have bought very similar, but much more expensive products in the past and this works as well as the most expensive I have tried at a fraction of the price.  Smooth&#x27;s out skin leaving it soft and well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend, I will be buying another bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now. I absolutely love it! I have noticed a difference in my skin in the areas I use it most (neck, forehead, laugh lines). Overall improvement with fine lines in general. It is very soothing on my skin after being out in the sun, too. I am making this  a part of my permanent skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Very effective to my sensitive skin thats why i like it. The smell is good and surprisingly its not sticky.</li>
    <li> mabe it takes more time</li>
    <li> This stuff ROCKS. Makes my face feel awesome :) I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Having used hyaluronic acid serums in the past I was thrilled to have the opportunity to review this product. This serum compares favorably to the product I spent three times as much for at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I love that this product was not tested on animals. The serum absorbs quickly into the skin, not adding extra time to my morning and night beauty routine. Daily, I use it under my bb.cream and at night I use it under my night cream, and so far, I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Received discount to try. I was very skeptical. I have very dry skin and nothing ever works. However my skin is much more soft and supple than before. My kids have even noticed a difference in my face. I will be using this all the time.</li>
    <li> Like the name says this is a miracle cream. My face is hydrated and my wriinkles have started to vanish I love it I will always have at least one in stock. I did receive this one to review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily about a week , not noticing any differences yet.  I haven&#x27;t given up hope but starting to think the 5 star ratings were from paid testers. Fingers crossed!!</li>
    <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is great. I could see the results after the first use. It reduces the appearance of the fine lines/deep wrinkles and is drawn into the skin immediately.  It feels great on and the results are amazing.  Love this Serum.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> Working wonders on my skin especially under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used other creams and stuff for my skin and I have to say Derma-nu products are by far my favorite line of product to use.  After the first use of Hyaluronic Acid Serum, my face felt so much smoother and healthier.  I have had a friend try to get me to buy some pretty expensive facial creams for over $50.  With my financial situation, there was no way I could ever afford to purchase that stuff.  I then saw this Hyaluronic Acid Serum being offered at a great price and needed to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did not let her talk me into purchasing that expensive stuff, because this stuff works amazingly.  She even noticed how much better my skin looked after a week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue after it is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> My skin (and wrinkles) never looked this good.</li>
    <li> No difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Works amazing! I&#x27;m 40 years old and have been using this morning and night for a month. Had a lot of comments that I don&#x27;t look forty, my little secret!</li>
    <li> This is my second review on this product. In my first review I said I liked it a lot and would most likely order more if I could get it for a decent price again.  Well the offer for 20% off your products made me want to order the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Eye Serum, both again through Amazon. I&#x27;m liking it even more as I continue to use it. I may have a question or two in the near future and I like that you offer to help with any questions I might have.</li>
    <li> I use this mostly around my eye. I feel like some of the fine wrinkles are gone, the skin is smoother and less puffy, just a little younger looking overall. Just bought a second bottle!</li>
    <li> One of the best ant-aging products I have used in recent memory.Noticed smoother feel to skin almost immediately! Visibly firmer within 2 days! Lightweight serum for all skin types. Definitely repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I really love my Derma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies. I use it 2 times a day, once in the morning before i apply make up and once at night after i wash my face for bed. I use toner as directed and then apply this firming serum. I love that it contains vitamin c as well as green tea and its cruelty free &amp;#60;3 i have an issue with some products irritating my skin or leaving it dry but Derma-nu does not do that. I dont have to worry about it leaving my skin itchy or red. Also it has no scent. Some creams and serums r scented forcing u to smell them all day. Derma-nu is thick and clear and rubs on smooth leaving your face feeling silky and smooth. Its also made in the USA :) I use it regularly to prevent crows feet and fine lines.</li>
    <li> Loved that this product came with an email that explained exactly how you should use this product to get the maximum benefits from it ! I did however receive this on a promotional off so I got a hell of a deal ! I am excited to see what&#x27;s in store for me with the product I am using as directed but have only been applying for few days so I&#x27;m not sure about the effects yet .....</li>
    <li> I could see a difference after a week once in morning and once at night I sent for more also am trying moisture cream also</li>
    <li> Very light texture, no perfume, no sticky feeling after application</li>
    <li> The instructions are simple add two drops and and water, the pump on the bottle is really nice. 2 pumps is all it takes for your face and neck. Leaves a nice smell of Green Tea. It&#x27;s like having botox to your skin. I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a product that he instructions are simple add two drops and and water, the pump on the bottle is really nice. Just 2 pumps is all it takes for your face and neck. Leaves a nice smell of lavender. It&#x27;s like having botox to your skin. I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a product that leaves your skin smooth &amp; soft, This is my opinion after testing this product.I was selected to try this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face and Skin with Vitamin A-C-D &amp; E- Oil, Green tea.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and have noticed some changes in the way my face feels&lt;br /&gt;real smooth and the crows feet have gone so far I will keep using it,</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t just &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; a product that sounds good as I will likely have a reaction that lasts weeks. I took a chance based on the reviews. I am beyond thrilled that I did. My skin loves this serum and I saw and felt results within a few days! I have ordered all the other products in the line with similar results. Wishing they had a cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the results. Starting seeing a difference within a week.</li>
    <li> The scent and texture were nice, but I used it regularly for as long as one bottle lasted and saw no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This serum is so effective to remove wrinkles, fine lines and spots.  It is reasonably priced compared to other facial serums.  I love this product so very much.</li>
    <li> It makes the face very dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My face feels firmer and looks younger!</li>
    <li> good one....I enjoy this product</li>
    <li> There are so many products for anti-aging/facial care out there to pick &amp; choose from, with so many claims &amp; promises...but so many dont follow through &amp; seem to only be an option for those on a &amp;#34;Hollywood star&amp;#34; budget lol. How do you choose or know what is worth our time &amp; money (which most of us dont live on a super star budget!)? Believe me, I am hesitant to invest much if any at all on skin-care products &amp; I wanted to be a bit detailed with this product bc it is one of my hardest choices when it comes to shopping &amp; hope to help people with the hassle of researching &amp; deciding or wasting time/money! First, it is affordable for everyone from all walks of life &amp; with the same (or probably more than the high end priced products for the famous beauties!). Its 72% organic &amp; no worries about harmful ingredients. Then what reeled me in &amp; got me hooked (actually purchasing) was the 100% satisfaction guarantee! If a brand/company has much to hide or try hyping up a crappy product they will not make that kind of promise! They are confident in the satisfactory of their products obviously! After a few days I could already see the dark circles under my eyes lighter &amp; over all brighter firm complexion...&amp; no sticky residue or build up! I hope this helps some of you with narrowing down so many options &amp; save you time in something legit &amp; a company with a promise!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter here in Indiana and my skin has become extremely dry.  I love to try various serums, creams and lotions so I was excited when I was given the chance to purchase this Hyaluronic Acid Serum at a special price to test for quality.  There are several things I like about it.  First of all, it&#x27;s a pump dispenser.  I prefer that over jars with screw on lids.  The serum is clear and goes on smoothly and is absorbed easily into my skin.  It leaves my skin soft and almost silky feeling.  It is not greasy at all and you can feel a tightening of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this this serum twice a day, once in the morning and again at night after cleansing  and  toning my face.  It works very well under my makeup.  There is no burning, stinging, or tingling sensations.  This product is made in the USA, is organic and paraben free which makes it even better in my book.  Overall, I am very please with how this serum makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> Noticing results after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I had been reading where a good combo of ingredients for younger firmer skin was hyaluronic acid in combination with vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;This product is both of those with green tea as well.  It is aloe vera gel based.  The consistancy is very spreadable.  It absorbs readily with a short dry time.  Recommended use is 2x a day morning &amp; evening after washing &amp; drying your face &amp; to follow up with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this on my late 40&#x60;s skin &amp; also used the Derma-nu Eye Gel to complete the deal.  I am seeing some firming of skin around my mouth &amp; nose area.  No adverse reactions for me from the serum...yay!&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was excellent and I received a follow up email with tips for use &amp; any questions I may have.</li>
    <li> Not noticing the significant changes as advertised.</li>
    <li> Using along with eye serum from Derma-nu. So happy with these products.  Been using together for about a month and can really see a difference in my skin texture and wrinkles!!!  Yay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this product. It does seem to help a moisturizer penetrate. My skin feels more supple and smile lines less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Ok I am 27 years old but I am determined to stay looking young!! On that note, I have tried many creams, pills, you name it I try it. When I was given the opportunity to try the Hyaluronice Acid Serum at an insane price I was so excited because it is a firming serum and I was having a few problems around my eyes. The tiny little wrinkles I had would cause my eyeshadow to clump up in the corners and I hated that. So when I got the Hyaluronic Acid Serum I immediately started applying it to my problem areas. I can honestly tell you that my make up is staying on and is staying smooth. My little wrinkles have started to diminish so quickly. I am so happy that I found a product that works! Thank you Derma-nu!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and and a little bit goes a long way. Absorbs fast. Non greasy. Skin feel and looks more toned since using it.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face and neck and upper chest.</li>
    <li> I started using this serum because it is approved by &amp;#34;Good Housekeeping&amp;#34; and it is reasonably priced.  They do not automatically keep sending you products like so many companies do online.  When you put the serum on, it does feel like it tightens your skin somewhat.  I believe, it is helping my skin on my face, throat and chest.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.Natural ingredients promote healthy skin and deliver effective anti-aging results.I use this this serum twice a day, once in the morning and again at night after cleansing and toning my face. It works very well under my makeup.The puffiness on my face has diminished, and my skin feels so soft.I will recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> this serum is alright didn&#x27;t feel any firming qualities or anything,, just felt like an expensive moisutizer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I see no difference in my skin</li>
    <li> it tightens skin, like it</li>
    <li> This works! My skin already looks better. Firmer and pores are smaller.</li>
    <li> I think the time allotted to give a review is minimal, so I have to rate this a 4.  It does leave your skin feeling smooth and I&#x27;m sure if you keep up with it daily you could see end results, with a busy schedule it was pretty hard to keep up with this specific item.</li>
    <li> Have not really seen any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> My  face got completely red &amp; all swollen for 3 days after I stopped using it.  Now that I stopped using it I am fine.  what do I do with the 2 bottles of Serum???     This company stands behind their product.  I was allergic to it as I am a lot of products &amp; they immediately refunded me plus postage.  great company &amp; I would recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 64 yr old women who has always taken care of her skin. The women who does my facials has always said  I have beautiful skin. I have been using this product for about a month now. I have noticed a few new fine lines that were bothering me. I was hoping that the Derma-nu Miracle Skin Firming Serum might do the trick. Well no miracle here!!  It&#x27;s a nice serum but didn&#x27;t do any better job than the  products I had been using, some of which can be purchased at any of the large drug store. Disappointing....didn&#x27;t do what it said it would.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. Nice professional looking label. Another great product from Derma-nu. While I have used so many lotions and creams on my face, I was just not getting the look I wanted. You can glow, but when you start to see &amp;#34;chicken&amp;#34; neck, you need more. Fist of all this is another organic product and made right here in the US. It&#x27;s affordable, yet comes with a money back guarantee. I have been using this for about 5 days but I did notice an improvement in that &amp;#34;chicken&amp;#34; neck almost immediately. One pump for my face and one for my neck and upper chest does the trick After about three days my skin appears softer and I see an overall fresher look. The hyaluronic acid is nice touch, seems to effectively plump and hydrate my face and neck nicely.  have been using this in conjunction with other Derma-nu products and couldn&#x27;t be happier. In just a short time I , my skin is  noticeably softer, brighter and firmer. Will continue this daily regime, while I don&#x27;t expect miracles I am happy with the results so far. I was offered this product at a reduced cost for my unbiased opinion. Will continue to use Derma-nu and will be looking for more of this line. There was a nice coupon enclosed with this, I expect to use it soon.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product! So smooth and easy to apply! Left myself very soft. Almost didn&#x27;t use moisturizer over it! I am so happy I found this product on amazon review trader and very happy at the discounted price I paid!</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a change yet, but like the feel of the product.</li>
    <li> I love it. after got a high discount code, I bought it. it is good for my mother. My mom likes it. she like the feel that with this product on her face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any differance</li>
    <li> Completely Satisfied. I can feel the firmness in my face and neck as soon as I apply the Firming Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry..</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  You notice the difference right way.  Dry skin was gone in a day!  Smoothed out the lines as well. I&#x27;d recommend this highly.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn Williams</li>
    <li> Great product! 100% recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin feels tighter,  but not overly dry. I have noticed a reduction in blemishes and lightening of hyper pigmentation under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is found naturally in the human body, which assists to lubricate and cushion joints and is a major player and component and of skin tissue and connective tissue structure. According to studies, the skin contains almost 50% of the hyaluronic acid found throughout the body.&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serums help heal and sooth inflammation and most importantly for beauty seekers - it prevents fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is looking tighter as result of using Hyaluronic acid products; I look forward to seeing results in about 30 days of use, per the advice of this products manufacturer. So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a promotional sample of this product and this is my knowledge, experience and opinion of using it so far.</li>
    <li> Received this item in exchanged for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Its kind of sticky until it dries but once it does, its very light weight.</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible difference with fine lines or dark spots, this is a good moisturizer, so it can&#x27;t hurt!  Company is extremely professional too.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful but the company is not.  I have a dispute in with both Amazon and my credit card company to settle this issue but the product is even better than I had hoped for.  I was just getting ready to re-order the gel when they overcharged me so I will have to wait and see the outcome.  Anyone can make a mistake and now let&#x27;s see how and when they correct it.</li>
    <li> I got these for review.I love this firming serum.I can already tell a major difference in my skin.I liked that it&#x27;s 72% organic!!! I love organic products..This is a nice size bottle and It will last for a while. I&#x27;m going to get my sister to buy a bottle because it&#x27;s a great price and she is always worried about Aging fast and this will slow down that process..Pick you up some today at such a great price..Like I said I love mine!!! I received this at little or no cost to me to provide my honest opinion and this is exactly what I have done</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about this product! It has vitamin A, vitamin C and green tea?  What else needs to be said? I applied This on half my face. and my current product on the other side... NO comparison! in 2 days  the lines were starting to disappear! I am 48 years old and happy I was offered this product to review, it is helping me feel younger!</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my eye skin feel. Works great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Honestly, I love the way my face feels with this stuff!</li>
    <li> Feels really good on my skin.Light gel with great coverage, feels like a very expensive, luxurious facial treatment! I could feel the tightening effect within minutes. I will be be keeping this on my 50 yo wrinkles! LOL. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE! I am in my late 30&#x27;s, and anti-aging is becoming a bit of a frenzied affair. I have to say, I notice a refinement to my skin. I don&#x27;t have any negative reactions to the ingredients, so it appears to be safe for sensitive skin. I also have a touch of eczema in patches on my face, this made the scaliness and redness fade to where I almost don&#x27;t notice it. You get a good amount of product for the money. All in all, A+!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It is light, non-sticky and smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> This is gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin like mines and it actually reduce my inflammation and improved the circulation and gave my skin a youthful healthy glow! By drawing moisture into my skin, it is in a category of it&#x27;s own, compared to lotions and creams that simply sit on the surface of the skin and not having the ability to be absorbed like this Hyaluronic acid serum...this is so worth the money and when this runs out I definitely will buy more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum every day for the past two weeks and so far I really enjoy it. I was really excited to receive this to test and review. I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines around my lips and eyes have gone away a bit and have become a lot less noticeable. My skin truly looks and feels much more alive. I have really dry skin and this has really moisturized it. My skin has a healthy glow now. I deal with acne and have noticed I haven&#x27;t gotten as many breakouts since I started using this serum by Derma-nu! This is a great serum with no alcohol, parabens, or any other harmful ingredients. I take my skin care very seriously and am very happy with my results from this serum.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and my skin feels great, clean, tight and plumped up. I use it day and night under my moisturizer and night cream. Sometimes I use it alone. I&#x27;m very happy! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have somewhat oily skin and need to be careful of creams as they cause me to break out.  This serum soaks right in and feels great.  I have been using it on my face and around my eyes and notice improvement in fine lines.  I just ordered the eye serum since I am so pleased with the firming serum.  I will admit that I was skeptical before I tried this and am pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> As I have written before, Derma-nu products are the most effective skin products that I have ever used.  I have always had extremely sensitive facial skin.  Severe acne when I was a child, direct sun exposure makes my face , along with my entire body burn horribly causing discoloration, and my face being more sensitive looks like a dry, peeling mess.  I was extemely fortunate when I was a child to have an Aunt who was a pharmaist give me a product that did not leave me with horrid pock marks.  Through the years I have spent a great amount of money purchasing facial products that advertize, usually reporting their product will make your face look younger, firmer, even skin tone, diminish wrinkles, blah,blah,blah.  The manner that Derma-nu presented all of their products they sell on Amazon caught my attention, not to mention the amazing price, so I told myself,&amp;#34;why not try some of them.&amp;#34;  AMAZING RESULTS!  The firming serum is exceptional!  I use it along with their anti-aging facial cream, and definitely within 3-4 weeks, friends were consistantly asking me what facial products I was using due to the great firmness, skin tone, diminiishing wrinkles, I could go on and on.  I am now 65 years old, and am totally greateful that I have experienced Derma-nu.  I feel so terrific about my appearance.  Compliments are always inspiring to me.  Derma-nu will always belong in my bathroom to keep my face undamaged.</li>
    <li> Great product and perfect addition to my daily routine</li>
    <li> This product gives immediate results. Literally I apply it and my wrinkles are smoothed out 2 minutes later. Will be reordering this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Love that the scent is very gentle! Not a fan of perfumes. Great seller! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> love this product! Skin feels great!</li>
    <li> It is a nice product but the bottle finished too fast. Maybe the container should be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Not seeing much of a difference.....actually..None...</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t really  seen any results.</li>
    <li> What a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients promote healthy skin and deliver effective anti-aging results. Love the fresh, light, natural scent:)&lt;br /&gt;MC</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! Love feeling my face after I use it. I feel so radiant.</li>
    <li> It was thin and easy apply but after over two weeks I could not see a change in my face. No facelift. I have fine lines and it did not change them at all. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Not overnight but give it a week and you&#x27;ll be telling everyone you know! Thank you!</li>
    <li> It leaves a film on your face i dont  think it did much og&lt;br /&gt;f anything</li>
    <li> Not sure if I see any difference, but thanks for allowing me to review this.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and so far very happy with it</li>
    <li> Just received the product about a week ago. I can not report about long term improvements, but it easy to apply, fast absorbing, my skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I really, really like the Miracle Skin Remedies Firming Derma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies!  Excellent product that works so well to smooth away&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Im starting to get an extra line here and there.  So i wanted to give this a try. I liked that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I used it under my name up and it didn&#x27;t Leave my skin feeling heavy.  I&#x27;m  still using it.  To see how i look after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> When used as directed, you will feel a tightening sensation as it dries.  Makes skin look smooth and healthy, easy to use.  Follow with your favorite moisturizer for a smooth, dewy complexion.  I ordered this product as a promotion to review.  The full price is a good value, great product for a&lt;br /&gt;small investment.</li>
    <li> Really drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> I find this product makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Works well and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> i received this product at an promotional price to give my honest opinion..ive used this firming serum for a few days now and it seems to work a little but it does work..maybe i need to use more of it to get better results, but for the few days ive used it i can tell a little difference so i would recommend</li>
    <li> Truely amazing!! This serum makes your skin smooth and soft! Its very light absorve into skin very quickly!! Does smooth out dry skin! I would definitly buy this again!! i got this product at discount price to review it! But opinion is my own</li>
    <li> I just turned 30 back in September.  I&#x27;ve always been told that your never too young to start taking steps to prevent ageing.  Turning 30 really woke me up to beginning to take those anti-ageing steps. I was chosen to try this product and give my honest and unbiased opinion and I was super excited. I love organic products for my skin and this being 72% organic was just right up my alley. So my package arrived very nicely wrapped in bubble wrap. It also arrived very quickly. I decided that since it was best to apply once a day under make-up, that I would just work it into my morning routine.  On the first day I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference. I really don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles yet... or so I thought!  My second day of using the Firming Serum I was shocked.  My skin looked absolutely amazing. My eyes looked better than they have in a long time. My make-up even looks smoother. I let my best friend try it out. She is 44. Needless to say after trying it once, she has already placed her order. It truthfully does work exceptionally well. I was truthfully skeptical for the price but not anymore.  My skin just looks rejuvenated,  revived, and refreshed. I am so glad that I ran into the opportunity with this product because it is now going to be a permanent part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I love this! I might actually be guilty of using it too much, if that&#x27;s possible! I put it on every morning and every night, hoping it will help firm up the under chin area. It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft. Cant wait to see how well it works after a few more weeks of using.  I also love the bottle design, its sleek and is a much welcome addition to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Taking care of my skin has always been a priority for me. When I noticed fine ones near my eyes, I wanted to stop that aging process as much as I possible. I found Derma-nu Hyaluronic Acid Serum and ordered it right away. Along with Derma-nu Anti Aging Cream, I discovered a new skin care routine that I do daily. First I apply the serum evenly on my face and neck, paying attention to my fine lines around my eyes and forehead. I let that dry and then apply the Anti Aging cream. The cream is thick and makes my skin feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just tell you that this combination has done wonders for my skin! My skin feels fresh, soft and firm. My husband has given me compliments on how naturally bright and well toned it looks! I will definitely be ordering Derma-nu products from now on Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I felt an immediate difference after the first use!  I&#x27;ve since added it to my nightly routine.  Although I do not have wrinkles yet, I do have problem areas that need extra special attention.  My forehead tends to be more dry than the rest of my face.  Derma-nu worked wonders on that problem area.  It seemed more elastic and hydrated but not greasy.  I love that this a high quality product with organic ingredients.  I had no reservations about trying this on my skin and was very excited to get to try and review this product.  I really like the results and recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wrinkles have started to fade, and The skin around my eyes is getting firmer and plumper. When I look at myself in the mirror, I am amazed with how much, clearer, brighter and rested my face looks! I love the ingredients, the formula and the fact that I have one of the best anti-aging gels on the market. It definatley firms as well as it advertises.</li>
    <li> Was able to try this stuff thanks to a coupon. I&#x27;m turning 30 this year and my facial beauty is becoming more important to me, so I&#x27;d like to do everything I can to slow down aging. This serum is pretty awesome. It came in a good size bottle and was easy to unwrap and dispense. The serum itself has a light consistency and isn&#x27;t too greasy, with a mild smell. I&#x27;ve been applying it after I was my face and before I put on my makeup. So far it&#x27;s been helping me appear more awake and fresh. I don&#x27;t seem to look as tired or have as noticeable bags. With longer use hopefully it will help with more areas on my face. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month. My skin feels less dehydrated. I have been asked how do I keep my skin looking younger and refresh. I told them about this product and ask them to try out for themselves. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have not been using very long, maybe 3 weeks or so... but I definitely see a difference.  Underneath my eyes are not as puffy and my face over all feels a bit firmer.  The fine lines around my eyes and mouth have also diminished.  I am a &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; believer that this is what I&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
    <li> I use the firming serum along with the eye gel.  Together they both work to soften and remove the lines around your eyes. The two go hand and hand to make your skin look softer, smoother  and  an actually glow.  You will enjoy using the serum and the gel  because in a short time you will see a big change in your complexion. I find that the hyaluronic acid is a must for skin care. I use it on my face after I cleanse and it sinks in immediately. I also use a few drops in my hair. I have blonde hair and it doesn&#x27;t really shine. After I use the  hyaluronic acid it shines like crazy.  These 2 products the Firming Serum with Hyaluronic acid and the eye gel are great for skin that is mature or maturing.  It is also great for any age to use on their eyes and hair to get a jump on Mother nature.  I highly recommend  both  of them as they are reasonably priced and arrived quickly. These are 2 products that I will keep on using. By the way I am 70 and look 40. Nice huh!!. You can do it too with these 2 products.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from under eye circles for pretty much my whole life. I am in my early 30’s and have started to notice some fine lines, wrinkles, and that my skin just doesn’t seem as plump to add to my under eye circles! I was super excited to be able to try this product at a promotional price in order to share my experience with this product with you! I love the fact that this derma-nu firming serum is organic, is not tested on animals and that it is made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;The feel of this product is amazing when it hits your skin! I love that it contains a Vitamin C and E mixture to give you a real anti-wrinkle and anti-dark circle effect! It has no odor and I have not had any harsh side effects from this product. It does exactly what I wanted it to do which is make the dark circles under my eyes go away, give my skin some firmness and reduce fine lines and wrinkles! This product seriously feels like you went to the doctor and got a face lift! It just has great properties to it. I promise you’ll love it! This product comes with a 100% product satisfaction guarantee so go ahead and try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old female and I have some skin issues. I had been looking for a product that I can use and not have a bad reaction to. This is an amazing product. For the people that don&#x27;t know what product to try for anti-aging. I would choose this product over anything else I have seen thus far. I give a rating of 5 because its just that awesome. It doesn&#x27;t give your face that heavy feeling. It doesn&#x27;t take long at all to see a difference in your skin! GREAT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  DIdn&#x27;t order this one, but was asked to leave a review.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight anti-aging staple product. Noticed a visible increased softness to skin with 24 hrs. Firming effect noticed after 2 days. Compatible for all skin types. No sensitivity issues at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mom, and she just loves it! She said it makes her skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> The area around my eyes already has firmed up and looks much better than&lt;br /&gt;before using this firming serum.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of this product goes a long way so it should last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I am reviewing this product for amztrader.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer. I have been using this two days now and for starters have not had any break outs or sensitivity and that is a miracle with my ultra sensitive skin. Being a licensed Cosmetologist I try many skin products for both my needs and daily use and promo products from vendors so I can recommend them to my clients and know how they preform.  This product is one I had not heard of before but after reading the reviews am glad i decided to give a go. Its very moisturizing and leaves my skin feels baby soft with a light natural glow. I tried it both under make-up and with out make up. While wearing make-up I did not notice any flaking like i often do with other moisturizers I also did not notice any slipping of my foundation as other moisturizes that claim to be oil free often cause. I have not noticed any firming results yet but did not expect to with only two days of use. I will keep you posted! But just the high day long moisture this product supplies would be enough for me to choose to re purchase it! I will be saving the link to this product on my facebook so Current clients can link to it if they are interested in picking this product up for there own use! I did receive this product at a reduced cost but this in no way any any impact on my review or willingness to share this product and my experiences with others!</li>
    <li> My face is tighter and fine lines have disappeared.</li>
    <li> I used it faithfully morning and evening, and I could not see any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is great professional product. My first impression was that the bottle looked really nice.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried the product I liked the way it felt cool and soothing on the skin. There is a light and pleasant natural fragrance from the ingredients in the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed right away that my face looked brighter and smoother once I started using it. I didn&#x27;t even know that my skin could look better as I am young and was not of the mind that I needed it specifically. I was always told that the time to start a skin routine was when you are younger and not wait till you need it to start using products and never put yourself in a position to NEED to rescue your skin because you let it get in such bad shape.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order fast and in good conditions and once I had received it the seller contacted me and was interested to know that I received it and was happy with the product itself. She&#x27;s very helpful, trustworthy and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good experience and I recommend this product to anyone looking to improve and firm up their skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I use this first and then the moisturizer. It leaves my skin looking radiant and ready for the cream. It feels great on the skin. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients, it&#x27;s all natural and it doesn&#x27;t have scent. It&#x27;s hard nowadays to find products without perfume. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I thought my skin was okay without using skin care product. But this Firming Serum gives me a more young and healthy skin tone, just after a week. This product was worth trying.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to use with my face moisturizer and I found this Hyaluronic Acid Serum made by Derma-nu Miracle Skin Treatment. It is supposed to compliment my moisturizer and help firm the skin. When I was offered to try this product for a great deal to share my honest opinion and experience, I ordered immediately. This Hyaluronic Acid Serum works instantly! As soon as it starts drying, I could feel my skin tightening and that is awesome! Usually it takes a while to see or feel results  but this serum works now! I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants instant results!</li>
    <li> I have used many firming serums, but this one is special. Whatever formula they use works. Of course, its not overnight but I like the look of my skin. It looks and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Havent used this much because I switched to something I like better.</li>
