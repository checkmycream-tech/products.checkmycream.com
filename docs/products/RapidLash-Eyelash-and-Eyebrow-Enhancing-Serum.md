      <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>How amazing..</li>
      <li>I could tell a difference after about 2 weeks, and after about 4 weeks my lashes were noticeably longer and to my surprise, had a nice swoop to them.</li>
      <li>Good luck :-)</li>
      <li>I could not beleive how fast my eyelashes enhanced, this product works great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as effective as Latisse, but for a fraction of the price, I speak for both of us when I say we&#x27;re sticking with this product.</li>
      <li>The price is more than fair considering everything else that is out there.  </li>
      <li>I always have a tube handy and apply nightly.</li>
      <li>It took about 6 weeks before I could  honestly see a change in my lashes.  </li>
      <li>but it got discontinued and that is actually is a good thing because this one is much better.</li>
      <li>I have never had this kind of irritation and honestly I think it is an infection.</li>
      <li>and I told her that her eyes looked just spectacular</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to give it about 2 weeks to see if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
      <li>It does not darken, however, and being blond, I would have liked that.  </li>
      <li>Before I used this product I could not see my lashes without mascara, now I can see them and they curl up quite nicely themselves without the need for mascara.</li>
      <li>Love love love it!!</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>it does really works very good...</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a couple of years with great success.  </li>
      <li>but honestly, I&#x27;ve been able to give my Dior brow pencil a bit of a break.</li>
      <li>I bought it because of the amazing reviews everywhere on the web, I even made sure I was applying it correctly by viewing tutorials, but</li>
      <li>I know how that sounds..too good to be true</li>
      <li>Prescription eyelash serums concern me because my eyes are very light</li>
      <li>I have been using Rapidlash about 3 weeks, and I love the results I see in my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I still love the results with mascara.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe it works, but my eyelashes are longer for sure.</li>
      <li>(OK prettier.</li>
      <li>The top lashes are thicker and longer.  </li>
      <li>Frowny face, for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I read many reviews on Rapidlash and figured I would give it a try-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After using for 7 days, I put on mascara and could see huge difference in length. Funny thing is that the left eyelash grew much faster than the right one. But no problem, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> I used it per directions on the back. I went through one tube and used it every single night. I did not see any results what so ever</li>
    <li> I have never had thick or long lashes and bought this as a Groupon deal.  It seems to be working and does not irritate the eyes at all.  I follow the directions and use every night on top lid only.  The top lashes are thicker and longer.  Can&#x27;t say darker because my lashes and eyebrows are black. I have noticed more length and thickness on my lower lashes, due to the fact that they were quite sparse to begin with. Started noticing a difference after about 4-6 weeks and I am now on month #2 and still on first tube.  So product does actually last pretty long.  Overall I am getting good results and would recommend RapidLash.  Going to buy from Amazon this time around.</li>
    <li> I researched lots of lash lengthening products before I purchased.  This product received good reviews.  After about two weeks of use, I started to notice my lashes lengthen.  My lashes are not any thicker, You can see them better because they are longer. I will continue to use Rapid Lash!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it worked. I&#x27;ll have to give it about 2 weeks to see if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows have become sparse over the years. . . .but, alas, RapidLash has rejuvenated the hairs and now my brows look much better!  I can even go without eyebrow makeup if in a hurry!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first since I was not seeing results after 4-6 weeks then all of a sudden BOOM!!! My lashed are definitely longer and fuller. I can even go without mascara or the need to curl them. Be patient and you&#x27;ll see fabulous results!!!.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for years and it grows your lashes thick and long. However, I will admit you need to keep using it regularly after your lashes grow back.</li>
    <li> Definitely works to grow lashes.  I have used Latisse but had problems with irritated eyelids and sores.  RapidLash grew the lashes without any side effects.  I also use it on my brows.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Took quite some time to notice a difference in lashes.  Irritates eyes if you get some of it in them. Lilash works much faster but costs more.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS HELPED MY EYBROWS AND MY EYE LASHES GROW!!! THE PRICE IS WORTH IT IT. I HAVE BOUGHT THIS BEFORE AT RETAIL STORES AND THEY SELL IT FOR $50, SO BELIEVE ME THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE PRICE ON AMAZON, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT REALLY DOES WORK!!! YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU CONTINUE USING IT!!!</li>
    <li> I had one eyelash much longer than others in 4-8 weeks, and rest of them seemed to catch up with it now.  My family thought that I got eyelash extension!</li>
    <li> I tried Rapid Lash three years ago. After about two weeks I noticed a difference in my lash length. It did not thicken my lashes, but it made them longer. You must continue to use Rapid Lash or your lashes will return to their original length within a couple of weeks as your lashes go through their normal growth cycle</li>
    <li> This may work for others...but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. I have continued to use it just hoping something will happen...but I&#x27;m really not impressed with this product</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and a referral from my sister in law I thought I would try it.  I have not had the results everyone else has and nor has a friend who purchased.  I will use it till the bottle is done but, probably will not purchase again.  I am primarily using on my eyebrows and just started lashes about 2 weeks ago.  I have done the brows for 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I used to have full eyebrows, but now that I&#x27;m in my 50s, not only have they thinned out, but they have gaps in some spots. Lilash worked wonders for my lashes, but Librow did not seem to work as well on my brows.  Decided to try RapidLash after reading reviews, and am very happy I did.  While I don&#x27;t think my brows will ever return to their former growth, RapidLash did have significant effect.  Longer, darker, thicker hair has grown in. While I still have some gaps, they are not as bad, and I can actually leave the house with no brow makeup on.  I can now use WunderBrow, which works like mascara (it needs hairs to cling to), in order to enhance my brows.  RapidLash also works well in maintaining my lashes, and I don&#x27;t experience any irritation. And last but certainly not least, can&#x27;t beat that price compared to Lilash and Librow. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this and worried about wasting money. However, after a few weeks of applying it I saw an amazing difference in my lashes, they were much thicker and longer. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year...off and on.  At first, I faithfully applied the serum every day for a couple of months.  There was a little irritation at first, some itchiness, but then it subsided and didn&#x27;t get that reaction anymore.  I got a little lazy, and worried a little about the long term use, so I stopped using it for a couple of months.  I decided to use Vaseline, as I read that that works also.  In the beginning, I noticed some change.  My eyelashes didn&#x27;t grow long, but they did get a little darker and thicker.  Again, I went back to applying the serum everyday, and noticed that my eyelashes did grow, not dramatically, got did get longer.  I&#x27;m blonde, and my coloring is light, including my lashes, and before the applications, my lashes were very sparse and stubby.  So...at this point, there was some growth, and lashes got a little darker and thicker.  Without makeup, it&#x27;s not that noticeable...but, when I apply mascara, I really see the difference.  I took off a star on the rating because of some irritation in the beginning.  Also, it didn&#x27;t work on my eyebrows, as the packaging said that it worked on eyebrows, too.  I still use Vaseline along with this product.  The Vaseline keeps the lashes conditioned.</li>
    <li> So far this has lengthened and thinned my lashes.  I don&#x27;t have anything good nor bad to say. I will wait to make a more informed judgement call.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times a couple of years ago and it worked.  I had longer, fuller lashes.  I stopped using it and decided to try it agin now.  I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula but I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have noticed no difference.  I&#x27;m quite disappointed.  I&#x27;ll give this a couple of more weeks and see if my lashes grow.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about two weeks.  I do see more length in my lashes and there does seem to be more volume to them.  It is especially noticeable when I apply mascara.  It is a lot less expensive than the prescription one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence on RapidLash but am ordering a second tube to give it a little more time.  I&#x27;ve seen huge changes to a girlfriend&#x27;s lashes.  Mine?  After one month, they are longer, but I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of thickening.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to see and am going for in this second order.</li>
    <li> Rapid lash works, that is really all it boils down to. I have uneven lashes on the corner of my right eye and it straightened them out so that they lay evenly now as well. I sometimes miss a day or two between applications and my lashes still look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a skeptic and a cheapskate and this is a product I can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
    <li> I apply this product on my eyelash line every night before I go to bed. I have not noticed a huge difference but definitely I have had a change.</li>
    <li> I have always had very long, lustrous lashes until I developed a thyroid condition.  My lashes began to thin out and become sparse.  This product is amazing and has given me my long eyelashes back again.  I can even go without mascara and not feel self conscious.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using rapid lash for over a month on my eyebrows and can see new hair growth.  Before rapid lash without eyebrow pencil you could not see my eyebrows they were so sparse, but now I can see them without any eyebrow pencil.  They are growing more hair constantly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year now . . . and I love the results.  I use it every night.  In the first couple of weeks that I started using it, I noticed a real difference in my eyelashes . . . longer and fuller.  I stopped using it this past summer for no particular reason.  Within about a month I noticed that my eyelashes were losing their fullness.  I ordered product from Amazon.com and have been using it ever since.  I have had comments on how beautiful my eyelashes are.  I hope this product never leaves the market.  For the price . . . it is priceless!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash Serum every evening for about 6 months.  My eyelashes are noticably fuller and more uniform.  The Eye Skin treatment also improved the area around my eyes. Two very useful products well worth the price. I love taking full advantage of today&#x27;s self-improvement technology.  I always find this product on Amazon.com at the best price, best product information and best customer service.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to lasting results (I&#x27;m still using my first bottle every night) but I have absolutely noticed huge results.  Not much in additional volume but the length is unreal.  I feel I have moderately sensitive skin around my eyes but I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I&#x27;m 66 years old and I have lashes like I had when I was 20. It works really well on eyebrows too.</li>
    <li> not as good as latisse and still caused red/ purple skin coloration where used regularly.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 3 weeks now and wow! My lashes have gotten longer and I see new growth coming in. Great product.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed this product was making my lashes grow a little within the first few weeks.  After almost 2 months of daily use, my eyelashes have definitely gotten longer.  I&#x27;m impressed.  For a $32 product, I expected this to be flop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will note that it makes eyelashes grow on the very side of your eyelid, like where they&#x27;re not normally, which can look strange.  I&#x27;m trying to be more careful about where I apply it.  Also, it won&#x27;t make your eyelashes super long and thick like falsies.  It will just enhance your normal ones a bit.  I&#x27;m definitely going to continue to use this product, but if it were more expensive I would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I have experienced NO irritation with this product and I wear contacts.</li>
    <li> the only down side to it is that if u stop using it your lashes will go back to normal. but i love it still keeps my lashes thick and healthy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now.  It does seem to work but it was 8 weeks before I noticed any change.  To be sure if it worked I only used it on one eye so that I could compare with the other eye and yes, that eye&#x27;s lashes did get longer, not a lot but definitely longer.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a few more months to see if the growth continues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and can see results. Although it took a little longer then expected from what I read, I will continue to use it for its inexpensive price compared to other products I&#x27;ve seen and for its effectiveness. Over all I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little somethimg more with their lashes.</li>
    <li> so back in May 2013 i had eyelash extensions done. even if you will have the patience to sit through 1.5 hours of beautician hovering over you, wiping up the tears, they absolutely suck.&lt;br /&gt;once the extensions fell out, they took my natural lashes with them. yeah, dont believe the stories that they &amp;#34;dont&amp;#34; - it is just a catch for you to keep coming back for more extensions $60/pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyhow, after i lost my eyelashes, i was rather desperate to try anything. i got RapidLash, and 3 weeks later - voila! i had eyelashes thick and dark as tar. perhaps individual results vary, but for me this definitely helped. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Others may have a different experience, but I can&#x27;t be sure that there has been any difference. Maybe a little, but it is still too minimal to be sure. I have three orders to use up and maybe I&#x27;ll have more info after that.</li>
    <li> I tried Rapid Lash two years ago and had Amazing results! I saw longer, thicker and darker lashes within weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Before using up the first tube I ordered 2 more. I noticed the packaging was changed and I suspect the formula,too. Both the second and third tube seemed useless! My sparse lashes returned. I have decided to give Rapid Lash one more try.  I will post my results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Always had long, thick lashes when I was younger, but the past few years they were thinning and breaking.  I could tell a difference after two weeks and after a month, they are almost back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  Will definitely continue to use this!</li>
    <li> Had success with Librow, and wanted to try this as cost-effective alternative, but tube was empty. Going to exchange, will update if results change.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes after using it for a month:( I do not think I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have very thin eyelashes. I started using Rapidlash a few months ago. There is a tremendous difference in the density now. With the help of mascara my eyelashes look thick and long!!! Someone even asked me if I had eyelash extensions!!!</li>
    <li> Good product hasn&#x27;t worked totally yet but feel certain that it will. really like it. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My eyelash grows rapidly! And I use it every night before going to bed. After using 2 weeks, I found that my lash has been growning!</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 2 months now and i am very pleased with results. I will be buying another rapidlash so i will not run out. Just apply before bedtime and i guarantee you will see results, my lashes were almost non existent before i started using product, now my lashes are long and thick.  Love it...would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> THis product works so well!  My lashes got so long they look fake!  I highly recommend this product and will contiue to use!  IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> My lashes have always been sparse and short...&lt;br /&gt;Seems like they always were breaking or just not there.&lt;br /&gt;After one month, and I must continue to use it daily, I now have long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they were thicker, however, I finally feel like I have eyelashes! Yay!</li>
    <li> I love RapidLash and will never be without it.  It took about 4-6 weeks to notice a difference, but WOW, did I notice. My eyelashes were ridiculously long on the top and bottom.  I could feel them on my cheek when my eyes were closed and they touched my eyebrows when they were open.  I started using it 2-3 times a week after 2 months of daily use.  This helped maintain the length. When I stopped using it for a month, my lashes started to fall out and break off (from waterproof mascara) again.  If you are looking for lash growth, try RapidLash.  Give it 1 - 2 months to see results.  I am starting to see results again, especially on my bottom lashes.  I cannot wait to get back to the length I had the first time.  It looked like I was always wearing falsies!</li>
    <li> Update:  Since I&#x27;ve been chastised for ragging on the company (who would get negative stars if I could), I still only give the product ONE star.  It simply didn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s obviously worked for others so give it a go if you like.  Hope this helps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So two things...not seeing much of a difference in the length of my lashes.  Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t want to work on me.  The most troubling is that it&#x27;s advertised that it comes with a Free Promaxyl Intensive Eye Treatment.  This never came.  I contacted the company and they said they were \\&quot;unaware that it was advertised as such\\&quot; and that they would go ahead and ship this out.  Well...it never came.  I contacted the company again and they claimed \\&quot;oh we can&#x27;t seem to track your package and it&#x27;s probably damaged or stuck in a warehouse.\\&quot;  Or how about...you never sent it.  They claim they will send me a $19 check \\&quot;to make things right.\\&quot;  We&#x27;ll see.  I&#x27;ll update  this review if I receive it.  I likely won&#x27;t order from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I received the $19 refund...thank you, but after the seriously rude behavior following the refund, I will definitely not do business with this company again.  Please shop around and make sure you don&#x27;t get bent-over on the pricing later from this company (Not Amazon).</li>
    <li> I have seen an improvement in my eyebrows after a few weeks of useing.  Even the eyebrow tech also sees the improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for almost two months...&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet....disappointed.......&lt;br /&gt;No more words are needed for a no difference-result......</li>
    <li> Decided to try this and NeuLash to see which worked better.  I am sorry I ordered the big size of Neulash - I have been using Neulash on the left eye and Rapidlash on the right to replace lashes pulled out over the course of using eyelash extensions.... The Neulash had regrowth of fine tiny lashes that were light brown.  The rapidlash just came in thick and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save money - use this one instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month now and I&#x27;m not seeing any great results, I&#x27;m loosing less  eyelashes per day, for me is kind of worth it because of that. I will update my review if anything changes.  Delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> I have previously used revitalash which worked wonders with both length and volume! With these kind of products, you really do get what you pay for. However, that didn&#x27;t stop me from looking for a less expensive alternative. I bought this not thinking it would do much and it didn&#x27;t at first. During the first 1-2 months of using rapidlash, my eyelash growth was sporadic, uneven, and very minimal. About 3 months into it, they are finally long and pretty. I would definitely repurchase this because even though it doesn&#x27;t thicken my lashes like revitalash did, it lengthened them a pretty decent amount. For the price, length is good enough for me. Remember, patience is key so don&#x27;t give up too early! Give it a shot. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! I have always had very thin, short eyelashes, and finally decided to do something about it. I tried the L&#x27;Oreal product first, with no results. With the Rapidlash, I noticed kind of suddenly at about 1 month in that my lashes were MUCH longer! I am really impressed. I just swipe it across the base of my upper lashes every night. Takes about 5 seconds and so worth it. I also started using Dior mascara primer and Diorshow mascara, and the total effect is impressive enough that even my husband noticed :)</li>
    <li> This really does work. I noticed that my eyelashes were healthier within a week. It does what it says it will do...my eyelashes are a little bit longer, healthier, and fuller. I am not blown away, but definitely satisfied.</li>
    <li> So excited to finally find a product that does what it says it does.  My lower eyelashes on one eye were almost non-existent giving me a very odd appearance.  This product has made my lower lashes grow so thick.  I noticed a difference in 2 weeks. I will definitely re-purchase this product as it is a fraction of what other more expensive products promis.</li>
    <li> Fast deliver...great product...very happy customer here...in two weeks I notice my lashes and eyebrow growing...it does really works very good...will buy again...thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always had, short, thin and sparse blond lashes. This works great! It did take about a month to see the results and my eyes were a bit sensitive to it in the beginning but I&#x27;ve been using it now for a little over 2 months and I&#x27;m really happy with the results.  My lashes are still blond and they are still thin, but they are longer!!! I can now put on mascara and actually see my lashes.  I now use it every other night and it&#x27;s sufficient and my eyes are no longer sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I received this item in a prompt fashion and I used it as directed, Although I did see some change in my eyebrows but after a month&lt;br /&gt;of use there was little change in my eyelashes. I will not be buying this product again. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Have used this for several years and will not be without it. I take medication that causes my eyelashes and eyebrows to come out easily, this along with being in my 40&#x27;s has resulted in thinning of my lashes and brows. Rapid Lash makes my lashes longer and fuller and is more easily affordable than prescription products. I always have a tube handy and apply nightly. Very pleased with my results!</li>
    <li> So I have the shortest eyelashes ever and was skeptical about this item working.  And i also didn&#x27;t want to spend the megabux or effort involved in getting a prescription.  So for $30 I thought - I could try it out and even if it doesn&#x27;t work, it wasn&#x27;t too much of an investment. Well, i&#x27;m happy to say that I didn&#x27;t even apply the serum religiously like I probably should have, more like every other night, but after a couple months, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyelashes are longer.  I need to buy some more as I&#x27;d really like to get them super long. (i still need a little bit of mascara help.)</li>
    <li> Rapidlash is great!! It has made my lashes long, thicker and beautiful. Not only did it grow out my lashes, Rapidlash also grew out my eyebrows. They are becoming so much thicker. Now I am able to shape them. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> This product works. I have always had long lashes but i noticed i was losing lashes on one eye more than the other. I heard about Rapidlash and started using it a few months ago. It works! my lashes are very long and i noticed more fullness too. Great price for the product as the alternative is Latisse which is an RX and much more expensive.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to individuals with short or average lashes, but I found that it takes really long time to work. Actual lengthening of the lashes only started for me on my second tube of rapidlash. But I&#x27;m still going to purchase a third tube of Rapidlash and wait to see if I can reach my desired lash length.</li>
    <li> Works for length and volume. Does not curl like lilash though. Good product for price! Overall good product and have repurchased.</li>
    <li> Does RapidLash really work?    No long explanation of how or why I bought RapidLash just a very simple,,, YES! YES! YES!  It really does work.</li>
    <li> It takes several weeks to notice a difference but it does work. my lashes look much longer but not really darker as product promised. I still love the results with mascara.  If you stop using it your lashes thin out very quickly, in a mere week, so you have to keep using. i don&#x27;t mind though because its easy and the product lasts several months before you need a new one.</li>
    <li> About a month ago, I tried eye lash extensions for the first time.  The woman did a terrible job.  I had them removed and lost about 70% of my original lashes.  I cried for 3 days!  I had bald spots on my eye lids and I could practically count the lashes I had left.  I tried rapid lash and saw a difference within 3 days.  The remaining lahses were longer! After 4 weeks, I have full super incredibly long lashes! They are beautiful and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It worked so quickly.  I have not had any sort of reaction and I truly think this is an amazing product.  Not only are my eyelashes longer, but I no longer have bald spots.  The lashes have all filled in and in such a short period of time!  What a great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use on my eyebrows after an overzealous plucking incident. I&#x27;ve been a bit heavy handed with the tweezers over the years (ever since I was 19 years old and the skinny Kate Moss eyebrows were en vogue). I&#x27;ve worked on growing my eyebrows for years - they are not skinny necessarily but they are a bit sparse. I purchased this product on a whim. It&#x27;s been less than 30 days and I&#x27;ve seen great improvement! I&#x27;m not Brooke Shields or anything but honestly, I&#x27;ve been able to give my Dior brow pencil a bit of a break. I&#x27;m glad I shopped around on the price since this product can cost up to and over $50. Great experience with Amazon.com as always! I highly recommend. I believe I&#x27;ll try this on my eyelashes next...</li>
    <li> I first bought in April and waited until now to do a review.  Even after reading reviews was not sure the product would work. But wanted to fill in my originally thick eyebrows that after years of plucking had &#x27;thinned.&#x27; The left eyebrow looked thinner and had a &#x27;bald&#x27; spot. IT WORKS FOR ME.  It filled out both eyebrows so they look thicker, they looked even because the left one grew some hair.  Also, I almost do not believe this occured but the &#x27;bald&#x27; spot had hair growing in that area.  I just bought another tube. I used for 3 months straight and got these results.  Then started again  but the contained is a tad low.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly and saw results fairly quickly. Am using this on my eyebrows and they seem less sparce. Love love love it!!</li>
    <li> Wasnt sure I should try this product , didnt think it could work but after thirty days of using , my lashes are so long.  It works extremely well.</li>
    <li> Used it as directed, however I did not see any difference with my eyelash or eyebrow.  For that reason I could not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never done a product review but this stuff works...I have been using a month now and my mom thought I had gotten lash extensions when I got in the car with her the other day!!!! i have blonde lashes so still have to wear mascara(i don&#x27;t know that they are darker but fuller and longer for sure!!!..but after using rapidlash only once a day...with a little mascara and the eyelash curler.... I look like i have false lashes..Luv it!!</li>
    <li> After more than 4 weeks, I have noticed no difference in my lashes. In addition, the window for returning the item has expired.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!!! How amazing..this product really works. My lashes are fuller, longer and thicker. Works great on eyebrows as well. I will continue using this product...</li>
    <li> Only used about 1 month.  I think I can seen some lengthening already, but no thickening.  Stings alittle but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Will continue to use for full opportunity to see results!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to wear individual false lashes until they began to pull out my real lashes. Eventually I had no lashes to stick the false lashes to. So I bought rapid lash and in 2 weeks they were already growing back. By week 4 my lashes are fuller, longer, and less tangled than they were before. I recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick, over-the-counter remedy for their troublesome lashes.</li>
    <li> I started to use this product about 2 1/2 weeks ago, I&#x27;m so thankful that my lashes grew back to what they were and then some. They have gotten thicker, a bit darker and the length is back. Very happy to announce that this product works!!!</li>
    <li> It works!! I was quite sceptical in the beginning but it really works! My eyelashes have never been so long!</li>
    <li> Beauty Fulfillment sent me some Rapidlash that had expired in January of 2013.  Boo.  Don&#x27;t send out expired product.  I only checked the exp. date because I felt like it wasn&#x27;t working as well as Rapidlash generally does - my lashes don&#x27;t look nearly as full and long.  Frowny face, for sure.</li>
    <li> before I noticed a difference and it&#x27;s not dramatic.  My lashes are thinning because I&#x27;m getting old. Particularly the outside corners. But the eyelashes I have, and had, are long and skinny. And after 7 weeks of Rapidlash they are a little longer, still skinny, still blonde and the lashes on my outside corners are still tiny and blonde. Prescription eyelash serums concern me because my eyes are very light and I&#x27;m broke. So Rapidlash it is and I should probably be more grateful it works at all.</li>
    <li> Yes they make your eyelashes longer but good luck trying to keep your eyelashes from falling out. This product only made a select few of my lashes grow but it made alot of them fall out when I did something simple like rub my eye. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because technically it did make some of my lashes grow... but the negatives outweigh the positives with this product. Once I stopped using, my eyelashes went back to normal length and didn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> It really work&#x27;s got good results, i told my friends about it!&lt;br /&gt;My eye brows  and eye lashes are fuller now !</li>
    <li> I do like it but the shipment I received from Amazon was dried up and couldn&#x27;t use it. When the product is fresh it does help. I couldn&#x27;t get it replaced either.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this serum and tells me it does work.  I though it&#x27;d be cheaper in England but not true.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used it once, ONCE, super clean eyes, super careful in the application, and the very next morning my eyes were red, worst than that, I felt as if I had blades on them. I have never had this kind of irritation and honestly I think it is an infection. I have been using Mavala double lash which gave me extremely good amazing results but yes, it took a little while, so after reading so many good reviews about this Rapidlash eyelash I decided to try. Very bad idea. What I got was a rapid irritation/infection. I&#x27;m back to Mavala, which is the best, I have never had ANY problems with Mavala. I wouldn&#x27;t dare to try this product again, it is EXTREMELY IRRITATING.</li>
    <li> I loved this product as it does not change my skin color (comparing to latisse). It is very easy to apply. I started noticing first results after 2 months of using it. Also the price is much better than the price of latisse. Thank you</li>
    <li> It does the job. You have to use a lot of this product to work it even more. This is the 3rd one I bought and my brows are still in the process of growing from too much plucking. I still see little gaps from  the hair that didn&#x27;t grow.</li>
    <li> I had absolutely no eyelashes and Rapidlash did exact as it advertised, in exactly 4 weeks I saw improvements in my eyelashes, they looked longer and fuller and I will continue to use it until my lashes reach the level I want.  I am pleased and I would refer this product to anyone interested in growing eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have no problems with it - and have seen growth within 1 month. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received my bottle of Rapid Lash. I went to use it and hardly anything is on the applicator. It is like the bottle is empty. I have to keep sticking the want back in just to get anything on the brush. I had high hopes for this product but am  very upset that I paid quite a bit of money only to get a bottle that seems empty.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than most, so I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me, but it did.  All of these seem to have a ridiculously small amount of product in them (and very thick container tubes), but that seems to be true of all of this class of beauty product.</li>
    <li> I am a recovering chemo patient, and at the time of ordering this product I had no eyelashes, or eyebrows.  I&#x27;m not sure what product made the difference as I also combined it with the L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting Serum.  All I can say that after about a week of using both products I began to see a major difference and started not only growing eyelashes, but eyebrows as well.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, and I did my homework on side effects but this one did not work out for me.  Within TWO DAYS, my eyelids had turned dark and the lash line was red.  Terrible itchiness on my lash line, but of more concern was the color change of my eyelids.  The product arrived ona timely basis but I am not using it because I fear that there are more side effects to come.</li>
    <li> I feel compelled to submit a review of this product as I usually read other reviews on products before I decide to purchase or not.  And I don&#x27;t write reviews often at all -  in fact rarely.  But this product has worked.  My eyelashes are fuller and longer and I noticed a difference in as little as 10-14 days.  I&#x27;m a penny pincher as well.  But I found this product to work, has not really irritated my eyes or eyelash line too much, is a purchase price that I can agree with, and it lasts a good amount of time before time to purchase more.  If you&#x27;re doubting whether to try this product or not, do not hesitate.  It works.  The price is more than fair considering everything else that is out there.  If you follow the directions and apply as it tells you to on a CLEAN eye, every night, you will not be dissapointed at all!  Coming from a sceptic, this is saying volumes - in eyelashes!</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, for sure. I decided to use this product faithfully, which was hard for me cuz I am not big on nightly routines... It took about 6 weeks before I could  honestly see a change in my lashes.  Let me be clear about this though... Without mascara, I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my naked lashes. But they are looking much longer and thicker with mascara applied to them then they ever have in the past, and I have been using the same mascara (Mabelline Big Lash) for many, many, years.  Maybe in time, I&#x27;ll see a difference in my naked lashes, but I&#x27;m happy with the results I have at this point (6 1/2 weeks into it)  and plan to keep purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> it has been about a month &amp; a half &amp; i have FAITHFULLY been applying to both my eyelashes &amp;  eyebrows with no difference whatsoever but i have been told you must wait a minimum of 2 months before you begin to see the desired effects(longer than that on your eyebrows)so i will continue to be patient &amp; we&#x27;ll see in a few more weeks what happens!</li>
    <li> It works! I can definitely tell my lashes are longer. It took about a month before I could really see a difference. I also used it on my eyebrow where I had a thin area and it filled that in as well. My one complaint is that I can&#x27;t tell how much of the bottle I have used and I don&#x27;t want to run out. I just purchased my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This product slightly works, not as good as other products but there are some results, just not enough to dazzle me.</li>
    <li> Made my eye lashes the longest they have every been. Mine were super short and sparse and I feel like it def made them longer and a litle fulller. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 mos now. It took at least 2 months for actual results.</li>
    <li> I have been using \\&quot;Rapid Lash\\&quot; since 5 weeks. I applied every night before sleep and I already have longer and curlier eyelashes. My eyelashes was never as long as right now in my life, never got curls, even with the eyelash curling tools. Also I didn&#x60;t get any color changes on my eyelid with this product. I read many reviews on different related products. Some reviews showed that some products made color changes (such as eyelid becoming darker) on the eyelid. My eyelid color same as when I start using \\&quot;RapidLash\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you \\&quot;RapidLash\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> After surviving cancer twice, my eyebrows and eyelashes were almost non existent. I purchased this after reading several reviews, for my eyebrows, I had last all hope for my eyelashes. It took twelve weeks to really notice but I have finally notice my lashes are thicker, longer and darker and my eyebrows are starting to fill in. I still have to dye my eyebrows but when I do they are fuller. One tube has lasted me 12 weeks now using it twice a day.  I&#x27;m ready to purchase another tube to see if I can get even more results.</li>
    <li> This is one out of many I have bought. I don&#x27;t know why I am being asked to review this again, but my eyelashes are still long and thick. As long as I use this they stay that way. But if I stop, they start to drop. But I only have to use it a couple of times a week now and it maintains my length.</li>
    <li> Was not sure of the product at first, but ordered it anyway. It was delivered very quickly; used it according to instructions, and it worked very well. Very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item but haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I had a problem with my vision so it is on hold for now.  Will try it when my problem gets better.</li>
    <li> I was considering getting a prescription for Latisse, so thought I would try this first before shelling out the big bucks. I knew this would not show immediate results and you have to use it 6-8 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for the past 2 months and my lashes look noticeably much longer and fuller. But you have to be patient. A month into using it, my lashes looked a little longer but not any fuller. It&#x27;s now 2 months and &amp;#34;bam&amp;#34; - they are longer and fuller. When I put mascara on I almost look like I have fake lashes on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 40 days already and I am still waiting for the result. What a waste. To make the matter worse, that thing leaves a line of dry gel on my lash that I have to peal out every morning.</li>
    <li> Works very well! I get accused of wearing fake eyelashes this works so well - I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> after destroying my lashes from extensions i was left with bald spots on m lash line and poor growth. After using rapid lash i not only grew back my lashes; i grew them back way longer and stronger. Everyone compliments me on my lashes now :))</li>
    <li> Meanwhile i use this product my eyelashes look longer, but as soon as i stop, they got shorter than before, I had long lashes, just wanted them a bit fuller, i guess it was a big mistake. Now they look shorter and weak.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend, unless you wanna use this product your whole life.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am a 52 year old African American female.  Lost my natural lashes wearing false individual ones. Thought I would always have to pay over $50 a month to have lashes. Then I read the reviews on this product and decided to try it. Absolutely amazing. Saw results in a couple of weeks. My lashes actually grow longer than before. I have one on my bathroom counter and one in my travel pouch.  Much thanks to the makers of Rapid Lash.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I notice a big improvement in my eyelashes, both in length and fullness. I have also used in on my brows, and see an improvement there as well.</li>
    <li> I am positive that it will make my lash long within 4 weeks. I feel that it is making my lashes strong and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Let me caveat this review by saying I never gave a hoot about my eye lashes or brows. Both have been pretty non existent for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair started to thin I just shaved my head. But eye lashes? I could care less. My sister has a pair of the most beautiful eyes I&#x27;ve ever seen. They&#x27;re much like Elizabeth&#x27;s Taylors eyes were. An exquisite blue that shimmer like jewels. Well, we hadn&#x27;t seen each other for about a month, met for lunch and I told her that her eyes looked just spectacular but I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on why the difference was so significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told me she was using NueLash which sells for well over a $100 per tube. I&#x27;ve been in Advertising for 35 years and research is a significant part of what I do. So to make sure the product was safe I did a little research on her behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes the lashes grow is the active ingredient \\&quot;Isopropyl Cioprostenate - it&#x27;s not new, it&#x27;s been used in Europe for over a decade. Out of all the eye lash enhancer&#x27;s on the market there are only three that have Isopropyl Cioprosrenate - NueLash, RevitaLash and RapidLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others use dense moisturizers to temporarily plump up the lashes. However the above three products are the only ones that can actually grow out eye lashes and brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a blind study by Consumer Labs and an independent clinical trial sponsored by RapidLash, RapidLash performed an average of 88% better than Nuelash and RevitaLash. The reason being it contains significantly more Isopropyl Cioprostenate - 27% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered a tube and have used it for less than two weeks. For the first time, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my eye lashes, they&#x27;re definitely a bit longer and thicker.

    <li> It does work but not dramatically or rapidly. I have been using it for about a month. I have noticed my lashes are a bit longer but they are not fuller. If you want dramatic results, spend more$$.</li>
    <li> Last year I had eyelash extensions put on. Unfortunately, when they came off, so did my natural lashes. Before using this product, whole strips of my eyelashes had still not grown in. After using this product for 2 months, I now have full lashes. I have to use mascara, but now, there are lashes to put it on. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s claims. I&#x27;m on my third tube and have used it almost 2 years. I saw results in 2 weeks. My eyelashes are longer and thicker. Friends have commented on how long my lashes are.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell with this stuff.  I used it pretty regularly, so far for about 7 (?) weeks.  About 3 weeks ago, I thought there was no difference.  Understand that I have short eyelashes that stick straight out.  I bought an eyelash curler, and curled them, went to put on mascara and whoa!  My lashes totally stood out.  I used to use individual false lashes in the outer corner of my eye just to enhance them, but honestly my lashes were too thick to fit the false ones in there.,  Then yesterday at the dentist, even though I&#x27;d not used the product for 2 or 3 days, my dentist&#x27;s assistant said &amp;#34;Wow! your eyelashes are so thick!&amp;#34;  Not so much long but thick.  She has long, curled eyelashes but little volume.  Long story short, I&#x27;m not positive this works, but I am definitely going to keep using it.  Didn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on my eyebrows, but once again, honestly, you look at yourself in the mirror every day so it&#x27;s hard to see change.  I&#x27;m not out of my first tube yet, but I will buy some more, and this time I&#x27;m going to take before/after pics</li>
    <li> Okay...I&#x27;m a fifty two year old woman who has NEVER been strong on eyelashes, and over the past few years the problem has begun to bother me. Super sparse, short and almost transparent. Nothing to even put mascara on without looking even worse. I&#x27;ve tried latisse twice in the past, and got results after a couple of months...but I&#x27;ve had trouble with compliance becaue the product requires a presecription, is expensive, and let&#x27;s face it, is a pain in a butt to apply. (that little dropper thing that you drop onto the horrible stiff little brushes, hassle plus I felt like I was wasting a lot of the product).&lt;br /&gt;So I read the reviews and though skeptical, I was desperte. I did notice ANY improvement in almost a month. So disapponted. But, almost overnight, in the last week, my lashes have started to grow like crazy! I&#x27;m so happy. The results are definitely better than what I saw with Latisse even after two months of use. My lashes are longer than they have ever been. They are still not dark, but I have a feeling that may increase over time. Anyway, I was so skeptical of this stuff, and now I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> At first was going to return this product because I bought it for my Eyebrows &amp; the box said just Eyelashes (nothing no where about Eyebrows).  Upon the return process I got an immediate response letting me know this IS the product for Eyebrows &amp; apologize  for not having anything on the box stating that.  So I kept it, have used it several times &amp; am starting to see eyebrows fill in a little. It is to be used at night &amp; makes it harder for me to remember to use it.  But overall I believe this is a Good Product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time about the middle of March and although I have purchased another one I haven&#x27;t yet run out of the first bottle and I use it every night..I really started to see a change in my lashes at about the 6 week mark, they are getting crazy long. My routine is I take a shower in the evening and apply my RapidLash and any other beauty products I use, I then wait at least a half hour before I put on any moisturizer to give it time to soak in and that&#x27;s it. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation to my eyes whatsoever and now that my lashes are the length I want them I will use it every other night for upkeep. I will continue to use this product for a long time..</li>
    <li> Within a week I could tell my lashes were getting longer. They were also softer. I also used the product on my eyebrows. I have a bare patch &amp; it&#x27;s now filled in- just about a week or a little longer.</li>
    <li> If you notice this product talks all about lashes and hardly anything about eyebrows.  How do you call a product eyebrows and lashes and in the description all you talk about is lashes...GO FIGURE!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! I have been using for about three months and cannot believe how long my lashes are!! I have gotten many complements on them - people want to know what mascara I am using. No mascara I have ever used made my lashes look like this! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I haven&#x27;t noticed any thickening. But my lashes were kind of thick to begin with. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Yes, I was skeptical about this product.  I&#x27;ve had it less than a week and I can definately see a difference already.  I know how that sounds..too good to be true but it is lengthening my lashes.  They are longer already.. not a lot, but Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day.  It won&#x27;t take long if this continues to do as well as it seems.[[ASIN:B00BD16OV4 RapidLash Eyelash &amp; Eyebrow Enhancing Serum 0.1 fl oz (3 ml)]][[ASIN:B005KNW0HI RapidLash Eyelash &amp; Eyebrow Enhancing Serum]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a month, so I have to wait to see if this really works.  My skin tingles when I brush it on.  It made my eyelids sore, so now it&#x27;s on my eyebrows only.</li>
    <li> This stuff does as it says- my lashes are noticeably longer but not thicker at all... I actually don&#x27;t love how they look- almost spidery. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> After researching many different eyelash enhancing serum&#x27;s I decided to go with this one.  It received good reviews and wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  I have noticed a difference in the length of my eyelashes, but they do not seem any more full.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to see the length of their lashes increase.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do!! I highly recommend it if you want longer lashes or have sparse borws. It works!</li>
    <li> I tried other brands, but I had to come back to Rapidlash because it works the best for me. Long and thicker lashes!</li>
    <li> It works. It starts working right away within days. Literally. I love it! My lashes are long and soft. Although it did make my eyebrows darker, at least now I have thicker eyebrows. I was losing them before. I definitely look younger and better now. (OK prettier. There I said it. I&#x27;m a modest person so I never say things like this but buy it! You will feel and look prettier.) You will have long lush eyelashes and brows. It runs out about every 3 weeks or so. So try not to run out. You need to try to use it every day. When it starts to run out don&#x27;t forget to turn it upside down and shake it. Swish that brush around. Use the side of the wand too. At $30.00 a shot you want to get every drop before you throw it away.  And I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 3 months. I don&#x27;t regret it. No side effects. (Besides darker eyebrows).</li>
    <li> This product rocks.  I&#x27;ve done the Obagi and Restolin at $$$$$  This products way less and every bit as good!!!!</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me and fast! I could tell that my lashes were getting thicker and longer. I was loving it until after awhile it made my eyes REALLY itchy! Not only that, my lashes were falling out, ALOT! There are now large and uneven spaces between my lashes. I&#x27;ve stopped immediately to let my lashes grow out. I mean your lashes are supposed to molt but not to the point I barely have any lashes now. I give it three stars for working but with terrible consequences.</li>
    <li> This does work, however it started making my eyes itchy and irritated.  I started reading more about it online and heard that there is an ingredient that should be only regulated by the FDA as it is with latisse that can only be had with a prescription.  That concerns me; my eyes and vision are precious.  It would be a good idea if this company would clarify / warn you before you purchase.</li>
    <li> I had been applying it every day for about a month when I started noticing real results. After two months, everyone was noticing my eyelashes. I get comments from friends, family, my boyfriend, even strangers. Because I don&#x27;t like removing my make-up at night (I know, I know, this is terrible), I apply Rapidlash in the morning. I put it on first thing out of the shower, and then it has a few minutes to dry while I get dressed before I put my eye make up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do seem to have some reddening at my lash line. If I look closely, it just looks like I have more tiny veins there now, but if you&#x27;re just looking at me with no make-up on, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing very faint reddish-brownish eyeliner. So it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I wish I could say that it has worked wonders for me, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not the case. I&#x27;ve finished today my fourth week of using rapidlash every single night, as it&#x27;s directed to do. I haven&#x27;t skipped a single application, but my eyelashes are exactly the same, actually if anything, I can say that I&#x27;m losing more of them than I usually do. I bought it because of the amazing reviews everywhere on the web, I even made sure I was applying it correctly by viewing tutorials, but nothing. I didn&#x27;t burn or sting my eyes, no red spots or anything of the sort, but no longer or thicker lashes either! I still have some product left so I&#x27;ll finish it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again. I hope it works for other people, for me it was a waste of money and a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> It started irritating my eyes after using the product for two days.  My eyelids were burning and irritated.  I was unable to use it.</li>
    <li> So I read all the other reviews and was hopeful this would be fabulous and I wouldn&#x27;t have to go the prescription route. It does work to some extent.  Like other reviewers, it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me, except it keeps my lashes from falling out and so they are a little longer.  But I don&#x27;t have noticeably thicker lashes, and no one has noticed my lashes are longer but me.  I will probably keep using it until it runs out, but I&#x27;m sure I will re-order.</li>
    <li> As a \\&quot;50 something\\&quot; woman who has been struggling with gradually thinning lashes for the past year, I was skeptical of trying this product, but decided to give it a shot. I have been using it for about a month and have noticed a definite thickening and lengthening of my lashes--a friend even said today at lunch--\\&quot;Your eyes look great. New mascara?\\&quot;. I was thrilled! My lashes seem very conditioned and glossy as well. I totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had decent eyelashes but really wanted longer and fuller ones so that I didn&#x27;t need mascara. I was in to get a facial one day and saw this in the salon&#x27;s retail area. I had seen the commercials for Latisse but being that this was half the price I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. Within about two weeks I noticed my lashes were a considerable amount longer. I lost my tube but my results lasted for a few months. I love this stuff and can&#x27;t wait to use it again! I had NO problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember what the directions say, but I put mine on at night before bed and put it between my existing lashes (if that makes sense) and made sure it really got in there and dried before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive eyes and am a contract wearer and have had no issues with the solution bothering my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT be disappointed, especially with this being a fraction of the cost of others that I&#x27;ve read don&#x27;t work as well! Good luck :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using eyebrow growth items for a while and this one is ok as a maintenance of brows. I do not see any rapid growth but also have not seen any loss either.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;ve always had pretty decent eyelashes. I&#x27;m Mediterranean, so I&#x27;ve never had any trouble growing hair! That said, a friend of mine recommended I try this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and I SWEAR my lashes are looking longer. I can&#x27;t wait to see what they look like after the full four weeks. That said, be careful how much you apply. I say this because the other night, my boyfriend found a super long hair on my cheek (!) and it turns out that I was globbing the RapidLash on so thick before bed that it was getting all over my pillow and spreading all over my face. He now wants a tube for himself!</li>
    <li> Buy this product, it actually lives up to what it claims. You do however have to be consistent in your application of the product. After about a month I noticed big differences. I have some pretty long eyelashes now, and when I put on mascara - bam! They are amazing!</li>
    <li> I just finished my first tube I bought about 4 months ago. I applied every night on clean lashes without fail and nothing. Absolutely no difference what so ever. I used to use li lash but it was really expensive. It&#x27;s worth going back though, only half way through a tube of li lash and I was having to trim them to keep them from rubbing the lens of my glasses. I was really hoping rapid lash would work at least half as well, but sadly no. :(.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on one of the reviewers (Peter)and I am so very gratefully for his review.  I am Asian and I had short lashes.  I have been using this for about a month.  It has lengthen my lashes beyond my expectations.  It did not add volume and my lashes do still break or fall out but new lashes are growing in very nicely.  It does not irritate my eyes and I almost fatefully have applied this nightly.  I have recently started applying the serum to my brows and they are also growing back in.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a few months, my eyelashes have grown back thicker and longer.  I now only use the product every other day to maintain them, but overall very happy!</li>
    <li> I used neulash for two months before and saw no change in the length or fullness of my lashes. With this product I saw results within a week! I am excited to finally grow my own lashes. After I lost most of them to lash extensions and then spent $80 on a product that doesn&#x27;t work I was desperate and resigned. I thought that nothing but latisse could help but because of the issue with it being a prescription product I decided to give rapidlash a shot. I never write reviews on amazon but my results definitely warrant one.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with product. I followed the directions and used it everynight. I haven&#x60;t seen any results at all. I have thin lashes and was hoping for something to help. This wasnt&#x60;t cheap.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as advertised!  Haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth on eyebrows, where I especially need it.  It&#x27;s been about four weeks now.</li>
    <li> I used the product only on my eyebrows, as they have been sparse for some years now.  To my surprise there is some new growth! I can&#x27;t say they are back to how they were before, but I&#x27;ll continue to use the serum and who knows?</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect having never used this type of product.  After about a month there was significant increase in length and volume.  It does not darken, however, and being blond, I would have liked that.  Still very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> It take about 3 to 4 weeks to see result but works very well. I get compliments on my lashes all the time.</li>
    <li> doesnt do what it claims in the ad. simple eyelash curler works better and is cheaper than this product is</li>
    <li> I started using this product after I had a miserable reaction to synthetic lash extensions done by my esthetician. The reaction was so poor, I ripped the extensions off and along came my natural lashes. I noticed major growth in my lashes after just two weeks of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be re-ordering. I think I may be hooked on Rapidlash.</li>
    <li> I was very sceptical about this serum, I really did not think anything could help my short, stubby and stick straight lashes. I made the mistake of ruining my natural lashes with lash extensions and started using this product after I was left with lashes that were broken off, ripped out. I could tell a difference after about 2 weeks, and after about 4 weeks my lashes were noticeably longer and to my surprise, had a nice swoop to them. I don&#x27;t even need to use my lash curler anymore. My lashes are too long and full to really put them in the curler.</li>
    <li> this was a total waste of money. Rapid lash sucks, I don&#x27;t even think my bottle was filled completely. the bottle ran out with in days. never again</li>
    <li> I have been using Rapid Lash for a year now. The results are dramatic!  My lashes have grown and have continued to look fuller and with more body. I use it every night after removing mascara with soap and water. I have read some reviews that have not been positive, broken lashes, eyes becoming red , etc.  This could be due to using over the counter mascara remove that contains oils or other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the price is too high.  I believe that the retailers are gouging the buyer because they know they can get it. If the price were lower believe they would sell more product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other (cheaper) serums that worked a little, but not much, and discolored my skin. Based on a review I read here on Amazon about an ingredient only in this product (and Revitalash), I decided to try it. I use it once a day on my lashes and brows, and my hair is longer and thicker. I haven&#x27;t been able to fill in over-plucked brows in years, and this product is finally allowing me to make some gain in this area! I have NOT had any skin discoloration, either, which is great!</li>
    <li> I applied Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing System every evening as directed with no noticeable results. Bummer, save your money for another product.</li>
    <li> I have used Lastisse in the past (loved it) and wanted to try something cheaper. I read many reviews on Rapidlash and figured I would give it a try- what&#x27;s the worse that can happen- my eyelashes wouldn&#x27;t grow??  Well my eyelashes fell out! At first I thought they were just going through a growth period and shedding some old ones. BUT they continued to fall out so I quit using it immediately.  My lashes are the shortest they have ever been and I have been using some faux lashes to fill in the sparse areas until they grow back.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rapidlash about 3 weeks, and I love the results I see in my eyelashes.  My lashes are longer, and more uniform in length.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sounds like I am having an atypical reaction, but every time I&#x27;ve put the intensive eye treatment on, the next morning I look like I have two black eyes. That is, the circles under my eyes are WORSE, and extend around the eyes. I don&#x27;t think this is an allergic reaction, since there is no itching, rash, etc. I don&#x27;t think I dare use it again. Has anyone had the same reaction? could this be temporary and the product does what it says with prolonged use?</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I reorder every two-three months.  It works so good.  Love my long full lashes!  Even at my age of 60 - it works!</li>
    <li> I saw absolutely no difference in my eyebrows using this product every night for 2 months.  I would like a refund but too much time has passed I am afraid.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. I used this product every night  for two months and my eyelashes still the same length. :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it works, but my eyelashes are longer for sure. Worked within the first week. I will be using this forever.</li>
    <li> My eyelash doesn&#x27;t enough grow long. That strange to me. I am looking for strong eyelash faster than slow process.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I can clearly see a difference with my lashes and brows. I was using a different product before but it got discontinued and that is actually is a good thing because this one is much better. I use it as directed and my lashes and brows are getting fuller and longer. I have no irritation and I have sensitive skin. I will absolutely will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after losing the majority of my natural lashes after getting lash extensions. It took about 2 months to see results, and now, when I compare pictures of my lashes now to pics of my lashes before the extensions, they&#x27;re a little fuller and much, much longer! Definitely will keep using this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything about my eyelashes to complain about. They weren&#x27;t long but not nonexistent either.  Being blonde made them less noticeable so I have been having them dyed with henna at a salon for the past couple of years. I decided to buy rapid lash on whim, ten weeks ago, and have been very happy with the results. I followed the directions and used rapid lash 1x a day.  It took roughly five weeks for my lashes to grow noticeably longer. Can&#x27;t say that they are necessarily thicker but way longer. My guess is at least 50% longer. I use it with [[ASIN:B004GHG8EK L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Blackest Black, 0.3 Fluid Ounce]] and my eyelashes look insanely long and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;1x day application&lt;br /&gt;~$40 for a single tube 4+month supply (cheaper than my face cream)&lt;br /&gt;ease of use (similar to applying liquid liner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;have to keep using it to maintain results (I&#x27;ve dropped to 3x week)&lt;br /&gt;another beauty item to add to my bedtime routine (argh!)&lt;br /&gt;~~$40 only for lashes, then there is face, eyes, throat creams, cleansers etc (these things add up!)</li>
    <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this except that so many of the reviews were so glowing. Sorry, but I&#x27;ve been using this stuff faithfully and just as instructed for over 8 weeks and there is no difference in my lashes or brows. I bought it to help my over-plucked brows fill in better. And then I thought I wouldn&#x27;t mind some thicker lashes either. To see if it actually worked, I used it on only one brow and only one eye. Eight weeks later, the right eyelashes are just the same as the left. Just the same. And the eyebrow hasn&#x27;t changed either. I don&#x27;t know how it worked on other people--if they just wanted to believe it so bad that it did or if there&#x27;s some different body chemistry that makes it work on some and not on others, but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Which is very disappointing because $25 is a lot of money to just throw away for nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for years. It took a good 4 weeks for it to start working, but has certainly been worth it.  My eyelashes were getting shorter over the years, and I didn&#x27;t want skimpy lashes as I aged. They are nice and long now. I use this everey night. The only complaint is that it does not work on my eyebrows. But I had actually tried Latisse on them and that didn&#x27;t work either. i think this works as well as Latisse on my lashes.</li>
    <li> This is the first lash enhancer product that I have used. I was pretty dubious and reading the reviews it appears that results can be variable. I&#x27;m pretty happy, it has made my eyelashes at least 30% longer. I noticed the product working from about 2 weeks of use. Been using it for 6 weeks now and I think my lashes are continuing to grow. Before I used this product I could not see my lashes without mascara, now I can see them and they curl up quite nicely themselves without the need for mascara. I&#x27;ve also been trying to thicken my eyebrows to keep in line with current brow trends, I can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference on the brows but I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I did do hoping but not knowing if it would work. My lashes are brown but there&#x27;s not much to them. I&#x27;ve always wanted those long glamorous lashes. Well, when it first arrived I marked down on my calendar the day I began using rapid lash. Almost six weeks later I am really happy with the results. Having longer lashes makes me feel even more feminine, and I Iove that. In addition, my skin is insanely sensitive ( as in, I only can use baby wash,etc. This didn&#x27;t burn or anything. Again, I&#x27;m thrilled with it and glad I tried this before attempting to try Latisse and possibly exposing myself to chemicals and more money than I can spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I should note I only use rapid lash no eye cream.</li>
    <li> I had long eyelashes to begin with but as I aged I thought they could use a boost.  I noticed a difference after about a month of daily use of this product.  They are definitely longer.  I was hoping for thicker but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.  I&#x27;m hoping that perhaps thickness takes longer to achieve since it is contingent upon new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no irritation with this product.  I apply it similar to eye liner but even closer to my lash line.  More in the lash line than above.  I use it once a day. I usually apply it at night. I&#x27;m thrilled I didn&#x27;t have to pay for the more expensive latisse.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it really works and I will buy it again when I use up this one</li>
    <li> It has been about 4 weeks since I started using Rapidlash on my eyebrows and am surprised to see slight amounts of growth in regions that I had previously never seen growth before.</li>
    <li> I saw growth in 3-4 weeks and a dramatic difference in 8 weeks. I think it made my lashes 50% longer. It also grew a bit of hair on my eyebrows, but just a few hairs. This is great lengthening product and if you couple it with a growth mascara, you will see surprising results. This didn&#x27;t make my eyelash hair thicker or darker, just longer, but thats all I expected. My lashes were healthy and decent to start with, using this product makes them look like Im wearing lash extensions. Good stuff. No side effects noted to date.</li>
    <li> These products are easy to use, produce excellent results, and are well priced.  Who could ask for more?  I would definitely recommend these products to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this not for my lashes, but for my eyebrows and on the box that I received, it didn&#x27;t mention eyebrows on the front, but said on the enclosed brochure, that you could use it for eyebrows; maybe the one I received was older?  Hoping that it works; haven&#x27;t had it long enough to have results yet, but will keep my fingers crossed!  It arrived very quickly though, thank you for that.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes were a mess after extensions.  They were sparse and what was there was broken, short and kinked.  I believe it only took a couple of weeks to start noticing improvement.  Soon, my lashes were much better than before the extensions.  I have now had my original tube for about 5 months; I do wish I could see how much of the product was left in the tube, but that would be my only complaint.  My lashes are longer, thicker, a bit darker and even a better texture to apply mascara.  I cut back to using the product to just 2 or 3 times per week and that was a mistake, as overnight at one point, my lashes went back to a sorry state.  It took several days to get them back into shape, so I would recommend using no less than 4 to 5 times per week.  I also have written a review of the Shiseido eyelash curler you may be interested in - have been very impressed with that product, as well.</li>
    <li> give this a shot, it works really fast. I have naturally  dark eyelashes but they aren&#x27;t very long and I don&#x27;t like wearing mascara. It&#x27;s only my second day and on both eyes I can tell that my lashes are much fuller and longer.</li>
    <li> unfortunatly i was disapointed.  i really wanted it to work and i am sad that it didnt.  i used it every night</li>
    <li> I stopped using Lattisse and thought i would give this a shot. It&#x27;s working great. My lashes grew long using Lattisse, but since i have started using this, i have not lost any of the gains i had made, so i&#x27;m inclined to think this is working very well. Also, this doesn&#x27;t seem to turn the skin around my eyes as dark at Lattisse did. This also costs a lot less and i don&#x27;t need a prescription.</li>
    <li> I didnt really expect anything from RapidLash, because I didnt believe all these things work. And it didnt work first month. But now I&#x60;ve been using it for almost 2 months and my eyelashes ara much longer. Looks very good and I am glad. But it doesnt make it more thick or dark in my case (I have light eyelashes and eyebrows). So I still have to use my mascara, but they look very nice now.</li>
    <li> Lost all my hair and eyelashes during chemo for breast cancer 10 years ago. The hair grew back--the eyelashes, not so much. They were short and sparse and fell out frequently. I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for about 3 months, and I really wish I had taken before-and-after photos. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find that my lashes grew a whole lot longer, but they have completely filled in. I&#x27;d say that they are at least twice as thick as they&#x27;ve been since chemo. I look like a normal person with normal eyelashes now, and I am beyond pleased!</li>
    <li> Holy wow ! I am actually shocked by this product. I surrendered to giving this a shot because I just couldn&#x27;t afford lash extensions anymore. My entire life I&#x27;ve had short, straight, blonde and sparce lashes and I never thought I could really change that but this serum really made a difference. My lashes are naturally longer than I ever thought they could be and even darker. I am no longer jealous of my friends long, luxurious lashes :)</li>
    <li> I did not think this would work, but it had a money-back guarantee so I said \\&quot;what the heck.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not even that good about applying it. I applied it about every other night for about five weeks and though, \\&quot;well, this is not really working.\\&quot; I had always had really long lashes, but suddenly it seemed like my lashes and brows were super-lame following a long bout of stress and a lot of differnent flu medications. It made me feel kind of sad. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in about the fifth week of my admittedly applying this about 4 nights out of 7, all of the sudden, I had super-long lashes again! Like some freakin disco-miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a second tube for my mom, because she deserves this result also. It really works. How weird! There must be something in there. Now I&#x27;ve seen results after the fifth week, I&#x27;m even better about putting it on every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d rather spend the equivalent of a restaurant meal on ONE thing that actually works than some drugstore BS that doesn&#x27;t do what what it says.</li>
    <li> I expected it at least to help with length. I used it religously for weeks and i did not have any difference in the end. I wished i would have used my money wisely, cause this product was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not the best product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well. It doesn&#x27;t work as good as some other products.</li>
    <li> I have used Rapidlash multiple times and every time it has given me great results without any side effects. The results are also noticeable within a week so it works really quick.  I recently ordered a lash serum that also had great reviews and was a lot stronger so I figured if this worked then that should be better, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  The other product gave me red irritated eyes with no results after using it for a month. I threw that out and have started using Rapidlash again, it is the best lash serum for the price!!</li>
    <li> I could not beleive how fast my eyelashes enhanced, this product works great! Every morning my lashes are thicker and stronger.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  When I went shopping the other day, three people stopped me and told me I had the most beautiful eyelashes.  Believe me, that&#x27;s never happened before.  I started out using GrandLash MD and got wonderful results, but when the price doubled I switched to this because it also had excellent reviews.  Now I just won&#x27;t be without it.  I used to put about 5 coats of mascara on my skimpy lashes and the still didn&#x27;t show much.  My lashes are very light, so I still use mascara, but only one coat does the trick.  My lashes are almost long enough to touch my eyebrows and they are much thicker.  I am beyond thrilled with the results of using this and will keep it on hand in the future.  I sure don&#x27;t want to regress to my former lashes.</li>
    <li> It was my first time using this item. So I had some of concern if it does work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks, and my eyelashes really got thicker and longer.&lt;br /&gt;It is so awesome!!</li>
    <li> slightly working for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for over three weeks and have not seen any changes on my lashes. I have thinning lash on my right side eye but no changes or thickness I&#x27;m seeing so far. I have to try other products.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my lashes are super long! I apply it on the top and bottom lashes..After the first week, my bottom lashes were noticeably darker and a bit longer. I applied it on one eye for the first week so I could tell the difference. If you use this at night faithfully, and then wear a volumizing, lengthening, or extend tube mascara during the day, people will think you have falsies for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con was when I applied it to my eyebrows. I definitely started seeing some new hairs growing within the first 2 weeks but it made my eyebrows break out.. I had 2-3 little red bumps on each brow.. Nothing major but I rather draw in some brows then to have bumps on my face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want some lashes, I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have never had eyebrows and now I do.  I know it&#x27;s for lashes but works for eyebrows as well.  This product works well but it seems as if I&#x27;ve run out of it pretty fast.  Aside from that, it&#x27;s easy to apply and affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually the one who gets the &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; side effects and sees little or no benefit.  But after using RapidLash for a month, not only have I not had any unpleasant effects, but the stuff actually seems to be working!  My lashes are bit longer and curl a bit more at the ends.  They&#x27;re also darker and thicker at the root, making it appear that I&#x27;m wearing a little eyeliner. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I lost much of my eyelashes and brows to a medical procedure. I was skeptical as I had already tried a big-name product, at a big-time price, with little success. I have only been using this for a short time and am amazed at the results! My lashes and brows look thick and lush. Maybe better than before!</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference. Except my eyes were dry, red and itchy. Maybe it would work if I applied more often but it was too irritating. Maybe for less sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month and my lashes do look a little better. But i think its more keeping them from breaking than actually growing them. Does nothing for my brows. I used &#x27;Enormous Lash&#x27; before and I think it worked better.</li>
    <li> this product is not for us with sensitve reactions.....(you know who you are)  Be careful.  the chemicals seem much harsher than other products I\\&quot;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing, inform yourself (google chemical names and read articles at consumer-protection sites) on chemicals used in ALL cosmetic products including shampoos and childrens&#x27; products; many are not tested and lot listed as unsafe by FDA due to technicalities in laws that may favor manufacturers but may not protect consumers, as New York Times article (link below) explains. Caveat emptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/regulatory/claims/120476614.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYT article: Think Those Chemicals Have Been Tested?&lt;br /&gt;nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sunday-review/think-those-chemicals-have-been-tested.html</li>
    <li> My mom and I both always been self conscious of our short Asian eyelashes. We were using Latisse for awhile, but it was very expensive. In an attempt to try something less pricey, we both bought RapidLash and have been pleased with the results. It&#x27;s not quite as effective as Latisse, but for a fraction of the price, I speak for both of us when I say we&#x27;re sticking with this product. Another added bonus is that it lasts a long time, too.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product as well.. It is light and easy to apply and seems to also work. My mom (who is a natural alternative nurse) approved of the ingrediants of both the products that I am using, so I have no fears in that area. My stuff was delievered on time and so far I am happy.</li>
    <li> Dont expect more than genetics gave you!! I think they did grow but no more than they will ever grow.</li>
    <li> It truly works- My eyebrow was extremely thin due to over plucking and let me tell that I truly have eyebrows NOW!!!  Absolutely great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years with great success.  This last tube that I purchased didn&#x27;t work at all.  I have heard that there is a lot of counterfeit product out there and I believe that this is what I got. I have used this tube consistently for two and a half months with no results at all.  I don&#x27;t know how a buyer can tell until it is too late whether the product is the &amp;#34;real stuff&amp;#34; or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third tube of this stuff in 10 months and my lashes have become much longer and bald spots have filled in.  I&#x27;ve even had to trim a few because they grew freakishly long.  I&#x27;m too lazy (sleepy) in the evenings to remove all my makeup (I know, my bad) so I put it on under my makeup in the morning.  No irritation, no discoloration of eyes (mine are very dark brown anyway) or lids.  It&#x27;s nice not to have to use so much mascara to have great looking lashes, and being so long, mascara doesn&#x27;t glob up as easily.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much product in every tube but I&#x27;ve managed to scrounge out a days dose every day for 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and it&#x27;s really working.&lt;br /&gt;The other day I purchased one from Bed bath and beyond.Once I got home,I saw that the date on the bottom was 10/10. That meaning the expiration date was on 10/12..it was expired! I&#x27;m upset about that! I ordered one on Amazon and it got here on time, fast shipping, very well packaged. I saw at the bottom of the tube it says 12/12 so it expires 12/14. I&#x27;m satisfied as well since it was much cheaper than Bed Bath and Beyond. I will definitely repurchase from this seller. Thank you. A wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> This review is about whether Rapid Lash &amp; Brow works as an eyebrow enhancer. I have never used it on my lashes, only my eyebrows. I have been applying this product liberally every night for 7 weeks on my thin eyebrows and over the part of my original eyebrow line where there is currently no eyebrow hair. The packaging recommends using for at least 8 weeks to see results, however at 7 weeks there has been absolutely no new growth anywhere along my eyebrow line. While I suppose it&#x27;s possible that over the next week, which would be the 8th week of use, I could suddenly see sprouts of new hair in my eyebrows, like new seedlings popping up from the ground, I sincerely doubt it. As such, I don&#x27;t think this product works on eyebrows. I&#x27;m going to go see my regular physician to see if I can get a prescription for Latisse.</li>
    <li> Lashes are growing and I will continue use, It was just a little slower to see results than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I am so excited that I found thirst wonderful product! After just a few days the spaces in my eyebrows filled in and eyebrows seemed darker.  After just two weeks I saw a noticeable difference in the length of my lashes.  I plan to use this product indefinitely.</li>
