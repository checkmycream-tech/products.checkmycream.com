      <li>Perfect minimalist headgear for CPAP users</li>
      <li>It fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with these items.</li>
      <li>GREAT!!!  </li>
      <li>Item matches perfectly with the Swift FX nasal pillows.  </li>
      <li>However, I found that the ear loops work great!  </li>
      <li>This was the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>This is great for people who can&#x27;t tolerate straps around the head.</li>
      <li>Great concept.</li>
      <li>Its a great change to not have the headgear go around my head.  </li>
      <li>so why not get the replacement parts at a great price?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m delighted with this product .</li>
      <li>Good.  </li>
      <li>I am getting a good night sleep.</li>
      <li>good product ,good brand</li>
      <li>Alternatively, I found that using the covers that come with the over the head headgear fit perfectly and are easier to put on because they have Velcro -</li>
      <li>Loved the feel of the headgear.  </li>
      <li>Good quality product, would buy from again.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice option for a good price.</li>

      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Love &#x27;em!</li>
      <li>I love the loops!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this mask!  </li>
      <li>Nice mask  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as good or better than the one that came with my machine</li>
      <li>But it is nice as there is minimum contact in your hair.</li>
      <li>and this is by far the best for me.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need to tighten the loops too much to get a good seal, and this way, they don&#x27;t hurt my ears!  </li>
      <li>but then very comfortable.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this.</li>
      <li>Much better seal and breathing treatment</li>
      <li>I am so glad I ordered this headgear.  </li>
      <li>In fact, they work even better if you are a side sleeper.  </li>
      <li>i ended up ripping them off at night not being able to tolerate the cpap machine.</li>
      <li>but if you are like me and do not move much during sleep it may be great for you.</li>
      <li>I have been using the ear loops for more than a year.</li>
      <li>I have used Cpap for twenty years and have tried most systems</li>
      <li>Love this headgear.  </li>
      <li>As long as you have a way to anchor your c-pap hose so that it doesn&#x27;t pull the face mask, the loops work great!  </li>
      <li>Nice option with the ear straps rather than the full head straps.</li>
      <li>So much more comfortable than the Swift LT headset.</li>
      <li>I wish I could use this headgear, it is the most comfortable that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>THE BEST head gear for people with anxiety and claustrophobia due to CPAP mask.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
      <li>and they have been easy to put on and off.</li>
      <li>Easy to watch television and/or</li>
      <li>It is more comfortable then the full head set</li>
      <li>it is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>This is hugely important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge improvement over the mask.  </li>
      <li>Then I begin getting light strap marks on my cheeks that fade in an hour after waking.</li>
      <li>However, this is not as comfortable as the SnuggleCover, but it is tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I bought these loops about a week ago and they are so comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Not as comfortable as I thought they would be.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>This is the only mask I&#x27;ve ever been able to get a good seal with while sleeping on my side.  </li>
      <li>This is just what I wanted and the price was right fit my budget, and it was shipped quickly, I love how it fits.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see these</li>
      <li>These are replacement parts for my original Swift FX for Her Mask.</li>
      <li>You have a crappy fit either of mask/pillows or headgear/loops or both, which likely means you&#x27;re not using the mask/pillows/headgear/loops combination most appropriate for YOU.  </li>
      <li>Just as good as the one I bought from the medical supply store and paid 4 times the price as here!</li>
      <li>The irritation goes away quickly after getting up for the day.  </li>
      <li>Item was well packed and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>These are much easier than having full head-gear!</li>
      <li>The cover set is soft jersey and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my CPap machine because I really didn&#x27;t like the fit and feel of the head harness that came with it.</li>
      <li>I moved the pink wrap to that area and it helped, but then I noticed the pressure seemed to move more to the top.  </li>
      <li>I really liked this but can&#x27;t wear every night because in back of my ears get sore.</li>
      <li>I had hoped this would be more comfortable than the regular Swift FX headgear.</li>
      <li>This is the most natural feeling CPAP mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer mentioned, in 2 or 3 days, they softened right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
      <li>I love this product, and wish that I&#x27;d purchased it earlier!</li>
      <li>The hat hair was so severe, I cut all my hair off in the back and tackled the top with a hot iron every morning for *some* correction ....&lt;</li>
      <li>I thought there might be some ear discomfort,  but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that it is quite comfortable.</li>
      <li>And it IS VERY NECESSARY, and will give you better sleep once completed.</li>
      <li>DO make sure the straps are FLAT around your ears and on your face.  </li>
      <li>I really like these straps - takes a few days to become pliable - but the ear bands are so much more comfortable than full head gear and so easy to take off and put back on if I get up in middle of the night.  </li>
      <li>I sleep all night long with this headgear - love it - much better than other head gear&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
      <li>and it really helped.</li>
      <li>The mask had too many straps, pulling hair and making it harder to put on.  </li>
      <li>My ears really hurt when I wake up in the morning.</li>
      <li>Fits very well; no leaking.</li>
      <li>And it is so much easier to put on and take off (</li>
      <li>Perhaps the tension is too much on theirs.</li>
      <li>I am hoping they will not stretch too much before I can order another set.</li>
      <li>My experience with respiratory therapists (RTs) and medical device/supply companies is that they don&#x27;t carry the breadth of possibilities available.  </li>
      <li>Was so thankful these were in stock - needed a replacement set and didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a whole new assembly.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I think this hugs my face better, has less leakage when I shift my head</li>
      <li>I like the freedom of this better, but had some trouble getting used to the part going over the ears.</li>
      <li>I purchased this headgear to use with the Swift LT mask I have just to try before purchasing a new set.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely lightweight, soft and comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair in any way.</li>
      <li>Also inexpensive to replace, unlike pretty much every other headgear on earth.</li>
      <li>As with any Swift FX mask, the key is making sure you don&#x27;t have the gear pulling the mask too tight.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t recommend this mask enough, just be sure to leave the ear loops as loose as possible!  </li>
      <li>I have been steadily losing my hair for 7 or 8 years due  in large part to cpap headgear!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality product, would buy from again.</li>
    <li> After reading mixed reviews, I decided to try the Bella loops.  As long as you have a way to anchor your c-pap hose so that it doesn&#x27;t pull the face mask, the loops work great!  In fact, they work even better if you are a side sleeper.  This is the only mask I&#x27;ve ever been able to get a good seal with while sleeping on my side.  However, you do have to make sure the loops aren&#x27;t twisted on the back of your ears or you may end up waking with a sore ear.  As with any Swift FX mask, the key is making sure you don&#x27;t have the gear pulling the mask too tight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a huge improvement over the mask.  The mask had too many straps, pulling hair and making it harder to put on.  I like the freedom of this better, but had some trouble getting used to the part going over the ears. It puts pressure on the lower part behind my ear, almost like wearing new glasses.  I moved the pink wrap to that area and it helped, but then I noticed the pressure seemed to move more to the top.  I&#x27;m still getting used to it and finding I can&#x27;t use it if I&#x27;m stopped up.  If I do a inhaler stick, it clears me up enough to use it for a couple of hours before I have to pull it off.  Apparently that is enough because my hubby still got to sleep without being woken up by my snoring!</li>
    <li> Nice option with the ear straps rather than the full head straps. The straps &amp;#34;stretch out&amp;#34; after a few months but it&#x27;s still a nice option for a good price.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the over head style of head gear damaging my hair and making it frizzy. This was the perfect solution. And it is so much easier to put on and take off (especially when you have to get up in the middle of the night). It took me a few days to get used to having something around my ears. But now I don&#x27;t have any trouble with it. I have been using the ear loops for more than a year.</li>
    <li> Nice mask  that doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair!  Takes a few nights to get used to something behind the ears but then very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This headgear broke with less than 1 month of use.  Not very substantial&lt;br /&gt;and will require that I purchase another.  Not worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bella Loops for approximately 3 years.  They are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small face on a normal head that a mask never fit well, then I tried the Swift for Her nasal pillows.  Much better seal and breathing treatment ..... But I still couldn&#x27;t get the headgear to stay in the right place on my small face without ratcheting it down super-tight so that I had strap marks on my face until noon every day and hat hair contstantly (same as all other headgear)!  Even hot water washes in the morning didn&#x27;t get rid of my permanent hat hair :-(  The hat hair was so severe, I cut all my hair off in the back and tackled the top with a hot iron every morning for *some* correction ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Bella Loops approximately three years ago!  This keeps my nasal pillows in the correct place, sealed, and no more hat hair or strap marks!!  Seriously, try them if you use nasal pillows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this particular batch the Loops were stiffer than previous Loops I&#x27;ve purchased, and I wonder if their origin of Australia has something do with it.  Are they old?  Are they made out of a slightly different material?  No matter.  As another reviewer mentioned, in 2 or 3 days, they softened right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for Bella Loop Use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- DO make sure the straps are FLAT around your ears and on your face.  This is hugely important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- DO replace your Loops as they stretch out from use.  When they stretch out too much, they become thinner and eventually begin biting into the skin behind your ears because they&#x27;re TOO thin.  I find that as the straps stretch out too much, I have to tighten them as tight as they&#x27;ll go. Then I begin getting light strap marks on my cheeks that fade in an hour after waking. Approximately a week after the strap marks begin to appear, the loops begin biting into the skin on the back of my ears.  If I replace them as soon as I see a strap mark, no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- DO find a way to anchor your hose, preferably somewhere above your head.  I have my hose zip-tied to a slat on my blinds 12\\&quot; above my laying down position because (1) I don&#x27;t have a headboard and (2) I move around a lot when I sleep and (3) your hose needs to be anchored if the combination of Swift nasal pillows and Bella Loops are going to work for you. All the videos and literature tell us to anchor our hose and show us hoses that are anchored, but we don&#x27;t anchor our hoses because it&#x27;s inconvenient or not necessary or looks stupid or whatever. Let me comment here that my zip-tied hose on a blind slat looks no worse that my BiPAP and hoses next to the bed and on the bed and my pillows/loops on my head .... And it IS VERY NECESSARY, and will give you better sleep once completed. Anchor your hose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- DO remember that strap marks that don&#x27;t fade to gone within an hour of walking or are painful at any time is a sign that something is WRONG. You have a crappy fit either of mask/pillows or headgear/loops or both, which likely means you&#x27;re not using the mask/pillows/headgear/loops combination most appropriate for YOU.  My experience with respiratory therapists (RTs) and medical device/supply companies is that they don&#x27;t carry the breadth of possibilities available.  I had to research nasal pillows for myself and beat a drum to get them instead of yet another mask that wouldn&#x27;t work, then I had to research these Loops and buy them myself to try them.  Only then did I have a solution that fit both my small face and child-sized nostrils. Keep searching, keep looking, keep trying, and change suppliers/RTs if you have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in All: Bella Loops + Swft FX (or Swift FX for Her) Nasal Pillows &#x3D; Win for small faces, people who are tired of constant hat hair, and people who are having trouble being fitted with normal headgear. Also inexpensive to replace, unlike pretty much every other headgear on earth.</li>
    <li> It is more comfortable then the full head set and it isn&#x27;t as aggravating because you don&#x27;t have all the bands to adjust.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and this headgear is so much easier to put on and take off than my previous headgear, I really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out. I thought there might be some ear discomfort,  but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that it is quite comfortable. Additionally, I think this hugs my face better, has less leakage when I shift my head (I am a back/side sleeper). I love this product, and wish that I&#x27;d purchased it earlier!</li>
    <li> Love this headgear.  With the advent of obamacare, insurance will no longer cover this head gear but will give me headgear that I cannot use.  How stupid is that?  So, I will just buy this myself and let the other headgear sit unused.  What a waste!</li>
    <li> I have used Cpap for twenty years and have tried most systems and this is by far the best for me.  I sleep on my back with the tubing on my chest and do not move much so it stays in place well.  If you move much you might have some trouble keeping a seal because does not fit as tight as other systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the straps adjusted correctly I did not have any soreness on my ears and it does not leave marks on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having some hair loss from straps from other systems rubbling on my head.  I no longer have to worry about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very simple to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price I paid through Amazon was significantly less that what my coinsurance would have been if I had gone through my usual medical supply company. (not really sure how that&#x27;s possible)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not going to work for everyone but if you are like me and do not move much during sleep it may be great for you.</li>
    <li> I might get my hair back! ! I have been steadily losing my hair for 7 or 8 years due  in large part to cpap headgear!  (and as a woman that is REALLY bad!) This has been the easiest to don and doff than any other cpap gear. No issues with the ear soreness as some folks have said. Perhaps the tension is too much on theirs. I do wear glasses so perhaps that helps for my &amp;#34;toughness.&amp;#34;  It does cause leakage occaisionally that I awaken, but so do the other styles. I think that&#x27;s just me...</li>
    <li> I sleep all night long with this headgear - love it - much better than other head gear&lt;br /&gt;J from Colorado</li>
    <li> It is very uncomfortable on your ears. It does not hold nasal pillow in place. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural feeling CPAP mask I&#x27;ve ever used. Going to stick with this model from now on.</li>
    <li> Great concept. Not as comfortable as I thought they would be.  But it is nice as there is minimum contact in your hair.</li>
    <li> When using this gear, you do not have to worry about a cap over your head. It gives ease of movement when turning during sleep or just knocked out resting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would encourage anyone who uses a CPAP machine to try this type of gear</li>
    <li> Just as good as the one I bought from the medical supply store and paid 4 times the price as here!</li>
    <li> I purchased this headgear to use with the Swift LT mask I have just to try before purchasing a new set.  Loved the feel of the headgear.  Very comfortable.  Unfortunately for me the headgear did not keep the mask in place.  I had read reviews that said basically the same thing but wanted to try for myself.  I wish I could use this headgear, it is the most comfortable that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s meat all expectations. It&#x27;s as good or better than the one that came with my machine</li>
    <li> I love the loops! I have arthritic shoulders which make it impossible for me to even put my hair in a ponytail, so I knew I&#x27;d have problems with headgear. I was so excited to see these and they have been easy to put on and off. I use a SnuggleHose cover, so that keeps the tubing from sliding around and dragging the mask from the proper position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem i had was they were causing me pain behind my ears, so I purchased the SnuggleCover  set for them and it really helped. The cover set is soft jersey and very comfortable. However, it is somewhat difficult to thread the loops through them, and time consuming. Alternatively, I found that using the covers that come with the over the head headgear fit perfectly and are easier to put on because they have Velcro - so no threading necessary. However, this is not as comfortable as the SnuggleCover, but it is tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat is that if you have lower earlobes that are not separated from your face, the loops will probably not stay on, although some users have reported they can still use them.</li>
    <li> These are much easier than having full head-gear! I&#x27;m a large woman, but apparently I&#x27;m supposed to be very small. I have small ears and a small nose, so sometimes these want to come off and at other times (depending on how I&#x27;ve got my head) they hurt my ears. Now ask me if I would stop using them. NO WAY!</li>
    <li> I really liked this but can&#x27;t wear every night because in back of my ears get sore.</li>
    <li> Execellent!!!  I bought these loops about a week ago and they are so comfortable.  I changed from the Swift FX for her and the comfort level of my mask has improved 100%.  Try them you have nothing to loose and only comfort to gain.</li>
    <li> good product ,good brand</li>
    <li> Perfect minimalist headgear for CPAP users</li>
    <li> The headgear is convenient for me to use. I am hoping they will not stretch too much before I can order another set.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that these would work, but I am very happy with them as they are so much less restrictive than other head gear.</li>
    <li> Was so thankful these were in stock - needed a replacement set and didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a whole new assembly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my CPap machine because I really didn&#x27;t like the fit and feel of the head harness that came with it. I like the design of this, but the straps behind my ears caused irritation and sore ears. I took the cloth off the head harness and adapted it to the silicon loops that go behind my ears, and all is well now. I think this would be better if they added a cover or some cushioning to the loops behind the ears.</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would be more comfortable than the regular Swift FX headgear. However, it was difficult to keep it in place unless the straps were pulled fairly tight (the weight of the tube pulled it away from my nose), which then hurt the backs of my ears. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the regular headgear.</li>
    <li> Nasal pillows, together with the hose, are too heavy for this headgear. My ears really hurt when I wake up in the morning. I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t smash down my hair, but this isn&#x27;t working. I had to switch back to my old standby.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy, would not stay on once I laid down, never got it adjusted properly. Too hard to adjust right.</li>
    <li> I do not move around alot in bed but this headgear will not stay on the ears. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is great for people who can&#x27;t tolerate straps around the head. They hold the nasal pillows in place throughout the night. I have a few patients with prior head or brain trauma that can only use the Bella Headgear. If ear soreness develops, a little gauze wrapped around the loop should alleviate that.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to see this head gear but could not use it as it was painful behind my ears.</li>
    <li> I really like these straps - takes a few days to become pliable - but the ear bands are so much more comfortable than full head gear and so easy to take off and put back on if I get up in middle of the night.  Easy to watch television and/or read with the straps on - I only get air leakage when the straps are too loose.</li>
    <li> A must have for the nasal pillows. I pay extra for the RESMED nasal pillows and head gear.  cannot wear the hard plastic, these products are also latex free.LOVE this.</li>
    <li> When I was tested a few years ago, I used this headgear. I still use it and would use no other! Have tried others but always go back to &#x27;Bella&#x27;. Have to get used to a little soreness behind ears until you become accustomed to them then soreness goes away. Doesn&#x27;t mess up your hair either! Love &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of the Bella Headgear.  Love it!  Item matches perfectly with the Swift FX nasal pillows.  Comfortable to use.  The only time I feel any irritation  behind my ears is when I sleep all night on my side.  The irritation goes away quickly after getting up for the day.  Item was well packed and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Not as comfortable as my head unit or as tight to keep the nose plugs in place ! Made my ears feel sore when I woke up as I am side sleeper !</li>
    <li> THE BEST head gear for people with anxiety and claustrophobia due to CPAP mask.&lt;br /&gt;all the different masks i tried was a nightmare.  i ended up ripping them off at night not being able to tolerate the cpap machine.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted and the price was right fit my budget, and it was shipped quickly, I love how it fits.</li>
    <li> My old Swift FX for her headgear has been in use for almost two years and I needed a change. I&#x27;ve been padding the straps with moleskin since it was causing skin breakdown and the bulky straps were uncomfortable since I&#x27;m a side sleeper. Enter the Bella. It&#x27;s extremely lightweight, soft and comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair in any way. Since my hair is well past my tailbone, not rubbing or tugging on it is a huge plus. The straps on this are very thin but still strong, and they don&#x27;t seem to put as much pressure on my cheekbones as the old headgear. They may eventually cause some soreness to the backs of my ears, but if that happens I&#x27;ll go back to the old headgear for a few days to give my ears a rest. Not overtightening the straps should help prevent soreness .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m delighted with this product . If that changes after a few months I&#x27;ll come back and update this review, but for now I think this is a solution to my headgear problems.</li>
    <li> I could never adjust these tightly enough to keep the nose pillows secured.  I would be awakened by the air leaking out of the pillows.  Also, these were very painful on my ears.  They just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried other headgear and this is the best by far being that I am claustrophobic.</li>
    <li> This assembly is a lifesaver.  I have had much trouble trying to use the headgear I originally got through my doctor&#x27;s supply rep.  I quite often had to remove it in the middle of the night.  This assembly is perfect.......I sleep with it all night.</li>
    <li> Hurts my ears if I make it where the mask doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> It does not stay in place during the night.  It leaks air causing hissing that is annoying and is loud enough to wake you up.</li>
    <li> Good.  I already use.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!!  Keeps hair from being pressed down come morning.</li>
    <li> These are replacement parts for my original Swift FX for Her Mask. Way cheaper than the mask I received from my medical supplier. Since I have a $1500 deductible I end up paying for my masks anyway so why not get the replacement parts at a great price? I am very happy with these items.</li>
    <li> So much more comfortable than the Swift LT headset. Fits very well; no leaking. Cushioned so it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
    <li> It fits perfectly. I am getting a good night sleep.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this headgear.  It has made a world of difference in the comfort.  Its a great change to not have the headgear go around my head.  It is very comfortable around my ears and the fit is perfect.</li>
    <li> Will not hold the weight of the mask &amp; hose with out bending my ears and cutting into the top of my ears.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mask that doesn&#x27;t leave crease marks on my hair and isn&#x27;t a pain to get on and off.  I was a bit nervous that the straps would hurt my ears after reading some of the reviews. However, I found that the ear loops work great!  The secret is leaving them VERY loose.  Don&#x27;t put the mask on while sitting up in bed and tighten the loops before laying down, because then it&#x27;s tighter than necessary and you&#x27;ll probably wake up with sore ears in the morning.  Instead, while laying down, put on the ear loops on and  leave them very loose.  I found that gravity helps keep the nasal pillows in place and I don&#x27;t need to tighten the loops too much to get a good seal, and this way, they don&#x27;t hurt my ears!  I love this mask!  Now I can take showers and wash my hair again in the evenings before going to bed without worrying that my mask straps will crease my hair.  Can&#x27;t recommend this mask enough, just be sure to leave the ear loops as loose as possible!  Love it!</li>
