      <li>so I&#x27;ll be ordering more</li>
      <li>Most of the product is going to be swept away on your pillow case as opposed to being on your face, working.</li>

      <li>If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to decipher whether or not your skin has improved, take pictures beforehand and use that as a measurement.the hyperpigmentation spots after each time I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are so many postive things I could say for this im getting paler by the minute.</li>
      <li>You have to allow the fade milk product to sit on your face for many hours at a time.</li>
      <li>Because this product might have a greater impact on some skin tones over others.</li>
      <li>The result, I became most darker and darker.</li>
      <li>more often I also Model so it keeps my skin one smooth complextion</li>
      <li>and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Its Very Good For Dry Skin</li>
      <li>Otherwise, works fine, and you can&#x27;t beat the price, can you?</li>
      <li>And the scent is fine to me.</li>
      <li>It also contains vitamins C &amp; E (which are important for the skin) and it&#x27;s also recommended by the Skin Care Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luminescent and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Has a light fragrance that is tolerable.</li>

      <li>it actually tones the skin and works great with palmers skin serum.</li>
      <li>I use this along with the regular moisturizer and am happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>(in general, my skin is good)</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>Fast forward many months</li>
      <li>This is probably true, probably not.</li>
      <li>Subtle, but I am happy to keep using this product!</li>
      <li>I feel like it&#x27;s helped some, but hasn&#x27;t made a tremendous improvement.  </li>
      <li>And here, we want to see results and quickly.</li>
      <li>If you are already lighter and you just want smooth flawless looking skin thin</li>
      <li>And here, we want to see results and quickly.</li>
      <li>If I were to use it every day like the instructions suggest I will run out quickly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>I would definitely reccomend trying this, because it is amazing.</li>
      <li>since started using Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success head to toe.  </li>
      <li>(this is where skin success comes</li>
      <li>Then about 6-7 months in, one day my boyfriend commented that he liked the makeup I had on (I recently bought BB cream foundation and had showed it to him) and I told him I wasn&#x27;t wearing any foundation!</li>
      <li>But, truly, I&#x27;m so thrilled with Skin Success that I couldn&#x27;t possibly take away a star for that.</li>
      <li>I drink so much water, my urine is more clear than the polluted tap water</li>
      <li>I drink so much water, my urine is more clear than the polluted tap water</li>
      <li>Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good.</li>
      <li>Anybody who&#x27;s done some of the most basic research on lightening agents, like hydroquinone, knows that you&#x27;re not supposed to be out in the sun when it&#x27;s sitting on your skin.</li>
      <li>Smooth And Soft</li>
      <li>Make sure to continue to use it for even brighter skin as a daily lotion.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pretty.</li>
      <li>This is my first time purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>What an absolute surprise!  </li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try more regular exfoliation on those areas to try and counteract that side effect.  </li>
      <li>Use this daily and love it</li>
      <li>The facial hair catches the product as opposed to the skin, so applying this product on a face that has facial hair is not as effective as it would be if your face were smooth and free from any facial obstacles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I stopped using it every day, maybe if I continued to use it every day I&#x27;d see better results in the long run.  </li>
      <li>I know that sleeping on your back is not the most comfortable position for some people, especially if you, like me, have suffered with asthma before.</li>
      <li>Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t tell you how much SPF is on this thing, so you don&#x27;t know how much time</li>
      <li>and I do see the overall tone does look more even and somehow a little more brighter, too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Cleared my skin of dark marks left after a bizzarre couple of weeks of an acne outbreak. To combat that problem, I drank wheat grass juice every day and applied twice a day after washing my face. Worked great! I received lots of compliments on my skin after. I discontinued use once the scars cleared because I don&#x27;t like some of the chemicals in this product. I would use again, temporarily though, if I needed to get rid of scars.</li>
    <li> Causing my skin to break out</li>
    <li> I just started using this product for about 2 weeks and I can see change I am light skin African american female... and im loving my results :) ....&lt;br /&gt;I will definatly be using there products more often I also Model so it keeps my skin one smooth complextion</li>
    <li> I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly.  Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good.</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin, and as such it seems to show every little mark that nature seems to throw at me.  Plus my skin is so sensitive that a lot of products aggravate it.  As a child I used to have chicken skin on my upper arms and what&#x27;s left now is very faint reddish \\&quot;scars\\&quot;, so I decided to try this product on my arms first to test how my skin would react.  What an absolute surprise!  The skin under my arms is like milk.  Luminescent and smooth.  I just want to pet it!  And the reddish skin on my upper arms has lightened considerably.  I figure over time it will be unnoticeable.  I can&#x27;t wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since started using Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success head to toe.  There are no adverse reactions.  It has a very subtle pleasant smell and goes on so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one chink I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you&#x27;re running around and getting sweaty it makes you ULTRA sweaty.  I kept wiping under my breasts because the lotion together with sweat makes you...well, I hate to use the word, but kinda slimy.  Rather like a sunblock would do.  But, truly, I&#x27;m so thrilled with Skin Success that I couldn&#x27;t possibly take away a star for that.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It moisturizes without being thick or greasy. I have already noticed some darker areas are beginning to fade. My skin is brown and the dark spots that are fading is noticeable. It has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling very soft. The ony problem I have with this product is that the bottle seems small. If I were to use it every day like the instructions suggest I will run out quickly. Unfortunately my face did not agree with this product. I think it might be the sunscreen in it that made me break out a little. But otherwise, I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple weeks now and have not noticed any lightening; however, the lotion is a great moisturizer and can see a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of this stuff because i love palmers products. i was using the fade cream with their coco butter lotion mixed as a body lotion and they have this! What more could you ask for a skin bleach? This product also contains retinol which helps with skin cell turn over which is very amazing. There are so many postive things I could say for this im getting paler by the minute. Now what i recomend doing is buying kojic acid soap which is really good for your skin (skin lightening soap i:e kojie san) and using this product after the shower you will notice the diffrence i would say in as little as two weeks i know i did. I do recomend you do a test day because hydryquonine can cause a rash and irratate the skin ( which is why i stopped using ambi because the mix was to harsh) this stuff just harsh enough to get you through the dark patches without the crappy side effects at least for me (pun intended). Consistantsy is key here apply it twice a day in affected areas or all over. It does say on the bottle if no results after 4 months discontinue useing it. Personally i recomend using it for four months out of the year because this really turns back time on the harsh enviorment on your skin and leaves it with a snow white untouched look and i really appreciate that.</li>
    <li> good essence on my skin</li>
    <li> I have bad scars on my face from acne, they used to be so bad that makeup couldn&#x27;t even cover them. I started using this in november and I can definitely see a difference; the scars aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they are now coverable and even without covering them they&#x27;re bearable. And I should say that I don&#x27;t even use this everyday like it says in the directions, which says to use it twice a day, I probably only use it every other day and sometimes I skip. I would definitely reccomend trying this, because it is amazing.</li>
    <li> works really good.. i have no complains, i haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to see results i guess but at least i haven&#x27;t had any negative</li>
    <li> I like this product it actually tones the skin and works great with palmers skin serum. Has a light fragrance that is tolerable.</li>
    <li> After using this I started developing little red pimple like bumps on wherever I used it. I gave it away to my sister I&#x27;ll just stick with CeraVe SA it&#x27;s a better lotion.</li>
    <li> Been using this lotion for years.. It is not greasy and absorbs well although it doesn&#x27;t really lighten the age spots.  I only use it once a day or every other day so if you used it twice a day every day it might lighten them.</li>
    <li> Does Not Do With It Stays It Does It Did Not Make My Skin Any Lighter And I Been Using It For About 5 Months I Like It Because It Does Leave Your Skin Silky Smooth And Soft Its Very Good For Dry Skin</li>
    <li> Brightened the skin on my legs but left them feeling dry. That could be the sunscreen element. The very best body moisturizer I ever found was the Vaseline w/alpha hydroxy, but they discontinued it (twice).</li>
    <li> My niece asked me to buy her this product and she was not impressed with the results. She wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff is doing the trick to lighten the post-acne marks on my shoulders, upper arms and back, but now I&#x27;m starting to develop itty bitty bumps all over my arms where I applied it.  It is VERY moisturizing...maybe it&#x27;s clogging up my pores? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I&#x27;ll try more regular exfoliation on those areas to try and counteract that side effect.  Otherwise, works fine, and you can&#x27;t beat the price, can you?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disapointed I was using this product with a soap each morning and night for 2 months. The result, I became most darker and darker. If you are a black african please don&#x27;t use this product it&#x27;s a waist of money!!</li>
    <li> While this was moisturizing, I used the entire bottle- 2 applications per day- and it did nothing to lighten my darkened elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> Use this daily and love it</li>
    <li> I bought this in the drugstore but am having trouble finding it now so am turning to Amazon - hope it&#x27;s just as good quality. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about year now, mainly on my face, arms, hands. I have naturally brown/tan skin that can get slight discoloration patches when exposed to the sun long. I also sometimes get slight freckles on my shoulders/arms and ashiness in elbows. After using this daily, I wouldn&#x27;t say I noticed a huge difference (in general, my skin is good) but i liked it as a light moisturizer and it has some sunscreen so I was happy.  And the scent is fine to me. Then about 6-7 months in, one day my boyfriend commented that he liked the makeup I had on (I recently bought BB cream foundation and had showed it to him) and I told him I wasn&#x27;t wearing any foundation! So I examined my skin more closely and I do see the overall tone does look more even and somehow a little more brighter, too. Subtle, but I am happy to keep using this product!</li>
    <li> I started using this on my elbows which were dark and this product has lightened the area well. It also removed the blemish marks on my back.  This is something I heard about through my friend at work so I searched on Amazon for it. The fragrance is pretty. This is something I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing this product. I purchased the soap and it was suggested that I use it with the lotion together. I want to clear up a few dark spots on my torso from surgery and pregnancy.</li>
    <li> The product quality is good. So far it has cleared most of the dark spots on my face. Great product to try.</li>
    <li> This product goes on runny and leaves a thick, gross residue after it dries. It does not feel good on the skin. I did notice a small difference in my scars, however I was using other lightening products.</li>
    <li> I have been using palmers for about 6-7 weeks where i can tell big differenxe already as far as gettn rid of sun spots and smoothing out my skin.  I have to say i am impressed with such an inexpensive product. I use at nite and again n morn after washing my face. ( apply, let dry, then put make up on)</li>
    <li> I purchased this over a year ago because I had so many post-acne hyperpigmentation marks on my face, including really dark and noticeable spots. I used this product for some time and for whatever reason, I moved on from it and stopped using it. I do remember it being decent, I don&#x27;t remember why I did halt using this. Fast forward many months, I decided, \\&quot;I purchased this, why not employ the contents to completion?\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been utilizing this for a few weeks now (solely on my face), and have really seen a difference. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that every day in the last few weeks that I&#x27;ve applied this to my face, when I wake up and look in the mirror to see if any changes have occurred, I do observe that the post-acne spots have either disappeared or have diminished some what in tone. So people might want to know, what is my skin color? Because this product might have a greater impact on some skin tones over others. This is probably true, probably not. My facial skin color is that of a tanned brown skin-color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people who&#x27;ve recorded no results and have seen no visible improvement in their appearance here are some tips that I&#x27;ve carried out in hopes of ameliorating my post-acne skin condition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash your face at least twice a day (especially if you have either oily skin or medium-oily skin). I know this is difficult to do. For me, I come home after 11pm many times, and I&#x27;m too tired to brush my teeth, let alone wash my face, but this is vital in keeping up the fight for advancing the changes you want to see on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You have to allow the fade milk product to sit on your face for many hours at a time. For me, if I&#x27;m not leaving the house for whatever reason, I try to keep this on my face for AT LEAST 7-8 hours. I can keep it on for as much as 10 hours. You want the maximum effect of this item, and the only way it can do that is if you allow it contact with your face for a substantial period of time. 4-5 hours isn&#x27;t going to cut it and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the results produced weren&#x27;t too noticeable or impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Ignore the \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; claim on this product. Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t tell you how much SPF is on this thing, so you don&#x27;t know how much time this fade milk is allowing you protection from the sun. Secondly, and this is important, it makes no mention of UVA and UVB protection, because it doesn&#x27;t have any. And third of all, and this is also a significant point: this has hydroquinone in it. Hydroquinone is the lightening/bleaching agent. Anybody who&#x27;s done some of the most basic research on lightening agents, like hydroquinone, knows that you&#x27;re not supposed to be out in the sun when it&#x27;s sitting on your skin. It&#x27;s counterproductive. In fact, they warn you that bleaching agents can have the opposite effect when you&#x27;re exposed to the sun, it can actually make your skin darker, not lighter. When I know that I&#x27;m going to go outside, especially for an extended period of time, I almost never use this product, and certainly never for its sunscreen purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) When you sleep, sleep on your back. This goes for any product that you apply topically. I used to apply so many products on my face only to consciously sleep on my sides a few hours later. Like using bleaching agents and then exposing yourself to the sun, this also defeats the purpose. Most of the product is going to be swept away on your pillow case as opposed to being on your face, working. I know that sleeping on your back is not the most comfortable position for some people, especially if you, like me, have suffered with asthma before. First control your asthma (this is vital) and sleep on your back. This will ensure that the probability of the contents of the product staying on your face as opposed to being scraped away is higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The directions instructs you to \\&quot;apply a small amount as a thin layer on the affected area...\\&quot; Booooooring. I usually apply a liberal amount onthe hyperpigmentation spots after each time I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Drink a lot of water. It does not matter what product you use, using them is only part of the battle. Your skin is like a child, you have to constantly tend to it by hydrating it. I drink so much water, my urine is more clear than the polluted tap water I drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Think also about purchasing a sunscreen like AMBI (Skincare Even &amp; Clear Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30). It&#x27;s a legit sunscreen that also evens your skin tone, so that should complement this product, when you&#x27;re looking to go outside. It also contains vitamins C &amp; E (which are important for the skin) and it&#x27;s also recommended by the Skin Care Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) For the guys, shave your face at least every other day. The facial hair catches the product as opposed to the skin, so applying this product on a face that has facial hair is not as effective as it would be if your face were smooth and free from any facial obstacles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) Lastly, you MUST get sufficient sleep (at least 8 hours worth). Sleeping rejuvenates both your body and especially your skin. I&#x27;ve had episodes where I washed my face, coated it with facial products and then woke up some hours later, horrified with what was staring back at me. I didn&#x27;t allow my body and skin enough time to relax and recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It annoys me when people rate products on here and yet don&#x27;t explain in details why they graded it the way they did. I rated this product four stars out of five due to my perception of this product working properly. The reason why I didn&#x27;t award it the full five stars is because this isn&#x27;t a perfect solution. You do have to give it time to work. Also, I&#x27;m not convinced that this alone will lighten your skin and diminish the post-acne marks. This is only one part of a larger process that should include both natural and supplemental means to enhance your skin&#x27;s appearance, from drinking a sufficient amount of water daily to eating healthily to using other (hopefully safe) even-toned/lightening skin products when you&#x27;re not utilizing this one, to getting a sufficient amount of sleep, etc. So this alone won&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company recommends that you use it for 3 months and discontinue use if you see no apparent results. Most people aren&#x27;t going to wait 3 months, let&#x27;s face it. We live in an instant-gratification era where we want what we want when we want it. And here, we want to see results and quickly. Use this for 2-3 weeks constantly, like I advised above. Wash your face twice a day, apply this twice a day (if you can), leave it on for many hours at a time, sleep on your back (and get at least 8 hours), etc. If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to decipher whether or not your skin has improved, take pictures beforehand and use that as a measurement.the hyperpigmentation spots after each time I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Drink a lot of water.

    <li> again I have brought a lot of their products and they all do what they say they will do  great great products</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Works wonders !!Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since July now so almost 3 months. The dark spots are still there but I am noticing some faint fading, so I guess that&#x27;s good. Hopefully after prolonged use I can see a bigger difference.</li>
    <li> I use to use this Fade Milk 3 years ago and it worked but can&#x27;t remember why I stopped until recently when I started using it again. I take a star off because I got a small rash on my left elbow, that&#x27;s when I remember that it use to give me rashes on my elbows. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this during the day if you&#x27;re going to be outside in the sun. When you&#x27;re wearing this lotion and sweat its not a pleasant feeling, it makes me feel sticky and want to shower all the time. Using it once daily before bed made a big difference and now I love it. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, the smell isn&#x27;t bad either. In the beginning my left elbow was itchy and I got a small rash, but after a week of ignoring it, I guess my skin adopt. The lotion is white but when I shower in the morning after using it at night, the washcloth/soap sud/water have a dirty pinkish color, this only happens when I use the lotion. I would assume that&#x27;s fading my skin tone, that&#x27;s the only explanation I can come up with. Over all this lotion works in lightening the skin, as well as making skin feel smooth and well hydrated. I only use it on my body and so far my tan is lightening and my skin is slowly going back to my natural light tone. I highly recommend if you&#x27;re not allergic to hydroquinone.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen that much of a change.  I use it on my body and face which is crazy because I break out easily but my face like this.  I use it every day. I have a lot of discoloration and my skin tone is brown.  Think Kerry Washington from Scandal. I&#x27;ve noticed a slight change in the texture of my skin but it has yet to fade my dark spots.  I may be too dark to notice a significant color change in the scars I have. This product is hard to find in stores by the way.  I don&#x27;t like the smell that much.  It doesn&#x27;t stink but I like to smell fruity so I&#x27;ve added this to some other lotions when I want a more fragrance on.  I&#x27;ve mixed this into my Chanel Chance body moisture! Lol.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product at a drugstore. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would be but as I had developed a few spots and blemishes on my face I decided to give it a try. Experience has been really good with this product. It&#x27;s been very effective for me in clearing up any blemishes. I didn&#x27;t have a lot to begin with as I&#x27;m blessed with good skin. I also tried it on my body and the product helped just a little bit. I have come to the conclusion that this product helps in clearing any blemishes, but does not lighten the skin as such.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months. This product does work, my skin has lighten by 1 shade and brighten leaving me glowing. After my bath i put this lotion all over my body. You must keep using it over and over again to see results. The problem with lotion and creams is I get tired of rubbing it on. Lol.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love this stuff. I use it to clear my skin. It also is a great moisturizer. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> i bought this in hopes it would help my post acne scars.  (very pigmented scars from cystic acne picking)  i&#x27;ve had some of the scars for a very long time.  I feel like it&#x27;s helped some, but hasn&#x27;t made a tremendous improvement.  I stopped using it every day, maybe if I continued to use it every day I&#x27;d see better results in the long run.  I am also using one other product to try to help my skins texture.  All in all I would say this is an okay product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it once daily for about a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed any change.  Maybe a slight fading but....Don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.  Quite runny in consistency.</li>
    <li> Great product love it</li>
    <li> I initially used this on my face and developed a hideous rash. I am now just using it as a post-shower moisturizer and it is quite effective.</li>
    <li> Let me start this off by saying that I have had acne scars for 6 years now, since I was 13.&lt;br /&gt;When I was a kid, I had pretty clear skin, the odd pimple or two but nothing major. One evening, I decided that I was going to clear my almost entirely clear skin (at the time) of the few pimples on it by using a trick that I had heard about- toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;And so began my 6 year struggle against a self imposed skin condition that zapped confidence, destroyed chances of dates, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 6 years and several hundred dollars spent on acne scar products, and I hadn&#x27;t achieved any progress at all.&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I decided that it had been long enough, and I started to look into laser treatment (that was almost certainly going to bankrupt me, or at least try to). Before I decided to go forward with that treatment, I decided to give the skin care route one last shot (this is where skin success comes in).&lt;br /&gt;Five weeks of use, and I have NEVER felt better about my appearance in my life.&lt;br /&gt;These days I&#x27;m trying to hold back my ego, where I was devoid of confidence (just kidding).&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, I don&#x27;t give my face a second thought anymore, even when the odd pimple shows up.&lt;br /&gt;Stop living life at the margins and join the party.</li>
    <li> It smells pretty good does a good job with fading so I&#x27;ll be ordering more I&#x27;m almost out and it last a long time to..</li>
    <li> I use this along with the regular moisturizer and am happy with the product.  I believe it helps with redness but it is not a miracle so don&#x27;t expect perfection but it does have some benefits.</li>
    <li> ITS A OKAY PRODUCT IT MAKES MY SKIN FEELING GREASY AND OILY!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I had bad dark scars and also wanted to lighten my skin. I have gone through 2 bottles so far of everyday use and not only have the dark scars dissappeared my skin is brighter and smoother. This stuff is great. Make sure to continue to use it for even brighter skin as a daily lotion. I do know however that this product will not effectively work on dark skin. It makes dark skin turn gray and very silver looking. If you are already lighter and you just want smooth flawless looking skin thin this is it. This product does contain parabens which are chemicals that are in most things we use, but deemed somewhat unsafe. This product does lighten the skin because of hydroquione in it but i doubt it will make one turn \\&quot;michael jackson light\\&quot; it that is what you are searching for. Basically this product will brighten your skin and give an all one color and one tone appearance and may lighten your skin a few shades. This takes alot of use though. More than what is stated on the bottle.</li>
    <li> After trying a number other moisturizing and blemish removing skin lotions, my wife settled on this one and has recommended it to several of her friends.</li>
    <li> IT LIGHTENED MY MARKS AND IS VERY GOOD RO THE SKIN INSTEAD OF BUYING THE SEPARATE ONE I USE THIS ON MY FACE. GREAT.</li>
