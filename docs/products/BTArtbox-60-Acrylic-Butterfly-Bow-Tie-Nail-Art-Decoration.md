<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> these are okay they are more bulky then i thought i love the look thow the colors are amazing thanks</li>
    <li> Product arrived when it was estimated to arrive. It came with a  variety of colors. It looks a little cheesy but good enough for nail art/designs</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves them they were the first of three items I ordered to show it shipped the same day I ordered as well :). I was excited to them show before the actual projected date to</li>
    <li> Perfect size for the width of your nails. There are four of each color which is nice as well. And they do come with the case shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> these bows are very cute and fun to put on my nails, however they are too large (i have normal size hands)</li>
    <li> Very Good!!! We like very much...We will order some more in next time...It is nice and beautiful....Recommend to buy some more in the future....</li>
    <li> I still have them, and I bought them a long time ago I get compliments all the time, how pretty they are.</li>
    <li> I love them! what more can I say? These are perfect for nails and the sparkly ones are super cute!</li>
    <li> These bows come with 5 of each color but all of the colored bows have some glitter on it. Still usable but I really wanted plain colored bows</li>
    <li> Love these!! Bows are cute and theres 5 of every color which was enough for me. They even came in early. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I think the only downfall to this is that it&#x27;s kind of weird to place on your regular nails unless they are long and very healthy (they dont easily break meaning). Otherwise I think it&#x27;s more for acrylic nails. But I still absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> these items were purchased and my daughter is having lots of fun making nail designs for her and her friends, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely adorable! Came in all the colors i could have wanted, petfect sizes and love the case they came in!</li>
    <li> These are the cutest things ever !  I got them for my nails and they look great on them, they not too big or too small. Defiantly try them out.</li>
    <li> These are so cute! I got them in two weeks (I live in Texas) They came with 5 of each color: lime green, hot pink, white, light pink, red, black, dark purple, light purple, dark blue, light blue, yellow, and orange. They have glitter on them which the picture doesn&#x27;t show, but I actually like these better! I&#x27;ll definitely buy more(:</li>
    <li> These are flat on the back so they don&#x27;t fit the contour of nails.  Had a hard time getting them to stay on, too.  They&#x27;re colorful, though, and luckily they ended up finding a good home in a five-year-olds craft arsenal.  One Barbie got a makeover with them.  She looks okay, I guess.</li>
    <li> The bows look nothing like the ones in the picture they&#x27;re smaller I don&#x27;t mind though  they&#x27;re still cute. They do come in different colors and with the container:)</li>
    <li> This nail art is too big for my nail bed. I used nail glue to apply them but the bows are flat and too large.</li>
    <li> havent purchased a good glue that would hold them in position. i received every single color. but next time ill aim a bit smaller. this style is too bulky for me.</li>
    <li> These are very cute, exactly how they look in the picture, comes with little case &amp; everything. The only downside is that I like to paint my own natural nails, &amp; I like them short &amp; my nails are pretty little...these bows are kinda big, about the width of my nails so if I were to put them on my nails it would pretty much take up my whole nail, &amp; they are flat so they stick out &amp; catch on everything. Like I said they are very cute &amp; I&#x27;m sure they would work with acrylic nails but not natural nails.</li>
    <li> The bows are really cute perfect for acrylic nails!. They did come in a little late than what I was expecting it to come.. but otherwise they are super cute from each color there&#x27;s five bows but some of them only have 4 so in total is not 60 pieces its only like 50</li>
    <li> Very nice acrylic bows perfect size for acrylic nails and they come in different colors and they are so cheap. I save alot of money with this cheap stuff for acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> Girls want me to order more of these.  They are just decorating their cell phones, slippers, purses and making hair accessories.</li>
    <li> I received these 2 weeks before the delivery estimate witch is great, although I wish there were more per color! Also they replaced the light baby pink with orange for me and I wanted the little kit for the light pink, white and red so I had to order another kit. Aside from that they look cute on nail!!</li>
    <li> Missing bows didn&#x27;t not recieve all probably thought I wasn&#x27;t going to check but I did I would like a refund if possible</li>
    <li> This item came way earlier than expected.  I&#x27;m in love with all the colors &amp; the small organized container they came in.  They&#x27;re the perfect size for your nails and they even had glitter on them which you can&#x27;t really tell by the picture.  So cute!</li>
    <li> These are cute but a little to big on the nails great colors will find another use for these cute bows .</li>
    <li> These bows are huge!  I purchased them to apply to children&#x27;s fingertips and the bows are just as large as the nail beds.  I am disappointed in this product and am apprehensive about purchasing something similar.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know when it will come or when it will come I ordered this back in april and it is almost July so when you order this beware</li>
    <li> I Loved The Bows, Do Not Listen To All Negative Feedback</li>
    <li> love these bows! i do alot of nail art and these are great! but if you have small nails, dont use they will over power your nail!</li>
    <li> I received these bows yesterday, I have not yet used them on my nails yet but plan to soon. I am just getting into nail art and decided to buy these when looking for an assortment of nail art supplies to try different designs with. They are a medium size and what I think are the perfect size for a nail. Probably too big for the pinky finger though but again I haven&#x27;t put them on yet. I received five of each color and they all have a nice sparkle on them. They are packaged pretty nice but I did receive one broken white bow which I had to throw out. Other than that everything was good and I plan to update when I use them. Does anyone have any recommendations on what to apply them with to make sure they stick?</li>
    <li> If your looking for a simple nail art, buy these! Love em to death! Great quality for price! They have sparkles on them which is a plus for me!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, I love these and fast delivery</li>
    <li> All bows arrived in the case shown above and the amount in the description is the amount of bows that arrived. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> They are very cute and I love them and they are very stylish and what are &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; right one cute accessory for your nails</li>
    <li> Very cute bows and not to big just wish you could buy more of certain colors but I will buy again</li>
    <li> Bows were great. Looks great on short nails. The only draw back is that they do get caught in your hair occasionally.</li>
    <li> I like these alot but I do wish that they were bigger ...I actually thought they were when I purchased them but that wasnt the case. ...its worth the money though (:</li>
    <li> I like the colors of the butterfly bow, the size is perfect, and is a new design that I can do for my customers.</li>
    <li> Good its allsome a kind of big but i could filled it fast shipping good pretty big huge colorfull it was lovely</li>
    <li> Great item but the packaging is near impossible to open! I actually broke a nail opening it. :(</li>
    <li> yes everything was good with this order came on time</li>
    <li> These are the cutest! I was afraid they would be too big but they are perfect!!!! Someone compared them to the size of pez but they are smaller and AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I did not get my stuff yet!! And I&#x27;ve been waiting for it and it needs to come. Right now,</li>
    <li> Oh these bows are the cutest embellishments. They all come in a nicely divided container, so you don&#x27;t have to worry where are you going to put them. Beautiful. I wonder if they come ina  bigger size??? A definite yes!!!</li>
    <li> The bows were more than I expected and so much ceaper than the nail shop I get complaiments whrever I go!</li>
    <li> Its kinda bulky for nails, but they are useable.</li>
    <li> FUN,many compliments.Easy to apply with glue.Will catch in hair,so put hair up or pay attention.</li>
    <li> They are super cute cant wait to put them on little pandas or little animals on my nails They are worth the money and come with a great case</li>
    <li> When I got them placed on my nails, I loved them... And everywhere I went people complemented me on them &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I love these bows they are so cute. Colors are great. The only challenge is keeping them on the nails ;)</li>
    <li> These little Acrylic Bows are an ideal piece to decorate your nails with,a good add on to give your nails that little added attraction,to match up any fashion design,And they come in their own tiny box,so you don&#x27;t lose them</li>
    <li> Its just what I wanted! Saves me money I can put them on my nails without having to go to the nail salon to pay an extra 10$ ! :) Deff worth it and love the organized case they come in.</li>
    <li> I APPRECIATE IT MY DAUGHTER WILL BE HAPPY TO HAVE THEM FOR THE SUMMER AND HER FRIENDS THANK YOU A LOT</li>
    <li> Ok, so I definitely was looking forward to these cute little bows being on my nails...but immediately after opening the package, I knew I, nor anyone I knew, would ever wear them.  For starters, they were almost the size of my pinky nail!  I mean come on, how in the world is a person supposed to actually wear something like that?  Also, they are flat &amp; stiff.  Therefore, to stick them on your nail, would be difficult, &amp; I have a feeling they would get caught on absolutely everything!  Since the are so big &amp; so bulky, I think they&#x27;d catch &amp; come right off in no time.  Also, since they are so big...there are not many bows in each color.  Not at all.  I guess it&#x27;s not exactly an expensive thing..but it still just adds to the disappointment.</li>
    <li> I used this for a phone case I wanted to decorate. They were very cute and just like the picture I plan to use the on other things&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;light weigh&lt;br /&gt;cute</li>
    <li> these things are really a good size. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to apply them on my nails yet. But i do look forward to them more than the flowers and bow ties</li>
    <li> Love the bows they look wonderful and aren&#x27;t huge so I can still do what I need to with out them getting in the way.</li>
    <li> These bows are so cute! Everyone loves them. They are small and fit the nail nicely. I had to use glue so it cod stay on. They are so cute!!!</li>
    <li> These bows are great and I love the color variety. I have small nails so they&#x27;re kind of large but it&#x27;s not too bad. Just wish they were a bit curved at the bottom so they&#x27;d stay on longer.</li>
    <li> on time, new, cute. i just have to glue them with crazy glue and i wish it was more, but they so cute :)</li>
    <li> they are big and raise pretty high off the nail, but they make the right statement. They are definitely worth having in your collection!</li>
    <li> The bows came early which was great it comes in the clear container that is shown i only use one to do a practice nail i recommend nail glue to make it stick it came package tight and secure i would definitly be ordering more products from this company!</li>
    <li> These are so adorable! I love the little case they come in, I just wish there was 6 of each color so that I can put two on each hand without having one left over. The colors are really cute and compliment all the different nail polishes I have. The price couldn&#x27;t be beat either!</li>
    <li> Awsome nothing wrong with these bows and it also comes in a cute little sectional case to store them in</li>
    <li> great item i had them in my nails for 1 month of course with crazy clue and i do dishes n other chores n they still look great</li>
    <li> I put these on my daughter and she got a lot of compliments they are so cute I added a crystal on the center of the bow for more bling.</li>
    <li> such a great buy.i do nails and i highly recommend it.it also has glitter on the bows .good size also</li>
    <li> Love the case that they come in. I can reuse it for many things. The bows are reusable too. H</li>
    <li> My clients loved these butterfly bows. Nice colors w a touch of fine glitter.  Ordered some more. Loved the container they came in also. Easy n to apply and perfect nail size.</li>
    <li> these little bows are awesome! The colours are great and they are lightweight, so if a client wants them on all fingers, it won&#x27;t weigh them down!</li>
    <li> These are pretty big, but still cute! Perfect for an accent nail or with acrylics.</li>
    <li> I got them early then what it said there so pretty and shiny.i love the color and that there not to big.gave to my sister for her birthday and she loved them:)</li>
    <li> I originally purchased these with the intention of using them on my nails - however, they are a little larger than I anticipated. Thankfully, they work perfectly on barrettes for my daughter! So all&#x27;s well that ends well. :)</li>
    <li> Just got them today shipped fast and im very pleased with my purchase there small enough for my nails when i get them done great for the price well be purchasing again</li>
    <li> They are super cute, I thought they would have more in the pack, but its fine. I have used them. My clients love them. I will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Another thing I cant wait to use on myself and my clients. Really decent size for you ladies out there who love 3D nails.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
