<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing razor.  Closest and smoothest shaver I have owned.  And the cleaning system makes it that much easier.</li>
    <li> I got this for my father and he is very pleased with it, I got it set up and he loves the shave it gives.</li>
    <li> This is not just an electric shaver, but really a \\&quot;system\\&quot; comprising of three main components: the shaver itself, the shaver charging and storing stand and a shaver washing stand. The charging stand &amp; washer share the same charger.    It shaves very close and while shaving you you feel as if face is being massaged. They call it SkinGlide system and glide it sure does on your face. Going from  [[ASIN:B000BUW8WM Gillette Fusion Power Battery Powered Shaving System, 1 System]] I felt the shave is much closer. With Fusion I get a small stubble by 5 PM and with this Philips I had no stubble even by 9 PM. They recommend that you shave against the direction of your hair and use it for three weeks  before you get the full effect. The handle is very ergonomic and easy to hold. Shaving with this razor is definitely gratifying.     But the CONS are many: complexity, maintenance and  cost. The user&#x27;s guide for this system is 40 pages and that should tell you how complex the system is.    1. The manual is same for five and possibly six different shaving systems. First thing you have to do is read the minute model number on the back of the shaver - mine is 1250X. For two hundred and fifty bucks, they cannot even provide a specific manual for your system!    2. The User&#x27;s Guide is very poorly written. On page nine of the manual you find out what those 8 components, that you just unpacked are: shaver, charging stand, cleaning stand, cleaning solution, cleaning brush, plastic cap for the shaver heads, charging power cord, and plastic storage pouch. But once you read the user&#x27;s guide well, and understand the system, you will not to use it very often.    3. The shaver itself is has to be extracted from that annoying plastic package which needs a knife to break open with a risk of wounding your hands during the process.    4. Quick charge for one shave can be done in 3-4 minutes but full charging of shaver takes about two hours.    5. I am clean shaven and I found it difficult to reach just under the nostrils, below the sideburns, and corners. GyroFlex 3 D system follows the contours of your face fairly well, but it bumbles over the Adam&#x27;s apple and lower reaches of the neck. The slide out trimmer helps with shaping the sideburns. They do not tell you how to clean the trimmer.    6. Compared to 1 minute 49 seconds on my Fusion razor, it took 4 minutes and 43 seconds to shave with this Philips Norelco 1250X.    7. Then you have the clutter of five different pieces (shaver, charger, cleaner stand, cable, and plastic cover) on your bathroom counter top plus storing the cleaning solution and brush.    8. It takes two hours to clean the razor in their Jet Clean system.    9. The system itself is expensive and then you have the cost of [[ASIN:B001E96UZU Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution (Pack of 3)]] and shaver heads which they recommend you replace once a year. The web site philipshomestore is a mess - and if you key in two ll in philips by mistake it wil hijack you to some phishing site. This model is not even listed on Philip&#x27;s web site as of September 2010 and you cannot find which one of the multiple replacement shaver heads on the site is for 1250X unit.    Undoubtedly, it is a well made shaver that is easy to hold in your hands, feels very nice on the skin and provides the closet shave I ever had. Comparing this to my [[ASIN:B000BUW8WM Gillette Fusion Power Battery Powered Shaving System, 1 System]],  the shave is definitely much nicer and closer: but I do not find it is worth all the hassle, extra time, complexity, clutter and 25 times the cost. But if you are one of those people who are really particular about their shave or if you like face massaging with shave and you like to spend time grooming yourself, you may enjoy it and find it worth all that.</li>
    <li> Let me be frank.  Spending $100 for an electric razor seems excessive.  I mean, all it takes is one drop, and your investment is gone, right?  It&#x27;s easier to buy two $100 razors than one $200 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;Philips Norelco 1250cc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System&amp;#34; has a long name, but here&#x27;s what it really is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  QUIET!  It is, hands down, the quietest razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  In fact, that&#x27;s almost a problem.  Your mind says, &amp;#34;This razor is so quiet, it probably isn&#x27;t working.&amp;#34;  I guess I&#x27;m used to a chain-saw.  It IS working... cutting your facial hair like it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  I suspect that every face (okay, maybe only mine) has one or two hairs that seem to resist normal cutting blades.  Every so often, you see or feel a longer hair.  &amp;#34;Hey, that one&#x27;s escaped the zoo again.&amp;#34;  This Norelco gets it every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It ALMOST feels like a face massage.  You will never get that feeling from other razors, at least in my price range. And your face is smooth afterwards.  The three cutting heads move with the contours of your chin, your neck, and your jaw.  You just have to remember that you need to keep moving the razor over your face... there are gaps in the spacing of those cutting heads, so you can&#x27;t hold the razor in the same orientation throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  I have a sensitive neck.  It is normally easy for the hair follicles to become irritated.  This puppy?  Not once after three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, I&#x27;m disappointed in the trimmer.  Your old trimmer?  Don&#x27;t toss it away.  This one is small and a bit awkward to fit into any position.  And I keep being worried that I&#x27;ll knock this razor over as it sits on the sink, breaking something.  I wish the stand had a bit wider base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first razor that uses a cleaning system, with fluids, noises, and sneaky motions.  I think I&#x27;m going to just rinse it after a shave like I normally do, until the razor feels different.  Then I&#x27;ll give it the big clean and try again.  I don&#x27;t want to waste electrons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very, very nice gift to give to that special person.  They probably won&#x27;t buy it for themselves, but they will appreciate this one.  That guarantees they will be thinking of you at least once a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  after 6 years,I&#x27;ve replaced the cutting heads twice.  I still like this razor!and try again.  I don&#x27;t want to waste electrons.  This is a very, very nice gift to give to that special person.  They probably won&#x27;t buy it for themselves, but they will appreciate this one.  That guarantees they will be thinking of you at least once a day!  Addendum:  after 6 years,I&#x27;ve replaced the cutting heads twice.  I still like this razor!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I detest shaving in the mornings, Im always rushed, its a hassle.  Because of this, Ive always loved the idea of an electric shaver, unfortunately, after trying literally dozens of them I have never found one that worked well, until now that is.    This thing is amazing.  Admittedly, it is very expensive.  I have to admit I probably wouldnt have tried it if I was unable to get this shaver as a sample, but after trying it now, I would definately spend the money.    Be warned, it even says in the instructions that it could take a couple weeks before your face gets accustomed to the process and you get good results.  This was definatley the case for me, I had some nasty razor burn after the first few uses, but it lightened up every time and now I get a smooth, painless shave every time.    --SHAVE--  This unit provides a smooth comfortable shave, with few passes required.  It does not shave you smooth in one pass, I think that is fantasy land for electric shavers, but it does shave in fewer passes than any other model I have tried.  The final result of the shave is the best I have ever had with an electic razor, rivals the shave I get from the cartridge shavers (Mach4, Fusion, etc).  The head is very flexible with little pressure required to make it conform to your face, this allows it to reach all the tough spots relatively easily.  The shave head also has different types of openings, allowing it to cut different hair types properly, no more leaving the thick or thin hairs behind, this one gets them all.  Additionally, the unit is sealed so if you are inclined to do so (like me) it funcitons well with shave lotion or cream for an even more comfortable shave.    --CLEANING--  This could be this units claim to fame.  The shave heads easily pop open to allow cleaning and removal of the hair debris left behind.  Most gets washed away if you rinse under the water tap, but occasionally it needs cleaned out.  Additionally, the awesome little cleaner station is amazing.  Not only is it a kick to watch it work, as it moves automatically, raising and lowering the shaver into the solution, turing the shaver on and off automatically, but it also WORKS.  After you run the shaver through the included cleaner station, it is like it is new.  Cleaning solution could be a little cheaper to replace, but considering you dont need to use it very often it should be a minor expense in the long run.    --ACCESORIES--  I already mentioned the cleaning station, but its worth mentioning again.  The cleaining station is great and does a fantastic job.  The shaver also comes with a nice carrying case, power cords, shave head protector, and convenient charging stand.     OVERALL  After years of dreaming of finding an electric shaver that actually works, Philips Norelco finally made one.  While they obviously arent afraid to charge for it, it is worth the money.  Dont wast $50 or $100 on other shavers, they dont compare, this is the shaver you want.  Please look at my other reivews if you have doubt, I have reviewed several electric shavers and they have all gotten poor reviews from me, this one is the real deal shaver.</li>
    <li> Long time user of high end electric razors. Gave up on Braun after quality of foils plummeted.  This razor feels much smoother on the face. I felt no irritation at all, maybe because I am used to electrics.  Really like that you can use shaving cream; makes the shave even smoother.  However, the shave feels not quite as good as my Bruan used to deliver. Cleaning base is much larger than the one for the Braun. It is a real counter hog.  For all those complaining about the long instruction manual - I never opened it. Everything is fairly obvious and self explanatory.</li>
    <li> Better check price of replacing heads ,the razor shaves good but the price of replacing heads is way to much. I bought one for me and one for my dad but would not buy again</li>
    <li> From the get-go, this razor shaved closer than any I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve used electric razors since I started shaving.  I love the fact that each head opens separately for cleaning.  I thought I&#x27;d find the trimmer awkward, but the placement is great- no problems with it flipping down during use.  I especially like the fact that it can be used with shaving gel.</li>
    <li> My fiance had been using another brand, and it seemed as though the foil cutters were wearing out way too fast.  He loves the smooth glide of this shave..hopefully it will last longer!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I was really impressed with the design and the handling of the unit. The shave was really smooth but gave me really bad razor bumps. I tried it for more than 2 weeks and thought my skin would adjust. But it got worse. I really wanted this to work. But this is not for people with sensitive skin.     Returned the shaver to Amazon. They gave me a full refund minus the return shipping charges.</li>
    <li> Hi guys... really, this shaver was my first electrical shaver and... woooow, it is really amazing!!!  My skin is not irritated any more, as before with the conventionals shavers.  Try it, and you will see.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several different makes, models and designs, never quite satisfied and always going back to a razor. I tried this after seeing a review in a magazine and after about two weeks of face conditioning I get a great shave, very close with absolutely no  skin nicks or burns.  The shaver is light weight, holds a full charge a long time, needs very little pressure on the skin to get a close shave, and the cleaner works great. The shaver is very quiet and feels good in your hand.  I&#x27;m very please. Oh, one more thing....the shaver can be used wet or dry.....I thought I&#x27;d get a better shave wet, but after experimenting I&#x27;m actually getting a better and more comfortable shave dry. Go figure.  Very pleased with this shaver and purchase.</li>
    <li> I finally decided in december 2010 to fork over the money and get myself an electric wet /dry shaver.  I settled on the [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]], after reading up on quite a few shavers.  It took me some time to get used to, but eventually I really started liking the product , as it was really comfortable, and gave me a closer shave than my the gilette razors I had been using.  Thought I bought a great product, and according to the description, it should have lasted me approx 5 years before the battery gave out and i would have to throw it out.  I even would have taken 3 years considering the money I spent yearly on razor blades.  January 12, 2012... Product Dead.  13 months  and $212.00 down the drain  Junk</li>
    <li> I used an electric razor (Braun) when I was a teenager, it had a mesh type head and it was dry shaver. That shaver scratched up my face so bad I had rashes and burned skin (neck area) every time I shaved with it. I switched to Gillette twin blades, and stayed with that product for 20 some years. A friend of mine showed me the 3D shaver and I saw how smooth and close it could shave, but I was haunted by my experience with an electric shaver from my teenage years. After reading and doing a lot of research I decided to get the Norelco 3D, it comes with a 30 day guarantee, so I thought I would return it if I had issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very think hair and very sensitive (thin) skin. It is so sensitive that if I shave against a the grain with a regular twin blade Gillette razor I would get rashes and razor burns on my neck  and it would take a few days to heal. I tried both wet and dry shaves with the 3D, the 1st time and 2nd time I shaved it gave me very minor razor burn in the neck, but went away by evening. I have been shaving with it for 2+ weeks, I take a shower, wait for my skin to dry and shave. I get a very clean shave and almost no razor burn. 3 weeks after using this shaver the minor razor burns along the neck area are almost completely gone. I love the shave, never had such a close shave in my life! Remember gently glide the head over your skin in small slow circular motion. I do my neck first, and then chin and rest of the face. It takes a little longer than regular blade razor, but it does a far better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought hard about saving $20 and getting the model without the Jet cleaning system, but finally got the one with the jet cleaner. I highly recommend getting the jet cleaning system, it is hassle free cleaning and it cleans very well. I have not switched the solution out yet, but plan  to do it after 3-4 weeks of use, the level of cleaning fluid in the tank has not dropped yet. The literature that came along with the razor says it takes 3-4 weeks for my skin to get used to the electric shaver, and I think I am already broken in. Great product if you are in the market for a great razor.o get used to the electric shaver, and I think I am already broken in. Great product if you are in the market for a great razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor that makes a great smooth shave.  The cleaner works great also...  The on board trimmer is very small but it does work.  I kept my old norelco razor with a larger trimmer for my trim ups..</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver, wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with it at first, but after a while I am using it over that razer. It holds a nice long charge, signals when it needs a cleaning, when it needs a charge, and after all it&#x27;s not that bad of a shaver. Haven&#x27;t used the Jet clean system yet, seems like a space problem here. But the sink does a good job rinsing it out and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 1250 XCC through Amazon. I was highly surprised when the Philips Norelco 1250X turned up in it&#x27;s place (Please note the model number difference). Whilst the differences are not too substantial, I believe that Amazon should correctly advertise the product that they are selling. In Australia we have Federal Legislation called the Trade Practises Act which prohibits misleading product advertising. I was also extremely disappointed to find that the charging terminal was designed for USA powerpoints, when this had not been pointed out to me. I seperately purchased a power point adapter but still the shaver did not work. I ended up going to a local shaver shop in Sydney &amp; they were eventually able to diagose that I needed to buy an Australian compliant power cable to charge the shaver. Overall I will carefully review any future purchases with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver for 35 years and have always had a fair shave at best, especially on my neck.  I have never been able to get all the hairs on my neckline except for using a razor blade.  I was not sure this 1250xcc electric razor was going to do the job either, but to my surprise, it shaved my face (including my neckline) just like a razor blade.  I have had this electric shaver for 2 weeks now and it is the best shaver I have ever used.  I know they say to give it 3-4 weeks to get adjusted to your skin so don&#x27;t expect a great shave right off the bat, but I had a great shaving experience right from the first time.  I also like the fact you can use it whether your skin is dry or wet.  I truly rate this shaver 5 stars and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This Norelco razor provides a good close shave and  holds a charge well. I have had this razor for over a year and I have used the Jet Clean System only once. I found that the razor is very easy to clean without the hassle of pulling out and setting up the system.</li>
    <li> I assumed this would be a nice razor, I just didn&#x27;t think it would be this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you notice is that this razor is severely over packaged. First is the main box, which has two hefty seals that require a sharp object to cut them. Inside is a plastic clamshell containing the razor and the anti-theft devices. A sharp object is also needed to open this. Next is the big box that has the stand (wrapped in foam), cleaning brush, power adapter (one end wrapped in plastic), and the blade cover. Another box has the soft carrying case, which is in a plastic bag. Finally there is the box with a corrugated insert that contains the wash unit, which is wrapped in foam and in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;Nice touches abound. The cord for the adaptor has a Velcro wrap. The stand has suction cups on the bottom to keep it in place. The razor is nicely balanced. Everything has a quality feel to it. The manual is extensive, but for those who can&#x27;t wait there is the \\&quot;Quick Start\\&quot; card...which is all pictures. Reading the fine print, I find it is made in the Netherlands, not China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the Manual:&lt;br /&gt;Sorry guys, I had to do it. The manual says it takes about 50 minutes to fully charge and you get about 50 minutes of shaving. It only charges in the stand or the wash unit. You cannot plug the razor in directly. If you let it run out, you can put it in the stand for 3-5 minutes and get 3-5 minutes of shaving. Norelco says not to leave the charger plugged in after charging fully, but doesn&#x27;t say why. It has a neat LED \\&quot;gas gauge\\&quot; on the front to tell you the charge remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most electric razors, it says to use it for about four weeks to allow your face to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to it. Norelco gives you a 45 day money back guarantee as well as a two year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the battery will no longer hold a charge you have toss the razor...the battery is not replaceable. This is a huge negative in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;I compared this razor to the [[ASIN:B001BJHCVO Remington Flex 360]] I tested earlier and to my old reliable blade, a Schick Quattro power. I shaved half my face with each and had a two- to three day growth each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco vs. Schick Quattro: I expected it to be no contest here, because everybody knows a blade shaves closer. The manual says I can use shaving cream with this razor, so I lather up with [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] using my trusty badger brush. Darned if it doesn&#x27;t work! Just like with a manual blade, you have to rinse frequently, but it works great. The shave was very smooth, even against the grain, and much better than expected. There was a bit of irritation under the chin on the Norelco side. When done shaving, just open the rotary covers, rinse with hot water, and set in the stand to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WifeTest: As is the norm in these shaving comparisons, I asked Mrs. Boilermate to judge which side is smoother. She said both sides were smooth, but, to my surprise, she said the Norelco side was \\&quot;a bit smoother!\\&quot; After two days I thought the Norelco side was a bit \\&quot;skritchier\\&quot; but Mrs. B, said there was no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco vs. Remington: The Norelco feels more balanced than the Remington, which feels a bit top-heavy. The Norelco weighs in at 6.1 oz. vs 6.5 for the Remington. Both felt smooth and both irritated a bit under the chin. The Norelco&#x27;s three separate heads make it easier to see what you are doing vs. the one big enclosure on the Remington. The individual heads allow you to get a bit closer, as well. The trimmers on each were easy to use, but the Norelco&#x27;s is narrower and it sounds like something is loose when pressed against my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Mrs. B deemed the Norelco shave slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;Both the Norelco and Remington rinse clean with hot water. To clean the Norelco, just open the three head covers and rinse with hot water and put in the stand with the heads open until dry. (It looks a bit like a Transformer in this mode!) The trimmer rinses clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every now and then you should run the razor thru the Jet Clean wash unit. The actual cleaning takes about five minutes, and about two hours to dry. It will charge the razor during the dry cycle. the manual gives instructions on how to disassemble the heads for cleaning as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Jet Clean system over the Braun&#x27;s, mainly because the cleaning fluid is in a bottle instead of special refills. First of all, you get about two complete refills from a bottle for about the same price as one Braun refill. You can also empty the reservoir into another bottle and cap it between cleanings. That way it doesn&#x27;t evaporate between cleanings and if you are short on counter space (as I am) you can put the wash unit in a drawer. I filter the fluid thru a coffee filter when reusing it. Norelco says you get about 15 cleanings per fill-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;This thing is like a riding mower for your face...a John Deere, not one from WalMart, and that is a good thing. A good riding mower cuts as good as a good push mower but does it a lot faster. Yes, it cost more and requires a bit more maintenance, but to those who have one, it is all worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price not withstanding, this is an awesome razor. It is well balanced and well built. It shaves as close as a blade, especially when used with shaving cream, and it covers a lot more territory so you are finished sooner. That being said, is it worth a nearly two hundred dollar premium over the Remington? Well, the Norelco comes with more: a stand, a carry case, and a cleaning system. So there is clearly added value. For the blade shaver who only occasionally uses an electric, it&#x27;s hard to justify. If you use an electric regularly you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/13/11&lt;br /&gt;Four months later and this razor has become my daily driver. I use it with shaving cream and get a quick smooth shave...even under the chin. And no more nicking the corners of my mouth trying to get close under my nose. After 40 years as a blade shaver I am a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/11/12&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about two years since I first used this shaver and I&#x27;m still a convert. I primarily use it with [[ASIN:B002L03N74 Bigelow]] or [[ASIN:B00837ZOI0 Proraso]] shaving cream (rather than dry) and it gives a smooth, close shave. I just ordered a replacement head (Ouch! Fifty bucks!) because they say I should, but it is still doing a fantastic job. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
    <li> The [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250cc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System]] is a very good shaver.  Like most high end electric razors, a great investment is required to get the most out of the unit.  The product includes a lengthy instruction manual that documents the recommended use and maintenance of the product.  After using this product for the recommended 21 days, I am pleased but am still left disappointed in several of the key features.  Most importantly, this unit is not good at shaving intermediate and longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;++ The product consistently produces a close shave with daily use&lt;br /&gt;++ The operation is smooth and quiet, especially compared to other electric razors&lt;br /&gt;++ Charging is quick&lt;br /&gt;++ The unit holds a charge very long, so it doesn&#x27;t die during a shave&lt;br /&gt;++ The unit can be used wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;++ The shaving heads can be easily opened and cleaned under water&lt;br /&gt;++ The jet-clean system lubricates the blades as it cleans, keeping them working well&lt;br /&gt;++ The included case and blade guard are great for travel use&lt;br /&gt;++ The separate charging base is compact and includes suction cups for easy mounting&lt;br /&gt;++ The device is attractive and sleek&lt;br /&gt;++ The included manual covers everything you would want to know, from usage to maintenance and even parts replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-- Leaves many longer and intermediate sized hairs behind when shaving&lt;br /&gt;-- The detail tool functions poorly and irritates the skin more than it cuts hair&lt;br /&gt;-- The cleaning unit is difficult to maintain, with a testy dual-button release that results in spilled cleaning fluid&lt;br /&gt;-- Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost&lt;br /&gt;-- Only 1 power cable is included for both the charging dock and the cleaning station&lt;br /&gt;-- The internal battery is not user replaceable and will limit the unit&#x27;s life&lt;br /&gt;-- More basic models provide a comparable shave for a more reasonable investment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL&lt;br /&gt;~ The cleaning fluid is meant to last 15 days, but I&#x27;m nervous about hygiene if it sits there for 15 days; The included bottle will last a few uses, so you must purchase replacement fluid almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SET UP AND USE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does not come charged and requires that you hook up the charging station right out of the box.  The cleaning station can be used as a charging station as well, but the shaver must sit in it inverted.  Charging was quick and easy, done in about 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is designed to be used wet or dry.  I tried both and ultimately chose to use it dry.  The first few times using this shaver resulted in some discomfort.  I was also surprised that the shaver nicked my skin, proving that the blades really do lift the hairs as they are shaving.  I found that the initial discomfort lessened after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station includes a container for the fluid, and I found it best to fill it to the bottom end of the range.  Changing this fluid is difficult to do without spilling some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver if you use it daily.  The shortcomings I noticed from day 1 never really changed.  If you allow your hairs to grow too long, it leaves a lot of the longer hairs behind, especially on the neck.  The product really provides a very close shave on shorter hairs, but the channels for longer hairs simply do not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I would recommend users explore one of Philips alternatives, like the [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]].  For a much more reasonable investment of time and funds, you can have an almost equivalent shaving experience.  I found that model to produce a shave that was almost as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this unit for those who want the Jet Clean system.  Other than changing the fluid, the system works very well.  In order to obtain that system, you have to get one of the higher end models.  For those who are very demanding it is worth the investment.  But for most users, the 2D model will work sufficiently well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.sufficiently well.     Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 and I have been shaving with Norelco Electric Razors since I was about 16.  My first Norelco was a hand me down from my Grandfather, a two header.  My Great Grandfathers, Grandfather and Dad have all shaved with Norelcos. I collect them and have a vast number in my collection.  I have had them to go out before and Philips Norelco was always quick to replace the defective model.  My pride and joy of my Norelcos is my Spectra 8894xl James Bond Electric Razor. It give a very close shave and I still shave with it once and awhile. I recently replaced the blades in it and it still delivers a close comfortable shave. I am always looking for a way to get a close shave with an electric.  I have a refurbished Smart Touchxl and it to shaves really close. Now on to Senso Touch 1250cc.  I purachased a Senso Touch 1250x at Walmart for $217 including tax, then I saw the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic for only $225 and with fast shipping, the total price was $235. I returned the 1250x back to Walmart and got the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic.  I was able to get the razor with the jet clean system on Amazon for only $18 more, a deal! I checked around at Target and a few other stores and there were no stores in my state that carried the 1250cc only the 1250x. It took only 3 days to receive this razor.  It ships by UPS.  I have a heavy dark beard and usually have to shave twice a day.  I never did get a close shave with my Arcitec 1050cc. It took me about 7 min. to get anything that even resembled a descent shave.  I gave my Arcitec to my Dad 68 who has a light beard and he loves it. All I can say about the shave that I get from Senso Touch is WOW! It is close and leaves your face feeling really smooth! I shave with it both wet and dry, but the wet shave is very comfortable and resembles the shave that I use to get with my old Cool Skin which was only a wet shaver. The razor comes in a big box and resembles a present. It is very expensive, but let me tell you, this razor is worth the extra money! It  takes a while to open it which in it are several smaller boxes which contain various parts of the shaving system. It really is a shaving system and it is was well worth the extra money. In the box, you will find the razor, the jet clean system, a bottle of jet clean solution, a charging stand ( charging stand does not come with the Arcitec 1050cc ), a soft pouch ( which is much better than the storage and charging pod of the Arcitec 1050cc ), a cleaning  brush, a protective cap, a power cord, and a quick start guide, and a useage booklet. On the razor itsself is a 3 level battery display which shows: cleaning indicator, battery high and low indicators which are shown in blocks, replacement head indicator, and travel lock indicator. This is a ruby black frame with a hidden display.  The razor has the GyroFlex 3D System, UltraTrack Heads, and SkinGlide System. This razor is Aquatec which means you can shave with it both wet and dry. This razor has a EasyGrip which ensures complete control and extra precision. The razor heads unlike the Arcitec can be taken apart and each one cleaned individually and you can wash out the razor and just let it dry. The jet clean system, which is very cool to watch in action, cleans and lubracates the razor heads.  I plan to use it about once a week to save on the cleaning solution.  Now when I shave, I use Afta Pre Electric and a little talc which helps to deliver a smooth shave. I do not use Williams Lectric Shave anymore as it cloggs the razor and it is very greasey.  Afterwards, I put on a little Nivea Post Shaving Balm.  When I shave wet, I use Nivea Shaving Gel. Philips tells you to wait about 3 weeks for your face to get ajusted to this shaving system.  I did experience a little irritation, red burn, on the lower part of my nck, but it could be due to fact I pressed too hard with the razor, but it is getting better evertime I shave. I love this razor and I am very happy with my purchase onAmazon. Like I said this razor is expensive, but I am a Pastor and I want to look good in the pulpit and this razor, so far is getting the job done! You can get the razor with a numeric display, but this model is sufficient for me.

    <li> I don&#x27;t generally like these but, it works with some side effects.</li>
    <li> I have always detested shaving, especially with an electric razor.  Despite all the high-tech and expensive electric razors that have come out over the years, I resigned to the fact that the only satisfactory shave I could obtain was with a simple razor, soap and water.  Time consuming and uncomfortable, but functional.    A week ago I received the Norelco SensoTouch 3D in the mail. I was immediately skeptical as in past years I had found electric shaver to be completely unsatisfactory and a waste of money.  Fortunately, my skepticism was to be unfounded.    The SensoTouch is easy to use, very versatile, and easy to clean.  Oh, and it provides a good shave too! I have used it after a shower with a wet face and soap and in a conventional manner with a dry face. The battery charge is good for sixty minutes, plenty of time for any of us. A handy battery charge indicator on the handle lets you know when it is fully charged.    Cleaning is easy, and can be done a couple of ways. The easiest method is open the razor heads and simply rinse them under hot water. Or, one can pop open the razor heads and use the brush supplied to sweep out hair particles. The best way is to use the supplied Jet Clean System, which actually works as advertised. This involves a stand-alone reservoir which holds Jet Clean Solution. One places the razor upside down in this reservoir in a frame which holds the razor. Pressing the start button automatically begins the process. The razor is lowered into the  cleaning liquid  and a series of whirring noises occur. The razor is raised out of the liquid and lowered back in several times. Eventually the process is finished when the razor is raised automatically to dry.     It is comfortable, functional, easy to clean, and can be used wet or dry.  Bottom line:  the Norelco SensoTouch is worth the money!  If you have been burned again and again in the past by electric razors that never seem to get all the hairs off your neck and irritate your skin, summonthe will to give it one more try with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Norelco razors and liked them. This one, not so much. Not only is it the most expensive razor I&#x27;ve ever bought it is just about the worst. Shaving is tough but this just makes it tougher. The blades are spaced so far apart it leaves a strip in the middle. The head doesn&#x27;t get as close as other razors either.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from [[ASIN:B002GJU2XI Philips Norelco HS8420 Nivea for Men Razor]] for this but still debating if it is really an upgrade or downgrade!  I have been very happy with HS8420 as it does a very close shave and Nivea dispensing is great. The only trouble I had with that was that the clipped hair falls on you while shaving and everywhere on the counter!  Norelco fixed that issue with this razor nicely; it shaves cleanly without this falling hair problem; it gets collected below the 3 razor heads in s a small compartment. That and the cleaning system is the only pluses for this product.  So here are the other things to consider:  Pros:  1. It is smooth and adjusts very nicely to the face contour, better than any other shaver in the market I have tested so far.  2. Hair gets collected under the razor that you can open and clean easily later or use the cleaning system  3. Seems to be holding the charge longer than older models (obviously it is also a little bigger than earlier Norelco shavers)    Cons:  1. It doesn&#x27;t shave fully or close as the old one (HS8420) did. I have to spend more time on this. One thing I found useful is to use [[ASIN:B000052Y6Z Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, Original, 3 fl oz]] before shaving with this.  2. As they have put a surrounding plastic shield around the razor it doesn&#x27;t really get close to difficult places; you have pay extra attention for that.  3. The trimmer at the back is totally useless (of course, the older HS8420 I used doesn&#x27;t even have a trimmer! but then this costs lot more than that model).  4. Cost    Finally a shaver is a shaver and if it doesn&#x27;t shave fully to your satisfaction it is not worth the price you pay, whatever it may be.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a (hairy) man, you&#x27;re more than likely always trying to find the next best shaver, but hate to spend a fortune on one that may not do the job...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System (black!). Hopefully it does the job, because it sure as heck costs a fortune!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this is without doubt one of the nicest electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever seen. It comes boxed very well (perhaps a little too well - annoying blister packaging for the shaver itself &#x3D; argh!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box you&#x27;re greeted by a small charger, the Jet Clean system (which is also ANOTHER charger in of itself), the small bathroom-friendly plug, a little cleaning brush, instruction manuals, a little cover for the shaver&#x27;s heads, and the cleaning solution for the Jet Clean System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging the shaver is not your typical 16-hour affair as is normally the case with shavers. One hour will see your shaver from dead to full. Very nice. The instruction manual does recommend the shaver be removed from the charger when it is charged. I don&#x27;t really know why, as most \\&quot;intelligent\\&quot; devices stop charging after the device is charged anyway to prevent overcharging and lessening battery life. I&#x27;m not sure what this Philips Norelco does in this regard, but again - it recommends removing the shaver from the charger when charged. I suspect it should be fine to leave it in the charger when you&#x27;re done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does it feel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have to say the first time you push the shaver against your dry face, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s gently massaging your skin.... until you realize it&#x27;s also removing hair at the same time. Woah! It&#x27;s a really fun feeling, but it definitely takes a while to get your entire face shaved depending on how much stubble you have there. I won&#x27;t lie - it&#x27;s the absolute closest to a razor I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric. It really gets that close if you spend the time to be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not say it&#x27;s perfect. I definitely rubbed my face a little too much in the process the first time, and I did feel a tad sore at the end, but I suspect this will ease with time. In fact, the manual suggests you use ONLY this shaver for 3 weeks so that your face can get used to it. I&#x27;ll update this review in a few more weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re done with your shave, you can use the Jet Clean System, which I think is super cool. You fill (the first time) or empty+fill (subsequent times) the little tray in the bigger charging unit up to the marked line once every two weeks (if you use the shaver every day), and then when you&#x27;re done shaving, you stick the shaver&#x27;s head upside down into the Jet Clean System, hit the power button, and then the shaver automatically dunks itself into the liquid/foam/lubricant, runs some on/off clean cycles, and then lets itself dry over the course of two hours. It&#x27;s definitely very futuristic, and saves having to scrape out hair and gunk like you would normally have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m VERY impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Slick-looking device&lt;br /&gt;2.) Not too noisy&lt;br /&gt;3.) Not too much hair debris everywhere at all - surprised by this!&lt;br /&gt;4.) Very fancy-looking charging LEDs on the shaver itself&lt;br /&gt;5.) Very fancy magnets hold the shaver in place when it charges&lt;br /&gt;6.) Has a nifty slide-out trimmer for below your nose or straightening out your sideburns&lt;br /&gt;7.) Comes with a nice, zipped carrying case for traveling with your state-of-the-art shaver!&lt;br /&gt;8.) Visual indicator when you need to replace the shaving heads&lt;br /&gt;9.) Two-year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Definitely will take a bit of an adjustment period if your skin isn&#x27;t used to such a close shave&lt;br /&gt;2.) The mini-charger doesn&#x27;t take up a huge amount of room, but the Jet Clean System is definitely not something that could be called subtle... so plan accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;3.) When using the slide out trimmer, it can be tricky to see whereyou&#x27;re trimming with the shaving blades in the way&lt;br /&gt;4.) Have to buy Philips Norelco&#x27;s special cleaning/lubricating liquid for the Jet Clean System&lt;br /&gt;5.) Non-replaceable battery&lt;br /&gt;6.) Just under an hour of use from a full charge (not necessarily a bad thing?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the few cons, this really is a great electric shaver, and definitely the best I&#x27;ve used. I hope it gives me much joy and trimming for a good while to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars out of 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT August 28, 2010***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this all week, and just as the manual suggests, it&#x27;s getting easier on my skin every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I have found it is safe to leave the device in the charger when it&#x27;s charged. The unit actually shuts off the charging circuit when it&#x27;s fully charged (all the LEDs go out).

    <li> We bought this shaver for our active duty military son who has to shave every day. He complained about how expensive razor blades were but that he likes the close shave he gets with a hand razor on his thick beard. He said that any time he used an electric shaver that it pulled and hurt his face, and that he would get a rash. He has very sensitive skin, besides a thick beard. In any case, this shaver comes with a money-back guarantee so we decided to buy it for him. He LOVES it! He raves about what a close shave he gets, as close as when he uses a blade, with no rash, no discomfort, and a beautiful shave. Thank you Norelco!</li>
    <li> Have been using this razor for almost 2 years and love it! Although I haven&#x27;t​ gotten much use of the bundled cleaning base, it sure looks cool when using it.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I really don&#x27;t know if the reviews I read they are real or just some advertisements from sellers. So I just want to say that this Norelco 1250xcc/42 is just awesome! I had a very, very old Philips shaver for the past 10 years. So decide to buy this new one. Absolutely satisfied. Because I had used electric shavers for so many years I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation. I truly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This razor, the Philips Norelco has a major battery problem. If you want to make you a favor look for another razor.   It is true that it is nice and when you buy the new razor you expect so much for your money. Nevertheless, it is very cumbersome to use it. First, you need to be very careful regarding the time allowed for recharging. Usually you do not have the time to take care for one hour your electric appliance. Second, the warranty includes the exchange after the failure of the razor; but, what happen for the second time. Think about it. You do not want to waste time every 4 to 6 months looking for a replacement at your mail box. Of course while you wait for it you need something to get your shave. Third, you cannot use it once the battery is dead since it cannot be plugged, so it is impossible to use in any other way   Finally, paying more than 200 dollars is ridiculous to acquire a product with so poor quality.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest razor system out there.    My husband loves the close shave it give.    Looks super cool.    Clean up is a snap.    Cordless and chargeable.    Adjusts seamlessly to the contours of the face.    Superb job for an electric razor.    No irritation or razor burn whatsoever.    Awesome product.    Makes a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Oh, I&#x27;am happy with this shaver, cause now my boyfriend never ever forget to shave! This shaver do it&#x27;s job really good and fast and to clean it you just put it into it&#x27;s base press the button and go whatever you want</li>
    <li> is it a good shaver? yes it does a very good job. most shavers do a good job when new. better than the expensive braun? i would say yes. but then the norelco isnt cheap either. although there isnt much too it and really over priced as most shavers    think twice before buying this kit. you are better off buying the shaver only and save $30 or more.    the wash system uses a water based cleaner. isnt that the same as rinsing the shaver under hot tap water? YES! then why do you need the wash system?    replacement head unit is around $60. for whatever reason norelco doesn&#x27;t sell just the foil/cutter for the 3d models. no reason for it since the foil/cutters come apart for cleaning and are easily replaceable</li>
    <li> Yes, this shaver is one of the more expensive ones on the market, but it&#x27;s worth paying extra for.&lt;br /&gt;* Features: This Philips Norelco shaver can be used comfortably for both wet or dry shaving. It comes with its own cleaning system (which also charges the shaver), travel pouch, and a separate charging stand. The shaver includes an internal trimmer, which is easy to slide out and back in; so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way, but is there when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;* Charging: One hour gives the shaver a complete charge, which lasts a couple of weeks. Just insert it into the cleaning system or the separate charging stand and forget about it, until you&#x27;re ready to use it again. The charging stand is small, and it has suction cups at the bottom to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fall over. This is a multi-voltage shaver, so you can take with you when you travel to other countries.&lt;br /&gt;* Closeness: closer than any other electric shaver, probably as close as a blade but safer. Curves out to your skin very nicely, making it easy to shave in normally hard to reach places, like under your nose. For the closest and most comfortable shave, use this shaver with your favorite shaving gel or foam.&lt;br /&gt;* Comfort: the shave is very close with no pulling or tugging on the skin. It&#x27;s a very quick shave. A couple of days&#x27; growth can be gone in three minutes. The wet shave is even pleasurable. The vibration it causes is minimal, and so is the noise when compared to other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to use: The shaver has a power indicator in front to tell you when it needs charging, as well as an indicator to tell you when it needs cleaning. It couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;* Quality: the unit is extremely well designed and seems sturdy, so I expect it to last several years. My previous shaver was also a Norelco, and I was very happy with it. It lasted eight years, and I hope this one will last just as long.&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning system: cut hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of the shaver, but stays inside so there&#x27;s no mess. For daily cleaning, simply lift each of the three heads--to reveal the well holding the hair that has been cut--and rinse the shaver under running water.  The indicator at the front of the shaver also tells you when it needs a more thorough cleaning. Fill the cleaning system with the included Jet Clean solution, and insert the shaver into the cradle at the top of the cleaning system. Press the button, and the cleaning system does the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine a better electric shaver. Well worth every penny..

    <li> Best Philips shaver ever. I been using Philips since I was 17 and this is the best shaver. better then using knife.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great shaver.  When my husband first used it.. he was amazed, he felt like the parts of his face that took 2 or 3 passes with his older Norelco were taken care of in one pass.  He didn&#x27;t really feel like it shaved any BETTER, but that it did shave faster.  However, this advantage seemed to fade with repeated uses and does not improve with cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look of the shaver is really nice and sleek and modern, especially compared to the older, fatter versions of the product.  The one feature he really does like is that each of the three blade platorms/heads move/pivot individually and do hug the curves fo the face more effectively.  The small shaver stand sits nicely on the counter and allows the shaver to dry well once the heads are opened up after rinsing them after each shave.  This is especially important because unlike previous shavers with a \\&quot;flip top\\&quot; lid containing all three blades that can just be laid down on the counter, this one has heads that open outward in three directions and so it could damage them if you lay the shaver down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the cleaning cycle.  To be honest, this just seems a little insane.  The cleaning stand is huge and has to be stored.  The cleaning solution, I assume, is expensive.  I don&#x27;t really know, because we won&#x27;t be bothering to replace it.  Basically the \\&quot;2-hour cleaning cycle\\&quot; consists of the product moving up and down and making mechanically impressive noises.  Then it spins for about 1-2 minutes in the solution in a seemingly deliberate pattern.  Then it sits hanging over the solution and dries for the rest of the two hours.  I&#x27;m fairly confident the solution is nothing more than watered down dish soap, and that the same effect could be accomplished by holding it spinning in a soap dish full of watered down dish soap and then finding somethign to prop it upside down in the dry.  However, I&#x27;m not even sure we&#x27;ll bother with this, because there is no apparent difference in cleanliness or performance after a cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts for about 3 weeks, which is outstanding.  He&#x27;s never had a Norelco or any other brand before that&#x27;s lasted more than a week.  This is great for short business trips because or short getaways because he can take the shaver without any charger in the little included travel bag and be confident it won&#x27;t run out.  HOWEVER, the shaver can only be charged on either the small vanity stand or the giant cleaning stand...there is no input into the shaver itself.  And the stands do not fit in the travel case and the small one is seemingly fragile and would not travel well.  So, on our three-week vacation, he brought his old shaver that simply travels with a small cord rather than deal with lugging these extra parts for the new one.  A major downer if you travel longer durations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... overall and with additional details,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very long-lasting charge (about 3 weeks with daily use)&lt;br /&gt;Charges very quickly (2-3 hours to full, as opposed to a day on older models)&lt;br /&gt;Nice look, especially on stand&lt;br /&gt;Individually pivoting heads hug the face well&lt;br /&gt;Digital Battery Charge Indicator lights&lt;br /&gt;Great initial shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, for not really any better a shaver than older models&lt;br /&gt;After one week, tried one cheek with old shaver and one with new shaver -- old shaver got better \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; for close shave from the ladies of the household.&lt;br /&gt;Only charges in a stand&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cycle is pretty much a joke, and a space hog, as well as an expense if actually replacing the cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;While three pivoting heads is nice, it&#x27;s annoying to have to individually open all three heads to rinse after each shave&lt;br /&gt;There is lots of \\&quot;excess plastic\\&quot; around each blade in the design that makes it hard to shave close to nose and other facial features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO... it&#x27;s a fine shaver, but the cleaning cycle poses no added value in our opinion and a cheaper simpler model may suffice depending on which pros-cons are important to you.</li>
    <li> Electric Razor stopped in middle of saving atleast 6 times. Not enough close save as expected. somewhat disappointed. It takes enough time to get adjusted.[[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d is as great as all the reviews claimed.  I was amazed by how close of a shave it gave me.  You do have to use it in the shower to get that great shave.  While the dry shave it good, it is nowhere as close as a hot shower and gel shave.&lt;br /&gt;  I no longer have need for a second shave for the old 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, as I did the Norelco Arcitec shaver.  Which was a good razor in its own or right especially for a difficult neck area as I have.&lt;br /&gt; However, the Senso Touch is in a class its own, with a \\&quot;baby&#x27;s bottom\\&quot; smooth shave.  I believe that the shave is as good or better then any blade can give you, and with no annoying cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The comments of not being able to replace the battery are false, as it is easy replaced by unscrewing the case, which is explained right in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I did get the model with the cleaner so I could get a longer life out of the shaver.  I do believe you get what you pay for; in the cheaper brands, you get bad shaves.  In the Norelco 3d you get the best shave money can buy in a reasonable budget.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic shaver and this coming from a 30y blade user.  I will never go back to a blade. Great shave, quick and close. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me one bit. Bette than a blade.</li>
    <li> My husband has always had trouble shaving with regular razors. His family repeatedly bought him super cheap electric razors that tore up his face just as bad. I convinced him to try another electric razor and we went with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it is great. There was some irritation to begin with but nothing like he is used to and it is supposed to take about a week to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might turn him into a once a day shaver yet!</li>
    <li> I like the old version with 3 head integrated, it gave you the sense of your skins was being  embraced.  With the new version of 3 separated head, when you save the center of three heads  pressure on your face while the outer edge gave you a \\&quot;floating\\&quot; sense.  Regards</li>
    <li> i was very happy to find this electric shaver here and i bought 2 of them one for my boyfriend and one for my brother they love it and every time my boyfriends uses his calls me  :)) ha ha, they both love this Philips norelco and haven&#x27;t been complaining about it and the shipping method was great</li>
    <li> I decided to go with the Norelco 1250xcc after debating it with the Panasonic ES-LA93 for several days. After weighing the pros and cons of each, it was just time to try a different type of shaver (rotary vs linear). My previous razor was a Panasonic, that despite lasting me over twelve years never really gave me a great shave. I always found myself grabbing my manual razor to finish shaving my neck. Not so with the Norelco. After removing the razor and all the other components from the nearly impenetrable box, I set up the charging stand, set the razor in it and was ready to shave in an hour. The first thing I noticed was how quiet this shaver is in comparison. I&#x27;m glad I read many other reviews first, as I would have thought it was not working right otherwise.  My first shave was a rather painless experience despite my face not being used to a rotary shaver. What it all boils down to though is that this thing gave me an awesome shave right out of the box.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I really like the fact that I can use shaving cream to obtain an even better shave with no irritation. The jet clean system seems like a nice addition for only slightly more than the standalone shaver. The whole package looks very snazzy with all glossy black components and white led&#x27;s on the trimmer to indicate battery level.  The list of positives in this package are many, below are just a few...  + 1-hour charge  + great ergonomics (fits perfectly in my hand)  + quiet  + looks good  + warranty extended to 2-1/2 years if registered with Norelco  + Made in the Netherlands  The negatives are much fewer in number...  - I didn&#x27;t make this purchase sooner</li>
    <li> My shaver died within 6 months-do not waste your money!The charger is ok, but the shaver won&#x27;t work. I did not misuse this shaver, and never used it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Although a tad pricey, worth every penny.  Product is as advertised.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  Shaves almost as good as a straight razor.  Highly recommend.  Shipping was \\&quot;instant\\&quot;.  Would buy from Amazon again.  Easy to do business with.  All in all, a good buying experience.</li>
    <li> At first I will admit I was a little skeptical, Norelco made claims that this shaver has the closest shave. After reading several reviews, watching some youtube videos and adding and deleting this item out of my cart 3-4 times. I decided to give it a try.. I have been using a razor blade my whole life, from traditional to three to five blades at a time. I was tired of spending $30-$40 on razor blades every few months, and I was also tired of cutting my skin and I also always struggled getting a clean shave anywhere on my neck. After using the SensoTouch 3d for a few weeks, I can honestly say that I wish I had switched earlier. It took me about 5-6 shaves to really get the hang of it, also don&#x27;t forget. Your facial hair has to get use to being shaved a different way. What works for me was not shaving for a few days so my hair gets enough growth. One of the perks of using this shaver in particular is that if you used razor blades like me then you can still use the same shave cream or gel that you have been using with this electric shaver. Me personally, I started using pre-electric shave lotion. Its less messy and I do not have to spend extra time rinsing/cleaning my face after shaving. And like I said earlier, you have to get use to shaving with a electric shaver and that means you have to change the way you shave. I learned going up and down does not really cut it, the best way to shave with this shaver is shaving in a circular motion using your other hand to stretch out the area of your face that you are working on. Does that make sense? It didn&#x27;t to me until I YouTube&#x27;d this shaver.. Last point, as far as cleaning shaver. I found it relatively easy just popping open the three razor heads and rinsing them out for a few seconds with hot water, then I just placed it back on to the jet clean system and let it do its deed. After its done cleaning it, it charges it right away and when its done charging it simply turns off. Overall I am very very satisfied with this purchase, definitely worth the money. I highly recommend spending the extra dough and purchasing this shaver. Norelco gives 60 days to decide if its for you, but it only took me 10. Five stars.</li>
    <li> To start i was very skeptical on buying an electric razer. All of my past experiences of just trying one were horrible, they pulled the hair, hurt and didnt get close. I have a thick beard and was worried it wouldnt get close enough. OMG was i wrong. This razer is awesome, not only does it NOT pull my hair but it shaves very close. It makes my face smooth even against the grain, and it does it fast.I didnt want to get a cheap brand or model so i went for the big boy. I am glad to say i am putting down my blades and using straight 3d from now on. Do not waste your time or money on cheaper models, spend the money and get a quailty razer.</li>
    <li> Years ago when I first started shaving I received an electric shaver as a gift, and I used it until it died, and never bothered replacing it.  I switched to blade razors and have been using them for more than 10 years, including both disposable and double-edge safety razors.  Over the last few years I seemed to be more rushed in the mornings so I wanted something faster and more convenient for the daily shave, and decided to give an electric shaver another go.  I poured over the reviews and ended up picking this model.  It seemed to be a good balance of features, cost, and favorable reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days shy of a month now, and overall I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was well packaged, and very easy to get out of the box.  I pulled it out, read the instructions, and charged it up using the stand.  According to the directions, it can take up to 21 days for your skin to become accustomed to the shaver, and some irritation can result during the course of the adjustment period.  While I did experience a bit of \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; on my neck, it was nothing too terribly uncomfortable and only lasted for a couple of days.  The electric shaver gives me a shave not quite as close as a double-edge safety razor, but looks great appearance-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is very impressive.  I keep a mustache and a full goatee, and shaving the rest of my face resulted in the \\&quot;needs charging\\&quot; indicator lighting up after 20 days.  During that time I shaved every day in order to allow my face to get used to the razor.  I went ahead and set up the Jet Clean portion of the product.  I placed the razor in the cleaner stand and it got right to work, dropping the razor in and out of the cleaning solution, turning on and off both in and out of the liquid.  After the cleaning cycle was complete it went to dry mode, then subsequently charged the razor.  I do have to say the razor feels like new again when done cleaning, there is no evidence of skin oil buildup on the heads as was starting to show after 20 days of use, even with daily rinsing with hot water.  I plan to use the cleaner weekly, but I wanted to see how long the battery would last on a single charge the first time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only used the razor dry without any shaving cream or gel.  While I do intend to give it a try and probably use it wet once in a while, the primary purpose of buying this razor was for the convenience and time savings of not needing to do so.  In that manner the razor is performing up to its expectations, which is a good trade off for the missing closeness I am used to with blades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver. It does everything I want it to do. Self cleans and cuts close and you can use it in shower.</li>
    <li> I was given this shaver as a gift by my wife.  I have been using it for almost exactly a year and it just died on me without warning.  I found it interesting that there were so many other reviews that stated this as well.  Its almost like Phillips has succeeded in timing the obsolescence of their product to the warranty period.  It takes multiple passes to get a smooth skin shave and by that time my skin is irritated.  A few times i have had the dubious distinction of being the only person i know that could cut themselves shaving... with an electric razor.  And even with that i never got a shave as close as my old handheld disposable.  The trimmer is a joke and i still needed my handheld disposable to trim my sideburns.  The charger is cute and seemed to be pretty effective.... that is until the thing died.  The two button release took some trial and error before i was able to open it without spilling the fluid all over my dresser.  All in all im a little disappointed that my wife spent so much money on a product for me that only lasted a year before it will have to be replaced.  I could have spent about 200 dollars less than that by just continuing to use my disposables.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this purchase. Great shave, great battery and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really review the razor because it did not come with a power cord! If the distributor would like to send me a power cord I would gladly re-rate this product! Overall I am very disappointed in the fact that this product did not come with all of its essential parts. My husband just returned home from Iraq and can&#x27;t even use his Christmas present! VERRY DISCOURAGING!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! He experienced only a little irritation at first, but he says it&#x27;s so fast and easy to use. He loves the sideburn trimmer and cleaner/charger.</li>
    <li> I have tried to like this razor and have been trying for over a year now.  It doesn&#x27;t shave close at all for me, continues to irritate my skin and simply cannot reach places under my nose effectively at all.  I have tried dry, wet, with foam, with gel, in the shower etc.  But I have finally given up.  I will be looking to replace this soon as I have simply run out of things to try...and patience.</li>
    <li> Very good product but you need to use with foam because if you dont the skin gets very dry.&lt;br /&gt;The jet clean is great, but remember to refil the liquid every 5 cleans</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried four different electric razors: one Remington and three Norelcos with less than stellar results. I always ended up going back to a blade, because a close shave is what it&#x27;s all about. Well, my beard grows in about six different directions, and even though I got a decent shave with a blade, I was getting tired of having to shave with the grain, against the grain, and across the grain to get it done. Even though I considered it expensive, on the reviews of Amazon purchasers and a leading consumer magazine, I thought I&#x27;d try an electric one more time. My son also has a Sensotouch, but without the jet cleaning system and likes it very well. In a word: Fantastic! This is the only razor I&#x27;ve ever used that really gives me a good close shave everywhere without razor burn in only a couple of passes. The Jet Clean system works really slick, too. I&#x27;ve used this razor and cleaning system for about two weeks now, and it&#x27;s the best grooming investment I&#x27;ve ever made. Money well spent.     Well here we are a little over two years later (January 2015). Norelco changed the head on the razor. The new one is twice as expensive as it should be and doesn&#x27;t work as well. After a lot of frustrated shaves, I threw the whole system in the trash and went back to a blade. I can buy a lot of blades for the price of an electric; especially when it takes the same amount of time to shave. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific shaver.  I&#x27;ve had several Norelco razors in the past.  This one was quite a bit more expensive, but worth the cost.  It gives a close shave, and thanks to the jet clean system doesn&#x27;t develop a funky odor.</li>
    <li> i used to always use a razor for my neck as my religion doesn&#x27;t allow razors  on the face, and an electric shaver for my face. i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost. its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?</li>
    <li> I am Asian male and have rough, thick beard. And I bought Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System which is less effective either wet or dry.</li>
    <li> One of the best Christmas gifts I&#x27;ve ever gotten my fiancé! He absolutely loves this razor, and still thinks me for it to years later. Do yourself a favor and get this for your man.</li>
    <li> its okay, annoying to refill</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 1250cc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System is awesome.  I got this for my partner, who hates to shave and is extremely finicky about electric shavers and he loved it.  Because of his curly hair and sensitive skin, finding a shaver that gives a very close shave with minimal pressure and results in minimal irritation to his skin has been extremely tough.  However, after using the Philips Norelco 1250cc, he has experienced a close smooth shave, both using shaving cream or not (exactly as advertised).  The razor holds a great charge and the jet cleaning system is wonderful and effective.  We have been fabulously thrilled with this razor and have recommended it to his friends.    I don&#x27;t think you will be at all disappointed.</li>
    <li> I waited a little while to use the razor before judging it and I&#x27;m glad I did. My first few times and the razor burn was un-real but in time it&#x27;s gotten better. This thing really does a fantastic job giving you a close shave and there&#x27;s always a payoff with a super close shave. You&#x27;re probably going to have to toughen up that mug if you plan on using this razor. I&#x27;ve used a Braun foil back razor for years and had always assumed it was doing a good job, not until I fired up this baby did I realize what a piece that Braun is.   The foil back was slow and wasn&#x27;t effective at all on longer stray hairs but this guy has no issue with that and it&#x27;s fast! What used to take a good 5 minutes can be done, with better results now in a minute and a half. I much prefer the refillable tank on this Norelco over the replacement cartridge type setup on the Braun.   The little pop-up trimmer gizmo is a cute extra, don&#x27;t expect much from it though.  At first I thought all the lights would just lead to complication but that hasn&#x27;t been the case, they&#x27;re easy to understand after a few uses when they light up. The extra stand they include is neat, haven&#x27;t really used it much. I haven&#x27;t had any issues just leaving mine on the cleaning/charging base.  In conclusion, if you&#x27;re coming from the foil back razors this is a step up big time. I can&#x27;t speak much from other rotary type razors similar to this model.</li>
    <li> Right off the bat I was very very impressed with how advanced this system was. But unfortunately the actual shaving process did not have the same effect.    PROS  Self cleaning process is awesome/high tech.  Comes with more than one charging method.  Comes with beard trimmer.  Very nice/advanced design.  With the right technique, shaves very well.  NO MORE SKIN CUTS!!! (so far none at least) :) Very cool.      CONS  As warned, this does take a while for your skin to adjust to (translation: can make your skin red/itchy)  For me, wasn&#x27;t as efficient as a regular razor.    This was the first electric shaver of this style I&#x27;ve ever used. I must say I prefer a regular razor for wet shaving, and this for dry... but I will go out of my way to use the regular razor as honestly, shaving with this is just... unpleasant for me.    I know I&#x27;m going to use this again in the future for special situations where I need a quick shave - but I don&#x27;t see it as an every day device.    If you didn&#x27;t have to adjust to this shaver and it were much more comfortable for your skin, I would certainly use it much more.    If this shaver went lighter on my skin, it would be pure win.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor.  Note the differences between the most expensive version and this one... a battery that supposedly lasts a few more days and a nicer charging display.  Now look at the price difference.  Kind of a no-brainer.  My preference was for the jet clean system since I firmly believe that clean and sterile blades don&#x27;t get as corroded and will last longer.  A common criticism is the bulk of the charging stand and jet clean system.  I agree with that, they are unnecessarily big, and it&#x27;s a PIA that you can&#x27;t plug the electric cord directly into the razor.  There has been a lot of criticism leveled against this razor to the effect that it must be unplugged after receiving a full charge.  I spoke with their customer service who contacted their engineers- the danger is not in zapping the battery, it&#x27;s there as a general fire safety precaution.  You can leave the razor in the charger and go to work, the battery should be fine.  Speaking of which, I&#x27;m on a deployment now and the battery has lasted over 17 days without a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality is very good, but it is not a blade.  Having shaved with a Merkur Futur (DE razor) for the last several years, the shave was a step down in closeness.  It is noticeable.  That being said, whereas I would spend 12 minutes wet shaving, I will now spend 3-4 minutes dry shaving and get 90% of the results.  Nicks and cuts are a thing of the past, and I can shave in uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product loses one star because:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is expensive&lt;br /&gt;2) Replacing the razor head annually is expensive&lt;br /&gt;3) 90% shave quality is very good, but it&#x27;s not as good as a traditional wet shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth I have pretty sensitive skin, and this is the first time in a long time my face is happy.</li>
    <li> Have used this razor for several weeks now. It has performed as stated in the litrature and shaves closer than expected. It is very quite for an electric. The battery operating time per charge should not be and issuse as some have expressed.</li>
    <li> The trimmer quit working after one use. Everything else about this razor is very good. The cleaning/charging station is very nice.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver.  Took a couple days for my face to get used to it.  Normally would shave every other day but was getting a bit of irritation on my neck, started using it every day NO ISSUES at all. DOn&#x27;t have to worry about nicks or cuts can walk around and shave.  Can shave wet or dry if neeeded.  Cleaner base is very cool.</li>
    <li> Purchased this unit in March and has been working great! Great close shave with very little irritation. After 4 months, the power button stopped working on the front of the handle.  However, it would charge and turn on when placed in the jet clean system.  I called Philips Norelco, gave them the date of purchase/serial number and they immediately sent me a new one in the mail. Hopefully the second one won&#x27;t have the same issues. GREAT customer service. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought it at Best Buy for $249 - it was still worth it.  Great for my sensitive skin.  I use with a pre-shave instead of just dry.  Cleaning it is easy.  Cannot ask for more.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a straight razor first and got real tired of the nicks, than switched to Remington Electric Shaver. After using it for several months I was not impressed, so I switched again, but this time to a Norelco Electric Shaver. Much better results and at a fair price, that was 25 years and 4 shavers ago and now I&#x27;m moving up. My latest purchase is the Norelco 1250xcc and I love it. Smooth, quiet, easy to hold, gives a great shave with no irritation, charges quickly and cleans up easily. I use the Jet Clean System once every every two weeks and hot water cleaning the rest of the time with no hicups. The shaver can be used dry, wet or with gel and will preform exceptionally in all conditions. This is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used a blade all my life to shave.  I didn&#x27;t hate it but was getting tired of razor burn and the occasional nicks.  I have tried an electric razor a few times before and didn&#x27;t like it.  This time consider me converted.  It took me a few shaves to get used to the process but now shaving has gone from being a chore to something I don&#x27;t mind doing.  I have used the electric razor in and out of the shower and done both a wet and dry shave.  No matter the method I get as smooth a shave as I did before if not better.  The only item that could use some improvement is the trimmer on the back but it is sufficient and doesn&#x27;t lower my rating for this item. One other note...many people downgrade their rating of the razor because it can&#x27;t plug directly into an outlet.  It needs to be on the stand and the stand plugged in for a charge and thus they reason that it makes the razor harder to travel with because the stand is bulky.  Well unless you travel frequently for over two weeks at a time I can&#x27;t see how this should be an issue for anyone.  The battery holds a charge for over two weeks so you should only need to take the razor on your travels and it is an easy item to pack and travel with by itself.</li>
    <li> Firstly, it looked like quite a gadget when i removed it from the box, bits n pieces everywhere and quite a large manual. But after a quick breeze through it all seemed simple enough and i started to use my new shaving toy. Being a regular razor type guy for a long time i was at first a little bit sceptical of the supposed performance of an electric razor but, after using the Philips 1250XCC for the required 21 day &#x27;trial&#x27; period i was astounded by the results! Definitely a quicker, easier and at times smoother shave than i expected. The ease required with cleaning and the fact i can get other things done in my morning routine whilst walking around the house shaving was amazing for me, the Jet Clean system is so simple to use and i found after using it the razor performed even better than before. My only gripe with the Philips Norelco 1250XCC is that the HQ200 cleaning solution bottle is a little bulky and with my travelling lifestyle i would definitely appreciate a more slim-line product, but again for you guys who are just using the Jet Clean system at home in your bathroom, this is totally irrelevant. Overall, a GREAT shaver and for ease of use, quality of shave, quality of product (Made in Holland!!) and general look and feel, this is a great buy! Enjoy</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  I was worried about the price, but it is so far worth every penny!  Wish I had invested in one years ago.</li>
    <li> Its ok. It doesn&#x27;t really give my that smooth skin shave I was expecting. Now I know that some razors work better for some people than others due to skin and hair type, but for what I paid I certainly expected it toe work better than it does. Maybe it will work better for you, but for me its just OK at best. I end up still having to go over my face with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of an electric razor being able to match that of my favorite Schick Quattro Titanium hand razor. The Phillips comes pretty close. The triple floating heads follow the contours of you face extremely well, even getting into that tight place just under your nostrils. A big plus is that it&#x27;s not made in China. I would have given the razor 5 stars had it been made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Jet Clean System stopped working properly, it does not go all the way down when i put it into clean mode.</li>
    <li> Maybe its my fault for having to high of an expectation but when I turned over 200 dollars for this product I was expecting to do away with my 5 blade fusion razor. What pushed me to buy this was descriptions of smooth non-irritating shave. I&#x27;ve dealt with irritation on my neck from razors my whole life and I thought this would make it go away but it&#x27;s worse. If you have smooth skin all over the shaver works fairly well as it does work well on parts of my face. If you try shaving under your chin and neck you&#x27;ll find yourself going over and over and over the same spots without being able to get the pesky hairs. You&#x27;ll ultimately end up irritating your skin more than you would have using a cheap disposable shaver. The jet cleaner does a good job if cleaning the shaver but it takes $5 dollars for a bottle of the cleaning fluid every 2 weeks (as instructed). The trimmer is horrible, I have a cheap $20 dollar shaver with a trimmer that does a better job than this one. Overall the product is not worth the price and if your intent of purchase is to escape the horrors of razor bumps this won&#x27;t do it for you. Save yourself the money.</li>
    <li> This thing does not shave close. The older designs were much better. I bought the top of the line model too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; ve been using norelco razors for many years and find the 1250x is by far the best. It gives me a fast and comfortable shave and adjusts to the contours of my face.</li>
    <li> Shaves pretty good. I have no problems with it. I can get 13 shaves easy before having to recharge. Some say that you have to go over the same area several times to get the spots you missed. Well, yes and no. I do go over some areas twice but that&#x27;s because of the shape of your face. Those are the areas where you have to stretch your face a little to help it out. Some say it doesn&#x27;t get the hair next to your nose, I can&#x27;t say cuz I don&#x27;t have hair growing next to my nose.  Cleans up fast with a quick rinse of hot water. I run it through the jet cleaner every time I need to recharge. I like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a foil electric shaver along with the fusion straight blade razor (for my neck) for years and I did a lot of research and debating on whether to get another foil or switch to a rotary. Obviously I chose the SensoTouch 3D. The deciding factor was the fact that I have sensitive skin and I figured the 3D rotating heads would be great for shaving my neck.  This shaver was a great choice! I tried out a dry shave on half of my face and it performed flawlessly. It took about 1-2 minutes to get all the hair off of that half of my face and neck. I was amazed how well it shaved around my mouth, chin, and neck. Then I tried the wet shave on the other half of my face with a shaving gel I use for my straight blade razor. The SensoTouch 3D felt like it was gliding across my face. The wet shave is definitely a more comfortable shave and it feels like I get a closer shave as well. After using the SensoTouch 3D for the wet shave, I believe an electric shave solution would make for a more efficient and comfortable shave than using gel or foam. Something like [[ASIN:B000H7Y250 Aramis Lab Series for Men Electric Shave Solution 100ml/3.4oz]] or the more affordable [[ASIN:B000052Y6Z Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, Original, 3 fl oz]].   It took me less than 5 minutes to shave all the hair off my face and neck (even while trying the dry and wet shave). The SensoTouch 3D shaves just as good as a straight blade razor (with far fewer nicks and cuts) and more efficiently than a foil razor.   This is perfect for someone that likes to keep a clean face. The only bad thing I noticed is that the SensoTouch 3D has a really hard time shaving longer hairs. You will need to trim off the longer hairs first before shaving with the SensoTouch 3D in order to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> i must say I&#x27;m completely sold on this shaver. I was using the Braun foil Series 3 shavers for about 2 years with mixed results. I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave with the Braun and razor bumps were the order of the day. Blades are not for me due to my sensitive skin and the huge risk of razor bumps. I read a couple of reviews about the Philips Norelco and decided to take the plunge. The price is a bit steep as I got the jet clean system as well but after the first shave, I was completely amazed at the close shave I got. Its as close as a blade can get. Since I was using the Braun before, my face didn&#x27;t need to get used to the Norelco so I had zero &#x27;side effects&#x27;. I&#x27;ve had the Norelco for 4 months now and I&#x27;m never going back to a foil shaver!  The shaver is very easy to clean over hot water so don&#x27;t waste your money on the jet clean system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver for over 25 years and this Norelco 1250cc is by far the best electric shaver ever. It is light weight, quiet, the pivoting heads make constant contact on ever curve of my face and the shave is the closest, and cleaner than any shaver I&#x27;ve had previously. I also like the cleaning system that also makes each shave great. Yes, the cost of the shaver system is on the higher end but the results are well worth it!</li>
    <li> The outer ring of close blades is impressive.    However, the middle ring of blades, supposedly for catching longer hairs, is not especially good.  I still have to do the light back and forth method several times to take care of longer areas, so I wish the entire blade/groove system was made the same as the outer ring to improve normal shaving.  If one is desperate to lose some really long hair, the trimmer feature can take care of it.    This shaver is still better than most others, which don&#x27;t have 3 blade levels on each of 3 heads as this one does.  So what is functionally offered is a very good 3-head shaver with additional inner features which don&#x27;t seem to add much.    The charging system is a world ahead of the blind chargers for other razors.  It shows when it is finished charging, and has a 3-level battery meter so you know if it is going to die tomorrow.    I am not sure how useful the cleaning system is.  The flip-out heads are already easy to clean just by running them under a strong faucet for a few seconds, so the cleaning bath seems like an unnecessary extra device.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to speed up my shaving routine because a proper wet shave has me standing in front of the mirror longer than my girlfriend does. I read all the razor reviews and thought this must be the one, and for the price it should have been.     Pros:   Nice ergonomic design.   Ultra quiet.  Self cleaning.  Shaves closer than a blade.    Cons:  Trimmer is near worthless. Still need a blade to detail sideburns.  Doesn&#x27;t flex well enough to get under neck line.  Shaves closer than a blade.    Now you might think I&#x27;m crazy for posting \\&quot;Shaves closer than a blade\\&quot; twice but it&#x27;s a double edged sword, or razor. My first shave was amazingly close and I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin felt. So what&#x27;s the problem? Those hairs decided to revolt and go underground so I ended up with terrible razor bumps that only got worse with each successive shave. I honestly had to stop using it after ten days (no way I could give it 3 weeks) or else I&#x27;d need to a dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve since returned the Norelco and purchased a cheap Panasonic which actually serves my purpose better. A quick shave without the ingrown hairs.    Bottom line. If ingrown hairs are not an issue for you and you want a really close shave give it a try.</li>
    <li> The razor glides smoothly over every curve of my face. Couldn&#x27;t have been more impressed. Cuts the hair with no issues. leaves my face much smoother than my previous remington razor (it was old) So i&#x27;m stoked.      Cleaning system works really well as well.</li>
    <li> This is far and away the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned. It takes a couple weeks for your skin to get used to a shave this close, but the irritation wasn&#x27;t too bad for me. I only rated this four stars instead of five, because with the extra cost of the jet clean system it&#x27;s not a great value. In all honesty, you can clean the razor just fine without it and it takes up a lot of space on the counter. Also, the refills are expensive for how long they last. Bottom line: buy the razor without the jet clean system, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Same as some of the other reviews:  great shaver, short life span.  On my 4th one since Christmas: they all just stopped working.  I&#x27;m not shaving underwater or throwing these things at the wall.  They just stop.  Save the box if you buy one, you&#x27;ll need it for the exchange.</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower with Nivea shaving soap. Battery life is great and the self cleaning system works fantastic. The cleaning solution needs to be cleaned at least every other time. Waited like it said in the manual and the solution was nasty.</li>
    <li> I cholse this as a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; for Christmas.  I chose the Amazon package deal with the cleaner, as the price without is was very close.  It does a good job - especially around the chin.  I used it every day in a row to test the battery life.  Got slightly over 2 weeks - plus it recharges in an hour. Did not have a problem with lower neck irratation that some did.    I always had problems with nubs, but this model eats them up first pass.  Also, when I skip a day or two (home office - who cares), my previous foil razors had a hard time shaving clean without many more passes. This razor seems to like the longer beard (not long - but longer by a few days) and seems to actually cut better with the first pass.  I have not tried the cleaning system yet, as I do not believe it is something that needs to be done frequently. Popping open the heads and blowing out the residue and then rinsing with hot water (plus running it under the water) seems to do a pretty good for short term.  I will try the cleaning system, but may again use warm water and then after it is done, rinse/run it under some of the cleaning solution to lubricate it.  No reason to carry the cleaning kit with you - even if on a several week vacation - the above procedure will get you by OK.</li>
    <li> Had an awesome experience with dry shave but wet gives you the best shave!! Worth the money spent, Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> not that good as I expect. But overall, it works well.</li>
    <li> After reading most all the reviews here at Amazon and reviews at a few other sites ... As well as getting a &#x27;HEALTHY&#x27; discount from Philip&#x27;s Norelco and the vendor (a savings of over $100 in total).  I ordered the Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3D Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System in black.  The SensoTouch 3D arrived on time as promised for Christmas.  I want to clarify something first ... When I said I read most all the reviews, I concentrated on the &#x27;negative&#x27; reviews.  I&#x27;ve owned Norelco Triple-head razors before and the Remington knock-off.  Although the Remington was good, it didn&#x27;t compare to the Norelco.  I knew what kind of shave to expect.  I know that regardless of razor brand ... the built-in sideburn trimmers are weak points.  The built-in trimmer on the SensoTouch 3D is better than most, but not as good as a dedicated trimmer.  The Razor - The look and feel of the SensoTouch is stylish and easy to hold onto.  All angles on the face can be reached quite handily and two areas fair better than when using a blade ... Namely the chin and just beneath the nose.  Both the stand and the Jet Clean systems have small foot prints.  Contrary to some comments I read, you do not have to use the Jet Clean System after every shave. And, having the system is better than not having it (for those of you teetering on the fence, waffling over whether you need it or not).  One other thing I should mention ... Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d is very, very quiet to use.  The Shave - The SensoTouch 3D gave me a shave that was better than I had anticipated.  Especially beneath the nose and in the chin area where the cleft always seems to be a bother.  I use my SensoTouch both wet and dry.  Wet for those once-a-week close shaves with a shaving gel and dry during the week, just to take care of the uneven shadow growth, that seems to get worse as us men get past the age of 40.  The Cleanup and Maintenance - Shave, rinse, shake off the loose water gently and stick it in the charger with the heads open to dry ... Or, shave, rinse well and place in the Jet Clean System, turn on, and let it do its thing.  *TIP* You can turn off the Jet Cleaner because the charger still works as long as the SensoTouch is in the Cleaning System&#x27;s cradle. *TIP 2* - If you get a Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with the Jet Clean System, make sure you rinse it very well (before, during, and after) while shaving with foam, or a gel.  The Value - Many will balk at the hefty price tag (currently $189 as of the time of this review).  But, when you feel it in your hands and note the craftmanship for the first time, you will know you&#x27;ve bought an electric shaver that will last many years if taken care of properly.  But the price isn&#x27;t just for the razor and believe me, the Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3D would be a bargain at $189, without the Jet Clean System.  But as it is, you get the Jet Clean System, a Recharging stand, and a nicely tailored travel case, plus your first bottle of cleaning solution for the Jet Clean System, which lasts far longer than many reviewers have implied.  Bottom Line - Most men know what &#x27;kind&#x27; of electric shave they feel best with.  Some feel they get a better shave from a foil razor, others like the triple head shaver by Remington, or Norelco because their faces can&#x27;t tell the difference.  My face is sensitive, but I also have some white hairs that are hard to cut.  If I use a foil razor, my face gets burned.  If I over work it with the norelco the same thing happens, but to a much less degree.  And now, since I can use my favorite shaving gel with my SensoTouch 3D.  It takes little effort to get a close shave that&#x27;s easy to maintain.  [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my Father and he loved it. Said it was the best razor he&#x27;d ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is my first wet-dry razor.  The shave I get in the shower or with a cream at the sink is far superior to a dry shave.  The combination charger and cleaner that comes with the shaver does a good job of cleaning and disinfecting the cutter heads.  This unit replaced an older Norelco rotary shaver that I had for 6 years.  It was a good choice!</li>
    <li> First of all, let me tell you some things about me.  I have used a razor blade for all my live, with the exception of 4 years in which I used the \\&quot;[[ASIN:B0043DMNHS Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3-Blade Nanotech Wet/dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver]]\\&quot;.  It took me about 3 weeks to get used to the Panny, after this time, the razor did OK, but not great, until I had to toss it to the garbage because the battery died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this experience I went back to the razor blade and I could tell the difference in terms of shaving closeness and irritation.  I swore never to go back to an electric shaver, but then, I really hated having to use shaving cream or gel, and taking from 7 to 10 minutes to shave.  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, It is a horrible beard with a lot of empty spaces that force me to shave regularly, otherwise, I end up looking careless and dirty.  Also, I have a very sensitive skin, prone to breakups when irritated and I had to change my razor blade every month even though I didn&#x27;t shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give the Norelco 1250X Senso Touch 3D a try, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  After one use, there was no irritation whatsoever, it was smooth and left my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.  The first time, it took me around 10 minutes to shave, but now, it takes me around 5 minutes and even less.  No irritation, and believe me, it is as close as a blade, I&#x27;m not exaggerating, it&#x27;s impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Jet Clean System, I can assure you, is not worth the extra price.  This razor is easy and very fast to clean, it will only take you 1 minute to clean it all, I bought this model because it was 5 dollars cheaper than the one without the Jet Clean System at the time of my purchase.  If you really wan&#x27;t to get more value for your money, I would recommend you to buy the [[ASIN:B0067D4RYY Philips Norelco 1255x Sensotouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black, Special Value Includes Extra Shaving Head Pack]]; is only about 20 bucks pricier than the single 1250X, but it has the extra head which costs around 55 dollars, so I believe is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is by far the best shaving experience I have had.  I you are like me: hate shaving, hate wasting time, don&#x27;t have a thick beard, have a sensitive skin and want the closest shave you could ever have; buy this razor, you will not regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing.  Many reviewers give this razor four stars because you can&#x27;t use it while connected to a power source.  This razor is made for dry and wet shaving, so Norelco doesn&#x27;t allow this shaver to be connected while using because of danger of electrocution by people using it in the shower.  But it has the 5 minute charge for a 5 minute use, that is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months using the shaver I&#x27;m still very happy.  I shave every day now, and my wife is happier than me.  I will tell you again, DO NOT BUY THE JET CLEAN SYSTEM.  This thing only washes and charges the shaver, it does not do anything else, and both things are easy and very fast to do on your own.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several foil electric razors over the past few years. They typically start off working well, but their performance quickly becomes mediocre. I have a MANE too. Typically I have a 10 o&#x27;clock shadow and I have to shave constantly. My old razors just couldn&#x27;t keep up.     My new rotary Philips Norelco is AMAZING. I can shave quickly and easily now without any undue tugging or scratching on my face. The cleaning system is also incredibly convenient. I used to accumulate so much facial hair in my old razors and with this one I just pop it in the cleaner, press the button and it&#x27;s clean! No need to rinse or clean manually. One nice feature is that you can also do a wet shave with shaving cream if you wan&#x27;t a more soothing shave. The razor is completely waterproof, even for shower shaving!    I&#x27;ve been through quite a few Braun and Remington razors. This rotary Philips Norelco is what I will be sticking with. From a guy with a quickly growing thick beard, I highly highly recommend this razor. It is a bit expensive, but think of it is as an investment. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and cuts almost as close as my manual razor.  Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty awesome. At first, there was a bit of irritation, but that&#x27;s no longer an issue. Shaving is as comfortable as rubbing my face with my hand. It&#x27;s not as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but from what I understand it takes time for my facial hair to adjust. Though, to be fair, the appearance of the resulting shave is quite smooth. In fact, you&#x27;d have to be pretty darn close or touch my face to notice it&#x27;s not a completely smooth shave. I&#x27;m hoping that this gets better with time, and I&#x27;ll update this review should it.    The cleaning system is a little bit of a let down. I suppose it works just fine, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t always remove all of the hairs from the inside. Extra cycles or opening it up and using the tap is the only other solution. Not that big of a deal though, but, imo, not worth the premium.    The shaver can have an occasional smell of metal, like an old coin for example. A few extra cycles in the cleaning system makes it go away for a while. Nothing too serious, but definitely room for improvement. I hope that the smell will go away entirely over time.    Either way, it&#x27;s a great, quick, comfortable shave, and that&#x27;s all I really wanted. Very glad I made this investment.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shaver. I have to confess that I was a little bit afraid, because I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before and I didn&#x27;t knew if it would heart my skin or if would shave well enough.   The first time I used it I spent a lot of time to shave and my skin got a little bit irritated and red, but after I&#x27;ve talked to some friends they said it happens only while your skin is getting used to the shaver.  After about two weeks I didn&#x27;t had these problems anymore.  Now, after about one month of use, I shave myself with this Philips Shaver really faster than I used to shave with blades, and my beard is also much better shaved, and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated anymore.  I&#x27;m really satisfied and I recommend this shaver for everyone.  About the Jet Clean System, it is really cool, but not necessary for most people. It is really easy to use, keeps your shaver always charged and better cleaned then if you cleaned it yourself. The worst con is that you have to use an special solution and change it every 15 days. But I liked it a lot and I would buy it again if I had to.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace a dying Norelco Quadra 7 (micro screens look like the ones on the mid-level 7340 XL razor).  I was shocked on the first day when it didn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my Quadra.  My first thought was to return it and get the 7340.  I stuck it out a couple of weeks, and noticed the shave improving every day.  I guess the blades need to mesh with the screen and it takes a couple of weeks.  Yesterday I shaved half my face with the 3D, and half with the Quadra 7.  Without telling my wife which side was which, she said the 3D side was a closer shave.  It is not a huge difference, but noticeable.  The biggest advantage to this razor is how easy it is to clean.  You open the head up like a flower, and run it under running water.  The micro screen is very open, and this allows it to wash out much better that a 7000 series razor would.  It washes so well that I thought the self cleaning feature was a waste of money.  But after two weeks of use and daily water rinsing, I rinsed it with water and let it dry.  I then used the Jet Clean and the cleaning solution for the first time.  The next morning I was surprised to see a lot of sediment at the bottom of the fluid.  I don&#x27;t know if it contains skin cells and oil, but it was an eye opener.  Now I actually think the jet clean system is worth it.  So I would say it is a nice razor, but expensive.  The advantage of this unit is a slightly closer shave over the mid-level Norelcos, ease of cleaning, and the Jet Clean.  Only worth it if you have plenty of $$$</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if the razor is any better than my old Norelco, but the cleaning system makes the difference.  I clean every other shaving and the razor still performs and feels like it did the first day.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great razor, have had it for nearly a year and thrilled.  It shaves close and holds a charge for a remarkably long time.  I shave my head everyday with the razor, very easy to do.  Best razor I have ever had.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Norelco razors for used but switched to a Panasonic because our son gave it to him as a gift.  When that razor needed to be replaced, he insisted on going back to a Norelco triple header.  He loves this model, and swears its the closest shave he&#x27;s had in years.</li>
    <li> This razor is revolutionary. Every shave feels like the first shave of a regular blade razor. Shaving hurts a lot less, feels way smoother and more comfortable to use. The battery life is very good too. And not to mention the futuristic design. I love the way the lights light-up when you turn it on. Also the fact that they go away, saving battery life. They stay on just long enough to show off how cool your razor is. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jet Clean System works great. You can literally feel the smoothness brought to the blades by lubrication. I use the cleaning system once every three-four shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco SensoTouch is a great product. You will not regret buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> This razor delivered as promised and was even better than expected.  Very close shaves with no skin irritation even on first use.  Easy clean up.  Long-lasting charge.  Only shortcoming is the narrow width of the sideburn trimmer does require more than one swipe.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just that good! hard to find anything to say that could possible be any better than that at this time.</li>
    <li> Philips makes so many models I thought it would be hard to find the right one. I wanted one that had all of the \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; features, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay an extra $100 for LED lights, touch screen, etc. that wouldn&#x27;t  actually improve the shave. This time I think I got the right one.   I used a Braun Series 8 self-cleaning model for the last several years and just felt the need for a new one. This new Philips runs a lot quieter and does a much better job. The first time I used it, it was so much quieter that I thought it wasn&#x27;t fully charged or that it may have been broken.  Bottom Line - The actual shave is much closer, and it really does a nice job on those unruly neck hairs that the Braun wouldn&#x27;t touch.</li>
    <li> I have always been partial to the foil razor for the closeness of their shave.  However, the one drawback with foil shavers is the greater noise it makes from the razor bars sliding back and forth.  The triple head shavers I&#x27;ve tried in the past have never been good for shaving along the jawline and adam&#x27;s apple.  Also, I&#x27;ve never been able to justify paying over $100 for a personal hygiene product.  With this as a background, I have been completely blown away by the Norelco 1250xcc 3d.  It is near whisper quiet, so I&#x27;ve been able to shave while watching TV at normal volume.  The closeness of this shaver is unparalleled.  I&#x27;ve only tried dry shaving so far, but it also is adaptable to a wet shave and/or cream shave.  I also love the quick charging of this unit, along with the charging \\&quot;meter\\&quot; on the shaver itself.  My son&#x27;s favorite feature is the robotic-like self cleaner.  I&#x27;ve caught him twice already pressing the clean button just to see it raise, lower and make little bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also comes with a travel bag, protective head cover, cleaner solution and quick-charge stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I am EXTREMELY pleased with this shaver.  It is well-worth the extra money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least a dozen electric razors in my time.  All of them have left some kind of patchy stubble unless you rub the crap out of your face with the razor until your face is red.  This razor, one or two times over and it&#x27;s as close as a blade. No kidding.  There is one thing I&#x27;m not crazy about, but since it doesn&#x27;t diminish the quality of the razor&#x27;s main job--close shaving--I didn&#x27;t knock any stars off..  What I don&#x27;t like is, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WITH THAT CHEESY CHARGING THINGAMABOB? It doesn&#x27;t stand up without leaning the razor against something, and in order for you to see the charging status lights, you have to do that.  Minor irritation and I might engineer myself a workaround for it in wood or something.  But for two hundred bucks I would have expected better.  Still, the important thing is I get--in 60-90 seconds--a VERY close, comfortable shave.  That&#x27;s what matters to me.</li>
    <li> Lasted just over a year and stopped working! trimmer too short and will not trim or cut hair. Didn&#x27;t shave as close as they want you to believe it can does. my old Remington R9500 titanium razor still shaves closer and better than this one when new.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor - my wife likes to kiss me after I use it :-)  Not a lot more to say.  I don&#x27;t use the auto-clean function after every shave.  I usually use it once or twice a week.  The solution isn&#x27;t too bad expensive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to evaporate too quickly.  The portable base/charger seems a bit silly to me and I&#x27;ve never used it.  I would prefer a cable that attaches right into the shaver, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal.  The shaver can go for days (weeks?) on a single charge, so it does fine for all my business trips without a charger.</li>
    <li> Love the razor but it broke in 3 weeks and won&#x27;t charge. Norelco is replacing the charger handler. This is my third Norelco. I hope to not have any more problems. This is an update. the next one lasted 2 weeks. It&#x27;s being returned the unit is fried and won&#x27;t take a charge the cleaner unit is worthless and you need a degree in phyics to work it. Seems 1250 has a 50 minute battery and if you charge it longer tjhan that it fries the battery. It is a throw away for $200. They want you to buy the $350 one with a decent battery. You also have only i plug to share between charger stand and cleaner. The cleaner unit is a joke. It has to be filled with their super water at $8.00 for a 4 oz. bottle. The instruction manual is 90 pages and you have to take 10 tests before you can be eligble to shave with this. It&#x27;s made in Holland from a wooden shoe manufacturer. I am lucky this happpened 2 times in 6 weeks. Right in time for my 45 automatic customers disadisfaction policy to run out. Since Jan. the price dropped $30. I will wait until it goes to $0 to buy another Philips Norelco. Remember Ford (Fix or Repair Daily) use to own them along with Magnavox. This was my 2nd Norelco. My 1st one has a case latch broken because the plastic housing is made of thin cheap plastic. When you call customer service they make excuses for this and tell you you need the better model or get a baby sitter towatch the charging unit. Don&#x27;t leave in stand the 50 cent battery won&#x27;t last. My cell phone battery is better. and so are off brand dollar store batteries.  This has a great cutting head but that where it ends. It&#x27;s also noisy and the cleaner unit takes longer than my kids do in the shower.  Norelco only wanted to give me back wkat I paid less the coupon I got for opening an Amazon account. Amazon is giving me all of it. Norelco is a con artist. Thank you Amazon.  By the way there are 7 other reviews with the same problem. It&#x27;s might shave well but has a battery problem. I guess you need all thegadgets. Get rid of this model and only make the one with real rechargeable batteries. Sell these batteries to Yugo for a Hybrid or Kodak for a 10 shot Instimatic but don&#x27;t use the flash or you&#x27;ll get only 3 pictures out of it. By the way Philips used to check my pacemaker battery but is getting out that business to recharge their razors. Maybe I can get an adaptor to charge my razor from my pacer.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day, and this shaver is perfect. Very fast, very close shave, and very easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t had it catch/pinch my hair at all and i&#x27;ve have had it for about a month.</li>
    <li> Great razor, battery died in 2 years. Cant find a service provider anywhere.  Soooo disappointed in norelco.  Guess i toss it and buy a braun.  My previous norelco battery lasted over 10 years.  Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Ce razoir est parfait, c&#x27;est mon 2eme Philips Norelco, mais mon premier SensoTouch 3D.  Au départ je me demandais si le prix en vallais la chandelle. Ho que oui il réduit mon temp de rasage d&#x27;au moins 35%, coupe les poils long sans difficulté, le rassage est très près de la peau. Je me rase sans crème et je n&#x27;ai aucune irritation de la peau ce qui n&#x27;étais pas le cas avec mon modèle précédent. Seul point pourquoi jai donner 4 au lieu de 5 étoile. Le système jet clean ne sert pas a grand chosse il fonctionne bien mais il prend 3 heure a faire le cycle et dans le manuel il recommande de débrancher le system/chargeur apres son utilisation mais moi je suis au travail rendu la donc je le lave sous l&#x27;eau a chaque utilisation. Donc sauver un peu d&#x27;argent et prenez lautre modèle sans le jet clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco 1250xcc/42 senso touch 3d w/jet clean system. The razor feels good in your hand and gives a really good shave and one of the best things is, I have sensitive skin and it causes very little if any razor burn,hugs your face well and gets those hard to cut places on your neck and around your nose. I am not sure about the jet clean system just yet, one of the negatives with it is the size and space it takes up and if it is really all that helpful or necessary and the fact that you need to replace the cleaner often which adds to the cost,also you cannot plug the cord into the razor for on the go, you must use the charging stand so that means more to pack on a trip but the battery life between charges is pretty good so if its only a few days or so you don&#x27;t need it. One other negative is the trimmer is real close to the razor, pops out about a half inch or so and makes it tough to maneuver. My old razor had a longer flip out trimmer I liked better but overall still does the job, I guess my biggest complaint would be the price of the razor but if you want a good shave without razor burn you will have to pay no matter what you get for now.  To end on a good note if you have the money I would definitely recommend it! The 3d is great cleaning is easy.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver it does a very good shave as well as a razor and the cleaning system is very good.  Wet or dry this shaver will impress even longtime razor users.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shaver since it first came on the market. The 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch combined with the Jet Clean System is by far the best of them all!! I receive a smooth, close shave with no irritation, and take adbvantage of the several methods for cleaning the shaver: rinsing under running water or the Jet Cleaning Unit ( The easiest and most effective method ) I give this 4 stars as I feel that there is nothing that can&#x27;t be improved upon or qualifying for a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Best rotary shaver ever . . . period.  Don&#x27;t look anywhere else and don&#x27;t settle for a cheaper model, you&#x27;ll end up buying 6 more anyways.  My last PhilipsNorelco Sensotouch shaver lasted me 5 years, changed the blade once! I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, if I use a razor or a bad electric shaver, my face blows up!  Never with this one.  Close cut, smooth, baby face, no issues.</li>
    <li> 35 years ago my Father told me \\&quot;If Your going to use an electric razor - use a Braun\\&quot; and so began a relationship with Braun products that up until recently has lasted close to forty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What set Braun apart from every single other electric razor on the planet was it&#x27;s Patented Optifoil. It was unlike anything else. Instead of uniform, same shaped holes. The foil had a wide variety of different shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Circles, half moons, crescents, stars and so on. It seemed random in placement but there was a method to the madness and you really ended up with a blade close shave.The foil and cutter (linear blades designed by Gillette) may be the head of the razor but when it comes to performance this is the very heart of any electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being both a head and face shaver, I prefer a wet shave with a DE (double edge) safety razor or straight blade. But the process is time consuming. I&#x27;ve tried other electrics over the years - including rotary razors which I never cared for and found them sub par on every level  to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Proctor &amp; Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When P&amp;G bought Gillette and Braun they made significant changes. The small appliances division was closed down. Manufacturing of the electric razors was terminated in Germany and resumed in China with the exception of the 760 &amp; 790cc which are still, at least for the time being made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is more, P&amp;G scrapped the original foil and replaced it with a generic one. Now with uniform octagon punch holes and without the center \\&quot; Active Lift\\&quot; strip this once excellent razor now shaves as well as any $40 piece of junk. (luckily I have one new original replacement left)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrigued by the positive reviews as well the high rating on Consumer Reports I bought the new Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1250X  and am delighted I did..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the shave was rough and poor but I&#x27;m finding as time goes on each shave is noticeably faster, easier and cleaner. The look of the razor is sensational, sexy, sleek and wonderfully ergonomically designed. It&#x27;s also without question the quitest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s surprisingly light, well balanced and fits nicely in the hand. The heads of the razor pivot so much and so effortlessly it&#x27;s the perfect razor for head shavers such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I get the closest shave by going with the grain in straight stroked as opposed to the suggested circular motions - but like any razor electric or not it&#x27;s all very subjective and personal. The key is always to find out what works for you best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleaning System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning and charging system is the best I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s a marvel to watch, takes up very little space and does an excellent job. I use it after each shave, but that may change. I think I just love watching that little robot lift, tilt and lower the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer on the other hand is very poor. It&#x27;s tiny compared to the Braun or the Panasonic ARC and Linear razors and doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you Get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The Razor (of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The charging and cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Power cord (for charger and station - Norelco should include two)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One 4 oz bottle of cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Nifty carrying case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning brush ( but no place to store it, minor issue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Users manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many aspects are well thought out.

And again, it&#x27;s whisper quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply a waonderful razor that does an equally exceptional job.look of the razor is sensational, sexy, sleek and wonderfully ergonomically designed.

    <li> Good shaver good battery life.</li>
    <li> photo in ad. is of 1180xx not the 1250x I expected one in picture, when I open box that caused confussion on my part</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband after long and intense research. My husband has a hairy face and his facial hair grows back extremely quick. He also has really sensitive skin that can&#x27;t tolerate being shaken daily. I&#x27;m sure you can imagine our dilemma. This Norelco was the 1st (of many) electric shaver that gives my husband a close shave without causing any irritation. He has been able to use it daily before work without irritation as well. This Norelco has been a Godsend for us, for him especially since it&#x27;s not very professional going to work looking grizzly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the wife, I love his face shaven, and ladies, it does a great close shave that you can forget about your man&#x27;s itchy stubble. I have sensitive skin as well, and my husbands stubble causes me to break out in bumps if he wants to give me attention. Not cool. Norelco saved us from that issues as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man and wife are thoroughly pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Worth every cent.  Every man in our family has a razor like this of their own.  After buying $100-$149 razors that don&#x27;t last more than a year, we decided to move us to this one.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> At 24 years of age, I still have not been able to grow much beard. So, I had to test these out on my side-locks and my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I keep my mustache fairly short, the system was able to shave it away with no hassle. But it had a bit of a problem keeping up with my side locks. My guess is that it only goes along well with minute bits of facial hair. Other than that, it is a nice replacement for my shaver. It self cleanses and all, just what you would expect from a modern-day shaving system.</li>
    <li> This shaver was purchased for a Christmas gift to my son. After using the shaver for 9 days, his reply to me was \\&quot;This is the best Christmas gift you ever gave me\\&quot;. It really gives me a Great shave. My old shaver was good, but I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 3 o&#x27;clock. With the Norelco 3D I don&#x27;t have to shave in the middle of the day, especially before a meeting with a customer.  He would recommend the Norelco to all of his buddies.</li>
    <li> In my 30 years of shaving I&#x27;ve tried a few electrics, including microfoils and an older Norelco triple-head rotary shaver.  These worked somewhat but left noticeable stubble.. almost a &#x27;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&#x27;.  I never really understood why someone would use these when a blade did so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the new Philips Norelco 1250 and I see things have changed.  Naturally a device with screens can&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but it gets DARN CLOSE!  I followed the instructions and used it for a month before passing judgement.  Supposedly you need re-condition your skin for a different shaving method or something like that.  It didn&#x27;t take that long to realize this was a perfectly acceptable replacement for everyday shaving.  There may still be times when I will use a blade, but so far haven&#x27;t..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- Convenient.  No soaps or creams needed, just grab it and shave while you are doing other things in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;- Good, close shave.  You *might* feel a little stubble on your neck but it will not be visible.  The side-burn pop-out razor cuts well and doesn&#x27;t bite, you can actually do some nose hair trimming safely.&lt;br /&gt;- Handles contours like an Adam&#x27;s Apple well.  The three surfaces flex in to fit your face, chin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- Can truly be a replacement for blades, unless you need a very smooth face for the ladies (Use a razor on those days!)&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof.  Use it in the shower without damage.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean.  Simply flip the heads up and rinse under running water for a few seconds.  I have not found it necessary to use the included cleaning system.. this is probably an unnecessary gadget.  Give it to your wife to clean her jewelry!&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to disassemble.  The triple-head pops right off with a gntle pull and snaps right back in.  But you don&#x27;t need to do this to rinse off the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- Need to use it every day, compared to my using a razor every 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;- Initially expensive but in the long run comparable to the cost of decent blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are replacing and old electric, or want the convenience of not having to rinse your face and sink clean, and still want a good shave, this product is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Winter is coming so I&#x27;ve started another beard.  While I&#x27;m back to a comb-type trimmer for the beard, I&#x27;m using the Norelco to shave my neck, lower lip, and do quick touchup of my cheekbone area.. the combination works well and keeps me looking neat.  It replaces the blade and is more convenient.e replacing and old electric, or want the convenience of not having to rinse your face and sink clean, and still want a good shave, this product is for you!    Update:  Winter is coming so I&#x27;ve started another beard.  While I&#x27;m back to a comb-type trimmer for the beard, I&#x27;m using the Norelco to shave my neck, lower lip, and do quick touchup of my cheekbone area.. the combination works well and keeps me looking neat.  It replaces the blade and is more convenient.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift, My husband loves it.  No more shaving cream and razor.  Before when he was rushed in the morning, he would use the cheap electric razor he used to clip his nose hairs (it had three attachments).  Now he has a smooth clean shaven skin every morning.  A little pricey but razor blades at up over time.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor, I shave open the heads and rinse it off, then stow it on the wash. I have not had this close of a shave in years, didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco lasted for a freakishly long time (over a decade of daily use) before it finally got to the point where it was not really holding a charge. This shaver is fantastic. Used dry it provides a fast and reasonable shave, easily coping with the difficult areas like chin and neck. For a super close shave I use it wet with a shaving gel - this gives me a better result than I have ever had, even with a five bladed blade shaver. Also without the haemorrhage from facial cuts.  The Jet Clean cleaning station certainly works, but I am not sure how much better it works than washing the shaver under a tap.  Electric shavers are not for everyone, and rotary shavers are not for every electric shaver user. However, if a rotary suits you, this one should do the job.  I was not too worried about the purchase price - even if it only lasts 2 years that is only $2/ week, a bit extra if you keep buying the Norelco cleaning solution, and replace the head once a year as recommended.</li>
    <li> I was raised on razors. They provided the closest and cleanest shave and my opinion on them hasn&#x27;t changed even now. I thought a lot about electric razors and the opinions on them have always been a love or hate from those I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take a chance on this one and I&#x27;m glad I did. The first few weeks were a bit rough as the manual suggested but after that, I really enjoyed shaving with this. It gets close, as close as shaving normally with a downward motion. When I need to get a closer shave, I take a razor and go upwards and it makes my face really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensotouch does a great job of replicating a normal shave but it won&#x27;t give you the really smooth shave you can get from a razor. It doesn&#x27;t have to. Shaving use to be a chore I do every other day because of the time it took. Maybe once a month I would do a more smooth shave. Where the Sensotouch really helps is I&#x27;m more comfortable shaving every day. Since it takes a few minutes, I do it in the morning and never have to worry about my facial hair getting too long after a couple days.</li>
    <li> I used this razor for about six months (during that time it was a good razor) after that period I began to have problems to the point the battery went dead and the razor stoped working...&lt;br /&gt;It will not charge any more...&lt;br /&gt;I been trying to get services at no avail... No way possible...&lt;br /&gt;Really I do not recommend this product...</li>
    <li> After 3 years of the Norelco Arcitech 2D razor, instead of replacing the RQ10 blades for the second time, I decided to replace the entire shaver.  I liked the idea of the heads moving in THREE dimensions (not a big difference); I wanted a better trimmer (much, much, better); and I wanted to have newer batteries (when the battery goes, so goes the entire razor, as they are not replaceable).&lt;br /&gt;The Jet Clean System is a bit quieter than the older model, and it does a very good job at cleaning and lubricating the heads.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used an electric razor to prevent the multiple cuts I would suffer with a blade.  This Norelco gives me a fast, easy, and close shave, without any injury, and now the trimmer is first rate.  You don&#x27;t need the Jet Clean, but I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This truly is the best electric shaver I have ever own!!  For the past six years I used another norelco shaver and I didn&#x27;t have any complains with it, but now that I have this model, I&#x27;m can honestly say I&#x27;m totally impressed with the ergonomics, close shave, and new features!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best razor ever. I can use it wet or dry and get a clean close shave every time. It is a little on the costly side, but some times you have spend a little more to get a better result. I would recommend this to anyone that does not mind spending a little cash. Also it comes with the automatic cleaner that works great.</li>
    <li> I need to start by saying that I hate to shave. I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette line for years, from their single blade to Mach3 to Fusion blades. Even though they did the job, it was always my least favorite part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Norelco 1250xcc a few weeks ago. Got it on the charger, and just a few minutes later I was ready to shave. Started off with a dry shave, which missed some hairs and caused a bit of discomfort on my skin. The manual says that&#x27;s normal, as with any new blade, you have to give the skin time to get used to the blade. However, I was kinda itchy so I decided to give it another try a few hours later, this time using shaving gel. The experience was fantastic!!! I love the shave using the shaving gel, and I use it whenever I have time. Yes, you waste another minute applying the gel, but you will feel very refreshed, and you will get minimal skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great shaver, that I most likely will purchase again as gifts for friends and family.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son and he loves it.  Works very well but if hair is very long needs to be trimmed down first.  He can go about a month without recharging the battery.  Shaves nice and close.</li>
    <li> Read quite a few reviews before purchasing, and the term &amp;#34;robo kisses&amp;#34; came up in one and made me laugh out loud.  Turns out, &amp;#34;Robo Kisses&amp;#34; may be the most accurately way to describe this razor...simply the best.</li>
    <li> Cuts short hair 2-3 days growth really good, any longer and it doesnt seem to work very well. Does cut very smooth compared to other electric shavers Ive owned. The jet clean system only seems necessary if you shave with shaving cream, otherwise it rinses clean fine with water but the shaving cream clogs up the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good razor, wouldnt recommend the cleaner.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have(like many others) sensitive skin. After a shave my naeck feels like its on fire. Also, the skin rash is commonplace. So much so that I could never go up from &#x27;Gillette sensor excel&#x27; format blades. Mach3, gillette fusion were pretty much like a potato peeler for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked philips solely for its ability to work with wet shaves. Wet shave is easier on the skin and hair get slightly softer when moist. I chose to get it with the jet clean system since its good to give it a &#x27;proper&#x27; clean every now n then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this a couple of weeks now and this is what I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;- Gives VERY close shave without ripping your facial skin off. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;- Cant eliminate the skin rash entirely but its a LOT more comfortable for the kind of shave you get.&lt;br /&gt;- Its fairly quiet and feels sturdy in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;- Hold the charge well and can charge while sitting on the jet clean system.&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer is decent for what it does. I use it for minor trim around the sidelocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Misses some spots shamelssly. The shaver seems to ignore some spots especially in the neck area. I make sure I do it 2-3 times on the tricky areas(circular motion et al), but it so far has never been flawless. Sort of defeats the purpose of a quick shave. Which is why I have removed 1 star from an otherwise brilliant product. (This could be a user error, will upgrade to 5 star if I see this situation improving.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would heartily recommend this product. After a lot of research 1250 is what I chose above the rest of the philips series since the differences are mostly cosmetic in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1 07/11/2013&lt;br /&gt;Getting better at this. But still not able to shave off 100% on the neck. Maybe I should get rid of the neck cos i love the shaver!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor i&#x27;ve ever had. I always had problems with electric razors because i have very coarse hair and very sensitive dry skin. It&#x27;s not as close as a normal razor but the closest that i&#x27;ve ever felt. It&#x27;s very efficient too. You don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area over and over again. Since it does shave so close though, i would suggest having some good aftershave lotion for razor relief but i&#x27;ve gone without it before and haven&#x27;t had any razor rash or anyting like that which is what I normally get. It fits in my hand perfectly so I don&#x27;t worry about it falling out. Its fairly light so yur hand doesn&#x27;t get tired. About as heavy as an Iphone. I&#x27;ve taken it in the shower and it works fine. No difference wet or dry as far as shaving. Cuts the same either way. The sideburn trimmer works pretty good. Probably the only gripe that I have is that the cleaning cycle takes too long. Besides that, its a great razor.</li>
    <li> I have used nearly every brand of electric razor since I started shaving over 40 years ago. I did a lot of research before making the purchase of the 1250X. I have a Norelco razor that I have had for 13 years that still works well but it wasn&#x27;t getting me the results that I wanted for my razor needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my razor to not only shave my face but also my head. This razor is hands down the best electric razor I have ever used. It&#x27;s quiet gives a very, very, close shave and the self cleaning unit works great at keeping the razor clean and ready to go. My wife commented after my first couple of uses on just how well it shaves my head. The tilting and floating heads get into nooks and crannies on the back of the head and neck that other razors just can&#x27;t touch. If your looking for a close, comfortable shave without the hassle and expense of standard razors this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> Provides a smooth shave; very easy to use. I would recommend this product to all men in your family or your friends.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco rotaries since I was given my first one as a high school graduation gift ... in 1966.  I don&#x27;t know how many exactly, but there have been several.  This one was by far the priciest - but I have ZERO buyer&#x27;s remorse.  I am a world-class cynic, and was more than a bit skeptical about the \\&quot;close as a blade\\&quot; claims, but I am happy to report that it, in fact, is.  No disappointment here at at all - I would not hesitate to recommend to a friend.  The ONLY negative I can think of is the inability to run it corded if you let the battery run down too far.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Norelco shaver that I have had for many years. This one is great and gives me a smooth shave in less time. I like being able to rinse it clean after use. It feels good in my hand and is much quieter than my old Norelco. I have not used the jet clean system yet. I&#x27;ve had it about a month now and would recommend it others that use electric razors. I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric razor for over 40 years now and this is the best electric razor I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I actually love my razor, cuts close and smooth. I don&#x27;t however care for the charging cord. I have charged my razor once on the charging dock and cleaned it twice in the motorized cleaning dock and now the charging cord doesn&#x27;t work. You would think that for $189.99 that there would be some sort of warranty. Unfortunately I will have to spend an additional $20 or so to order and have shipped out to me a new cord.</li>
    <li> Got this gift for my Boyfriend about two years ago. Still works like a charm! He uses it maybe once a week (I like the rugged manly look ;-) ) and it works great, charges FAST, and looks pretty! The heads on these last FOREVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS NORELCO!</li>
    <li> I had my last electric razor for 14 years.  It still works but simply doesn&#x27;t shave as well as it did even with new foil and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hesitant to pay this much for a new electric razor.  I have had it 3 months now and can safely it is a close to a traditional razor shave as you can get, shaves quickly with the large surface and is very quiet.  The cleaning system is a breeze to use and I only use that once a week.  The charge it gets during the cleaning process lasts the entire week easily. It cleans up well with a hot water rinse during the rest of the week.  I have a round face and my last shaver would miss a spot or two.  I kept a traditional razor in the shower to get those spots.  The 3d doesn&#x27;t miss a spot anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A very &amp;#34;High tech&amp;#34; shaving experience. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Gift for my hubbie, he loved it.</li>
    <li> Feel good, close shave shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product and Philips Norelco does a great job of planned obsolesce.  I give them a 5 star at designer a product that you must through out and by a new one every couple of years.  I only buy the full razor because the replacement heads for this razor are about the same price of an entirely new product.  So five star to a company that makes you through out their perfectly good product frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would like to report they have great customer service.  If anything breaks including the plastic cover for the blade heads.  Do not purchase a replacement but instead call customer service and they will send you a replacement for free.  That I like though perhaps they where thinking I would just by an entirely new razor instead.</li>
    <li> I promptly recieved my order from Amazon. The razor is light weight, easy to charge and easy to clean. I have used several types of electric and blade razors over the years and this is by far the best results I have ever been able to obtain. The ability to use the razor in a dry state if your in a hurry or as a wet razor if time permits is an added benefit with this razor. The flexible head helps follow the contours of your face and the flip open rotary blade arrangement allows for quick easy cleanup. The Jet clean system takes a while to cycle through but should always have the razor ready by your next shave. This was a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the razor. It provides a comfortable, close shave. The cleaning system works well and leaves the razor smelling fresh and clean when used again. The only negative has been the built in trimmer. The positioning within the razor makes it virtually impossible to see what you are trimming.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  It shaves nicely and the cleaner is nice to have.  This is an overall a good shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s skin feels softer after shaving compaired to when he used a regular razor. Plus cleaning is easy, so he does not have to bother much with maintenance.  Best birthday gift yet!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m enjoying this razor, it&#x27;s sharp and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auto-cleaning with the specific device is easy to use and keeps it smooth on my skin. The only drawback is this one is fixed function cleaning and takes around 2 hours (15 min to clean, 1:45 to dry).</li>
    <li> This is the mercedes-Benz of shavers. Very refined and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over a year now and am very satisfied, albeit a more expensive model which is basically the same rotary head just has silver metal trim that makes it more expensive. I used to get razor burn on my neck with gillette fusion proglide which would be all red once done shaving. With this shaver its hardly ever happens, except on rare occasions. It works best wet and that too with shaving cream rather than foam or gel.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this one for my dad, he loves it. I have converted 3 more people in my family to start loving electric shavers with the sensotouch 3d,  these folks had a negative prior experience with major brand foil shavers.</li>
    <li> Good electric razor over all. Leaves a smooth shave as it was a brand new razor blade. Liked how the owner gave me $10 back. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s best for people who doesn&#x27;t deal with Gilette products. Of course it&#x27;s not perfect but best in the world...</li>
    <li> I have had this for a little over a year.  It&#x27;s supposed to have different sized slots for longer hairs.  I am finding that it leaves a lot of longer whiskers and doesn&#x27;t give much of a close shave at all.  If I could return it, I would.  I just bought a different shaver.  This is too expensive for this to have happened.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver only problem with it is that the trimmer sucks thats why i am giving this only 3 else 5 start</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery</li>
    <li> best shave yet from an electric razor  Jet Clean System works great.  Ordered one for a grandson to use too.  Cleaning solution could get pricey as you get about 3 fills to a bottle.  In all well worth the price for this shaver.</li>
    <li> Close Shave, much better than my original corded Norelco. Heads flex and follow very well. Good Battery Life. Haven&#x27;t used cleaning system yet after 3 weeks of use, rinse daily after shave under hot water so far.</li>
    <li> The razor was all that I expected.  I got a close shave in a short amount of time.  I was surprised at how well the cleaning system works.  It does take up space on the counter, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this shaver does the job as advertised. But, it&#x27;s definitely not worth $220.  Look for cheaper alternatives that will do the same job, but for less money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 20 years, I tested / used several shavers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Manual shavers gives you close shave with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;2-Most electric shavers never gives you close shave and sometimes irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one worked from day one, easy, close shave and NO IRRITATION!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, someone came up with this 3D seneso touch technology and save my face.&lt;br /&gt;Its not cheap, but with the discounts and the Black Friday sale , I got this one for 1/2 the price ( best price is on Amazon , believe it or not, was even cheaper than Walmart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with warranty and you can return it if you don;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one comes with the Jet cleaning system which I am glad to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one last thing, it saves you a lot of time in the morning comparing to manual shavers when you rush to work.......A lot!&lt;br /&gt;No more shaving cream and no more water.....just simple , dry and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;I spend $192 a year on manual shaver heads, this one comes with one year shaving head which you can replace for less than $60.&lt;br /&gt;It will notify you when the head needs to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Switched to Norelco Senso Touch 3d after using Braun 7 series shaver. Must say, I was a only using Braun shaver for about 6+ years, and after using Senso Touch, I won&#x27;t be going back to Braun ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much quieter then Braun. Braun 7 Series sounds like a chainsaw by comparing to Senso Touch. I spend less time shaving with Senso Touch then Braun. Senso is lighter, has better battery life and less irritating shave (after getting use to it).  Easier to clean, and foil lasts much longer then on Braun.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law who who is in the military and will be overseas during Christmas!! He was so excited and said when he used it, it was like he used a regular razor!!</li>
    <li> Love the Senso Touch 3D! It was a gift for Father&#x27;s day from my wife and she really nailed it. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I had a whole regimen for shaving and even with the expensive fusion pro glide I was still not getting the shaves I wanted. I decided to try this out for 21 days and I can definitely say its a better shave with a lot less hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend the williams electric pre shave with this.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for few month now and still enjoy shaving every morning.&lt;br /&gt;the fact that it can be use as a dry and wet shave is great.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the wet shave give me a closer shave than the dry one.&lt;br /&gt;the Jet clean system is also a great add to this product which makes it easier to clean it after every shave.</li>
    <li> What a difference a this makes. My husband has been using the same old electric shaver for years and he never gets a great shave from it.....So I finally bit the bullet. The Senso Touch is amazing!! His face is so smooth and the shave lasts longer. Really worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This a fantastic razor. Quiet. Powerful. The jet clean system is great for when a simple rinse won&#x27;t do. And the price is the same as a similar model without the cleaning system</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a high end Braun shaver/ cleaning unit over the last five years.  I have a reasonably heavy beard and I honestly believed I would continue to use that shaver until it quit and I think it still has years.  But from the VERY FIRST shave with the Philips Norelco 1250 I knew I HAD A NEW SHAVER.  I&#x27;m 52-years old and have been shaving for quite some time.  This VERY FIRST shave was the best shave of my life. Bar none.  So quick, so close and extremely comfortable.  My beloved Braun cannot hold a candle to this new marvel of technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following my \\&quot;magical\\&quot; shave, I tried out the Jet Clean system.  I want to mention that I did run the shaver under a hot tap, as suggested by Norelco, before using the Jet Clean.  Honestly, I think the &#x27;tap cleaning&#x27; removed every last whisker and left the unit spotlessly clean.  But I wanted to test the cleaning system, since my Braun also had one.  Simple, intuitive.  It really is just the push of a button and the unit undergoes a two hour cleaning and drying process.  Though the manufacturer is suggesting this after each use, I don&#x27;t think that would be necessary.  Once a week or every few days should suffice if one is &#x27;tap rinsing&#x27; the blades in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the assembly apart is a snap.  The instructions could be a bit clearer relating to accessing the blades and combs- but it&#x27;s figured out fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give a higher rating.  This is a BRILLIANT advance in my shaving life.  And I welcome it.  Think about it men, we spend a LOT of time in our lives shaving.  It is really nice when it is such a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This product just &#x27;stopped&#x27; working.  I pressed the power button only to find a dead shaver.  Short of the hassle of sending it back for exchange etc.. I just tossed it out.  Check your warranty carefully and plan for the worst.  My review had been five stars, now I&#x27;m only giving it a one.</li>
    <li> For decades I was a dedicated blade shaver and over the last few years most of the time I just ran a set of clippers over my cheeks and went with the scruffy look. I have fairly sensitive skin and I wear a long goatee. The last time I tried an electric razor of any kind (an expensive German model) it grabbed a hold of my facial hair and STUCK to my face. I was quite worried about a repeat of that disaster with this new razor from Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find I could get right up against my goatee without any hair grabbing problems. The razor went through heavy stubble with ease though it did require a bit more pressure than I initially expected. The first time I used this I had to go back and reshave but that was just the learning curve and not the fault of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the instructions it does warn about skin irritation while switching shaving methods and I must admit I had some irritation. It was more pronounced on the softer skin of my neck and under my chin and less on my cheeks. The irritation wasn&#x27;t severe and went away in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver dry or with shaving gel/cream. I&#x27;ve tried it both ways and I must say I LOVE using this razor with my shaving gel the head glides smoothly and it seems to result in an even closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the shaver would be the position and maybe the size, of the trimmer. It&#x27;s a bit small and awkwardly located behind the shaver heads so it&#x27;s a bit hard to see what you&#x27;re doing clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the unit is a breeze even when using shaving gel. Rinsed under warm running water then opening the heads to rinse out the clippings and residual foam. Alternately you can also use the Jet Clean System which is as simple as it gets. Place the razor in the unit and push the button on the front of the Jet Clean System. The razor moved in and out of the included cleaning solution, then dries and charges itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package also includes a separate charging stand (which shares the cord with the Jet Clean System), handy travel case and a small cleaning brush along with the bottle of cleaning fluid for the Jet Clean System.udes a separate charging stand (which shares the cord with the Jet Clean System), handy travel case and a small cleaning brush along with the bottle of cleaning fluid for the Jet Clean System.</li>
    <li> This is a very stylish design for a shaver. It&#x27;s lightweight and has an ergonomic feel in the hand and against the face according to my husband. When it arrived I realized we were dealing with a \\&quot;system\\&quot; as it came in a HUGE box full of multiple smaller boxes of components and accessories. The SensoTouch Shaver sort of has it&#x27;s own little universe on my husband&#x27;s bathroom counter right now and I wasn&#x27;t expecting THAT. There&#x27;s the razor itself, it&#x27;s charging stand, it&#x27;s cleaning box, the bottle of cleaning solution, the blade cover, the brush that cleans the moustache trimmer, and the travel case. All those gizmos serve good purposes and are nice to have in and of themselves, but my goodness... we&#x27;ve sort of gone beyond a quick morning shave and into the domain of manscaping at this point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, the battery was totally dead, so into the charger it went. Within about 90 minutes the battery was completely charged and ready to go. No fuss, no muss and no waiting overnight. That is a very nice feature - super fast charging. The power button is a flush push button on the front of the razor, easy to find and the power indicator is a row of L.E.D. lights going up the front of the unit with a futuristic look that just adds another touch of style to the whole look. Overall a really nice design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mustache trimmer pops in &amp; out of the top of the unit just behind the trimmer blades easily. It works smoothly and did a nice job evenening up my husband&#x27;s mustache. Though using too much pressure will result in a cut to the upper lip very quickly. The razor itself for actual beard/face shaving was close and did a fine job with only one real complaint from the man of the house. He groused about the fact that the blades missed some of the hair along his neck line requiring multiple passes over the same area. We&#x27;re not sure why this happened - it may be the location of the area, it may be that the hair on the neck line is finer than the hair on the rest of his face or it may be something about the razor. What he did say was that shaving with a regular hand razor or his ancient Norelco electric razor he did not need to make multiple passes in the same way as with this new SensoTouch 3d Razor. So overall... he does like this razor and will continue to use it, but wishes it took up less real estate on his counter top. (Of course you can stash some of the extras in the closet!)or it may be something about the razor.

    <li> I had this unit for 2.5 years, and the jet clean system is buggy.  It doesn&#x27;t want to clean my shaver anymore, when I load it up and put the cleaner into the container and put the shaver into the jet clean system unit, the unit will lower the shaver and raise it immediately without cleaning it.  The orange low fluid indicator would come on and the unit would freeze.  There is plenty of fluid inside of the canister, so that&#x27;s not it.  I contacted Philip Norelco&#x27;s customer service to see if they could help me troubleshoot or fix or even alleviate the  problem, but the only thing they told me was that I had to buy a new jet clean system machine.  The machine standalone replacement costs over 120 bucks, seriously??  The shaver with the cleaning system cost 190, and the cleaning system alone cost 120???  This is horrible customer service, I have also done some research online and this seems to be a very common issue that Norelco just never fixed, so beware before you purchase.</li>
    <li> Unlike some others who say it has a short life, I have had mine for almost 2 years now and it hasn&#x27;t got any worse - battery life is over 1 hour and there hasn&#x27;t been any significant decrease.&lt;br /&gt;But the shave is terrible. The best result it gives me is an uneven stubble. It misses hairs everywhere and usually does not catch some hairs even if I try 100 times. It also often causes bleeding and always irritates my face.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that this shaver throws all the hair out. So forget about shaving at your desk like you did with the old ones. You need to do it in the bathroom and then clean the mess. This is not a problem with mine. I took it to their service center and they said it&#x27;s the way these are designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver was a Speed XL - it was just great. But then the battery died and the heads needed changing, so I thought why not get a new one which is even better. Big mistake! I&#x27;ll probably repair the old one and go back to that soon</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband, who seems to go through an electric razor every year. Here&#x27;s what he had to say about this razor:    Over the past decade, I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different electric shavers. The best ones require little effort to use and can give you a fairly close shave with just a light touch. On the other hand, some don&#x27;t give you a close shave even if you press them so hard against your skin that you give yourself burns.    I&#x27;m pleased to say that after using this razor for the past few weeks, it scores as one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried. Each of the blades are close enough to the surface in the UltraTrack head covers that they do a nice job cutting facial hair. The fact that each blade is suspended independently (the GyroFlex system) makes it easier to shave specific places without having to press too hard, and the thinness of the head helps prevent having to hold the razor in an awkward position.    Secondary qualities of the shaver also rank highly. It charges quickly and keeps the charge for a good while. It is easy to hold, and it&#x27;s nice that the product comes with a case, holder and device to be used for cleaning and charging at the same time. The only downside of this razor seems to be the price, which is fairly steep compared to many of the highly rated razors without the flexible heads (including many of Norelco&#x27;s other products).    I definitely recommend this product. However, you&#x27;ll need to think twice before deciding if the incremental improvement of the GyroFlex system and UltraTrack heads are worth spending more than twice what a more traditional electric razor will cost.</li>
    <li> When I saw the price, I couldn&#x27;t believe that a shaver could cost that much... but when I received the shaver, I realized that it was not like the electric shavers I ever used. I started shaving with a Schick electric back in 1952. I used it daily for a number of years except when I was in the field and had to use a single edge razor... they didn&#x27;t have rechargeables back then! Well, as time went on and I was working long hours, I would put my electric razor in my brief case to take to work with me. One shave didn&#x27;t last all day! Whenever I had a late appointment or meeting, I&#x27;d shave a second time. Well, things have sure changed! This surely is a shaving system. Once I got used to the recharging and cleaning station, I tried the shaver on my face... I didn&#x27;t feel anything! I thought, here we go again... another shaver like the ones I bought a few years ago from the mail order catalog with a famous name... pure junk! Wait! I felt my skin and the beard was gone... I didn&#x27;t even feel the shaver doing it&#x27;s job! Wow! I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it shaved and with hardly any effort. It shaved closer than a blade. The design of the shaver and accessories might not be for you, so I suggest you take a look at one of these in person to be sure it&#x27;s something you will like. I&#x27;m an old-timer and sometimes have a hard time adjusting to anything that doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;conventional\\&quot;. It surely isn&#x27;t anything like the old Schick or Remington shavers I used years ago. One thing I&#x27;m sure of is that once you try it, you&#x27;ll surely like it!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR A GIFT FOR MY FATHER , HE SEEMS VERY HAPPY WITH IT . REGARDS GH</li>
    <li> Good. Not scratch me  compared with 790cc.</li>
    <li> have owned braun in the past,and was ready for a new shaver,after watching the video of the norelco,i made my purchase,I&#x27;m glad i went with the norelco,i love it!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, very quiet, very comfortable all over face, effective trimmer.  And almost silent.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Does a good job shaving and battery last a long time.</li>
    <li> I choose the Senso Touch as an upgrade for my Philips Speed XL.  I am always looking for the closes electric shave possible and the 1250X does just that.  The Jet Clean System, is a perfect addition to keeping my razor clean, sharp and ready to go.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this razor.  I&#x27;ve bought him some really cool birthday gifts, stuff he wanted, and never really got much of a reaction.  I got him a razor, and he just raves about it.  He shaves all the time now, because it&#x27;s so fast and easy, and he hasn&#x27;t complained about any skin sensitivities yet.  He did say the first day his skin felt a bit sore, as other users reported, but after that, it was smooth sailing.  It was a big investment, but I&#x27;m kicking myself for not getting it for him sooner.</li>
    <li> Since I don&#x27;t shave my face--my review here is based on my son&#x27;s feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first and only electric shaver he has used--and he loves it! Since he hasn&#x27;t used any other electric shaver I am unable to say how it compares to other models.  However, I can say that he found it easy to use and it does a great job of shaving his young beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious on whether this could be used on legs . . . but since it likes it so well I decided not to try it.</li>
    <li> The absolute best razor I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a few weeks now.  Gives best shave ever from this type.    Pros:  Fabulous shave.  Easy to recharge.  Not harsh on skin.  Lightweight.  Great design.  The daily cleaning and flip-up heads let you really clean this.    Cons: Must clean with hot water every day.  High maintenance.    In addition to the hot-water-from-the-sink, I have added one more step.  I have very hard water, so I then rinse the shaver with distilled water to avoid any stains/buildup.    I find the Jet Clean gets even more stuff out.  Right now, I&#x27;m using the Jet Clean weekly.  I get an even better shave after using the Jet Clean, so I might do that twice a week or even every other day.    Summary:  Great shaver that requires daily maintenance.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Bought the razor for my father who has used Norelco&#x27;s for several years.  Loves this razor.  He said it shaves closer than any other Norelco he has ever owned.  Closest shave to a razor blade.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The shaver is as good is it claims to be.   The 3d system is important in order to get to different angles of the face.</li>
    <li> More than what I expected, best shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time, worth the price, major competitor (who claims they always have low prices) had same item with out Jet Clean System at same price, I always check Amazon prices before I make before I buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor.  Completely satisfied</li>
    <li> I am a cancer patient and have a problem shaving but these let me cleab up with little fuss.</li>
    <li> Great razor and the self cleaning function is really helpful.  Also all 3 blades fold out individually so you can dump the larger bits before putting it in the stand to clean.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for decades (better for my skin) and typically view them as a necessary evil--don&#x27;t get too close a shave but, hopefully, does not irritate my skin. I find cleaning electrics to be a large pain, so end up not doing it as frequently as I should, meaning that the razor loses its effectiveness quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Philips Norelco 1250X: I absolutely love it! It shaves quickly and gives me quite a close shave, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean, using the supplied cleaning vessel or rinsing it under the faucet. I never thought I could love an electric razor, but I stand corrected. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this. Not even a year after buying it, the replacement blades went up in price. They went from around $30-50 to $120-150.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s almost as much as a new one. What a joke. The trimmer attachment quit working within 6 months. The razor itself provided a close shave, after a fresh blade install, for about a month. Then it would start cutting and making my face or head irritated 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS CRAP!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Quit, effective, very light, and excellent smooth shave. I use with the Williams Lectric Shave pre-shave. What an amazing feeling. No need for shaving cream and still get the razor blade and shaving cream feeling. Just apply and Lectric Shave, shave, and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor speaks quality. I had the Norelco SpeedXL for over 10 years and it still working. I purchased its a newer technology and just because my older shaver is getting too old looking. If you have the budget to add the Jet Cleaning System I certainly recommend it. It works like a charm. After I shave, I open the heads, rinse with water, close, then insert in the Jet Cleaner this process helps keep the solution clean so I would last much longer than recommended. May be twice as much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got this razor for my husband for a Christmas gift and he LOVES it.  Works much better than his old Panasonic razor.  He has a very heavy beard.  He spend less time and gets a much better shave than before.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Consumer reports says this is the best electric shaver but I tend to disagree. It&#x27;s good- provides a nice shave initially, but I believe you can do better with a blade. I find it is much more effective if used with shaving cream- not on a dry beard.</li>
    <li> Still has issues with razor burn when used with shaving gel.  Would not have purchased, but was a great deal.</li>
    <li> Why, Norelco? Why would you have a system that requires a $20 bottle of solution every month for a razor that, as it turns out, you can clean under tap water?  Is it because you secretly hate us?  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the razor is fantastic, works in near any condition, travels well, and holds an incredibly long charge. But the cleaning thing here is nothing but a money sink.</li>
    <li> This top of the line razor performed as indicated in the advertisement.  I recommend it. Easy to use and easy to clean</li>
    <li> I have been on a quest lately to find an electric shaver that can do reasonably well with shaving as compared to a standard shave using shaving cream with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blunt Summary:&lt;br /&gt;This thing shredded the heck out of my skin and will be returned immediately.  Read on for more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Background:&lt;br /&gt;When I was younger, I used a older style Norelco electric razor and it was OK for me, until I graduated high school and entered ROTC.  My cadet trainer took one look and my face and said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re using an electric razor, aren&#x27;t you??!\\&quot;  \\&quot;Yes, Cadet Lieutenant!\\&quot;  \\&quot;I thought so.  From now on, you&#x27;ll either shave three times a day with your electric or once a day with a REAL blade.  You&#x27;re starting to look like a freakin&#x27; hobo!\\&quot;.  \\&quot;Yes, sir!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since that time I have steadfastly used a real blade and shaving cream.  Unfortunately, I have also been \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with very youthful looking and sensitive skin as well as a minor case of keratosis pilaris (which basically means that in a few spots, such as under my neck, my skin has a few tiny bumps).  As such, once I left my military association, I switched to shaving only once every three days.  Any more than that, and my skin will not be happy.  In fact, even with infrequent shavings, a normal blade and razor will still cause irritation and formation of a few pimples on my neck after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I got fed up with having to shave immediately after showering and with the pimples that invariably form on my neck.  Thus the recent quest for an alternative began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Norelco today and attempted to use it.  I charged it for one hour prior to use.  During the first few minutes of use, I was very impressed with the low noise level of the razor and with how smooth it glided over my skin.  I noticed that it was missing a few areas, so I went over them a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had finished I noticed my skin starting to smart and I noticed about 6 cuts on the skin where either the blades or the grill mesh had cut my face:  not a great sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then opened the unit to clean it and noticed some hair in the unit, which was good.  BUT I also noticed a lot of skin in the unit also.  Evidently, the razor had not just cut off the beard, but it had cut of a lot of skin as well; which explains the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my perspective, a razor should cut the hair only, and not also give you a free exfoliation as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone other than myself, without the very sensitive skin, this razor might do the trick.  But for me (and my rating), this razor is unacceptable in terms of the irritation and damage that it caused to my skin.  I will be returning it to Best Buy tomorrow.or the grill mesh had cut my face:  not a great sign.    I then opened the unit to clean it and noticed some hair in the unit, which was good.

    <li> This is my first electric, having only ever used razors, and I have to say this thing gets about as close as you would need for work or special events like a wedding or something. I always used to nick myself with razors, but no more with this fine piece of engineering! I have very sensitive skin and I always break out a little with irritation when I would shave with the razor, but even the irritation has subsided. I just use a little water to dampen the face beforehand, and it&#x27;s more like a massage than a shave! I have had no problems whatsoever in the last few days since it arrived. Forget a solo homerun, Phillips hit a walk-off grandslam with this thing! Highly recommend this shaver to anyone with sensitive skin that is tired of getting burned by those razors!</li>
    <li> Am a super senior and never thought I could ever attain such a clean shave without a blade razor. Well it took just about eight week before I got to the comfort level of using the electric shaver and get a clean, comfortable and nick free shave. The comfort really kicked in when I tried the suggestion of wet shaving with a little gel. Over the years I have purchased two units, a Sunbeam in the &#x27;50&#x27;s and a Braum in the late &#x27;90&#x27;s. Gave up on both and returned to gel and a razor. I now look forward to the easy daily clean shave. I purchased the unit early January and began using it within a week after aquiring it. It is easy to clean. Just open the heads and rinse with hot water after every shave. Charge it about every ten days and use the jet clean system every third charge. It is a keeper.</li>
    <li> like product says, you have to give your face time to adjust to new razor.  shaves closer than my old braun 7000 series.  also, shaves and cleans quieter than braun 7000.  there&#x27;s no need to use jet clean every other day, you can rinse off razor heads w/ warm water. i only use jet clean system when its time to charge razor. once cleaning is done, it starts charging razor.  people have wrote that the clean system is big but it&#x27;s really not much bigger than braun cleaning unit.  i also use j.c. system to store razor when I&#x27;m done shaving. and because of 3 shaving heads, time shaving is shorter! i enjoy unit and hope this helps make your decision a bit easier.    thks!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 2 weeks now. It is a great shaver! From its stylish and ergonomic design to the ease of cleaning - best shaver I had so far. Having sensitive skin I always have trouble with shavers damaging my skin (sometimes to the point of bleeding), this one cuts clean and fast and being waterproof is a huge plus. My facial hair also grows back much smoother and uniformly as opposed to a blade, so even if I want to get a little bear action going it will look very even, and will be quite soft!   Overall - best purchase this holiday season.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 model. For the last 5 years i have been using rotary shavers except last 2 months just before i got my new shaver, i used normal Gillette razors (it was my first time to use manual shavers). My beard is relatively thick.  And i have to say nothing gives a good close shave and this sense of freshness without any redness or itchiness like manual razors. However, its only problem is when the hair is little bit long then it&#x27;s not a very good experience since the blades keep pulling the hair.  This is when an electrical shaver for me turns useful. But anyway i should talk about the shaver itself,   well it is good though cannot be compared to manual razor specifically for removing the hair at the neck area. And i honestly can&#x27;t see any big difference between this model and the previous Philips model i use to have , i thought the flexible heads will make a huge difference but well it is good but not as i expected at all. It still made my skin irritate (which i didnt experience with manual razors , yeah i know it&#x27;s strange)and i can test that just after putting my after shave (you know what i mean)but this could be because my skin hasnt adjusted yet since it was my 3rd time to use the shaver.  I didnt like that i have to charge the shaver in the stand with no means the directly plug the shaver itself to electricity, this will be annoying while travelling.  However, i have to say that the ability to use it to shave under shower is its main advantage. The shaving just go very and incredibly smooth even when my beard hair was long and this is just awesome . I love also the cleaning set since i am lazy in cleaning the shaver and from my past experience hot water was not enough to properly clean ( i think some bacteria remains).  And finally, i dont regret buying it but all i am saying that i wasnt really impressed or maybe my expectations were very high. I was only impressed by the smooth shaving i got when using it under shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Dry Electric shaver user since 20 years , I spent the first year trying out several brands until I landed on Philips , The SensoToush 3d is my 3rd shaver ,Accordingly ,I&#x27;ve been using philips products since 15 years now , The SensoTouch 3d delivers a shave that equals in smoothness the one you get from Gillette 3 blades after leaving your beard for 3 days in less than a minute .&lt;br /&gt;If there was 6 stars ,I would&#x27;ve give it so , Low noise , you won&#x27;t even feel that the shaver sliding on your skin , the jet clean system also is doing a great job .&lt;br /&gt;Philips shavers are like the iPhones , Once you use it , you can&#x27;t replace it with anything else , Nice job Philips .</li>
    <li> An eccelant shaving machin. a bit delicate, good and smooth shaving. the rinsing machin that attached cleans the head to shining. a spare head is too expensive.</li>
    <li> Shaver stopped working after charging overnight. 6 months later tires randomly and started working again. No stopped again. There seems to be a battery problem, would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Exceptional close shave and the auto wash is a real winner!!</li>
    <li> SPEED OF LIGHT SHIPPING!</li>
    <li> Razor is okay, Bath died in about 9 months.</li>
    <li> I have owned several electric shavers in my day ...  but this unit is far the best at shaving my neck area. I have whiskers below and to both sides my Adams apple area, and this baby just skims them right off without contorting, standing on my head, or jamming it in at several different angles. The 3D pivoting heads do just what they are suppose to, and shaving is now a breeze ... as it should be.</li>
    <li> Works great for the facial hair; in fact I think it does a better job than the Fusion blades (which cost $40 for 14 and they don&#x27;t last very long). This razor is very quiet and comfortable to use. It takes about the same time to shave as the Fusion blades without the cuts and bumps.I also use my shaving cream with this razor and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this to shaving head is not so great. I wish it would get the close shave as I got with shaving my face but no luck. This unit just wasn&#x27;t cut out for it. If it did, I would definitely give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Provides a very smooth, quiet shave.  The jet clean system is an outstanding feature.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband has a really hard time shaving, but this one finally did the trick. No more ouchies. No more bloody patches.</li>
    <li> Great shave for the 1st 90 days, then kaput.  Dead, dead, dead.  Luckily I only paid $110, but still, that&#x27;s over a buck a day.  This is not the only crummy Philips Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and at this point, I&#x27;m done with the brand.  I tried a cheap shaver from this company, the idea being a short lived shaver, but cheap, is okay.  Well, the cheapie still works, but the shave is terrible.  It&#x27;s the \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; for the one that just died, better than nothing, but not by much.  Stay away from this shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. His old electric razor wasn&#x27;t shaving closely any more. Plus, it took him sooooo long to use it every morning. This one is great. He breezes through his morning routine and gets a really nice shave that keeps him looking neat all day.</li>
    <li> This razor is everything it is advertised as.  It is incredibly quiet, and after a short adjustment period, it shaves super close.  I have a very very thick beard and I get an excellent shave.  The hair on my neck was never able to be shaved successfully with an electric til now, although it takes much more time on the neck than the rest of the face.  (only reason it did not get 5 stars)</li>
    <li> I like the shaver... design, quality, durability, and price... the most important is the chance to use it with wet skin...</li>
    <li> This is a great product and awesome on my neck where my skin is very sensitive.  The jet cleaner is a great option as well and I like it, but is not needed to clean your shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!  Great shave and easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> I have tried both this shaver and the Braun Series 7-790 shaver and there is no comparison that the Braun is a higher quality product.  The Philips was difficult to shave and keep straight sideburns due to the circular design.  Also, the overall quality of the shave was better with the Braun.  One downside of the Braun is that it is designed not to be used with shaving cream/gel while the Phillips can be used with both.  A huge advantage of the Braun is the cleaning system.  With the Phillips you have to replace the cleaning solution every two weeks, while with the Braun you replace a cartridge every 3 months.  The cleaning solution with the Braun is also a higher quality in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver away after several tries. It didn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my Panasonic which I ordered subsiquently.....</li>
    <li> Great product! First time I&#x27;m using an electric shaver, but this one does the job very well. Takes a few days to get used to it (I have used a blade all my life), but it&#x27;s much better afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this two years ago for my husband and its still going strong.  He had an old Philips razor that was seeing the end of its years (it had been nearly 15 years).  I think spending the extra for the cleaning system is worth it as well.  He cleans it about once a week or so and has yet to replace the blades.  It still gives him a clean shave two years later.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this razor.</li>
    <li> Ace razor, smooth and fast. Really don&#x27;t need the jet clean. What dose it do that normal cleaning dose not? Save the money and get the basic package.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a birthday gift for my hubby.  He absolutley loves it!  it is super quiet when he&#x27;s shaving, and shaves just as close as a blade.  It also stayed charged for 2 months before he had to put it back on the charger.  Great razor!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the speed of delivery and quality of the goods</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace my Braun foil shaver that was absolutely horrible and never got a complete shave with. I read the specs on this razor and decided to give it a try with Philips norelco&#x27;s 45 day money back guarentee in mind if I didn&#x27;t like it. I was actually shocked after using this razor the first time seeing how close it actually got with almost no stray hairs afterwards.. however I only use this electric razor in the wet shaving format... I have never tried it dry yet and have no intention to do so. But if you like to wet shave, then this is your razor.. yea its pricey but well worth It after you try it. When shaving with cream you just have to rinse the head often and shave in a circular motion which they suggest. After im done I always rinse the shave head inside and out for about 30 seconds with hot water to remove any excess shaving cream and then place it in the jet clean to finish. Wet shaving with this razor isn&#x27;t the quickest at about 6 min for everything. However I just like to make sure the razor is clean afterwards so that&#x27;s prob the extra time. Yea a manual blade razor is a lil quicker but I find more irratation with it over this electric one. This is all coming from someone with very sensitive skin who gets razorburn and breakouts from shaving with a blade. I find this razor very comfortable and with its two year warntee it is sure to last if you take care of it... I will update this later if I find any problems...</li>
    <li> When i bought it i dont know what happen but later when i tested simply i love it.  The best electric shaver that i had, its really amazing how do your work  if you dont sure about buy this shaver, dont have afraid....you will not regret</li>
    <li> I am skeptic at first of technology and the price. But after using the product, its awesome and worth every penny. Enough said.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but with the cost why not save $150 and get a shaver that also works fine. This shaver is nothing special.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a shaver in over 5 years &amp; w/this recommended by my bro, I was sure to give it a try. Although a bit pricey compared to most shavers, it was totally worth expense. Best shave &amp; shaver I have ever had. It&#x27;s got a soft razor touch and the trimmer is similar to a modern haircut clipper. The Jet Clean System is easy to use, comes w/one bottle of liquid solution good for 30 washes. Dispense about 1/2 of bottle into tray and use 15 times/washes &amp; then empty out/resupply w/other 1/2 left in bottle. I made the mistake of throwing away solution after only one wash. One bottle of cleaning solution will last one month if you use shaver once per day.</li>
    <li> I purchased the model without the cleaning system (same specs as this model) last spring. I have also been using the top of the line Panasonic and the top of the line Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise:&lt;br /&gt;No comparison. The Norelco is extremely quiet. The buzzing from the other two models is very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed:&lt;br /&gt;I find the Norelco faster than the other two. Having three circular heads seems get the hairs at different angles at the same time. The other, linear heads require me to rotate the whole shaver to get a different shave angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;As I said, i did not purchase the cleaning system. The Norelco washes up quickly and quietly without disassembly under running hot water. The other two require head removal for hot water cleaning. This makes it easy to travel with, since I don&#x27;t find the head cleaning system a necessity (but it is a luxury).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good; though not as good as my 10 year old Norelco. Somewhat better than the Braun or Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness:&lt;br /&gt;I find all three about the same. Don&#x27;t press the heads down on your skin; just a slight pressure and the long hairs will be taken, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like a good deal to me.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this razor. At first i was hesitant to buy it, not knowing if it would work as well with African American skin and facial hair, but he was very happy with the results. He says it doesn&#x27;t ittitate his skin and gives him the smoothest shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> I love this electric shaver, after going through hundreds of products, this is by far the best electric shaver on the market. A close shave, easy self cleaning system, and in years to come when the razor wears out, just replace for $30 and you are back to a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Had to return this.  Unfortunately, it hurt my skin and it functioned too slow.  Also, the cleaning system is way too clunky and space consuming.</li>
    <li> These types of items are just commodities...the same at Best Buy as on here.  That is why places like Best Buy are getting killed.  People check out the products at their locations, and then buy on-line.  That is what you are considering here.  I bought this top-of-the-line Norelco shaver for my son.  Hey, it ought to be a nice shaver for the money...and it was.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Husband for Christmas. Both him (and I!!) love it. Only thing I wish, was that the stand was smaller. We have a small vanity and it utilizes a good deal of or space.</li>
    <li> I have been against electric razors for years because they just did not shave me at all.  Well this one is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave I went dry, close shave but ouch..  Then for the next shave I used shaving cream, WOW this thing worked amazing. I am sold and got one for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is I do not have any ingrown hairs since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I recommend this and spend the extra few dollars and get the jet clean it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;shaves quick, cleans real easy, i like the jet clean gadget - probably because i like gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;comfortable in hand, even if you have big hands.&lt;br /&gt;for me it works equally well dry/wet/in-the-shower shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;does not charge with cable - you must use the supplied cradle or jet clean. not an issue if like me you don&#x27;t intend to travel much.&lt;br /&gt;the built-in trimmer is a sorry little thing. regular sized non fancy shavers have much better trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;replacement blades are way expensive.</li>
    <li> .I have not used my Gilette blade since ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the the the the the the the the the the the</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver in my 60 years of shaving with one. It is fast and gives a perfect close shave every time. the most amazing aspect is how quiet it is. Unlike all my other shavers you hardly hear this one running. My only complaint is that the head needs renewing about once a year and they expensive.</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with.</li>
    <li> my stepdad has been using this razor for over  a year and it still gives him a close shave like the first day he used it.  Well worth the price and recommend to anyone who has had trouble finding the right electric razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best replacement for the senstouch 2D. Mine was already 1 and half year old and needed a head replacement. A friend recommended me this and after reading all reviews, and considering my experience with the 2D I decided to pay the price and get a gift for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier. This one is way better. Smoother feeling, a lot quieter and what it took several minutes with the 2D it takes only a fraction of time now to leave my face with a perfect shaving. Of course the age of the old head could have an impact, but I don&#x27;t remember getting to this level even with the 2D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 starts recommendation as a 2D replacement or as new electric razon.</li>
    <li> A really smooth shave and the docking station is pretty cool too.  I suppose the only drawback would be the cost.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great.  If your looking for the best electric shave you can get buy it.  I use the shaver to shave my face and head on a daily basis and it does the job well without leaving any irritation.  Since I have sensitive skin and my old Braun Pulsonic keep causing skin burns to the point where I could only shave 1 or 2 times a week I needed a change.  The other 2 great things about this shave is the fact you can use it wet or dry.  So like I mentioned above about irritation I use this along with shaving creame and it does not effect the operation of the razor what so ever.  The other thing I like about this is the Jet Clean, I&#x27;m lazy, work alot, so the last thing I want to do is clean a razor, so this does the trick.  When your done shaving simply drop it in the cleaner and press the button and you got a sparkling new shaver.  The one thing I do have to mention as a slightly negative thing on this product since I have used Brauns in the past in my opinion their shaver cleaner is far superior to this one since it uses cartridges versus pouring solution in a cup for this shaver.  The reason I say I like the Braun for that is when its empty you take it out and it has all the junk inside it and then in the trash it goes.  With this one the junk stays in the cup so you have to clean the cup.  When you clean the cup since it has the cut hairs inside it when they go down the drain it tends to clog the drain up so either dump it outside or get some drano.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! It works great. He has always been a shaving cream and razor guy and he kept saying he wanted to try using an electric razor so I got this for him. He has hair that is very thick and grows very fast. He tried other razors before and they made him break out. So far, this one has been very gentle on his skin but still gives a nice and close shave. And the way it opens up to be cleaned makes it look like a transformer. Plus, the cleaning solution and stand for it that self cleans is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good product and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an older Norelco razor. These things work pretty well! I like that it came with a cleaning system as that makes periodic cleaning much more simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a disposable-head razor, this one does not shave as close (nor will any electric razor). The tradeoff is time saved, the ability to wet OR dry shave, and the fact that razor heads don&#x27;t need replacing for about a year. The razor head replacements are fairly expensive (~$50) but compared to needing ~12 ~$5.00 head replacements, the cost is about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> I went from an older Phllipis to a Braun which I thought was quite good. But when the Braun expired much too early, I went with this razor. While not a blade, best electric I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Big and heavy box. I bought it for my friend, my friend said it&#x27;s good. But it really much heavier than 1250/40.</li>
    <li> I like this razor. It is very quiet. Does very nice job. I like cleaning kit. I will strongly recommend this razor. It can be used in shower or dry.</li>
    <li> love the shaver. however was bummed that it did not come with the cleaning system. got a partial refund. but still a bit annoyed.</li>
    <li> It was shipped fairly fast. The packaging was huge though. But at least it was well protected. It was a present for my dad and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;It took some time to figure out how it works as the dock is slightly different, I tried to tilt it, bend it, but all I had to do was it switch it on. Duh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Boughted for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It stay charge for a  long time and it gives him a pretty close shave.</li>
    <li> Ok I used for a week now with zero irritation as it seems most have gone through. I have a thick beard and use at least once a day. I shave my face and my head (wet and dry), so we will see how long the cutters last. I will update my review at the 6 month mark and see if I&#x27;m still diggin it. Until then I&#x27;m diggin it.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because of the cost..... $190 should be around $120. Plus heads are $60+ a set 1-2 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 23Feb2012&lt;br /&gt;Used 1 month 1 week,&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work ok on my head, I just have to keep going over spots to get all the hairs (10 mins or so).&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it on my face...... not happy. It barley gets all the hairs on my cheek, but the hairs on my neck..... let&#x27;s just say I might as well be shaving with tweezers and broken glass. For a $200 razor it shaves like a dollar store special. I&#x27;ve used it wet, dry, shaving cream, electric shave oils, tonics (that smell horrible). I think I will be contacting Amazon and/or Norelco for a refund. This shaver would be ok for someone with a soft beard (reads high school pre-pub peach fuzz), but not a man with a real beard. I guess I&#x27;ll stick with Gillette&#x27;s over priced razors until I&#x27;m man enough to try a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;Still giving it 3 stars only because it started out great and still allows me to shave my head on the go when i don&#x27;t have time in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 17Mar2012&lt;br /&gt;Well the allowed time to return was 28feb........ So I&#x27;m stuck with an overpriced electric weed wacker. Maybe I can see if my 16 yr old nephew wants it to shave his peach fuzz. Now it&#x27;s down to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this electric shaver (Norelco 1250xcc/42) for about two weeks now, so far I love it! I did quite a bit of research before buying this because it isn&#x27;t cheap. My wife wasn&#x27;t too happy bout me spending almost two hundred bucks on a razor when she says \\&quot;why don&#x27;t you just use a blade and gel like you&#x27;ve been doing?\\&quot; Women huh, they just don&#x27;t get it! Well if she had to shave a tough beard all the time she might get it. First off I have been using the same ancient Norelco triple head off and on for the last 16 years. it hurt my face to use, I don&#x27;t mean a little I mean screaming burning pain! I hated it, so would use a blade mostly. But what a pain in the face that is to do all the time. So I started looking and finally decided to give the new Norelco a shot.  First impressions after opening the box was how sleek and modern it looks, I like the colors and design overall. The razor sitting in the charging station looks sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room even with the cleaning station sitting next to it. I like how the heads open and how the whole head comes off to clean it, and the trimmer pops out the back part and works well. After charging it for two hours it was ready to test. I had not shaved yet so had a decent growth. I decided to try it dry and see how it performed.   Dry Shaving:   It feels nice and light in the hand, unlike my last Norelco. Turning it on it purrs softly, so quiet, my old razor sounded like a jet taking off on my face. Shaving with it dry was not too bad and since I do use a triple head a few times a month my face took right too it. Luckily my face is pretty smooth with no sharp angles or deep crags or bumps. Still my chin had always been an issue with my old shaver. (Little tip, always  wash your face with hot water and soap then dry it off if dry shaving)  Even dry the 1250 took off almost everything pretty smooth in a couple of passes using a light circular motion. Don&#x27;t press to hard let the razor do the work. Pull the face tight up at an angle to really get close, you will know when your done by the sound and the feel of the razor on your face.   Dry shaving came out pretty good, smooth and didn&#x27;t burn, it&#x27;s all about technique and knowing your face. My wife and daughter were impressed.  Wet Shaving:   But it was a couple of days later when wet shaving with a little shave gel that this thing really shines!! It felt so smooth and comfortable and so fast to shave with wet.  Just running the head under the faucet for a few seconds cleaned them fine to finish wet shaving. The feel and results were amazing!! So was the speed, it was way faster than shaving with a razor and shaving cream because I didn&#x27;t have to go over parts eight times like using a blade if I want a close smooth shave.  Cleaning the razor out was easy and fast, just leave the heads open sitting in the cradle which looks cool, my son said it looks like a sci-fi device. I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning station yet, but I like the fact that it uses the bottles of solution instead of the cartridges others use, way cheaper.  The big test was the wife test of course. After wet shaving she said my face felt as smooth as a babies bottom, so did my 15 year old daughter. So at least she has stopped complaining about how much it cost especially after she found out some versions are twice as much.   Anyway, my son was so impressed he ordered one from Amazon last week. Maybe I should get a cut!  The biggest most impressive thing about it though was the next morning after wet shaving, my face was still pretty smooth. Normally by morning my stubble would be so rough and thick, but, my face felt great. The next day wet shaving with it felt even better and smoother. If you use a gel just wash your face good with hot water, leave it wet put a very light coat of gel and shave away. It works great and your face will thank you, so will your wife.  GREAT SHAVER NORELCO!! A GREAT DEAL FROM AMAZON!! Oh yeah I also got delivery faster than I expected too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both Braun and Norelco brands of razers over the years.  My last razor was a Braun.  I decided to give Norelco a try again after reading reviews about this razor.  It&#x27;s a decent unit.  It does the job i need it to with little fuss.  I do like the jet clean system better then the braun cleaning system.</li>
    <li> The shave is close and I had little to no irritation. It was much more comfortable than the disposable safety razors I&#x27;d been using. The 1250xcc is very quiet and easily cleaned by pulling up the 3 heads and rinsing under hot water. The included Jet Clean System is fun to watch and does a great job but the hot water rinse probably works just as well. The shaver does a very good job containing the shaved whiskers. Very few end up in my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual states multiple times to not leave the shaver in the charger or Jet Clean after charging is done. It doesn&#x27;t say why but judging by how many times they mention it I&#x27;m not about to try it. My guess is that it might shorten the life of the battery which would also shorten the life of the shaver since you cannot replace the battery. This is a minor annoyance. If you have trouble remembering to unplug it you might want to consider a timer: [[ASIN:B003P2UMS0 Belkin Conserve Socket F7C009q Energy-Saving Outlet]]. While they mention you can use the Jet Clean daily it hardly seems necessary and since it&#x27;s also a charger it might not be the best thing for the battery. I plan to use the Cleaner as the only charger and just let it clean the shaver when the battery needs recharged. A daily rince under hot water is enough to keep the shaver clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to consider is the expense of the cleaning solution and the replacement heads. I&#x27;m not so sure how necessary the cleaning solution is. I may decide that the Jet Clean System isn&#x27;t even necessary. The cleaner takes 1/2 a bottle of solution and you&#x27;re warned to replace what&#x27;s in the cleaner every 2 weeks. So even if you don&#x27;t use the cleaner much once you pour it in, the clock is ticking. The replacement head is designed to last about a year. You can&#x27;t just replace the blades, you have to replace the entire head so be sure to price those before you buy this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re okay with the expense of the cleaner and replacement heads and don&#x27;t mind unplugging it after it&#x27;s charged then this is a fine shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses: Well made, quiet, close shave, very easy to clean (even without using the Jet Clean System), nice design&lt;br /&gt;Minuses: must be unplugged after charge cycle, expensive replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Over a year later and this shaver is still great. The head has already lasted longer than the 1 year stated lifespan but may need to be replaced in a few months. A simple rinse under the faucet and a daily use of the jet clean system is all I&#x27;ve needed to keep my shaver clean. Once I performed the thorough cleaning procedure described in the manual but it was completely unnecessary. There were no traces of stubble in the shaver head. The battery performance has not noticeably changed since the unit was new. After daily use I&#x27;ve had no problems with this shaver. If it were somehow lost I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.mind unplugging it after it&#x27;s charged then this is a fine shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses: Well made, quiet, close shave, very easy to clean (even without using the Jet Clean System), nice design&lt;br /&gt;Minuses: must be unplugged after charge cycle, expensive replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Over a year later and this shaver is still great.

    <li> I have used a Braun 7500 series electric shaver for 10 years and I thought this was a great product. It would not hold a charge and I needed to replace it and was going to buy the newest Braun. I have to say that the Braun foil did leave my skin a little irritated but it was not that bad. I was hesitant to go with the Phillips but I liked the idea of being able to use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I charged the unit up and the next morning was the test. I turned it on and it was so quiet and meek that my heart sank as I was thinking this was not going to do the job. Boy was I wrong! One pass and my face was as smooth as a full barber shop hot towel shave. I had no skin irritation and it gave me the best shave I have ever had from a razor.</li>
    <li> I have always used products from Phillips Norelco. Their product I can find top of the line and that is why I have used them all my life</li>
    <li> No razor burn ladies!</li>
    <li> I have a little baby girl, and every time her father kissed her, her face was a little red because of his beard and her sensitive skin. He tried several shavers but same result.&lt;br /&gt;Since he got the Philips Norelco the results were visible, his skin feels soft and there are not red marks on my baby girl&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easy to clean and manipulate. I recommend it over other brands. This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Once again Norelco does it, I have loved this product after my face got use to the new process.  I stopped using regular razors and have been using electric razors and this one is a great one.</li>
    <li> this thing is the biggest piece of shit ever.. very disappointed.. the braun i had before was 10 times better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it takes me now twice as long to shave as before. the trimmer is super small so if you grow a bit of facial hair, it will take you forever..&lt;br /&gt;the blades are garbage..&lt;br /&gt;i would NOT recommend this one at all</li>
    <li> The most comfortable razor I have used in more than 40 years of shaving. This razor feels so comfortable it is like wearing a very comfortable slipper, ohhhhhh…..! Unlike most razors that leave your skin a bit irritated after shaving this razor DOES NOT.</li>
    <li> I went from an old foil shaver that started ripping my whiskers out by their roots.  After researching on-line I discovered that these rotary head shavers work better for someone who doesn&#x27;t shave that often.  I started shaving less as it wasn&#x27;t required by my job anymore, so the foil shaver started feeling uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t get as close a shave with this than the foil unless I use shaving cream which makes for a great shave.  I typically shave my neck and cheeks every other day or so and leave everything else.  Once a month I shave everything, typically with shaving cream after knocking down all the long stuff with a trimmer.  I don&#x27;t use the built in trimmer because I don&#x27;t like it.  That is my only complaint.  The built in trimmer is in a bad location and you can&#x27;t see what your trimming, at least I can&#x27;t.  If the trimmer extended out more where you could see over the top of the rotary head it may be better.  The cleaning solution lasts a LOT longer than the Braun I was using before.</li>
    <li> It works good, I use it for my entire bald head and so far so good. it cleans and lubricates the blades....MOST IMPORTANT PART! I have only have it a month but it&#x27;s worth it. When it comes time to change blades....it&#x27;s worth it, change solution? WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> GREAT RAZOR  LIKE HOW IT CLEANS AND CHARGES AT THE SAME TIME. GREAT SHAVE.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
    <li> I have it for around a month and everything works things fine so far. But one thing I don&#x27;t like in this machine . It&#x27;s not work well in nick area</li>
    <li> First razor that I can use with my sensitive face. Works great and I suggest this razor to anyone. Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shaver.  The auto-clean is great.  I get a great shave!!  Sometimes I will still use some cloverine salve or even skin antiseptic(cures redness) but a lot less razor burn with this shaver.  Technically should replace the heads once a year, little pricey but great shave all that matters.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing piece of technology....I can&#x27;t believe how easily it shaves...there were some parts of my face where I used to get cuts almost all the time with Gillette...but this one just smoothly glides over....my shaving time has reduced to 5 minutes with this.... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying the jet though... it is not useful....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;giving 4 stars simply because some parts of my neck are left untouched. I have to manually use a razor once in a while to shave that...also the blade for side cuts is not that effective...</li>
    <li> Este producto es exacta a la descripción me permite usarlo al seco o húmedo, me puedo aplicar la espuma de afeitar de mi preferencia y comenzar a rasurar sin problema y el accesorio de lavado de la maquina brinda una higiene excelente</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited when I got this! I had looked around and after reading the reviews, I finally decided that this would be the best one. The item was very well packaged. Set up was very simple. Took only a few minutes to start charging. Right After fully charging it I started using it. At first, it did not get very close and I had to keep going over and over it again. But after about a week of using it, I notice it is getting closer and closer as my face is adjusting to it. So I am giving 5 stars because it gets super close. It is super quiet! And the self cleaning machine is very nice. The liquid you use smells great and so when you use it to clean your razor, the next time you use it, your face smells great. I would not recommend using the self cleaning kit every time you shave. Use maybe once a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this every other day or so, I have noticed that it works a lot better if you use shaving cream. However after a few uses, product became a little louder like a scratchy noise. Not a big deal to drop it down a star, still a great product!</li>
    <li> Cleaning system is awesome. Razor works very well, love that it can shave wet or dry.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great razor great razor great razor great razor great razor great razor great razor great razor great razor, Now that is an 18 word rating!</li>
    <li> i love love love this  it is well worth your money i tell all of my buddy&#x27;s at my college  to get this because it is the best out there  hands down nothing can even come close to this razor</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the product. Works Great for what I wanted it for. I would recommend to someone else if I was asked.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I really recomended. My skin is safe now, All the redness is gone! The batteries take forever to end and I can travel without the charger.</li>
    <li> Great razor; however, Phillips Norelco discontinued the original replacement heads.  The newer style replacement heads seem cheaply made in comparison and do not work nearly as well as the originals.  For the price of this razor Phillips Norelco seems to be taking advantage of its customers, of which I will probably not be one for long.  The replacement heads should be at least as good as the originals and not be so expensive</li>
    <li> Excellent &amp; good price</li>
    <li> I have used various Norelco shavers for about 25 years. The 1250x/40 worked well and was easy to clean - until it stopped working after only 2 years! When the shaver did work, I think that the shave was not close enough; I was expecting it to be much closer - more like a blade and less like I shaved 12 hours ago. Anyway, when placed in the charging cradle. the shaver doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. I replaced the cradle as well as the cord to no avail - the shaver still refuses to recharge. Does anyone have any ideas regarding an easy fix? Thanks.</li>
    <li> This shaver was purchased to help with a medical condition.  It has been excellent in aiding in treating the condition.</li>
    <li> Nothing great here, shaved me Ok, but I did not like the ergonomics of this shaver and I thought it was a bit overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard and it did so so a job for me, I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Clean shave&lt;br /&gt;No irritation&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;The edge defining tool could be better in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t get as clean of a shave as I&#x27;d like it to be.</li>
    <li> Got this special gift for my hubby and he loves it. Saves us money on the disposable razors. So worth it!!</li>
    <li> Got this razor for hubby for Christmas and he loves it.  Gives good smooth shave. Would recommend to everyone.  Very nice!!</li>
    <li> The cleaning station includes a container for the fluid, and I found it best to fill it to the bottom end of the range. Changing this fluid is difficult to do without spilling some.</li>
    <li> This shaver is really great it gives me a smooth shave like I used a razor blade, I always had an electric razor but never had one that shaved really close and smooth. I can now shave every other day instead of every morning. I Love the cleaning feature and it charges has its cleaning the heads very good.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Senso Touch 3D, and loved it. It was my first successful venture into electric razors that did not pull the hairs out. I have had this razor for about 2 years. When I bough it, I bought 3 replacement blades ($50 each). The cost of the Whole system was about $300. I am out of blades, and saw they discontinued the RQ12, and replaced it with RQ12+. I bought the RQ12+, and it sucks. The old RQ12 replacement head is also now $250+. So I have a choice, to keep buying heads that cost more then  the system (currently) costs, buy the crappy RQ12+ blades, or seek another brand. I chose to go with the Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System. I&#x27;ll see how that works. Philips obviously does not respect it&#x27;s customers. I really did love this shaver. Such a bummer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 months now and it&#x27;s working nicely.  I had a previous version of the Norelco razor.  I don&#x27;t know what model it was,  but it was re-chargeable, submersible, and cost about 100 bucks.  This costs quite a bit more, but when I first used it I was amazed at how quickly I was done shaving.  This one was way more powerful than the lower cost model that I used to have.  The Jet Clean system is pretty nice to have.  I was always worried that I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my old razor as effectively.  The Jet Clean solution has a nice antiseptic smell to it,  so I get the feeling that it does a better job of disinfecting/cleaning the razor than just running it under the tap.</li>
    <li> My main reason for returning  the Philips Norelco 3-D shaver is the lack of a close shave. The shaver left stubbles and did  not give a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Shaves close and comes with a bunch of accessories. I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to switch from a straight razor. I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks so far and haven&#x27;t had an issue yet.</li>
    <li> Great buy! works perfectly and well built. I like the shape of this shaver. A lot of  accessories. The travel bag is very useful and I take it wherever I travel to. It looks really kinda sci-fi.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought it in amazon frustration free packing which is a great idea. Those plastic packing are like a dungeon. I sometimes hurt my finger opening it.&lt;br /&gt;  This is my first electronic shaver, I&#x27;ve been using those old-school manual shaver before. So I&#x27;ve told that electronic shaver doesn&#x27;t do the job clean enough, but I bought it after all.  I am satisfied by this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second 1250X Norelco. The first stops working after 1 year using it and warranty was due. The second stops working exactly the same maner. Right now, 4 months after I bought it I&#x27;m trying asking for the warranty. I&#x27;m sure this electric shaver has an electronic problem. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> For the last 20+ years I&#x27;ve had a Norelco until about 3 years ago when I decided to try a Braun.  The Braun has been great but when it started needing a new head I decided to try a new Norelco.  Long story short after a couple attempts I&#x27;m back to the Braun with a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I started with a 1150 2d, without the cleaning system.  It only took one shave to figure out that I didn&#x27;t like it.  The real deal breaker is that with the 1150 the heads only flex inward so with any pressure the heads flex in and the outer edges become sharp corners that don&#x27;t glide over your face, there is also a large space between the blade and the edge of the head so it&#x27;s impossible to shave under your nose and difficult to get close to your sideburns.  I could have lived with the 1150 not having a trimmer... ...I know it has a separate trimmer but it&#x27;s so inconvenient that it&#x27;s easier to just use a different trimmer or touch up with a Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I bought a 1250 3d with cleaning system, with the \\&quot;3d\\&quot; the heads also fex outward.  The 3d shaves great, the heads move smoothly across your face and the blades are closer to the edge so you can get under your nose.  The trimmer is built in but is narrow and does a poor job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco cleaning system... ...this deserves it&#x27;s own paragraph.  To sum up, it sucks.  I was converted to razor cleaning systems by the Braun.  The Braun system uses an alcohol based fluid that it pumps through the razor, it leaves the razor squeaky clean and smelling slightly like Trix (silly rabbit).  The Norelco uses a water based/soapy cleaner, it dunks the razor in the cleaner.  The Norelco comes out smelling like a dirty mop, it&#x27;s nauseating, the smell is not as bad if you rinse it with hot water after you clean it but it still stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is quiet, it shaves closer than the Braun and seems to hold a charge well.  The Norelco feels like it would implode like a light bulb if you dropped it, cleaner seems equally flimsy and takes up too much counter space due to the cord placement. The stand is also flimsy and not heavy enough to stand up by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is loud, it shaves great but not as close as the Norelco, the battery has held up well for 3 years and it still holds a charge like new.  The Braun feels like it would break the floor if you dropped it, the cleaner is too loud to use while other family is sleeping but works very well.  The Braun also has a good (not great) timmer built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the 1250 for a month or so I returned it, bought a new head for the Braun, and lived happily ever after... ...if the Braun died tomorrow I guess I&#x27;d have to replace it with another Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the world really needs is a rotary shaver built by Braun.</li>
    <li> I moved to the Norelco from an old Braun 360 system.  The shave is as close as the Braun.  The Norelco does a better job around difficult areas.  There is much less going back to tough areas with the Norelco.  Underthe nose is good, neck and jaw are also good.  It is much better at getting those difficult hairs that stick to your cheek.  The Braun always left a few hairs that I need to go over and over again.  This is much better than the Braun.  Cleaning is easy, you can use the cleaning system or clean it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: you cannot  use Braun cleaner on the Norelco.  The Norelco cleaner is soap based while the Braun cleaner is alcohal based.</li>
    <li> Great performance on those annoying little neck hairs. Also like the cleaning system and other features. Pricey but worth it so far.</li>
    <li> Used a blade for almost 40 years. Needed a new razor, wanted to try an electric.&lt;br /&gt;Picked this model because of the pivoting heads, and cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;Took a couple of weeks to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Best, easiest shaves I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect razor set, and definitely worth the price (especially if you have really sensitive skin like I do)!</li>
    <li> Although I purchased this item, I have not use it yet. It&lt;br /&gt;came with the set so I bought the set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always admired the design and reviews of the SensoTouch, and after some debate I decided to ditch purchasing refills, and purchase the SensoTouch. To my delight the Razor is ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!! Amazing close shave and I love the fact that you can use it in the shower, or on the go in the car. Great design and feel to the Razor. Extremely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I bought this one in part because I found its predecessor to be the best I had used. This one cuts better, runs more quietly and, when used with its power cleaner, saves time and insures that the instrument is in top form whenever I need as shave.</li>
    <li> He says it&#x27;s a very close shve with little effort and the cleaning feature is a major plus. It arrived ahead of scheduled so that&#x27;s nice as well.</li>
    <li> My partner like it very much. The Razor is light and easy to handle. The Jet Clean is a bit big. But the product is nice and my partner says very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The package is really good and box is proteceted very well. The delivery is fast.&lt;br /&gt;All good, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very good product as I expected</li>
    <li> Gives a good close shave.  The heads rotate in different directions so notthing is missed..  It is light weight and shaped for a comfortable  grasp.  The cleaning cycle is a little too long and The on and off button could be placed elswhere.  Overall, the besr shaver I  have owned.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the hubby for Christmas and he loves it.  First electric shaver and the shave is beautifully smooth!</li>
    <li> Received the item today. Item was mispackaged and the shaver does not fit in either the stand or the jet-clean system. Upon checking some Youtube videos, it seems the package has the wrong stands. Called Philips Norelco for tech support (not replacement), who completely put the blame on Amazon (even though I bought the retail packaging of the product, not the frustration free version) and suggested buying it from Philips directly the next time. Of course, it costs twice as much buying directly from them. Ended up hanging up on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon being Amazon....is shipping an overnight replacement. As for Philips, do not buy this product expecting any form of customer service from them. If the second one does not work either, it&#x27;s off to Braun 7 series for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/16/13: Sure enough, the new pkg arrived today and everything worked as expected. I put the stands next to each other and the one that arrived today is slimmer and taller than the one that arrived yesterday. No wonder the shaver would not fit. Now I can finally get around to using and reviewing the actual product.</li>
    <li> This razor has been a pleasant surprise for me.  It looks good, feels well balanced, and is very easy to clean.  The three shaving heads just unsnap and click to stay open, then you just hold each one under running water to clean.  I&#x27;m not sure I need to use the Jet Clean System.  It works fine without it.  It shaves close and fast.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. It is really great. I like this order. The product is what I want to buy.</li>
    <li> Works well for shaving my bed ridden husband.</li>
    <li> Best electric shavers ive ever used and ive tried allot. I have very sensitive skin and it definitely accommodates.</li>
    <li> I decided to ask for the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System for Christmas 3 years ago. I have used other electric shavers in the past and they just could not get the job done to the point that I was completely turned away from electric shavers. Then the new Norelco 3D came to market and I decided I would step my game up and try a quality electric shaver. Well its been three years now and I have had to buy a single thing for shaving other that some new jet clean solution in over 3 years. I cannot tell you how close of a shave you are able to get with this shaver. I am able to shave with this shaver either wet or dry and have no problems or irritation to my skin. The shaver comes with: a small charger, the Jet Clean system (Separate dock that charges and self cleans), the small plug with velcro, a little cleaning brush, instruction manuals, a little cover for the shaver&#x27;s heads and travel case, and the cleaning solution for the Jet Clean System. I have traveled with this shaver over 20 times and never have to bring the charger with me it always last the whole trip even a two week trip to Europe. It charges very fast and last over an hour I would guess per charge. I honestly will never look toward another shaver this Norelco has performed so well year over year it has not given me any reason to even consider looking at another shaver. This is a MUSThave for men!</li>
    <li> The razor is just great. I had let my beard grow as I have extremely sensitive skin and regular razors would leave me just as if I had scratched it against a cactus. I have started to shave every day with no problem and although it takes a few days to get used to this kind of habit, I am happy I decided to buy the Philips Norelco. Besides, the JetClean system is one thing less to worry about as you just place it in it after every shave and it remains as it was on day one. I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> This product allows you to get your beard  softened up in the shower and to get a good lubricating layer of shaving gel on immediately before shaving.  This provides a close shave with minimal friction.  After shaving the razor can be rinsed out and then put in the jet cleaner which cleans and lubricates it.</li>
    <li> I expect much before I try... I see their web site and CM,,, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3D ! new tech !  this kinda divice grows with technology... so I decided to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is good decision.  I have ultra sensitive skin... this seems gentle to my skin I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and without giving big pressure onto my face... it shave well.  There are many cheaper shaver ... but&lt;br /&gt;I think it worth for paying...  thanks Philips.</li>
    <li> This is the girlfriend gave me for my birthday, as a flagship model Philips family times, after get our hands have full sense of technology, shaving is very clean, can take care of every detail of the site, cleaning is very simple, clean liquid two weeks I think once is enough, the usual routine maintenance is a must</li>
    <li> Best price I could find was $169 until I found the Amazon $50 coupon. No one could beat the $119 price.I like the quietness and the close shave. I rated as a four because I have not used for the 45 day period for skin conditioning and am hoping for an even closer shave then. Have not used the jet clean system yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many razors over the years with these gimmicky cleaning systems that seemingly work great at first, but always crash and burn over time; sometimes, not even a very long time before they bite it.  We had the first Braun to feature a cleaning system when it just came out, and that thing was a dud.  Shaved ok, but the cleaning system was a joke and broke within a couple months.  We replaced it, and then that one broke too.  Then we got the Braun Pulsonic -- slightly better shave, slightly better cleaning system -- it broke after about a year.  And finally, we tried the Panasonic Arc 5.  Seemed to be the best razor by a mile, which was good considering the VERY steep price.  But then, after a couple weeks, the cleaning system started it fail; it never turned itself off and would go literally for hours on end if we didn&#x27;t babysit it.  Complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Phillips Norelco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d used their original 3 head shaver many many moons ago, then was lost to Braun and Panasonic for years, before I finally found my way back here.  I have to say, in the years since my absence form this product, they&#x27;ve really upped the anti.  This is without question, the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned!  The 3D technology is no joke -- it really does make a difference in shave quality.  Each head floats independently across my face for a near flawless shave, each and every time.  Unlike my other shavers that caused razor burn, I don&#x27;t have to press this Norelco hard to my face.  It just gently glides across my face, easily mowing down all the whiskers in its path.  Best shave ever by far.  Fast and easy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Cleaning Base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like putting your razor into a little Jacuzzi bath all its own.  The motorized mechanics precisely lower the razor into its little bath, and then get it all shiny and squeaky clean. It does a great job and looks really cool and cutting edge too.  Oh, and best of all, it&#x27;s QUIET!!!  My Braun&#x27;s always sounded like a Learjet was taking off in my bathroom!  No joke!  But this Norelco is smooth as silk; quiet, effective, and economical to operate.  Unlike Braun, that was overly expensive for their cleaning solution, this Norelco is very affordable at barely four bucks a bottle.  Better still, it&#x27;s more readily available locally than the Braun solution ever was.  And the Norelco seems to last a good while, so I won&#x27;t be spending as much and can clean my razor more often since it&#x27;s economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Helpful Tip*** - Definitely get the frustration free packaging!  The retail packaging on this one is definitely a HUGE pain in the you-know-what to get open!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line -- Hands down the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Hands down the best cleaning system ever.  And most importantly:  hands down, my best shave ever!  Amazon has the best price on this by far.  Almost 100 less than my local Target.rjet was taking off in my bathroom!  No joke!  But this Norelco is smooth as silk; quiet, effective, and economical to operate.

    <li> It&#x27;s does the job okay but...allows more whiskers to fall on clothes or counter than previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  Secondly, after one year, the shaver just stopped working.  No lights, no charge, no operation.  Philips warranty service is sending me a new one with no questions asked--so that&#x27;s nice--but expected more from a $200 electric shaver.</li>
    <li> very good!!&lt;br /&gt;I will return to buy!!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!&lt;br /&gt;I will return to buy!!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!&lt;br /&gt;I will return to buy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas - it came in on time and the price was right!  My husband loves this!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t what reviews said the Braun foil shaver I lost was much better. These weird shaped heads make it a pain to cut and the circular motion is annoying.</li>
    <li> Gift for my fiancee that he uses everyday.  He has sensitive skin, and has to shave everyday for work.  He had been using a Fusion razor with the &#x27;Art of Shaving&#x27; sandalwood skin care system, which was working great.  Prior to that he would have razor burn all over his neck, with the &#x27;Art of Shaving&#x27; system, it reduced it to only a mild razor burn that wore off by 2 in the afternoon.  Since this electric razor can be used we or dry, he can still use the &#x27;Art of Shaving&#x27; system and the electric razor. Since then, no more razor burn! I highly recommend the razor, as well as the &#x27;Art of Shaving&#x27; system - the sandalwood scent is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I was a manual razor guy until buying this. Just needed something convenient. This sure is that. Takes a while to shave properly and getting used to it takes some extra time. Much nicer than hand shaving.</li>
    <li> I was a user of the original Norelco Speed Shaver: Model SC 8020. I loved that razor and when it died, moved on to a more modern \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; razor. It turned out to be more of a beard plucking machine. I gave it months of use to \\&quot;train\\&quot; my face to accept it, but could not take the pain any longer. So I went with the Braun Foil shaver and loved that one for many years. It recently began failing and even with frequent blade and foil replacements became too ineffective to use. So I took a chance on this Norelco and have been thrilled with it! No longer a torture device, it accomplishes a close [enough] shave with relatively little nicking here and there. Mine came with the Jet Wash cleaning system which performs the required \\&quot;after each use\\&quot; cleaning easily. The cleaning fluid is relatively cheap and I change the reservoir each Sunday. So the bottle lasts a month. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this razor again.  Philips Norelco stopped making the replacement heads and started making a cheap version that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the original head.</li>
    <li> The best shaver ever. I wished that I had purchased this items years ago. After years of using other type of electric shaving machines, my only regret is not buying this shaver years ago. A slam dunk of a shaver.</li>
    <li> efficient, clean shave. better than any razor i&#x27;ve previously owned. I like the cleaning feature, and the battery life that are sufficient for multi-week business trips away from the cleaner/charger between battery top-offs.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very useful to me.but  the shippment price is too high.and i am chinese,so i need a instruction book in chinese</li>
    <li> Perfect function and perfect qaility and perfect prize for a 3D razor also with clear mechine. It is a bargain to buy.</li>
    <li> Although I have appreciated the reviews on many products I have seen on this site, I have never been moved to write one myself, however the qaity of this shaver has caused me to say that this is simply the best shaver I have ever owned.  As someone has already mentioned, it is very quiet, streamlined and light.  Gives a very close and comfortable shave.  It conforms well to the face given the floating and bendable heads.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as birthday gift, which I was excited to get my first electric shaver with jet clean system. Like anyone will tell you switching from manual regular razor to electric shaver it takes several days of shaving for you and your skin to get use to it. First days I was getting razor burns when I shaved dry or little less with shaving cream but either way the shave was good enough. Cleaning system works nice, charges, moves the shaver down to bottom of the container where the cleaning solution is. It does that three times with turning the razor heads for full cleaning and then lets it dry. Definitely shaving with manual razor like Gillette Mach 3 or Fusion will get you a closer shave but for Norelco 1250 electric shaver it really does a great job.</li>
    <li> considering the price with such a valuable coupon discount ($50 off), it is perfect! Well recommend to those person who prefer Philips‘ 3D track head rather than Braun&#x27;s cutting head. Comparing with Braun 7 serier, Philips is quiet, Braun is more like a vibrator.</li>
    <li> First week my skin had to adjust as it was drying my skin out, but afterwards its fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean manually (have not tried the automatic cleaner yet).&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic, feels great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Love the travel lock and pouch.&lt;br /&gt;I full charged it the day I got it, and 40 days later only one bar has dropped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for daily 40 years. As advertised, this one is much improved and is their best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little apprehensive about buying the razor with the jet cleaning system because the last one I had was kind of stupid. This jet cleaning system is easy to use and works well. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. Does a great job on my face and I like the cleaning station. I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Works just fine.</li>
