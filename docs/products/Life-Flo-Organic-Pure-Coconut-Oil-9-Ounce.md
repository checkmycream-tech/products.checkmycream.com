<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We use this on our heels.  It is the first summer that we have had no sores and bleeding on our heels.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to coconut oil.  I love this and it works great!  I use several different oils on my hair, nails and skin and this particular coconut oil is awesome.  It has a perfect, soft scene which is not overbearing.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Very fast service.</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer on my body and a conditioner in my hair. If I leave it in the shower by the time I&#x27;m done it has melted enough to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I also rub it on my dogs skin to help with his allergies and dry skin. He&#x27;s prone to infection and coconut oil is naturally antibacterial and healthy if he licks it off.</li>
    <li> I am using it on my scalp and on my cuticles and I really like this product!  I will purchase it again and i will recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I never used Coconut Oil of any kind, I like Coconut but not a Big Fan. I was surprised to see that \\&quot;Life-Flo Organic Pure Coconut Oil\\&quot; is congealed into a Thick White Paste with the aroma of Coconut. An Oil that is good for just about everything, 1 Tablespoon has 130 Calories. I have used it in Frying and Cooking instead of Butter with excellent results and the taste of Coconut is not that noticeable. I have also applied it to may Face, made it Nice and Soft...Next I want to try it on my Scalp I want to see if it will Grow Thicker Hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil is Recommended as a Supplement, take 1 Tablespoon 1 to 4 times daily, maybe use it as a Spread or added to Salad Dressings and Smoothies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR COOKING: Use it in Place of Butter, Margarine, Shortening or other Cooking Oils in Temperatures up to 350F degrees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR SKIN CARE: Use it as a Moisturizer Lotion, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, Massage small amounts onto the Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR HAIR CARE: Use it as a Conditioner, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, then apply 2 teaspoons to the Hair 1 to 2 Hours before Washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil is a Natural Energy Source, it contains High levels of Healthy type of Fat called MCTs \\&quot;Medium Chain Triglycerides\\&quot; Pure Form of Coconut Oil, MCTs are different from other Fats primarily because they are digested much more easily and more efficiently. This makes them an extremely efficient Energy Source much more than Sugar. Also MCTs don&#x27;t add to Fat Cells or form Artery Hardening Plaque as readily as other Fats. Coconut Oil is a Good addition to my Physical Activity Exercise and Weight Loss Programs. I like the Pure Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to the point that has become a Staple in my Kitchen! ...Thank You D.D.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for dry curly. I say this because once i got it i applied to my hair and instantly got results my hair was smooth,soft and shiny. And it smells heavenly! Also i applied some too my skin and it got super soft!</li>
    <li> WOW! I have very sensitive skin and eczema (though it&#x27;s not always flared up), so I have trouble finding the right product to tame my skin. I use this both on my face and my body. I love it on my hands. My hands and face are the most sensitive areas! This works great! I love it so much. I have really flaky skin on my face and my family always says that with the right gust of wind, I&#x27;ll just blow away... Well, I won&#x27;t anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird having a product that smells like coconut. I feel like I&#x27;m putting dessert on my skin or something, lol! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. I don&#x27;t melt it like it says. I just get some and rub it together for a bit, then apply. I do that with Egyptian Magic, too! Egyptian Magic doesn&#x27;t work well on my face, though. My skin reacts a bit.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! after first use, my skin become soft like silk. And it smells so wonderful! I will order this product again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a lowe grade VCO, very low grade with a very little worthless mix of Vitamin E. Ingredients are Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (99.5), Tocopherol (Vitamin E) (Antioxidant to preserve the freshness of the coconut oil) (0.5%)... They are charging a ridiculous fee simply because the have added less than one, repeat again, less than 1% of Vitamin E to it. Not organic VCO, not organic E, nothing good about this mix. VCOs can last for months with no preservatives so adding less than one percent and charging three times more for a VCO, a low grade VCO is nothing but a marketing gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VCOs should be the same regardless you apply to the skin or consume directly with a spoon out of the jar. This is a low grade, processed VCO with no nutritional value sold as a beauty product which is very misleading since if the VCO is missing its nutrients then it will not have the impact as it should internally or externally on human body regardless. Not even a USDA organic since it&#x27;s facilities not up to standards of most VCOs producers that sell USDA VCO for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE A: Unfiltered, Fair Trade, Certified organic by the USDA, Canada Organic, BC Certified Organic, Ecocert, first pressed VCO and Kosher. Hand pressed and cold-pressed to produce raw oil from fresh coconuts in as little as two hours.&lt;br /&gt;GRADE B: Unfiltered, Fair Trade, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressed from fresh coconuts. Unknown if first pressed, Not Ecocert, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.&lt;br /&gt;GRADE C: Unfiltered, Certified organic by the USDA, Kosher, cold-pressed from fresh coconuts. Unknown if first pressed, Not Fair Trade, Not Ecocert, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.&lt;br /&gt;GRADE D: Filtered, not certified organic by the USDA, not Kosher, cold-pressing/expeller pressing, not first pressed, not Fair Trade, not Ecocert, not from fresh coconuts but from copra, Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.</li>
    <li> This shipped quickly, arrived in good condition and was a great price for organic coconut oiI.  i would recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is 100% coconut&lt;br /&gt;It smells refreshing and very tropical.  Not too oily and Distribute very easily on skin</li>
    <li> Nothing extraordinary.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> I took a workshop with &#x27;green guru&#x27; David Wolfe and he said he only recommedned using either coconut oil or olive oil for skin care....I took him up on it and ordered this product about two months ago. My. Skin. Looks. Incredible! Seriously...my pores have shrunk to seem almost non existent, I have a GLOW that I get compliments on regularly. The smell is amazing...you can EAT it (goes to show how natural and chemical free this is). I could go on and on....I put it on at night and in the mornings after washing up I smudge a little bit under my eyes and cheeks for a radiant, summer-like glow. This stuff is so fantastic I can&#x27;t believe I went so long with out it!!! My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It wasn&#x27;t closed tight during shipment so it leaked onto other items in the box.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I&#x27;m Jamaican and it smells just like this coconut snack we have here. It feels great against my skin and I just want more &amp; more!</li>
    <li> I use this on my dry scalp and my aging skin to hydrate and keep soft. Works great and does not have a heavy scent. Melts easy. I use this straight.</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin, but not close to eyes cause they became very irritated; so makes me think it&#x27;s not as pure as stated. I have used other organic brands of coconut oil  that you can actually cook with and still use as a moisturizers,  including taking my makeup off and does not burn, but actually makes my eyes feel better.</li>
    <li> bought this to use on my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;hair feels softer after rinse&lt;br /&gt;only need a small amount for desired affect&lt;br /&gt;mixes great with shea butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons</li>
    <li> I think this stuff is great.Not only is it all natural but, it really does make my skin soft.I have Keratosis Pilaris on the tops of my arms and this makes it less noticeable and it might even be clearing it up a little. It has a light nutty smell to it,not super tropical but, a pretty good smell.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. Makes skin very smooth. Slightly greasy though.</li>
    <li> Small, but I love the coconut oil</li>
    <li> Love it, it works so good, I would rubs into my grand daughter hands, cause they where so dry and red, the next morning her hands where soft and not red anymore</li>
    <li> I was skeptical if all the hype but I really love this stuff and will be getting more. It&#x27;s multi purpose but I like the skin benefits the most. I&#x27;m a hard core botox, filler user and started using this and really feel as though it has helped take years off my skin. I kind of even hate to tell what I&#x27;m using and I know that&#x27;s wrong but I want to keep it a secret.&lt;br /&gt;It does go on a bit greasy but absorbs quickly and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Perfect overall product. It reminds me of the old SNL skit for Shimmer, a floor wax and a dessert topping - only in this case, it&#x27;s a hair and body softener or a cooking oil!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks now. I really like it. I&#x27;m using it for my hair &amp; skin regimen.  Hoping for great results. It smells great, i love it on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue was it took a month to receive this product.  I even got an email that said it wasn&#x27;t coming, then it showed up in the mail.  NOT GOOD AT ALL!  Other than this, the product itself is great!</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil!! I use it for everything!! It smells and tastes great as well!! I use it in my hair for a nice sheen &amp; on my skin to give it a nice tropical glow at the beach</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t worry-- I have two jars.  One lives in the kitchen for cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One lives in the nursery for baby&#x27;s bum.  Put on a little when he starts looking a little red, and poof, diaper rash reversed before it starts.</li>
    <li> Simple save for the damage done to my skin every winter. You only need a small amount and it truly helps.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this pure coconut oil.  I use it for my hair.</li>
    <li> I am so glad i bought this product. I use this along with oilve oil in my conditioner as a deep condioner. my hair is more manageable because of it. I also used this combo in my mothers ans sisters hair,and their hair is shinier,just all around gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Amazing  product, especially for your hair. If you put it on right before you wash. You will have a great shine. I had damaged  hair and with the coconut  oil it has been repairing  it</li>
    <li> Love this product - I use it for all of my cooking</li>
    <li> wife likes it, which means I like it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Great for massages, especially sensual massages! Guys... always remember, you should always use natural, food grade oils! Regular massage oils in the wrong places are not good for the ladies! Plus... this stuff smells really good... naturally scented!</li>
    <li> Love this coconut oil, I use on my hair overnight works great also good for skin .</li>
    <li> I used this product on my hair the first day I got it. I followed the instructions and dipped the container in warm water to liquify. Left it on my hair for about 30 minutes. My hair is silky soft!  I have thick course waivy hair. It was super easy to straighten it after wash and blow dry. Iike this product so far!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best oils....period...will be buying more.  The smell is great, and it goes on really smooth.  If you love coconut, consider this oil.</li>
    <li> Great coconut oil the best we have ever had although it was melted and the first time i bought it, it was a solid wen it came but it  was still great</li>
    <li> love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Went on the internet and found out many uses for the coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is perfect. The consistency is semi-solid but malleable enough to melt with the just the touch of your fingertips. It absorbs quickly and is not the slightest bit greasy, unless you overdo it, which may not be a bad thing if you have severely dry skin like myself. My elbows, heels, cuticles and even my forehead around my hairline/scalp get very dry and flakey and just a dime size amount of this coconut oil does the trick. I also put it on my hair (dry hair) right before flat-ironing and it kept it silky and soft, you just have to be careful when using on your hair not to put too much or it might make your hair stringy &amp; oily.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is 11 on a 10 point scale, including the nice glass jar packaging.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as a post-exfoliation moisturizer and weekly hair treatment. I use it after Ocean Salt by LUSH cosmetics (exfoliator) and my skin just glows</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and correct order</li>
    <li> I love this brand of coconut oil so much that I plan to buy more. My only regret is I didn&#x27;t buy more with my first purchase. Thank you so much for making this product and please make more.</li>
    <li> ...and it was awesome! I put about three tablespoons in a bowl and melted it in the microwave. I had to let it cool a bit (ow burning oil!) and then dipped my ends in first then worked the rest of it throughout my hair (I have shoulder-length very thick wavy hair). Once my head looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in months (lol) I wrapped my whole head in plastic wrap and left it for two hours (I watched a tutorial that said to leave it in overnight but I didn&#x27;t want my pillows getting all oily!). Then, I showered -- I had to wash my hair like 3 times to get it all out and I used less then my normal amount of conditioner, but when it dried my hair was SO soft and shiny and it looks gorgeous! I&#x27;m so in love I will probably do this treatment like once a week now haha :) It worked wonderfully! Plus its organic and tastes pretty good too hahaha, Google online all the things you can use this for! I used three tablespoons for my hair ended up having some left over and put it on my dry skin and eyelashed and holy wow! My skins looking good and my eyelashes seem to be longer! Make sure when you do this, if you&#x27;re doing your hair you most definitely want to use an old shirt! It gets very drippy, which is why I wrapped my head too :)</li>
    <li> Smells great, very clean oil. Absorbs well and my hair looked good for a day, but I guess I need to do it more often!</li>
    <li> I wear after bath and I feel my skin smooth and shiny .I didnot have any problem with the shipment was fastest thanI expected</li>
    <li> It works very well in homemade beauty products. Unfortunately after I bought this I found out that Sams Club sells a 54oz Pure Coconut Oil bin for $17.</li>
    <li> Excellent ingredient for home made scrubs.  This coconut is so smoothing to the touch and smells wonderful.  Recommend this very much</li>
    <li> Good product took over two months to deliver.so dont think i would order again. Need to work on processing there product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. The bottle is a little smaller than I had anticipated but I&#x27;ll be using it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I have 4C hair and it leaves it feeling super soft and my manageable. My hair is no longer dry and brittle. That &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; feeling is gone! I would suggest mixing with drops of other oils (rosemary for growth, peppermint for scalp soothing and dandruff and lavender)</li>
    <li> I love the smell and consistency.  I bought mine a month ago, and I am almost out, so I am buying another.  It&#x27;s been highly effective as an all-over (including face) moisturizer and as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like to moisturize my skin with Coconut oil.  this one was good, but a little too greasy, since it also contains Vitamin E.</li>
    <li> This product met all my expectations. It works really well on the areas  that I needed and it is pure.</li>
    <li> Used it to protect my hair during a 40 developer bleaching session. It arrived leaking a little but was mostly intact.</li>
    <li> I love the smell; I just wish it had a seal to protect it from spilling out when it was delivered.</li>
    <li> This arrived on a very timely manner- as promised!  I like this product, but it&#x27;s only been about a week that I have been using it. I try to use it everyday, but I don&#x27;t like that you have to nuke it in hot water to get the coconut oil to become less pasty.</li>
    <li> I never received this coconut oil, and I have not been reimbursed for it. I purchased it at the beginning of February and it was supposed to take over 4 weeks to arrive. Shockingly, it never arrived. Had I known it would take so long to be delivered, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. In fact, after I purchased it, I started noticing that many other local stores sell coconut oil for significantly cheaper. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the oil. It wasn&#x27;t too strong and it didn&#x27;t taste bad at all. I used for my hair,skin and oil pulling technique.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and body and absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to everyone I know</li>
    <li> I use this for everything cosmetic related. Works great as a moisturizer on your face so long as you use it in small amounts. I also use it as a hair mask. Melt some of the wax or work it into a liquid with your finger and lather your hair (wet or dry) then braid it or put in in a bun. It will look oily while the oil is in it, but once you wash it out your hair is so much softer. I do this every two weeks!</li>
    <li> It smells delicious, it is not heavy, it is light and leaves your skin wonderful.I am extremely happy and the price is very convenient.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look great! Nice, shiny, smooth, it&#x27;s the perfect conditioner. Will buy more when&lt;br /&gt;I run out.</li>
    <li> So it arrived with some oil on the outside. I really didn&#x27;t care. It smells amazing. It melts in your fingertips. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. It&#x27;s natural. It&#x27;s non greasy once it soaks in, and it soaks in quickly. Great for hands during dry winter months. I will absolutely be buying more when I run out, but you don&#x27;t need much so it should last a long time</li>
    <li> The oil is great, smells like coconut, the only problem is one of the tops on the jar was broken, not wrapped properly, besides that it great.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this more than a month ago and have yet to receive it...not happy!! It seems like a great product but I won&#x27;t know until I get it IF I get it!</li>
    <li> I love this product !!! I use it on my skin esp now that winter is coming to help fend off dry winter skin. I also use it in my hair and it helps keep it moisturized and soft!</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable item for hair care. I like that it keeps my hair feeling super soft and luscious. If you have super bleached out hair like i do, then I would definitely recommend this product. Instead of leaving it in for only 25 minutes, i would lay a towel out on your pillow and leave it in over night. Then proceed to rinse it out in the morning because really bleached hair requires quite a bit more nourishment.</li>
    <li> OMG! This stuff is the real deal! When I opened the jar I got a whiff full of goodness! I love the way it smells so heavenly! Also, a little takes you a long way. I use this as a staple oil for my hair; I take a tablespoon out of this and melt it in the microwave, put it in my applicator bottle and voila! It helped my hair retain moisture: keeping it from breaking off, which helped my grow over three inches in four months! Not only is it good for the hair, but it works wonders for the skin! It gives my skin a beautiful shine, without the greasiness and weight of petroleum jelly! All-in-all, it was packaged in this glass jar beautifully, with no cracks! Just order this and you will see what i&#x27;m talking about!</li>
    <li> I really liked the coconut oil. This was my first time using it since I&#x27;ve bee natural. I normally change up my oils every month or after every use to see what works well with my hair. But I will continue to keep this as a favorite.</li>
    <li> This is nice stuff. Use on hair and cuticles. Melts and absorbs quickly. Does not not leave greasy shine surprisingly. DOES add shine to dry, over-processed hair. Glad I found it. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is so amazing for your skin, I had gotten a burn on my arm and used this coconut oil on my burn it has healed amazingly and was hardly painful. I would so recommend this product to everyone I come across.</li>
    <li> Take 3 oz of this and mix with some extra virgin olive oil. Wow, this has truly moisturize and condition my super thick natural hair. Love this method more then hair grease because it does not weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Great smell. I use it as a lotion for my skin and it works well I find it to be rather luxurious</li>
    <li> My daughter has natural curls &amp; I don&#x27;t like using product in her hair that contains alcohol.  A friend of mine suggested coconut oil &amp; I first started at the grocery store.  It worked great on her hair but started to smell kind of stale &amp; &amp;#34;plastic-ey?&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell it left in her hair.  I read the reviews on this one &amp; everyone said it smelled great...it does initially smell just like coconut and does&#x27;t have a bad smell, but eventually it does start to smell funny in her hair also, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as strong &amp; as bad as the grocery store coconut oil I had tried.  Maybe we&#x27;re doing something wrong, she already shampoos her hair twice every night to get it all out so she doesn&#x27;t leave old oil in there, but we love what it does to her curls...still trying to figure something out!  If anyone has suggestions it would be great!</li>
    <li> jar had leaked It was only half full</li>
    <li> I had patches of dry skin at each side of my cheecks near the mouth , I would use creams even medicated my derm docs and it would seem to go away but every time i wake up it was still there and I was like a slave and it was so embarrasing for me, but Ever since I began using this product its has completely gone. It took me about 3 weeks of continuos use of this and  now I can go some days without using it and I have not soon this dry patch anymore, it doesnt burn anymore either I dare to say its gone for good!!!!. Plus this 9ounce embase has lasted me a while. It leaves my face soft and rejuvenated, I also use on legs after shave once in a while. I will pruchase an extra for comsuption because it tastes good. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I finished up Trader Joes brand and Life flo is much better.  Life flo melts better and rubs into the skin better.  The price was a little more than what I normally pay but I wanted to try the brand.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t describe how divine thus smells. Like a bounty bar but sweeter. The real compliments though are for what it does. I&#x27;m a black woman and currently growing out my natural hair to allow it heal from damage caused by relaxer. This is the best conditioner ever! My hard to manage hair was instantly softened. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair. I also use this a moisturizer before bed. It&#x27;s feels a lot more indulgent than what I paid for it&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good product fast  shipping.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff on my skin, in my hair, on my face and I also eat it. It helps to make my skin soft, my hair shiny, and acne off my face. And since it is food grade, Eating it helps to do all of this from the inside as well as assists in weight loss. It smells and tastes wonderful. I still can&#x27;t believe I can put it directly on my face to help with acne. Wow. Coconut is truly amazing. I love it. I found that putting a teaspoon or 2 in my coffee works out really well. Gives the coffee a great taste. Anyways, will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Loved my life-flo coconut oil. I ordered 2 right away-not knowing if I&#x27;d like it or not. But I do, and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to waste time ordering another one in a week!</li>
    <li> This product comes in the form of a solid coconut oil that melts once you mix it into your hands. However, if you store it in a warm room, you will find that the product will partially melt in the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use this to moisturize my skin during the winter. I mix it into another cream lotion (Eucerin) and apply it all over my body. At night, I put some of the oil onto my face for an hour, then wash it off right before I go to bed. It leaves my face slightly oily, but by the time I wake up my face feels quite moisturized without being too shiny.  I also apply it to a cotton bud and use it to remove makeup, since it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and doesn&#x27;t contain any fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easily absorbed and leaves my skin very soft. Unlike other lotions that leave my skin dry after only one hour, this product serves its purpose effectively and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I rated this four stars because it has a tendency to melt, and is thus very difficult to transport when travelling. I usually transfer it to a small plastic bottle, but it would be nice if the container it comes in originally was a little more leak-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive skin, this is a great product to use for removing makeup and moisturizing skin. It can also be used to moisturize hair. I&#x27;m not sure if this particular brand is the best (this is the first coconut oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased) but it seems to work well and is also food-grade (according to the label).</li>
    <li> Good product. I order a Coconut Oil and received a Cocoa butter BUT that Cocoa butter is good for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> love this coconut oil! it is very easy to melt in my hand. I use it for shaving, hair treatments and moisturizer for my face/lips. It has a nice nutty smell to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as a makeup remover and moisturizer for my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;- This product is truly &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;. When you open the jar and take a sniff, it smells like a fresh coconut!&lt;br /&gt;- It is non-irritating for the eyes. I use this product to remove my face makeup, including eyeliner and mascara. I wear contacts, and I have never experienced burning or anything. If you get it on your contact it might fog it up, but it is safe to use around the eye region.&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves my skin very moisturized, an added benefit since I have very dry skin&lt;br /&gt;- When using it on the ends of my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed that my ends have become healthier and stronger. I also use it as a mask prior to washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a heavier oil than others (e.g. Emu Oil) so if you have oily skin or skin that is prone to clogging up, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for your face. I had attempted to use it as a moisturizer on a nightly basis, and found it to be too heavy. I would stick to a lighter cream or a Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;- The consistency changes with the temperature of the house&lt;br /&gt;- Price has increased, maybe check in-store to see if it is available for a cheaper price than on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Life-Flo has  delivered with a pure Coconut Oil that has worked for me. I would recommend this product to others, but just keep in mind that it may not work for you the way it works for someone else.</li>
    <li> I wanted to test out the coconut oil before I started amazon prime with this, best decision I ever made!! Works wonders with my hair! A little goes a long way, and you have to shampoo at least 3-4 times to get it out( normal for coconut oil) for best results leave in over night and shower the next day, but sometimes I leave it in for about a half hour then shampoo it out and it works the same!</li>
    <li> I bought this small container of coconut oil first to make sure I wanted to use it.  Well, it is a very good product to have on hand.  You can use it on cuts &amp; scrapes or take it internally.  Anyone who decides to try it should get the book, 101 Miraculous Coconut Oil Benefits &amp; I can promise, you will get your monies worth out of it.</li>
    <li> it was great.. I eat it, put in my hair, use it as moisturizer, cook with it. it does the job</li>
    <li> this is the best oil for my skin. I have very dry skin and I use it a few times a day</li>
    <li> the coconut oil is good.  Just a bit too oily...  I like to use creams at bed time and the coconut oil left spots on my sheets.  I could of course use it earlier in the day and eliminate that problem.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and nothing was working.  I got the coconut oil and now my skin is getting back to normal. I use it for everything.</li>
    <li> I received this product shortly after ordering it, it&#x27;s so versatile in terms of beauty uses and absorbs quickly into skin and hair to leave you feeling moisturized with no residual oily feeling. I will keep this in my cabinet from now on!</li>
    <li> I finally found what I was looking for, I bought this for my dog, she has a patch of dry skin and it this works great on her, she loves it and she smells nice too, will buy again</li>
    <li> FAST shipping i ordered it 2 days ago and it got here today!! So far im like the smell and consistency, i put it on my lips and my body after i get out the shower  and i loveee the smell</li>
    <li> Wonderful Coconut Oil, purchased for me but my husband cant get enough of it&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;Smells delicious and works well on hair, face and all over. Thanks again everything was so&lt;br /&gt;nicely packed.</li>
    <li> Very good for my hair.  No petroleum, silicones, or other additives.  There is also no fragrance in it.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I thought it would smell a little sweeter, but it&#x27;s not too stinky, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to arrive as a complete solid. I have to microwave it before every use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that it comes in a glass jar as I know glass is best to store products in versus plastic. It works great on my skin and leaves it soft all day without a greasy feeling. My husband compliments me on my baby soft skin and I&#x27;ve noticed the compliments since using this brand of coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I havent really used it used it, but the smell is nice. It arrived on time and it seem like it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is my first coconut oil purchase, wanted to try it out. Does a great job. I keep it in the shower and use it to shave my legs, use it to moisturize, and also put a little on my ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> this can be used for anything from food (i didn&#x27;t, but you &#x27;could&#x27; as its food grade) to skin to hair. Even household needs. I like this product!!</li>
    <li> Coconut was a staple in my house as a child.  This natural product has many benefits for the skin, hair, etc.  In a pure state, it.hardens which makes it a little difficult to use  Resoved by using a spoon, it melts on contact with body heat.  I prefer its purity rather than a cream form with additives.</li>
    <li> I love the smell It&#x27;s really good it really miracles.I need this more in my life because it&#x27;s helping my hair grow.</li>
    <li> great for dry skin but it can make you feel greasy so I only use it at bed time - can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything to HELP my skin besides felling hydrated at night</li>
    <li> I really love it for conditioning my hair ( I have very thick shoulder length hair) and it smells terrific!  The only thing I was disappointed about was that I thought that I could use this in cooking.. This does say &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34; and pure, but in one of the question/answers at the bottom of the description, they did answer that this is formulated with Vit E oil and not be be consumed. I also saw on the jar a warning to be careful around eyes and keep away from children. I would buy again for moisturizing but would probably be more careful in buying a pure true food -grade product in the future. My fault.. I did not see those answers before I bought it.. not sure why it would SAY food grade, if you cannot ingest. That part is a little confusing to me, anyway.  Otherwise, I cannot wait to shave my legs with this and will try it as others have, as a skin cream! (Watching around the eyes.. )</li>
    <li> My kids have eczema and this provided almost immediate relief the first day. I put it on them after they bathe at night and when I dress them in the morning.  I love it because now I don&#x27;t have to use prescribed steroid creams from the doctor anymore!! I even use it for my own skin!  Great product!</li>
    <li> perfect! Bit of advice if the room temperature is 65 degrees or higher you will have oil in a jar. I placed my jar in the fridge</li>
    <li> I will be using it as a natural hair remedy to soften my hair and bring growth to it, need to try it still, but I&#x27;ve heard great things! We shall see :)</li>
    <li> It arrived on time but this came broken it had broken glass all over the box once you opened , very dangerous</li>
    <li> Excellent product - you only need a little bit, and it&#x27;s odorless too. I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose, very oily though</li>
    <li> Smells great. I use it as a conditioner for my hair and now using it for my skin. Not a waste of money, worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil. I use it for my face and hair. It makes my hair nice and smooth and nourishes my fried ends like nothing else I&#x27;ve used before.. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product in so nice and creamy, great for hands and hair. Plus the smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for all sorts of things.  I made home made play doh and it was the best ever.  Stays so smooth.  Way better than that you buy.</li>
    <li> So coconut oil is amazing and this is no exception. Its all natural and works very well. I use it on my hair and i love it.</li>
    <li> I use a small dab on my hair after I wash it while it is still wet. It makes my hair smooth and soft. I love the light coconut scent of this oil.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how well it softened my skin. I will differently recommend it to friends and family. Thanks</li>
    <li> My naturopath recommended rubbing coconut oil into my skin after my shower because of postmenopausal dryness.  This stuff is solid, and my hands weren&#x27;t warm enough to melt it, so I bought a mug warmer and small glass dish to liquify it.  I scoop a little into the dish, hop in the shower, and when I come out, it&#x27;s ready! The coconut is pure, the oil quickly dissolves into my skin, and the coconut smell rapidly dissipates.  The glass container is small and easily sits on my vanity.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I decided to go natural hair journey and after doing some research I learn organic pure coconut oil was good for growth, conditioning. I&#x27;m very impressed on the results of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this coconut oil. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it seems to take a little longer than others to melt down/liquify on my skin, but once it does, its very, very nice and soaks into my skin and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face for my dry skin. Works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping for a different hair conditioner, but in reality, it&#x27;s much more. I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin, including on my face. You just have to be careful you don&#x27;t glop it on or you will have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I use this on everyone and everything! Smells like an almond joy! I use on myself to remove makeup, on my toddler&#x27;s dry patches, and even on my dogs irritated skin!</li>
    <li> Does wonders on my skin and when mixed with my conditioner does wonders for my hair as well</li>
    <li> With the cold weather my skin get super dry and itchy....I use a little of the Coconut oil and done!</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  I use this as a body moisturizer.  It absorbs well and leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my skin and hair and I absolutely love it! I use it on myself and my ten month old son and I love it from the moisture it provides to the sweet, sweet smell of coconut it leaves behind . . . I definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is literally my favorite for everything, especially as a mosturizer, your skin just sucks it all up and stays hydrated. I love it as a hair treatment as well!</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and I love the way it makes my hair and skin feel. I use it daily and I will buy this again</li>
    <li> I use this Oil for my natural hair and also as a skin moisturizer. Smells amazing!  The oil is not greasy, very light and absorbs quickly into skin. This is the best Coconut oil i have purchased!</li>
    <li> The smell is god,  and the coconut oil melts quickly in your hands however its a little gritty unless rubbed well</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a review on an amazing shaving cream where someone mentioned they used coconut oil instead of paying for the cream so I researched different ones and this one seemed to be the best to fit my needs and had the best reviews (and I read a lot from different brands!).  I used it this morning and it&#x27;s perfect for what I wanted and was just as good as the $20 shaving cream I loved (plus the scent of coconut is ah-mazing!!!). When I received it, it was in pure liquid form from being in the delivery truck. I left it sit in my shower (tile and stone) and it never hardened up. It got a little thicker though, like a gravy substance which was perfect for using to shave with. I just dipped my fingers in the jar (be careful since it is glass) and rubbed a thin layer on my legs and everywhere else I shave, it went on great even with water on my skin. (I read where some used it for their hair so since it stays on your hands pretty well I applied some towards the ends of my damp hair too since I blow dry it). It didn&#x27;t gunk up my razor and I never had to reapply any. Rinsed off with water, no stinging like with regular shave gels/creams/foam and the oil stayed on so my legs were very soft and I didn&#x27;t need to lather on lotion afterwards either!  As for my hair, it was very soft and shiny after blow drying it. I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this brand.&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: I bought it from Swanson Health Products on a Thursday and received it Monday).</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell you because I never got it.  I was sent sunflower oil instead of the coconut oil and paid $9.40 to send it back and had to eat the return postage.  I was never sent the right one I ordered so I had to it to get nothing in return.</li>
    <li> When I got the product the lid was broken. I basically couldn&#x27;t use the lid at all and had to wrap around a plastic bag with rubber band when I tried to transport the oil. It was a mess and I lost a lot of oil for that reason. I wrote to the company but never got a response. What a shame! Product was good and I would have continued buying from them.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! the smell is something else... this is my first  time trying coconut oil on my skin and I love it. My skin feels radiant and soft!</li>
    <li> This product smells NOTHING like coconut whatsoever it actually smells like buttered popcorn with a hint of chicken grease. Not pleased.</li>
    <li> I used this and it made my skin soft and supple. I was devastated when I ran out will order more</li>
    <li> great product! I&#x27;ve always been a fan of coconut oil and this is great!</li>
    <li> I love this product on my hair. I order it twice but the second time it was really watery so I was wondering if I got the real thing. Well.... I don&#x27;t have to melt it</li>
    <li> Do not order this in hot weather. Ran out of the container as soon as I took off the cap. Also found you can buy it cheaper in the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil in general is amazing stuff and does wonders for my skin and hair. When I ordered this, I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the size of the container and when I got it I realized it&#x27;s a bit overpriced. Not a huge issue as coconut oil tends to last a while, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. Advertised as food grade but it&#x27;s not. This doesn&#x27;t really affect me but annoys me anyway. When I opened the box, the jar was slick and oily. I think if they&#x27;re going to charge over $1 an ounce, they should be able to manage a jar that doesn&#x27;t leak. I shouldn&#x27;t have to repackage a beauty product before taking it somewhere. It does smell very good, though.  Also, when I put it on my face, it made me break out. I&#x27;ve put other coconut oil on my face with no problems in the past, making me think this brand has something irritating in it. I don&#x27;t have problems with oily or pimply skin, but it is very sensitive. Something in this oil irritated my face. Seems to be ok on my arms, though.</li>
    <li> I bought pure coconut to use for my hair.  I use it twice a week. Leave it in hair for 15min. Than shampoo. I can see my hair is starting to have some life to it. Since it was brittle and dry. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I&#x27;ve ordered it more than once within a 3 weeks period. It would be great if they sold larger jars...I didn&#x27;t see an offer for a larger jar.....maybe I&#x27;ve missed it...(((Smile)))</li>
    <li> I being using for my dry hair, but my hair is Still have a long treatment ahead because is very dry.</li>
    <li> This is a good but for the price. I have ordered several jars now. I have noticed the last few times the jar is not full. I am using a a moisturizer on my eyelashes eyes hair and body. Very easy to use l</li>
    <li> I just got this product and have used it twice on my hair and on my face and it has worked wonders! I can see a huge difference in the quality of my hair! And smoothness of my face! I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it for absolutely everything from shaving my legs to whitening my teeth to moisturizing my hair.</li>
    <li> very nice product doesn&#x27;t sting keeps your skin looking good and smells really good. I think my skin likes it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for a while now. It works for so many different things. This one container has lasted me for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil.  It smells heavenly, and it rubs well into my skin.  It starts out as a solid, but quickly turns into an oil.  It says that it&#x27;s food grade on the label, so I can&#x27;t wait to use it for cooking.  Plus it&#x27;s cold pressed and organic!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Use this on my head to condition scalp; works great, smells good, and lasts forever. Absorbs well. Great product!</li>
    <li> The best gift from earth!</li>
    <li> love the smell i put this all over my body and it feels great i use it everyday on everything that i could think of</li>
    <li> Many uses for different purposes. The smell was sweet but since it was quite more liquidy than I thought, it ran out quick.</li>
    <li> just the best thing for your hair &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND HOPED FOR! Works well as moisturizer for hair face nail etc, very pleased and highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Love coconut oil! ! It works for everything, face, body and hair</li>
    <li> So far, I love it! It has worked wonders for my hair. I had really dried hair because of the dye-burn-process with L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Cream Dark Ash Brown. My natural hair is blonde, dark blonde with highlights in golden honey. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for 12 years; fine hair as mine couldn&#x27;t take it any more. I&#x27;m really surprised I was able to do it for so long. Anyways, I had a chemical reaction and had to stop. A hair stylist recommended to buy coconut oil to apply to my hair, from middle to ends, 45 minutes before washed with coconut shampoo and conditioner (Organix brand). She then proceeded with applying treatment and semi-permanent product after wash-out the dark color on my hair. I came to Amazon and after an extensive research I decided to try this one from Life-Flo, and this organic Pure Coconut Oil has worked wonders in less than a week. My hair doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore, and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore. I have being able to deal with color change without damaging my hair that it was almost fried from all the processes in all these 12 years. It looks like coconut desert and smells heavenly but it&#x27;s nothing compare to what truly does if it&#x27;s use for treatment on hair or skin. Looks pretty natural to me. I would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;PD: I&#x27;m not prone to write reviews, so imagine how satisfied I must be with this product.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair for 4 hours and then wash it out. It makes my hair soft and feeling restored. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> this stuff does miracles!</li>
    <li> Using this as an organic antiperspirant ....doesn&#x27;t mask odor but keeps me super dry!!! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great product.  Online the picture is a bit misleading.  Jar is small but product delivers very well.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my hair this product was just like any other oil I brought</li>
    <li> Quality product.  I use this to make all natural conditioner.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Has a great flavor when cooking and makes your skin smell great also!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face every night and my skin is so soft.  I also like to put it on after being in the sun.  In the jar it will range from slightly solid to more liquid depending on the room temperature, but it goes on well and melts right into your skin.</li>
    <li> Over the winter I had some intensive problems with my face being too dry. It keeps my face hydrated all day and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs from this product. I like it!</li>
    <li> small bottle·but i like it ·i use my hair and my face skinㅡ</li>
