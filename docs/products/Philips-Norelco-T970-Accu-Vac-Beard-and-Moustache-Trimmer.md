      <li>expect them to be nice.</li>
      <li>BTW the customer service rep who was handling the warranty service was extremely nice too.</li>
      <li>and I have been trimming my own hair for 10 years.  </li>
      <li>I really think Norelco makes the best Trimmers in the world.</li>
      <li>I liked the accuvac in the beginning; the hair reservoir is quite functional, even if it doesn&#x27;t catch everything.</li>
      <li>a guess that you do indeed wish your face to look nice and the hair on it to appear well kept.</li>
      <li>My wife is extremely happy with the clean sink.  </li>
      <li>It looks great, is not too loud sounding, and feels great in your hand.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for a trimmer that is easy to use as well as does a good job at trimming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many beard trimmers and I must remark, this is the absolute best.  </li>
      <li>The vaccum collects easily two-thirds to three-quarters of the trimmed hair and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The one hour charge time is very nice, but I find I get about 3 trims per charge on my full beard.  </li>
      <li>VERY easy to adjust and use.  </li>
      <li>The indicator lights are very easy to read and as far as the depth setting goes, it is the best.</li>
      <li>The blades cut nice, but battery life could be better.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy so far.  </li>
      <li>I travel a lot and it is nice to be able to just take it along without the charger knowing it will work like a charm for a couple of months.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a hormonally precocious eight-year-old or own an SUV, it&#x27;s sure to appeal.</li>
      <li>this trimmer i own for more than 2.5 years..works as specified</li>
      <li>Enjoyed it while it worked although I wouldn&#x27;t call it amazing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the T6000 (the original trimmer) for 5 years and loved it until the battery crocked.  </li>
      <li>Good clean trimming.  </li>
      <li>to use and very precise trimming</li>
      <li>This was very important to me.</li>
      <li>a made of tougher nilon, the charger alone is HUGE!</li>
      <li>I read many of the reviews before making my purchase and don&#x27;t understand the problems some of the reviewers had encountered.  </li>
      <li>(and I read a lot), didn&#x27;t turn up anything that looked better than what I had been using.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
      <li>and I still have not been able to resolve the problem.  </li>
      <li>so I am pleased with it</li>
      <li>6 weeks, I am satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>The various height adjustments are excellent for creative trimming.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I braved the many poor reviews and bought this trimmer. Although it didn&#x27;t seem to first trim closely enough (stubble) at first, it got better as I learned to use it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But after removing the top comb attachment to use the precision mini-trimmer, it was absolutely impossible to put it back on. I could how it was supposed to go back on but it simply wouldn&#x27;t work. I spent forever and finally decided maybe it actually did need a bit of force. I was wrong. I&#x27;m sending it back tomorrow, and I expect a full refund.</li>
    <li> Although the clipper is a little bigger than I would have liked it to be, it does cut pretty well.  The vacuum picks up most of the clippings.  My sink is definitely cleaner than it has been with other clippers.  Good product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Well, after 43 years I finally worked up the nerve to let my facial hair grow.  So much so, that I needed a trimmer to keep it ... well ... trim.  Over ~ a month, I began using the Norelco T970 every day.  The unit performed admirably.  I found myself looking (admiringly) in the mirror waaayyyy too much.  My wife on the other didn&#x27;t admire my new growth.  In the end, I used this fine razor to make one last close pass over my face before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The person who complained of the packaging is right. You need a chain saw to get into this thing.  I used a boxcutter razor blade but when I was trying to get everything out, the &#x27;precision mini trimmer&#x27; piece went sailing across my table. Now it&#x27;s in 3 pieces and I have no idea how to put it back together.  The thing hasn&#x27;t even been plugged in yet, and I&#x27;m already screwed. I&#x27;m tempted to just box all the pieces up and send it back.  Do the \\&quot;packaging engineers\\&quot; that design this type of packaging realize that somebody might actually try to remove the contents some day?  This really is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say I&#x27;m severely disappointed with some of the other reviews of this product, as I have found them to be light years from my experience with this trimmer.  Thus far, I have found it to be well designed, well built and very easy to use.  Also to my surprise, the vaccum works just great!  Yes, there are still hairs that hit the sink, but whadda ya want, perfection?  The vaccum collects easily two-thirds to three-quarters of the trimmed hair and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve found the most impressive aspect of the trimmer is the extended precision trimming head.  While not as wide as the standard trimming head, it extends the cutting edge far enough away from the body of the trimmer to provide the easiest and most accurate edge trimming I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Outlining my beard, moustache and sideburns is suddenly a far easier and more precise task.  For any guy who either wants or needs cleaner lines on his facial hair, this is an excellent choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting used to the length selector and how to get the desired look before having to take off the guide comb and switch trimmer heads to get a more precise cut, but I&#x27;m sure that will come with time.  It operates in much the same way as my previous Norelco trimmer, but the body design of this trimmer fits much better in the hand, and the guide comb assembly provides a much more comfortable trim as I glide it over my chin.  It&#x27;s also a wonderful thing to have the fast 1 hour recharge time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve found so far is some irritation of the skin while using the extended trimmer head.  It&#x27;s a VERY sharp head and can nick you if you&#x27;re not careful, but I put that in the still-learning-how-to-use-it category.  This is truly a great trimmer, so to all my proudly facially hirsute brothers, I say don&#x27;t believe the nay-sayers and pick this puppy up!</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer is good but I don&#x27;t care for the moustache trimmer,it was a lot better on my old one.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs that are trimmed, but it gets alot. &lt;br /&gt;I like the trim guide that is part of the razor. &lt;br /&gt;thumbs up</li>
    <li> On using the product, I removed the head to clean out the hair collection chamber.  The plastic guide for the chamber came off and the retaining spring flew out and was lost. I could not reach anyone at Amazon.com. &lt;br /&gt;The return instructions implied that once the package is opened, there would be a restocking or a less return benifit.  I called Norelco and they offered me a free replacement even though they did not sell the product.  This is the last time that I will ever do any business with you.</li>
    <li> I have been using one for about a year.  But, recently, I had to replace it because, while in the UK, I inadvertently, plugged the charger into 220V. I could have purchased a replacement charger but, a few months back, my son dropped the trimmer in the sink and it then stopped locking on the depth setting, requiring that I hold the dial fixed while grooming.  So, I had a choice, do I buy a full replacement or look around for anything better?  All the reviews I could read (and I read a lot), didn&#x27;t turn up anything that looked better than what I had been using.  Why 4 out of 5 stars?  Well, the drop in the sink was not that jarring.  It should not have broken so easily.  Also, it does suck up 80% of the hair but 100% would be the gold standard. Still, 80% is better than the mess I used to have to clean out of the sink. Also, my first unit had a battery that didn&#x27;t hold a good charge.  I am pleased to say that the replacement unit lets me get about 4 trims of my goatee before recharging</li>
    <li> This trimmer has done everything it claimed to do. It is very easy to use and enables you to groom yourself without fear of an uneven cut.</li>
    <li> Norelco definitely knows what a trimmer shoud be. This trimmer is the best I ever owned. It does not make much noise, it cuts very cleanly. The vacuum is not perfect (none are) but way better than my noisy Remington MB-70. Also the detail mini trimmer works nicely and trimms much closer than the Remington&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomics are great and the accessories snap-in very easily.</li>
    <li> This is a fine trimmer.  Reports that it is noisy are unfounded and and cuts beautifully.  I like it.</li>
    <li> The moustache trimmer on the old T7500 was built-in and extremely convenient to use.  On this one, you have to pull off the guide, then the cutter head, then stick on the moustache cutter.  There&#x27;s no place to even store the trimmer, so it&#x27;s either rattling around in your drawer or the bottom of your toilet kit. &lt;br /&gt;Also, I found it a lot harder to get a consistent length cut with the \\&quot;Accu Control\\&quot; flexing comb guide than with the fixed guide of the older unit.  I keep my beard pretty short -- this might not be a problem with a longer beard.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I returned the T970, and went back to my old T7500, even tho the battery no longer holds a charge and I have to run it off wall power.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, corded and rechargeable. Nothing beats a Norelco. The vaccum gets about 80% of the hair and cuts better then any other shaver I have had (except other Norelcos.)</li>
    <li> The T970 is an example of putting 5 lbs. of **** in a 1 lb. bag.  The concept of having to remove the guide and cutting blade assembly to attach the close trimmer blade is a pain in the ass.  P.S. Men do not care, need or want a vacuum for home use.  Especially when it means giving up a self-contained unit that does not require a wall charger.  BRING BACK THE T750 MODEL.</li>
    <li> I went for this for the \\&quot;vaccum\\&quot; it boasts of.  I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with the vaccum performance.  It works better with the cap on it but without cap vaccum manages to collect just 60-70% of hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The head of the second trimmer is very small.  I should say it is convenient only for side-locks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m okay with the trim but I&#x27;m, a little, disappointed with the \\&quot;accuvac\\&quot;.  I would suggest this only for those who want to use it with the cap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because when he trims his goatee he manages to make a really big mess.  This trimmer with the vaccum is wonderful, it really does suck the hairs into the built-in container.  It&#x27;s simple to clean, little maintenance, no need to use oil for the blades and there&#x27;s no mess left behind for me to clean up!</li>
    <li> The beard/moustache trimmer and its edging attachment work well, but don&#x27;t count on the vacuum to pick up the hairs.  Most of the hair still ends up in the sink and on the counter.  It&#x27;s a good idea, but Norelco should re-design the vacuum feature.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t fully endorse this product.  It works well enough as a beard clipper although it is pretty big for its intended purpose; almost as large as a full size barber shear.  I thought my wife would appreciate the mess reduction but the anemic vacuum collects only about half of the beard clippings.  The course nature of beards really makes this impossible without a shear that connects to your shop vac.  It is kind of flimsey too.  I haven&#x27;t dropped mine but I doubt is would survive a single blow to the cutting head.  My advice....look for the smallest, cheapest beard trimmer and use it in the bath tub or outdoors.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 9 months ago and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. it is a good trimmer and the two attachments come in very handy. Although the vacuum collects some of the trimmed hair, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be much different from trimmers without the facility. I am still having to wipe out the sink and everywhere near where i trim.</li>
    <li> After a brief search for a beard trimmer, I chose the Norelco based on product reputation and model features.  This trimmer does a decent job and has some nice features.  What ruined it for me (literally) was the difficulty removing and re-inserting the trimmer adjuster.  I had to tug and cajole to take it off and had even a worse time putting it back on (which relies on an exact line-up of the plastic tabs).  The thing finally broke and I pitched the trimmer in disgust.    I next bought a Remington model 200 trimmer which is much simpler to use and up this point have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> T970 is miles away from its predecessor(s) (I also own a T7500 Deluxe) as far as the feature set goes. It boasts a charge level indicator, incorporated vacuum, and fast 15-minute charging time. However, I don&#x27;t know what was in the mind of the industrial designers who came up with this latest installment from Norelco/Philips other than capitalize on the truck craze that&#x27;s taken such a powerful hold on us. Indeed, I wish all those miles were for the right reason. Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I view the newly added vacuum function adding only marginal benefit to this unit, at the expense of draining battery power fast, noise making, and increased diameter size. With T7500, all one had to do was to charge the trimmer every other 15th use or so, and undo a couple of things to clean it after each use. Also, T7500 was smaller, it fit well in your hand and/or travel pouch, and could be charged at 110V-240V. Now, T970 requires a recharge every 3rd use or so, and it&#x27;s so much harder to fit in you hand and/or in your travel bag since it has a larger diameter and comes with a power adaptor that works only at 110V. Cleaning T970 is akin to undoing a Matrioshka, the Russian nesting doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking more about it, I came to the conclusion that T970 wasn&#x27;t put together by industrial designers but some marketing types... For these guys I would venture to suggest that they should keep T7500 on the market; it would serve very well the traveller types, whereas its successor would be for stay-at-home folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering it sells at a discount and it comes with a 60-day return period, I am able to rate it cautiously at 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this trimmer to replace a dead Panasonic trimmer. I used that trimmer both for my beard and for clipping my head hair down to very short size once every couple of months. The panasonic worked very well for both purposes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Norelco is a great beard trimmer and the vac part is quite nice in that it makes much less of a mess. However, it is a horrible trimmer for thick head hair like mine. I know that that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for, but just in case someone is looking for a trimmer for the same purpose: don&#x27;t buy this one. The head hair accumulates in the vac part and in front of the blade, making you empty it almost every stroke. Once full of hair, the trimmer does next to nothing until you empty it, and then is only good for another 1 stroke. The motor also easily gets overloaded in thick hair and stops. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Again - fine beard trimmer, but do not use for head hair. I&#x27;ll be buying the updated Panasonic model again to replace this one for that purpose.</li>
    <li> While the concept of the built in comb is a good one, this design just does not work well and don&#x27;t count on the vacuum catching all your clippings because it can only hold about half the volume of a shot glass. I ended throwing mine away and switching back to my old Oster hair clippers with the snap on combs for my head and bought a small rechargeable Waring beard trimmer. The twist dial for the comb length on this unit can be wrong - I gouged my beard/sideburns once with this unit. The comb unit must be removed for frequent cleaning and putting it back on correctly takes a delicate touch. The large size of the unit and comb also makes it verr difficult to trim your moustache close to your nose. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The trimmer functions really well. The trim setting and the head are not problematic. Though my beard is long and I use the machine minimally, it is nonetheless effective. The blades need to be clear of large hair to be most effective. It is not difficult to maintain. It needs to be thourghly cleaned at every use. And if trimming alot, once inbetween each use. Though it is light, compact and the battery last long for trimming, if you are looking to trim the beard at a set length all the way around, you may find this trimmer deficient. But if it is for touch ups, then its all good. The vaccum is at 80% efficiency.     Overall pretty good.</li>
    <li> This product does not allow you to get close enough to keep your beard or mustache closely trimmed.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works just fine as a trimmer, but any suggestion that you won&#x27;t have a major clean-up job afterwards is just wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;vac\\&quot; part of the \\&quot;accu-vac\\&quot; is a complete farce.</li>
    <li> Design was horrible.  Vac requires something inside to spin, if you squeeze the handle (even slightly) that plastic bit bound up and wouldn&#x27;t spin causing the trimmer to stop.  Even when handled VERY carefully, the vac didn&#x27;t do anything worth while.  Yes, it might of sucked in a bit... but it missed a lot, you still had to clean up.  I ended up sending mine back for a refund, it was a total waste of money.  Got a adjustable panasonic (without any \\&quot;vac\\&quot;) and am happy.</li>
    <li> After using a Norelco trimmer without a vacuum, I purchased the T970 in October 2004.  The trimmer performs well and captures all but a few hairs in its reservoir. It is exceptionally easy to clean and to change from the beard to mustache trimmers.  I do agree with other reviewers that battery life could be better and the dc converter is fairly heavy for travel (these are minor flaws.) Overall, it does a great job on my full beard in a very short time</li>
    <li> I was changing the dial setting, and I guess I switched the settings too hard, because it broke.  Now the dial moves, but  the actual setting of the blade doesn&#x27;t, it just stays the same.       I think the dial wasn&#x27;t built to withstand a perhaps slightly harder than usual turn.  I&#x27;ve had other shavers for years and didn&#x27;t break their dials.      So, if for some reason you still decide to get this trimmer, be careful with the settings dial.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for six months now, and I waited to review it until I had used it for some time.  I read many of the reviews before making my purchase and don&#x27;t understand the problems some of the reviewers had encountered.  Does it catch all of the trimmings? No.  But it does catch about 75 to 80% of them.  The others don&#x27;t catch any of it.  The one hour charge time is very nice, but I find I get about 3 trims per charge on my full beard.  It could be a little sturdier, but as long as you handle it with reasonable care you won&#x27;t have any problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think its the best trimmer I have ever had, and recommend it to anyone with a beard to trim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brad</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer that stated that this clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming. The zoom dial adjusts by itself even with the slightest pressure while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired. It needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you hold it.  The vaccum function is so-so, I could live without it.  Noise level is unusually high, but that&#x27;s least of my concerns. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have a rough, grey beard.  I have tried many types of trimmers.  Most do not stay sharp enuff, and run out quickly.  This one is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G-R-R-R-R-R-reat!</li>
    <li> I never had a beard before (I&#x27;m 75) so I wanted a trimmer that would let me control the length and shape of my facial hair. I checked reviews of the Philips Norelco T970 trimmer and they were very good, but not uniformly excellent. My experience has been that the trimmer was underrated - it&#x27;s outstanding in every sense - does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well, has easy and useful controls and is no noisier than an electric shaver. I&#x27;m delighted with it!</li>
    <li> The blades cut nice, but battery life could be better.  The vacuum does actually work well, I was surprised.  However the curved long design at the end makes an even shave under the nose impossible.  Hair directly under the nose is noticably longer than at the lip.  Frustrating!</li>
    <li> For the past 14 years I have sported either a full beard or a goatee.  During that entire time, I have ALWAYS bought a NORELCO trimmer.  Two months ago I replaced my old Norelco which lasted four years, and bouth this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I do like the vacuum, the old models had a push out mini blade for the delicate work.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  None of my older Norelco&#x27;s ever slipped from their length setting.  This one does, and when it does, it makes me look like I have mowed my face with a weedeater.  Furthermore, the self adjusting comb never allows my mustache to come out right.  There are always longer hairs towards the top of the mustache that I have to carefully try to cut by taking the brush off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have followed the instructions very carefully and made sure not to over or undercharge the battery, but innevitably towards the end of my trim, the blades get a little sluggish.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is not a model to buy.  Stay away from this model.  Although I believe in Norelco, I will not buy one with this adjustable comb, and unfortunately it seems that they have put them on all their models.  Until newer models come out that don&#x27;t have them, I&#x27;ll have to switch brands.  Sorry Norelco!</li>
    <li> I really think Norelco makes the best Trimmers in the world. &lt;br /&gt;I have tried many others and paid good money for it, always came back running to Norelco. &lt;br /&gt;This model has all the options you might want, I love the vaciom option on it where is sucks thecut hait in a samll contaner, this way you make a lot less miss than the earler models. It has a battery indecator, which is very imprtant, I can&#x27;t remember how many times I ran out of power and I have only tremed half of my beard!!!! This one gives you a heads up, and even if you forgot, you can use it with AC power, love that. &lt;br /&gt;Till you the truth, I can&#x27;t think of more options I would add to this machine.</li>
    <li> As my title says this trimmer is the keystone cops of beard trimmers. The people who call this trimmer good must have peach fuzz for beards. The vacuum is a waste of money, it keeps getting clogged so you have to take it apart two or three times during trimming to keep it working. DON&#x27;T take apart the vacuum too much to clean as the spring inside is loose and it ended up in the trap of my sink. And finally forget the settings. I start off with a three setting for example and notice some of my beard is shorter than other parts and look at the settings and somehow the thing has slipped to #2. So then you do a 2 only to find out it has slipped again to 1. If you want a laugh buy this thing but if you want a trim dont buy it. Where is my old definition sixty which was battery operated but was better than this. Go back to the drawing board and do away with all the gadgetry and come out with something that trims beards properly and maintains the settings. Is that too much to ask??</li>
    <li> I had an older Norelco 7500 which I loved, but it died on me.  I went on a search for a new one and came across this one.  I debated the T770 and the T970. I decided that for a few more dollars, the fast charge time would probably come in handy.  The length a charge lasts is GREAT!  The trimmer itself is decent... BUT the vacuum feature leaves a lot to be desired and still leaves you a sink to clean up.  The old 7500 had a fine trimmer built in.... the T970 has an attachment you have to put on before you use it.  The T970 is probably about 20% larger also...  It is effective and does the job, but I think Norelco took a step back here.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month. works good in all areas except under the nose. As the other review put it, you can notice the hair longer there than everywhere else. The vacumn action works well better than without that&#x27;s for sure.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only solution for under the nose shaving is to remove the clip and use a comb?  Just takes extra time and caution not to shave it all off.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought a T800 quite a few years ago when I found the Austrian-made unit on sale at the local Target store. It lasted very well, and I was somewhat disappointed when the battery eventually would no longer accept a charge, though it continued to work while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;After carefully looking into alternatives, I went with a T970 from Amazon.com, hoping for the same quality. Major letdown! This Chinese-made unit just is not up to the same standard as my T800. The charger is a seperate seperate and bulky transformer, instead of the simple cord of the T800. The T970 is larger, more awkward to hold and to use, and more fragile in every possible way. The vacuum, which was one of the initial attractions, works, but only marginally well, and the unit is unstable when laid down on a solid surface. If the mile-long charging cord is attached, expect to have to prop the unit against a wall to prevent it rolling over.&lt;br /&gt;I spent $6.00 on a top-quality replacement cell for my T800 (shipping was $4.00, for a 700mA Sanyo AA), and after careful disassembly and reassembly, successfully replaced the ailing cell without breaking anything. Unbelievably, The T800 now outlasts the T970 two-fold.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d stuck it out with the T800 in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Updated June 29, 2009.&lt;br /&gt;After about two years of irregular use and the resulting regular complete self-discharges, the T970 stopped functioning even while plugged in, unless first given time to recharge. Initial time to start working after plugging in has increased to the point where it no longer works even being plugged in for 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I understand that there are differing opinions on this trimmer, but after using it back to back with the Remington Precision Pro MB-400 Titanium Vaccuum Mustache and Beard Trimmer, there is no comparison on the following counts: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1)  quality of the trimming accessories - the Norelco has a flimsy cutting guide, and its all on the verge of breaking everytime you use it.  Anyone who has had a previous Norelco product points this out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2)  a ridiculously designed sideburn trimmer - It is so hard to get the trimmer set-up!  a poor design &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3)  A terrible cut - if you have even a medium beard, the trimmer is very uneven. you can certainly do better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The items above are enough to walk away from this device.  The reviews that critique the vaccuum are probably being unrealistic.  It is in part Norelco&#x27;s fault - they set you up to expect more from the vaccuum than you get.  But simple physics will tell you it is going to miss a lot of hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was such a bad experience, I had to review it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Remington is superior in every way.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Beard Trimmers I have ever owned.  It has given me one of the most even trims I have ever had.  I am wearing my Beard longer now, and the Number 9 setting is perfect!  I can wear a longer beard now, and yet keep it looking neat and trim.  The vacume system works very well, and catches tons of hair that might go down my drain.  The charge system keeps a charge longer than I expected; I&#x27;m able to trim my beard three times before a recharge.  I like the fact you can use it cordless, or if the power goes down and you don&#x27;t have time to recharge, with the cord.  It looks great, is not too loud sounding, and feels great in your hand.  I like the Trimmer Attachment that comes only with the T970, for trimming my chin line, and edging around my mouth.  Makes nice clean cuts.  All in all, can&#x27;t find anything about this trimmer that I DON&#x27;t like!  Give this baby a spin, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Prior Norelco products have been far better.  The problem is in the guide comb attachment.  It is NOT stable.  It chances the setting with even moderate pressure while trimming is occurring.  Other trimmers have not done this.  Overall, a useless product.  I sent my back.  Norelco - you have to do better than this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of beard trimmers over the years.  This one is as good as I&#x27;ve experienced.  I bought this one for my father who is in his eighties.  The various height adjustments are excellent for creative trimming.  The only problem with this unit is a battery with apparent memory.  The instructions offer all the cautions about how and when to recharge.  Failure to abide by the instructions may shorten the battery life or cause it not to recharge...hard to explain to old folks.</li>
    <li> potental durability seems the only question-  the product does exactly as described;  wish it had NiH battery, though</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer. The vacuum feature is ok, although not strong enough to collect all the hairs, but still an advantage.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington cordless trim vac and then this one. I returned the Reminton, and saved $15.00 There was no comparison when it came to almost every categery. The ONLY feature I preferred on the Remington was the 1 handed length adjuster, but the Norelco&#x27;s works very well except you need both hands to adjust it. Other than that, this trimmer very precisely and effortlessly trims my beard,sideburns and neckline to perfection. Very few hairs escape the vacuum. It&#x27;s a bit noisy but smooth. Overall it&#x27;s the best of its kind in a new design that&#x27;s very cool.</li>
    <li> This will be my last purchase of a Norelco product.  I wanted to give it zero stars but this wasn&#x27;t an option.  This moustache trimmer was designed by morons.  The Three Stooges could have done better.  Even the packaging is absurd.  To be more specific I list the following: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  Getting through the blister packing was extremely difficult;  I am 6&#x27;4\\&quot;, 230 lbs, lift weights and still had to use a sharp knife.  Fort Knox would have been easier to break into. &lt;br /&gt;2.  The instructions are terrible and the print is tiny. &lt;br /&gt;3.  The parts of the trimmer did not fit properly together. &lt;br /&gt;4.  When I tried to make adjustments to the trimmer setting the entire top assembly came flying apart and were not easily reassembled. &lt;br /&gt;5.  The lowest setting really should be shorter. &lt;br /&gt;6.  The rechargeable battery can not be replaced.  (This is actually a blessing in disguise since I will have to throw the entire trimmer away in a relatively short period of time) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I could go on but this device isn&#x27;t worth my time or money or yours either. Buy a cheaper trimmer from Wahl or someone else or just use a scissors.  This Norelco is a piece of you know what.  It really sucks.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair and goatee very short and I have been trimming my own hair for 10 years.  I am not an expert on hair trimming products but during the past 10 years I have used Wahl, Oster, Conair corded trimmers.  I have also used Braun and Norelco cordless shavers.  I purchased this product because I was looking for a product that could trim my goatee and serve as a travel trimmer for my hair.  Although I intended to order it from Amazon, I needed it more immediately and therefore purchased the T970 from a Target retail store for $39.99 (on sale). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I normally do not write reviews but I was surprised at the disparity of reviews for this product.  Most people either loved it or hated it.  I also became skeptical of some extreme reviews (positive and negative) when I saw the same exact reviews found at places such as Target.com.  I hope the following will be helpful to others: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend visiting a store (e.g., Target) such as I did to see the competing products from Walh and Remington.  Both offer vacuum trimmers that are priced a little less than this product.  In the store, I confirmed my initial decision to buy the Norelco T970 because of the smaller form factor, the 2 year warranty and the no-hassle, 60 day money back guarantee from Norelco (used or not). &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a cleaning brush, travel bag, thorough instruction pamphlet and heavy (though compact) AC wall adapter.  The unit is reasonably well constructed.  It is likely the lightest trimmer or cordless razor out of any I have used.  The hair trimmings compartment is easy to remove but did not fall out during usage.  The dial to adjust the trim length is easy to use (but does take two hands to turn).  It has 9 settings and #1 is the shortest.  The guard does come off for close-up trimming but did not come off unintentionally during usage.  I charged the unit until the top (of five) LEDs began to blink fast to indicate it was finished charging.  This took 55 minutes.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I turned on the unit and was ready to begin.  It is definitely the loudest trimmer I have used secondary to the vacuum component.  It is probably has about 1.5x to 2x the noise of my current Oster or Conair corded trimmers.  I doubt this will matter to most people.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the precision of the device.  It can cut your facial hair and hair on your head very short and even.  I typically use the \\&quot;blending\\&quot; guard on the Conair trimmer for my goatee.  The #3 setting on this device left my hair about the same length.  The #1 setting is extremely tight and will give you a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  I used the #4 setting on the rest of my head without difficulty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vacuum component was definitely not perfect and I needed to take the guard off once to unplug the opening of the vacuum with hair trimmings.  However, the vacuum compartment did get about 75%-85% of the trimmings.  You will still need to wipe the sink (and take a shower if you are doing your entire head) but clean-up is easier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Summary: &lt;br /&gt;The advantages of this unit: &lt;br /&gt;-60 day money back guarantee (used or not) from Norelco &lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight and decent design &lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use and very precise trimming &lt;br /&gt;-Ability to use corded or cordless &lt;br /&gt;-Quick charging time of about 1 hour for 40 minutes of use &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The disadvantages of this unit: &lt;br /&gt;-Ni-Cad battery (therefore battery \\&quot;memory\\&quot; and shortened battery life if you forget and leave it plugged in or use the cord while trimming) &lt;br /&gt;-The battery is not replaceable &lt;br /&gt;-Relatively noisy compared to other corded trimmers and cordless razors &lt;br /&gt;-No stand or hard case (it does not rest well on a flat surface) &lt;br /&gt;-The vacuum feature does not mean you can stop cleaning the sink.  It just means clean up time will be shorter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The VERDICT:  For $39.99, I am satisfied with this unit.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I would probably recommend this device tothose that need a good, all-around device for trimming their mustache, beard, goatee in addition to something that can pull double-duty and cut short hair (on your head).   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco products for over 15 years (still have my first 700Series electric razor) and I never thought they could get something so wrong.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read every review I could find on this product and found some pretty mixed comments. Throwing caution to the wind, I made the leap. Today, I returned the unit for a full refund (glad they still have that 60 day satisfaction guarantee). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those who have written about the Accu-Vac&#x27;s shoddy construction and cheap feel are absolutely right. In fact, mine literally fell apart in my hand (and into the sink) on only my second use.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;ll find another Norelco beard trimmer that WILL work and feel better. They&#x27;re still the best and you can&#x27;t beat their guarantee or value. They just got this one wrong.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stay clear of this one. Purchase a simpler unit. One that ISN&#x27;T rechargeable or has a (useless) vacuum or too many adjustable and removable pieces. You&#x27;ll be a lot happier.</li>
    <li> The product seemed to work well -- the vaccum feature worked as advertised, and I was pleased.  But, as other reviewers complained, it was very difficult to place the guide back on the unit.  Within a week, I managed to break the unit where the guide could not be adjusted anymore.  After returning the unit, the 2nd trimmer I received worked fine, but was much much louder than the first.  Something must have been wrong with the motor because when I pressed it to my face, the motor would slow down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Wahl vaccum trimmer instead and have been much happier (plus I saved $10).</li>
    <li> Well, so far this electric triimer is everything they said it would be, It trims great, the vac really works ( you have to check the vac container now and then and empty it, depndes on how haory you are.  If you want more storage capacity due to wooly mammoth syndrome, get a hoover or trim more often); it is easy to use (unless your gadget handicapped), it charges fast and lasts a long time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that it does not have a charging stand, you have to use the cable and set it some place where still on its side, therefore it can roll over, fall, maybe the cable might get  slighty yanked.  It hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet, but if it is round it can roll, and if it can roll it can wander and fall.  So, this is the only disadvantage I find it to have and quite frankle, Norelco shoudl consider including the stand; I mean como on guys, if its on a stand, then the machine will be out in exhibition so others can see it and use it, it is easier easy to access, vs. being hidden away in a bag.  It&#x27;s free advertsinig NORELCO, so don&#x27;t go jacking up the price if you do so or we&#x27;ll have to reconsider changing brands.  Ever heard of consumer awareness and free will of choice for best buy?  We are getting smarter not dumber. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The rest will be the stress test and for that, time can only tell.   But, so far, so good...  Let&#x27;s hope that battery has a good life span.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer has a ring to select the length of hair, but while shaving the selection keeps going lower and lower!  &lt;br /&gt;This device is not reliable enough.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my short beard.  I don&#x27;t think it would do a great job on a long one, though.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises.  The vacuum feature gets most of the whiskers, the trim is very even, and unlike some other people, I haven&#x27;t had a problem trimming my mustache - it might be that for some people&#x27;s faces and noses, it&#x27;s more of an issue, for me it&#x27;s not.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming.  My main complaint is that is has 7 settings to choose from but the settings are adjustable by a dial ring on the handle and it is easy to set the trimmer on one setting but have it slip to another setting while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired.  This trimmer needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you grip it.</li>
    <li> The T970 from NORELCO is the sorriest trimmer i ever ran across. &lt;br /&gt;The writeup of this product gets one to think that this is a real great product, but it turns out to be a \\&quot;dog\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;When I turned it on, after charging the battery, I thought the thing would fall appart in my hands.  It does not hold a charge and all around is not what I expected for NORELCO to put on the market.                   &lt;br /&gt; recommed not to purchase this thing.</li>
    <li> The vacuum does work, it just doesn&#x27;t work perfectly, but at least 90% of hair is caught by vacuum. My trimmer holds a charge good for five or six uses...definitely worth the money in my mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the T6000 (the original trimmer) for 5 years and loved it until the battery crocked.  I&#x27;ve been using it on the wire since, but then decided to upgrade.  My first reaction about the T970: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BAD: &lt;br /&gt;* Plastic is VERY flimsy - it doesn&#x27;t have that tough look. &lt;br /&gt;* Lots of movable parts, which have very flimsy plastic hinges (I think I&#x27;ll break them soon) &lt;br /&gt;* Not as compact as the original T6000 (Nape trimmer doesn&#x27;t extend from inside but is rather a separate attachment) &lt;br /&gt;* AcuVac is junk - it doesn&#x27;t catch all the hairs but most of them. (The trimmer is very loud because of the AcuVac.) &lt;br /&gt;* The little brush needs to be longer - it doesn&#x27;t reach some of the parts where hairs stick, like the AcuVac containers bottom leaving me having to blow the hairs out - which land literally all over the place making me wonder why I bothered with the AcuVac in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;* Travel case needs to be more compact a made of tougher nilon, the charger alone is HUGE! T6000 had compartments for the Brush and the wire, snugly fitting together.  I&#x27;m afraid the pivoting head on the T790 will break off the first time I put the trimmer into my travel bag. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;GOOD &lt;br /&gt;* The pivoting head actually helps in raising hairs to get a more even shave, leaving hair softer (a feature I&#x27;ve lived without for 5 years, and think can go without a little further) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Charge Indicator is pretty cool. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it is the most expensive trimmer on the market, thinking PRICE&#x3D;QUALITY, boy was I wrong, but with Amazon&#x27;s special @ $43+change my girlfriend will have something to use to trim her poodle.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD A BEARD SINCE 1967 AND AM FIFTY EIGHT YEARS OLD.I&#x27;VE HAD TRIMMERS SINCE THEY WERE INVENTED. I STICK WITH NORELCO NOT BECAUSE THEY&#x27;RE THE CHEEPEST, BUT BECAUSE I&#x27;VE BEEN SATISFIED. I HAVE THE T3OOO, BUT WANTED TO UPGRADE. GOT THE NEW T970 BECAUSE IT&#x27;S CORD/CORDLESS,AS IS THE T-3000 AND IT ALWAYS WORKS EVEN WHEN THE BATTERY IS DOWN. SOMEONE MAY MAKE A TRIMMER AS GOOD, BUT NOBODY MAKES ONE BETTER. THAT&#x27;S MY STORY AND I&#x27;M STICKING TO IT. THANX NORELCO.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. GW HUGHES</li>
    <li> The battery last longer than the previous version of Norelco trimmer and it tells you when the battery is about to finish. It is very fast cutting/trimming the beard and mustache. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PLASTIC CASING CRACKED.  WHEN I SHAVE THE BEARD GUARD CAN SHIFT AND CUT OFF PART OF MY BEARD. SOMETHING IN THIS PRICE RANGE SHOULD BE MADE MUCH STURDIER,</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Norelco beard trimmer, and although I am very satisfied with the vacuum, the lack of an easily accessible small trimmer is very disappointing.  If I want to trim above my lip, I have to take off the guard, and blade unit and replace with another.  Pretty sad compared to the pop up under lip trimmer in models past.</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer, and would give it 3-1/2 stars. It cuts nicely and is relatively quiet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the vacuum works poorly, and is not a worthwhile feature. It captures a little more than half of the trimmings. So you not only have to clean up the bathroom counter, but also empty the vacuum receptacle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old Remington, it is an improvement. It has a rotary motor which is much quieter than the Remington&#x27;s reciprocating motor. It cuts easier and holds its length setting better. However, the Remington&#x27;s pop-up mustache trimmer was more convenient, because this trimmer requires changing out the cutting head to convert to mustache mode. But since you have to brush out the area under the cutting heads anyway, I guess that&#x27;s not a big minus.</li>
    <li> Although the vacuum wasnt that great, it did its job well - but only while it lasted. The trimmer stopped working after only 10 months of service. Unacceptable!</li>
    <li> I liked the accuvac in the beginning; the hair reservoir is quite functional, even if it doesn&#x27;t catch everything. I would have given the accuvac 4 stars were it not for the deafening noise it has started to emit after not even 1 year&#x27;s use. It is a high-pitched screeching sound of exactly the kind you want to avoid at 6.30 AM, which is unfortunately the time I most often shave or trim. It may have been bad luck, but next time I am getting a Braun or a Philips.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. It seems a bit underpowered, maybe because the vacuum is sucking up some juice. The vacuum sucks up about 1/2 of the cut hair, so there is still some cleaning to do. Overall, i think it&#x27;s an ok buy.</li>
    <li> Without a question the best trimmer made. People talk about flimsy plastic and many parts. Who are they kidding. The plastic is of the highest quality and there are three parts to the whole trimmer. The vacuum compartment, The blades and the comb. How many less do you want. All the parts are very easy to remove and clean. I love the fast one hour recharge time for 40 minutes of cordless operation. The indicator lights are very easy to read and as far as the depth setting goes, it is the best. Not easily bumped out of place like some others. You turn the ring and it stays put. Obviously you need two hands for that. How can you complain about that? As far as noise. It is very quiet compared to others and the sound that it does make is lower frequency which is much more pleasing. Sort of like a big smooth V-8 not the 4 cylinder sound in other shavers. Another thing I love about this trimmer is the great warranty that it comes with and the fact that it is Made in Austria not China like the others. I actually got this Trimmer as a warranty exchange, I used to have the T-7500 Which was a much cheaper trimmer. Finally after almost two years the batteries died and Norelco replaced it free of charge with this brand new top of the line model. I didn&#x27;t even pay for shipping to Norelco or back. BTW the customer service rep who was handling the warranty service was extremely nice too. These days you don&#x27;t even get to speak to live person that often much less expect them to be nice. Can you say that about others. I doubt it. I would rate this trimmer 6 stars if I could because of the customer service and total satisfaction I received from Norelco. This is just as important as having a great product which this certainly is.</li>
    <li> I have had a goatee since I was able to grow one more than twelve years ago.  So I&#x27;ve had a lot of trimmers.  I was always one to spend a very little money on trimmers, figuring that they don&#x27;t last for a long time anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this one was a gift, so I didn&#x27;t mind.  The Vac system catches about 2/3 of my hairs - the sink isn&#x27;t immaculate, but it&#x27;s a ton better than before.  It took me awhile to figure out how to use the precision attachment, but now I love it.  The number system for length of beard seems to correspond exactly with other Norelco products, so I was able to step up immediately. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery indicator is seriously cool.  It&#x27;s quieter than a hair dryer, which I use as the benchmark for bathroom noise-makers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s time for a new trimmer, this one is worth the price.</li>
    <li> When my (non-vacuuming) Norelco trimmer would no longer take a charge, I ordered this item, not too concerned over whether the vacuum was effective or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received was a poorly designed trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. To hold the trimmer, one must place one&#x27;s hands over the vacuum air exit slots, thus throttling the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The guard was so complex to attach and detach that it took 10 minutes each time to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The closeness settings don&#x27;t actually lock in, and tend to \\&quot;wander\\&quot; toward (1), the closest setting.  And so I would find myself completing my trim with 3/4\\&quot; length hair on one side of my face, graduating to stubble on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally threw the thing in the garbage after a week and bought a leftover non-vacuum Norelco model like the one I previously had - $19.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you see some poor soul walking down the street with long whiskers on one side of his face, and a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on the other, be kind.  He&#x27;s probably not dimented - just the victim of this \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well, just not as easy to handle as the models that don&#x27;t have a built-in vacuum.</li>
    <li> I have used beard trimmers for over a decade. Most of that time I have used Norelco trimmers. For me their current \\&quot;latest greatest\\&quot; is a mixed bag. The vacuum feature has helped bring matrimonial harmony to the bathroom. When used per the directions the vacuum does a nice job of scooping up errand beard trimmings (good but not perfect.) If reducing beard scraps from your sink is a priority it&#x27;s an excellent choice. It&#x27;s a chunk nosier than it&#x27;s non-vacuum predecessor. If you are looking for peace and quiet, I&#x27;d sharpen your scissors, or buy a trimmer without a vacuum. My only concern about the product is the increase 1/4 inch pace between the leading edge and the cutting blades that is caused by the addition of a vacuum. If you are looking for exact cuts, choose another trimmer and put a towel over your sink. All in, not bad, not great. I look forward to the evolution of vacuum models in the years ahead.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sharply yours, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jeff &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This does a good job at trimming.  The little vacuum bit collects most of the hair but if you&#x27;re trimming a thicker beard, empty the little cup fairly frequently (and, no, it will not get ALL the hair).  The settings adjust quite easily and there is a wide range of adjustment.  The springy blade guard takes some getting used to.  It is rather large so getting it around can be a bit challenging; keeping the blade tight against the face while moving it to catch all the beard bits.  I find that cutting with the growth does not trim much but cutting against the growth cuts more than expected; at the same setting.  Against the growth does a better job of trimming, I think. It cleans up quite nicely.  I find the battery does not last as long as I expected.  I have to charge about every other use (but the, those uses are spaced a bit apart so the battery may just wear while it&#x27;s idle).</li>
    <li> Well, even though this item had mixed reviews, I tried it anyway. While the trimmer does work, the promise of no mess with a built in vacuum that actually works is not what you get. The trimmer captures only a portion of the hair that is cut -- and not a particularly impressive portion at that. If you follow the instructions and start with the higher setting and work your way down, it does work better -- but even then, the trimmer only captures about 75% of the trimmings -- which of course results in the rest falling into the sink, onto your shirt, or onto whatever is below. It is possible that this trimmer works better for some types of beards than others, but for me, this is a throw away purchase (literally). Back to my old trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well, holds a charge well, and it follows the contours of your face well. I would give it 5 stars except for the vacuum part. The vacuum chamber is small and clogs up after about half a minute, and then the beard hair goes all over the sink as usual. Has to be cleaned and blown out frequently to work. However, it&#x27;s still the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am still very pleased with this shaver.  Does everything it promised.  My husband was surprized how powerful and accurate this trimmer turned out to be.  I was pleased with the fast service from Amazon! Worth every penny! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Over all this beard and moustache trimmer are great.  The Accu-Vac is a definite improvement over my previous Norelco beard and moustache trimmer.  I feel that compared to reviews I read before purchasing the Norelco T970, the Accu-Control settings are a little loose.  I enjoy my trimmer and like the added attachements.</li>
    <li> This Norelco is just what I expected and works like it should. The vacum could be better but then I am only using it for my beard and moustache once a week so I am pleased with it as if I used it more then it would be just fine. I like Nlrelco and I like that the battery can be replaced making it last much longer this time. I have used Norelco before and was very happy this is my first one with the vacum.</li>
    <li> Does what it does as advertised... does it catch every hair in the accu-vac? nope.. but it does get a vast majortiy which is far better than none. I use it to keep the \\&quot;stubble look\\&quot; and it does a fine job of it.</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer is great, relatively quiet, very easy to set a beard length, and holds a charge for at least five trims.  The moustache trimmer takes a little getting used to but does a great job also and the unit is easy to hold steady.  The vacuum only gets about 75% of the hairs but that&#x27;s still better than nothing and the only negative to report.  I travel a lot and it is nice to be able to just take it along without the charger knowing it will work like a charm for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> If you want a good trimmer that allows you to keep your beard at a length longer than stubble this is the one. Vacuum works reasonably well but, as my beards white, it&#x27;s hard to say how much hits the sink. All-in-all, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The clowns below do not know what they are talking about. This trimmer is awesome. So nice not to clean hair off me or the floor anymore. I have very short hair on top and use this on my head as well every other week, great trimmer.</li>
    <li> This popped up in my gold box, and I decided to give it a whirl since the idea of trimming my beard with no mess had a lot of appeal. The vacuum does half work.  Unfortunately, catching half the mess won&#x27;t change the need for clean-up--there&#x27;s less to clean, but you&#x27;ll still need to do it.  So my main recommendation is that you shouldn&#x27;t let the vacuum \\&quot;feature\\&quot; be your reason for buying this.  If anything, it&#x27;s a slight negative, because the opening for the vacuum gets in the way when you are doing edge trimming without the attachment.  The next down-side is the \\&quot;memory\\&quot; rechargeable batteries.  Basically, unless you let the batteries completely discharge before recharging, they will hold less and less charge each time.  This is mentioned in the folded up piece of paper that passes for a manual--you will want to read through that.  Which leads me to my final gripe:  That piece of paper is extremely poorly done--diagrams with no explaination, unclear instructions, etc.  So you do have to read it, but you&#x27;re going to spend some time trying to puzzle it out before you actually figure it out.  For all my complaining, the trimmer isn&#x27;t completely without merit.  It does do a decent job of trimming my beard, which is of course the main point of the thing.  I also didn&#x27;t have any real noise complaints, which seems to be an issue for other reviewers.  On balance though, my main recommendation would be don&#x27;t pay for the vacuum, because you won&#x27;t be getting what you paid for.</li>
    <li> This device has serious functional and aesthetic flaws.  On a functional level, the vacuum is virtually useless so that at least 2/3 of the hair winds up on the counter or in the sink.  I could have stayed with my non-vacuum trimmer!  Also, the blades clog and everything comes apart to clean with a flimsy, I hope I don&#x27;t break this, kind of plasticity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On an aesthetic level, this is very noisy and the noise is extremely unpleasant, sort of a sick screeching sound that I do not associate with quality.  As soon as I turn it on, I want to turn it off as soon as possible.  This just does not feel like a quality product.  It is within a hair of it being worth the trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> I have been trimming my beard for over 25 years, and this is a great trimmer.  I don&#x27;t understand the complaints.  If you gave some people $1,000 worth of silver, they would complain and wonder why you didn&#x27;t give them $1,000 worth of gold.  I have no complaints about this trimmer.  Look at some of the complaints of others.  Some said it didn&#x27;t vacuum ALL the hair, and some said only 1% of the hair.  I would have to say that has to be \\&quot;operator error\\&quot; because I have very little or NO hair left when I trim.  My wife is extremely happy with the clean sink.  Another reviewer said it was \\&quot;noisy\\&quot;....compared to what?  It was not as loud as a hair dryer, and what did the reviewer expect - a completely silent vacuum?  I mean, a clothes dryer is louder than a clothes-line, but I doubt many people would prefer going back to the days of hanging their clothes out to dry.  Someone complained that it took two hands to turn the dial to the beard length position you wanted.  Let&#x27;s see, you hold the trimmer with one hand, turn the dial with the other....hmmmmmmm.  Actually, I consider that a strength, because I have had trimmers that have accidentally slipped into another position and messed up my beard.  Someone else actually complained that they couldn&#x27;t open the package it came in with their bare hands....well, I have a pair of scissors at my house.  I didn&#x27;t know being able to open the package with your bare hands was a qualification of a good beard trimmer, but I could be wrong.  Well, I guess you get my drift.  The beard trimmer works great, the vacuum when used properly is great, and as I said before, it is the best trimmer I have ever used.  If you are looking for a really good beard trimmer that will be a lot easier to clean up after, I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer rules!  I will never have to hear the phrase &amp;quot;There&#x27;s hair in the sink!&amp;quot; from my wife ever again.  Sure, a couple of hairs may get by, but I can easily wrangle those, and it beats the heck out of holding the bathroom garbage can under my chin with one hand and trimming with the other.  Gentlemen, do yourselves a favor: drop your old trimmer off at the nearest GoodWill and get yourselves one of these.  Sorry to hear shake-man (below) had a rough time, but I think it may have been user error.  The only way the adjustment mechanism could be easier would be if I could will it to a different length with my mind...</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco T6000 (earlier model trimmer) that worked just fine but the rechargeable battery quit. So I bought this new one the T970 Accu-Vac and it is a case where nothing was wrong but they went ahead and fixed it anyway and not for the better. I ordered a replacement nicad battery for my old and as soon as it gets here, I&#x27;m going back to the old one. &lt;BR&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about the new one - &lt;BR&gt;1) the pivoting head, I&#x27;m about ready to glue it into place.&lt;BR&gt;2) The vacuum canister is fine unless you knock it out and now the hair is all over the sink. It falls out too easily.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never had a trimmer then this one might be just fine.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of use I can say that this trimmer does an excellent job and performs as well as advertised.  Some trimmings get missed by the vacuum collector, but it&#x27;s a small percentage of the total.  The charge last well and I&#x27;ve encounter no problems.</li>
    <li> The good: &lt;br /&gt;Catches most of the trimmings, greatly reducing sink cleanup effort. &lt;br /&gt;Very precise length adjustment. &lt;br /&gt;Clean cuts. (On my hair, your mileage may vary.) &lt;br /&gt;Convenient to use. Good ergonomics and I like the charge indicator. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bad: &lt;br /&gt;Slightly noisier than other electric trimmers, due to the vacuum. Overall the volume is not worse than the 8-year old trimmer it replaced though. &lt;br /&gt;The batteries are NiCd. I generally prefer NiMH for environmental reasons. &lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve got to be careful when you install the comb (say after cleaning) to make sure it goes on right.  &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t catch ALL the hair. (I know, this is nitpicking.)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco to maintain my stubble beard and it has maintained it perfectly. It is easy to clean and battery life is excellent so far.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;you have to keep a slower speed so the vacuum can grab all the little hairs but most of the time I just do it over the sink so I can perform my cut quicker.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eventually they could produce a stronger vacuum but then you will have a leaf blower by your ears.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Length adjustment is easy and the flexi-head allows for simplicity to getting an even cut while maintaing a strong quality feeling product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to another person to purchase. Excellent Investment.</li>
    <li> I find the trimmer works very well and is easy to use.  The only disadvantage (and it&#x27;s slight) is that you have to switch attachments when using the fine trimmer.  This is the first trimmer I have ever bought.  I was referred to Norelco by a neighbor who loved his (different model).  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> As an owner of the previous model without the vacuum, I was looking forward to this new purchase. Bah. This item is heavier, noisier and more inconvenient than its predecessor. And for practically no gain! This shaver catches maybe 10% of the clipped hair with the rest of it flying all over the sink.    Stay away from this model.    Update: I&#x27;ve owned Norelco trimmers in the past, however based on my experience with this particular model, my next trimmer will NOT be a Norelco. The fan which drives the vaccuum rattles against the plastic housing, making a hideous noice while I&#x27;m trimming. The vaccuum action is terrible; hairs don&#x27;t make it down into the receptacle, causing constant blockage. This in turn, scatters hair all over the place, worse than any conventional non-vac trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. (And no, my beard is not especially thick either.) I&#x27;ve finally had it with this model. I&#x27;m about to order a new trimmer on Amazon. No, it won&#x27;t be a Norelco.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at a local department store.  It has been a godsend.  No more hair in the bathroom sink.  No more hair going down the drain -- and clogging pipes.  Norelco got it right with this trimmer.  Thankfully, they included a rechargeable battery since the vacuum does use a lot of power.  No complaints about the length selector or noise.  My cordless tooth brush is almost as loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature is the included ear/nose hair trimmer.  It uses a narrow blade and just snaps onto the razor.  Very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a beard for over ten years now and tried a variety of trimmers.  The Norelco is a keeper.</li>
    <li> The only real shortcoming of this trimmer is the vacuum feature. Then again, you can&#x27;t expect a little vacuum like this to pull the hair from a month long growth. if you trim frequently according to your growth, you will get most of the clippings. I need to trim at least once a week. If I wait longer, i tend to have a larger mess to clean up. Otherwise, the only other complain I have is that you need to be careful with the way you hold the unit while you are trimming, or you can change the height adjustment....</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a trimmer that is easy to use as well as does a good job at trimming. The vacuum works just the way I would expect and helps in the trimming process. I will not use another trimmer again!</li>
    <li> Made cheaply and does not hold a charge for too long but it does work pretty well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a several-year old T-2000.  I found the 2000 very handy for use touching up my hair, sideburns, etc.  The T970 is totally unsuitable for this purpose.  The floating guard overhands the blade, unlike the 2000.  Removing the guard still leaves the vacuum inlet in the way of the blade.  The vacuum feature cannot be disabled and clogs the inlet with longer hairs with each pass, necessitating removing the hair before the next pass.      The T970 may work fine for beard and mustache trimming (it&#x27;s stated purpose), but is nearly useless for trimming hair.  Just be aware.    A plus is the battery charges much faster than the T-2000, although it uses a wall wart for power instead of a simple cord as on the 2000.  You can also use the 970 by simply plugging it in, rather than waiting for it to charge.  It&#x27;s also noisier and less powerful than the 2000.</li>
    <li> Excellent moustache/beard trimmer.  VERY easy to adjust and use.  It keeps its charge for a realistic amount of time.  The quality and performance are tops!</li>
    <li> Not great. The battery gave out after a short period of time. Go with a better more expensive brand. I do not have a mustach any longer(:</li>
    <li> This item worked okay for the first month.  I haven&#x27;t been able to get an even trim since using this product.  After that, the vac quit working and the blade guard split in three pieces. This is a total piece of junk!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco series for about 5 years now.  My original still works in fact.  I upgraded for new features, etc.  That&#x27;s why I bought this one (for the vacuum.)  Well, it does NOT trim as evenly as my previous model (as another viewer noted.)  It does make less mess (but still a bit if you&#x27;ve got some growth.)  It won&#x27;t run plugged in.  I have to charge it daily (before I can use it.)  It&#x27;s really really really loud and hurts my poor ears.  Unlike previous models, the internall AA NiCad battery is no longer accessible, so once it runs out of recharge life I guess they expect us to buy a whole new unit.  I&#x27;m really sad..........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about a week and I&#x27;m very happy so far.  I wanted to address 2 things that I was curious about before I made my purchase: &lt;br /&gt;  1)  This trimmer, while far from silent, is the quietest of the 3 that I&#x27;ve owned. &lt;br /&gt;  2)  The vacuum seems to get about 1/2 the hair so don&#x27;t expect it to eliminate all of the mess.  I think that it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to get 100% of the hair clippings, but I&#x27;m happy for whatever help I can get. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, I also really like the battery indicator and the adjusting blade guide.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this one.  It&#x27;s better than the last model and if you shave real slow, it will vacume most of the hairs.</li>
    <li> With the Power Cord provided you don&#x27;t have to worry about the shaver going out on you or losing power and start pulling your beard when its cutting. The Vaccum works great and takes in most of the hair. It feels comfortable on the skin when trimmin and is better than previous versions of Norelco&#x27;s Trimmers.  Worth the purchase as a first trimmer or upgrade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many beard trimmers and I must remark, this is the absolute best.  There are a wide variety of adjustment heights, which are perfect.  When trimming, the adjuster does NOT collapse, like some other models do.  Add to this the nice edging attachment, and I&#x27;ll say it again:  It&#x27;s perfect!  If you trim at a reasonable speed, the vacuum will catch most of the hair. For those who complain that their wife gets angry having to clean up residual hair???  Well, maybe the trimmer is not the real issue.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I am unable to review the product.  When I received the trimmer it was damaged.  Instead of contacting Amazon (my mistake)I called Norelco.  It is now four weeks and I still have not been able to resolve the problem.  After two weeks and three phone calls I received a pre-paid return label from Norelco.  I then shipped back the defective trimmer which they subsequently received. After two more weeks and two more calls I received a replacement.  Unfortunately they then sent the wrong item.  Instead of the beard trimmer they sent an electric razor.  I am, once again, waiting for the appropriate replacement.</li>
    <li> Having used several Norelco trimmers in the past I looked forward to using the top of the line T970. I am very disappointed after using it for six months. I have gone back to an earlier model while waiting for delivery of my Panasonic trimmer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works OK, it decreases the amount of clean up but certainly doesn&#x27;t elminate it, but the real problem involves the regular use of the device. If you have a beard and a moustache a requirement for this kind of device is that it be able to trim at various lengths and then be able to have the length comb removeable. I found the pieces very hard to disassemble/reassemble for use. It would take many tries to get the thing back together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then pieces started falling off the unit. The mechanism that changes the length is needlessly complicated and fell apart. I found the use of the trimmer frustrating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall this is about the poorest consumer electronic device I have ever owned. I have moved over to Panasonic trimmers since this experience was so frustrating.</li>
    <li> Overall the Trimmer is good but it is not designed keeping a traveler in mind!  First, the charger is quite big and very heavy.  Second, the charger is only for 110v electricity and will not work overseas without a stepdown converter.  Third, Philips could have provided a small box/carrying case to safely store the extra Mini-Trimmer.  Fourth, the soft carrying case will not protect the Trimmer from fall or heavy packing in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed it while it worked although I wouldn&#x27;t call it amazing.  After about 18 months it would not get thru 1 trim on a full charge. I took proper care of the battery.  My previous Norelco lasted 5 years!</li>
    <li> About six months after purchase, I&#x27;ve just finished ripping it open in order to remove the batteries and dispose of it responsibly.  But it was garbage even before it died.  It&#x27;s still under warranty, but I dislike it sufficiently that I won&#x27;t bother to try for a replacement.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The mechanism for setting the clip depth readjusts itself under even mild pressure - the only reason that it didn&#x27;t die of being thrown across the bathroom after removing half my mustache is that I don&#x27;t have that much energy in the morning.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vacuum compartment cover falls off frequently during use, which means in practice, it&#x27;s just saving all those little messes to make one big one the moment you drop your guard.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s large, heavy, awkward to use, and notably ugly - cosmetically over-designed, completely with little blinkie lights to pointlessly nag you about the status of its obsolete NiCAD battery.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a hormonally precocious eight-year-old or own an SUV, it&#x27;s sure to appeal.</li>
    <li> I owned an older model T850 and it was great.  Lost it.  Now I \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to this model and works the same except that it  builds up static and some of the hairs stick to the side of the unit.  So it will require a bit more cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about 6 years ago and have loved it from day one. Time was finally catching up on it though, the battery was pretty much useless. I came online to find one just like it. I do not like the style of any of the newer trimmers out there. I found one here and it works great. It&#x27;s only slightly different/updated from my original.    As far as the comments about the trimmer/guard not staying in position? I have not had this problem with either of the two that I have owned. Maybe they are just pressing WAY too hard.</li>
    <li> I received mine today, and the on/off button wouldn&#x27;t work.  The only way to get it to work was to squeeze and twist the base.  The only problem is that the beard adjustment has to be twisted, too.  You can probably guess what happened.  What was supposed to be a level 5 shave suddenly and irreparably became a level 2 &amp;quot;stubble mode&amp;quot; shave.  That just sucks.  I used Norelco&#x27;s live chat to complain and hopefully to get a little sympathy and apology.  What I got was a rep telling me that I need to read the manual from now on.  Thanks.  And thanks for the apology that finally came at the very end of the conversation.  I hope you didn&#x27;t sprain anything.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, instead of the vacuum system sucking the hair into the storage chamber, it blew it all over my shirt and the sink.  That was sweet, too.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s probably just a defective unit, but it still ruined my beard.  Actually, I ruined it, but its defectiveness should get most of the credit.  The end.</li>
    <li> This does little that it claims to. The vacuum is a joke. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. I&#x27;ve had mine a week, used it 1 and a half times. Now it&#x27;s going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco used to make a good product. I guess they&#x27;ve chosen volume over quality.</li>
    <li> I have had my beard trimmer for about a month now and am looking forward to getting rid of it anyday.  It is about as loud as a jet engine, doesnt clean up well at all.  I believe it does pick up hair, about 1/1000th of the hair that I am trimming.  The regular Norelco trimmers are much better.  The blade on my new trimmer always snags my hair and I have a shadow, not even a beard; also the power doesnt really seem to last much, it seems as though everytime I use it I have to recharge it.</li>
    <li> I  bought it several months ago and use it for a stubble look.  It works great.</li>
    <li> First time I tried to re-attach length guage after using trimmer, gauge broke.  Save yor money.</li>
    <li> After using this product for appox. 6 weeks, I am satisfied with the results. As noted in other reviews, some care must be taken to ensure the cutting guide is not accidently broken. The vaccum does a good job. It does not catch 100% of the hairs, but I would estimate that it catches at least 66%. It does take a little practice to find the best way to use the product, as everyone&#x27;s face is different and likes a different look.</li>
    <li> Here goes: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. The vac doesnt hold but a little bit, and if your beard hair is any longer than setting 6 it can only get clogged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. That said, its nothing but a useless, noisey bulge that makes trimming a pain... not just under the nose and with the moustache as some have pointed out, but everywhere. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. The settings, oh God the settings... the whole point of trimming your beard is to give it that clean, uniform look. If you&#x27;re looking to get that \\&quot;oh I haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days aren&#x27;t I chic look,\\&quot; this is your machine. If not, and you actually have a beard (and a thick one at that), the trimmer demands that you use a lot of force to attain an even cut; however, if you apply this force, the settings slide--and always down a notch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. The settings also react to the least bit of hand contact, so one has to be sure not to ever grab the machine too high up... but then even with this cautionary action, its likely to slip as described in tyrannous trimmer complaint #3. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5. Since you&#x27;re looking over these reviews, trying to decide \\&quot;is this for me and oh, is this for me?\\&quot; I&#x27;d hasard a guess that you do indeed wish your face to look nice and the hair on it to appear well kept. If so, you probably wish to use the sclupting function to keep clear of Giraldo moustaches, pirate beards and the like. Unfortunately the sculpting function does no better than setting 2.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There you have it. Instead of plopping down the money for gadgetry that fails everytime, go for the simpler model, the smaller one, the one with the stategically placed setting switch, that one that makes your sink look like its just seen a balding rat climb out of the drain and shake all its loose hair hither and thither--God knows youre gonna have to clean it anyhow. Parsimony, oh parsimony...</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance, based on the past good performance of an older Norelco trimmer.    The good news is that this trimmer works as well as the old Norelco and its small mustache trimmer attachment is much better than the one-size-fits-all blade of earlier models.    The charging and battery indicator systems are also very much improved.    The vacuum feature, which I did not expect to be perfect, is adequate, but as others have said, don&#x27;t buy just for that. It appears to catch more than half the mess, which is helpful.    My only complaint is the parts you need to work with every time you use the trimmer. The detachable comb/accu-trim guide is not flimsy per se, but the tracks it fits into are and it requires careful attention to align it properly to put it back on the trimmer. I fear that one of these days I may put it on outside the track and snap the plastic runners that go into the tracks.    The internal pieces of the cutter mechanisms -- main and mustache trimmer -- are downright flimsy. The first time I removed the main blade it felt like something snapped, but I couldn&#x27;t see anything wrong. When I put it back on after using the mustache trimmer, the device ran at about half RPM and sounded like it was straining. Sure enough, the force required to remove the main blade had resulted in its inner row of teeth coming out of the little track it runs in, back and forth, to cut hair, and I had to play jeweler as I squinted to carefully coax it back into place.    Not having owned any other brand, I don&#x27;t know if they cut any better -- I doubt it. But the older Norelco was less fragile.    I plan to keep this one, unless it breaks during the 60-day trial. If I could rate it at 3.5 stars I would.    UPDATE Feb. 21: nothing has broken; the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; parts are wearing in so they come apart much more easily and I am definitely going to keep this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco beard trimmer and it&#x27;s a huge disappointment. I&#x27;d send it back today if I could.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shoddy construction, imprecise cut, hard to assemble and reassemble. Other posters with negative comments are on target with this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would happily go back to one of their older products without all the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; junk in this model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Consider yourself warned.</li>
    <li> This item is an excellent product. Two basic functions of this trimmer drove my purchase decision. The first was the quick charge/re-charge feature. This trimmer will charge in one hour or less. This was very important to me. The other function was the quick adjustment feature. This trimmer adjusts to the nine different settings in seconds. I don&#x27;t have to keep track of several different trimming combs. There is only one comb with nine different settings. I used this to replace an older Norelco trimmer with the quick adjustment feature. I wasn&#x27;t going to buy any trimmer without this feature. This trimmer is comfortable, fast, and accurate. I have no negative things to report, only good.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great.  Vacuums hair well, not 100% but what does?  Good clean trimming.  But, this is only for short beards,  if you plan on growing a substantial beard, not the right trimmer.  it has different settings but they do not go very far so if you want a trimmer to keep a longer bear neat, look elsewhere.  if not, look no further.</li>
    <li> I really did like how it worked, the vacuum was probably not that useful, but it did a good job of trimming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I had was that after about a year of use, something burned out on it&#x27;s circuit board and it stopped charging the battery.  I popped the cover, unattached and re-attached the batteries, it worked fine (normal battery life time) for a couple charges and then reverted back to its broken way.  And while in its broken state, it would do nothing more than get real hot along w/the wall outlet converter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my trimmer for a year or so, and I love it. One of those frivolous little electronic gadgets that actually pulls its weight, because it saves having hair all over the bathroom. It holds a charge for weeks and stays sharp. My only wish is that it would be nice if I could adjust it to cut closer, but it cuts close enough and my girlfriend loves the results.</li>
    <li> this trimmer i own for more than 2.5 years..works as specified.. helps to cut down trimming + cleaning time.. does n&#x27;t mess up the place.. best value for money</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last. Vacuum was not engineered well</li>
