      <li>Amazing Products!Thank</li>
      <li>This would be an ideal gift for a guy who wasn&#x27;t into fragrance, or was taking the first step into the world of scent.</li>
      <li>It is very fresh smelling and lasts a good while.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping great price love it</li>
      <li>I was hoping it smelled more like gardenias but still like it.</li>
      <li>It should be called fragrance free, does not stay, does not even smell that nice.</li>
      <li>they love it..</li>
      <li>I get a smooth yet strong,soapy kind of smell from this.</li>
      <li>blending of gardenia, amber, musk and precious woods it masterly.</li>
      <li>My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean sent.</li>
      <li>This has a nice clean not overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>The huge bonus is that it lasts on the skin for 8-10 hours, and I am notorious for burning through scent.</li>
      <li>A great sillage and it last on my skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nearly as cheap as some imposter colognes.</li>
      <li>Very light, freshly showered, clean smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>MisterCrazyLegs over at Frgantica has been a kind of mentor and guide for me in the classics and this one is indeed a brilliant, romantic stellar classic.</li>
      <li>; it&#x27;s just a very fresh, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This EDT smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>my girlfriend thinks it is just OK, not I am going to tear your clothes off ready!</li>
      <li>I would not wear this for any special occasion though.</li>
      <li>A nice scent that&#x27;s not too loud and overpowering</li>
      <li>a good eight to ten hours.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clean, fresh aroma, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It is thee only thing i wear nothing on earth smells better than Nude PERIOD!</li>
      <li>i own 5 back up bottles</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the scent.</li>
      <li>I would describe this as a fresh out of the shower type of scent.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, go for classic version or Vip both by Bijan, they are great.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this stuff never fails to get women&#x27;s attention.</li>
      <li>the shower.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s exactly what it smells like to me.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this product from Amazon&#x27;s website September 10, 2010</li>
      <li>regular for men is more spicy and the black Bijan is more spicy still.</li>
      <li>But really, it&#x27;s great for anyone who wants something subtle, clean, and mysterious.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like all the Bijan EDTs I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He hasn&#x27;t said much.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>They price is far less than some of the very popular male fragrances.  </li>
      <li>It is the EXACT same product I paid 5 times more for in other places!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s somewhat summery, but definitely not limited to hot weather applications.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s subtle but definitely effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bijan Nude has an old Hollywood feel to it, like something Tyrone Power or Errol Flynn might wear.</li>
      <li>But after it settles into the skin, it blooms into something altogether more complex.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh scent and the shipping was as expected.</li>
      <li>This scent is a little secretive; when you apply it the immediate top note actually is a little soapy.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical ordering online, but the scent is exactly the same as the ones I purchased full retail from the malls.  </li>

    <li> This EDT smells very fresh and clean.  It smells like you just scrubbed down with soap and just got out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s exactly what it smells like to me.  Very light, freshly showered, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not spicy, woodsy, floral, &amp;#34;mysterious,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;adventuresome,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;romantic,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;dreamy,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s just a very fresh, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really like all the Bijan EDTs I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular for men is more spicy and the black Bijan is more spicy still.</li>
    <li> It is thee only thing i wear nothing on earth smells better than Nude PERIOD! i own 5 back up bottles lol...</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product from Amazon&#x27;s website September 10, 2010 and the seller was Marden&#x27;s Inc.  I used to have people following me asking the name of the cologne.  I was getting low and decided to purchase another bottle. This time the seller was Amazon.com LLC and it arrived today.  It smells like dishwashing liquid with alcohol.  The sad part...it cannot be returned.</li>
    <li> This has a nice clean not overpowering smell. I really like it. I think my husband likes it too. He hasn&#x27;t said much. Great for an all day cologne especially if you work around people it won&#x27;t overwhelm them or make them stand 20 feet away!</li>
    <li> The best!!! My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> A nice scent that&#x27;s not too loud and overpowering</li>
    <li> Bijan&#x27;s nude isn&#x27;t the best cologne out there but for the price it isn&#x27;t quite bad. I would describe this as a fresh out of the shower type of scent. I get a smooth yet strong,soapy kind of smell from this. It reminds me of Le male when it dries down. So for the price I would say why not buy this. I will probably be wearing this during the day on weekends when I go to the gym. I would not wear this for any special occasion though.</li>
    <li> Very good price and smells really good on my Husband. Even though it may not be his favorite, as Polo is his standby, he likes it very good as well.</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh aroma, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I like the fresh scent and the shipping was as expected. I don&#x27;t dislike the scent but it is subtle, doesn&#x27;t last as long on me as the regular Bijan did and my girlfriend thinks it is just OK, not I am going to tear your clothes off ready! Of course, every scent reacts differently with each persons individual chemistry so my experience may not reflect yours.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical ordering online, but the scent is exactly the same as the ones I purchased full retail from the malls.  Lasts just as long too.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for several years, and when I saw it at the price I paid - I was astonished! It is the EXACT same product I paid 5 times more for in other places!</li>
    <li> Good product for a great price. Not crazy about the scent. I was hoping it smelled more like gardenias but still like it.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping great price love it</li>
    <li> Gardinia at midnight in a Spanish garden somewhere in Spain, or on the back lot of MGM. This one is a STAR! It has personality and panache yet its charm in set firmly in its subtle aproach. MisterCrazyLegs over at Frgantica has been a kind of mentor and guide for me in the classics and this one is indeed a brilliant, romantic stellar classic. So I have to thank him for leading me to this one. It has proven to be a head turner and I the very best way. People, even those who profess to not be into scent ask me abut \\&quot;that incredible fragrance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blending of gardenia, amber, musk and precious woods it masterly. A great sillage and it last on my skin a good eight to ten hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bijan Nude has an old Hollywood feel to it, like something Tyrone Power or Errol Flynn might wear. It is noteworthy and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;Five solid platinum stars *****</li>
    <li> got for family member..they love it..and i loved the price</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It has a nice clean sent.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this cologne. It is very fresh smelling and lasts a good while. You can&#x27;t find it for a better deal than here! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It should be called fragrance free, does not stay, does not even smell that nice. Don&#x27;t waste your money, go for classic version or Vip both by Bijan, they are great.</li>
    <li> Great company great product,and a really good fragrance.</li>
    <li> Do people still say that? Anyway, this stuff never fails to get women&#x27;s attention. And I actually like the way it smells too. It&#x27;s subtle but definitely effective.They price is far less than some of the very popular male fragrances.  It&#x27;s nearly as cheap as some imposter colognes. You really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Amazing Products!Thank You</li>
    <li> This scent is a little secretive; when you apply it the immediate top note actually is a little soapy. A just-out-of-the-shower scent. But after it settles into the skin, it blooms into something altogether more complex. Still subtle, but layered with woody flowery powdery business that you could inhale five times and notice something different every time. It&#x27;s somewhat summery, but definitely not limited to hot weather applications. The huge bonus is that it lasts on the skin for 8-10 hours, and I am notorious for burning through scent. This would be an ideal gift for a guy who wasn&#x27;t into fragrance, or was taking the first step into the world of scent. But really, it&#x27;s great for anyone who wants something subtle, clean, and mysterious.</li>
