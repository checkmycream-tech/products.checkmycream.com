<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m giving it one star for this particular combo package.  I got suckered into buying this item thinking 2 4+2oz meant 2 4oz bottles and one 2oz bottle.  It meant one of each (total of 6 oz). Buying separately, you can get a 4 oz and a 2 oz much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday after shower.  My skin looks  amazing after 50!  Even my husband has started using it and he&#x27;s not one for products.</li>
    <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
    <li> this is great stuff!  works well on surgical scars.</li>
    <li> I just love bio oil. It has been great for the psoriasis dry spots on my elbows. Also use it on my face from time to time and just about anywhere to hydrate and help my skin. I was getting it at Costco and they have stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It used to be available at Costco, but now have to order it from the U.K.</li>
    <li> This works so well at hydrating your skin and helping to defy lines and wrinkles.  A little goes a LONG way.  Lasts me over a year, so it&#x27;s a great value. too.</li>
    <li> Bio-Oil works very well for me. I&#x27;ve used it for years. I have always purchased this exact same packaged set at Costco. But for some reason, Costco stopped carrying it and I had to resort to purchasing on Amazon.com. When I found this exact same packaged set, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue to purchase this. I was wrong. When I got my shipment, the bottles where loosely packaged in bubble wrap and not as seen in this photo. When I opened the boxes to check out the products, I&#x27;ve noticed that the color of the oil is a faint light orange color. The products have definitely been tampered with and diluted. The original bio-oil is suppose to be a rich orange colored oil, and not this light orange color. I am very disappointed about this purchase. I may have to buy my Bio-oil from Target or Walmart moving forward. Its a safer bet that you will get the real thing.</li>
    <li> I use this oil regularly for my face (which is hyper sensitive) and surgery scars.  Never had a bad experience after 3+ years using the product.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I  love it and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a week but I can already feel a change, really love it only negative is I believe that it was gonna be 2 tall bottles, but it was only 1 tall &amp; 1 short... But still work good</li>
    <li> I use bio oil all over daily!  It makes my skin soft!  I use it every night before bed.  Shame on costco for discontinuing!</li>
    <li> My wife started using Bio-Oil for operation scars and acute psoriasis.  It has made a big difference and performed as advertised.  She recommended I try it for irritated skin areas and I found it to work great at relieving irratation and help in healing.  She had previously tried many other scar specific products and variuos lotions/skin creams.  Bio-Oil has out performed them all.</li>
    <li> Picked it up in desperation with wrinkly arms and flaking legs...Winter maladies getting worse with age. You would not believe how much healthier my skin looks. Use daily after shower - very effective! Takes about 2 weeks to really see the difference. Smells great too. I am recommending Bio-Oil to a pregnant relative. All safe ingredients.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of Bio-Oil about 18 months ago.  It didn&#x27;t seem like anything special at first, and I continued using it just to use it up and not waste the money.  I used it every night on the backs of my thighs, where the skin is very thin and stressed.  When the bottle was finally empty, I switched to using my faithful Neutrogena Intensive Moisture Wrap.  Much to my surprise, the Bio-Oil kept moisturizing the skin all through the night, and I could still feel it in my skin the next morning. The Neutrogena lotion did not have the same long-lasting moisturizing effect.  So, after using Bio-Oil faithfully every night just to &amp;#34;use it up and get it out of the way&amp;#34;, I find myself buying another bottle!  ;)</li>
    <li> the package is old and with abrasion. I bought it as a gift for my friend, but the outlook of the package didn&#x27;t satisfy me.</li>
    <li> I love Bio Oil! I&#x27;ve been using it for years on scars, burns, bug bites, and dry skin. It works so well on me and that&#x27;s why I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is helping with the healing as well as the comfort of my post surgical scars. After a breast reduction and tummy tuck, I have scars that require care. Bio-Oil is remarkable! My scars are fading already and when I start to feel discomfort during the day, I apply the oil to my scars and it immediately relieves the tightness and discomfort. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
