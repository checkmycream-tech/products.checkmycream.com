      <li>AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THE OUTDOORSY, FRESH FORESTY SCENT OF ACQUA DI SELVA.</li>
      <li>This cologne smells fresh and invigorating.</li>
      <li>I bought 3 highly rated colognes, this one is 3rd place according to my wife (but still good).</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product for many years from various vendors.</li>
      <li>First, the bottle dose not look look like the picture shown.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of different colognes and fragrances for men and I have to recognize that this cologne just hit a right spot.</li>
      <li>I bought this after I saw positive reviews</li>
      <li>Not too sweet, masculine, and feels Euro.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>A very distinctive fragrance.</li>
      <li>To make the story short - I like it very much!</li>
      <li>SOMEONE TURNED ME ON TO ACQUA DI SELVA WHEN I WAS 20 YRS OLD.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Acqua De Selva since I was a kid , seems like they&#x27;re using old bottles!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Back then they had something they called &amp;#34;Victor Silvestre&amp;#34; but this stuff comes very close to the one I used in the seventies.</li>
      <li>I will continue to occasionally use Aqua di Selva EDC, but it is no longer my main fragrance.</li>
      <li>and it barely smelled.</li>

<li> SOMEONE TURNED ME ON TO ACQUA DI SELVA WHEN I WAS 20 YRS OLD.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Acqua De Selva since I was a kid , seems like they&#x27;re using old bottles!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Back then they had something they called &amp;#34;Victor Silvestre&amp;#34; but this stuff comes very close to the one I used in the seventies.</li>
<li> I will continue to occasionally use Aqua di Selva EDC, but it is no longer my main fragrance.</li>
<li> and it barely smelled.</li>
<li> I believe that I received a genuine product and not a diluted fake that seem to permeate the internet.</li>
<li> I used Aqua di Selva about 25 years ago and it was my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrance after trying several other products such as Aqua di Parma, Boucheron and Bulgari to name a few.</li>
<li> It has been my No. 1 favorite for over 30 years............ mellow, unassumming, yet very lasting unobtrusive fragrance that can only be described as always</li>
<li> Recommended as a daily use type of scent, or for the less daring perhaps their &amp;#34;evening out&amp;#34; scent.</li>
<li> My disappointment was, that even though the initial spray has a strong woodsy smell, there is a heavy undertone of alcohol.</li>
<li> AND IT HAS BECOME A LIFELONG FRIEND.</li>
<li> Be careful with this stuff; it&#x27;s dynamite!</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a push down</li>
<li> and I feel like the product has been watered down.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read all previous reviews before buying this cologne and decided to take some risk and buy it.</li>
<li> Sadly it was the same.</li>
<li> This is the 1st time I feel like the fragrance is weak</li>
<li> But when it was nearly impossible to find, I used Creed and some of the other brands.</li>
<li> Beware this is not the orginal product its fake.</li>
<li> It used to be very difficult to find in the US.  </li>
<li> Has to be one of the worst colognes on the market .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Beware this is not the orginal product its fake. I&#x27;ve been using Acqua de silva for 35 years,  this is not made  by  Visconti.  First, the bottle dose not look look like the picture shown. Secondly the scent last for only one hour.</li>
    <li> My Dad wore Acqua Di Selva most of his life. When I married, I made sure my husband wore it too. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s easier to find nowadays and cheaper too. It&#x27;s wonderfully citrusy and woodsy at the same time. A very distinctive fragrance. The only thing in this world sexier than a showered, shaven and well-dressed man is if he&#x27;s also wearing Acqua Di Selva!</li>
    <li> It has been my No. 1 favorite for over 30 years............ mellow, unassumming, yet very lasting unobtrusive fragrance that can only be described as always......... NICE.  Love it.....</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw positive reviews and it just seemed to be a good investment for my collection. It&#x27;s the best of the 4 new kinds I got and I love it. Fresh, clean, nice smell. (My bottle came with the chrome cap instead of the pictured one, but its nicer anyways)</li>
    <li> This is an awesome, weird, wonderful cologne for men that is intensely sexy.  Use it, it will not fail you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it sparingly.  Be careful with this stuff; it&#x27;s dynamite!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful scent for a man. It is my favorite cologne. The spray bottle is also easy to use.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance Have used it for years</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for 50 years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for more than 30 years. I was happy to find it still available at a good price.</li>
    <li> Has to be one of the worst colognes on the market .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this after shave.  It used to be very difficult to find in the US.  Thanks to Amazon, it&#x27;s readily available now.</li>
    <li> SOMEONE TURNED ME ON TO ACQUA DI SELVA WHEN I WAS 20 YRS OLD. (BACK IN THE DAY!!!) WELL, I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER 40 YEARS NOW AND IT HAS BECOME A LIFELONG FRIEND. I&#x27;VE HAD IT ALL.....FROM CK, HUGO BOSS, LAGERFELD ETC AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THE OUTDOORSY, FRESH FORESTY SCENT OF ACQUA DI SELVA. IF I COULD GIVE IT 10 STARS I WOULD. AND BY THE WAY.......THE LADIES? THEY DON&#x27;T CHASE ME ANYMORE BUT THEY STILL COME SNIFFING AROUND AND LOVE THE SMELL HAHA!!!</li>
    <li> Clean and fresh...the best!</li>
    <li> It is my brothers favorite for forty years  and was a great deal</li>
    <li> I bought 3 highly rated colognes, this one is 3rd place according to my wife (but still good). Bvlgari Pour Homme Soir was the winner, Curve Soul came in second. I personally like this one best, but my vote does not count.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all previous reviews before buying this cologne and decided to take some risk and buy it. I&#x27;m a huge fan of different colognes and fragrances for men and I have to recognize that this cologne just hit a right spot. If you like good ol&#x27; manly fragrances then this cologne is definitely for you. This cologne smells fresh and invigorating. I use it only after shaving and it makes me feel very refreshed and the skin very smooth. To make the story short - I like it very much!</li>
    <li> Wore this when I was younger (15 or so) and loved the smell. Found it again and bought the 6.8oz cologne and it barely smelled. Thought that I must have gotten a dud and bought the spray. Sadly it was the same. What a shame it was a beautiful smell.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for those who love it. I did&#x27;nt, thus the 3. Can&#x27;t describe the scent but it&#x27;s just not for me. I should know  better than to buy without trying, but oh well...</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of Acqua di Selva since 1968 when it was distributed by Victor, most always purchased in the bottle pictured. Now I&#x27;ve received differently shaped atomizer bottles containing a fragrance I dislike and no one seems to be able or wants to address my issue. Yes, it&#x27;s still an Acqua di Selva product, but am I the only one out here who has recently noticed a distinctly different scent?</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for many years from various vendors. This is the 1st time I feel like the fragrance is weak and I feel like the product has been watered down.</li>
    <li> I like it. The scent stays for several hours.</li>
    <li> It no longer comes in the bottle displayed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a push down squirt bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Acqua De Selva since I was a kid , seems like they&#x27;re using old bottles!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate a response!!</li>
    <li> Not too sweet, masculine, and feels Euro. Recommended as a daily use type of scent, or for the less daring perhaps their &amp;#34;evening out&amp;#34; scent. Try it.</li>
    <li> Not quite the same scent as I remember from the Disco days. Back then they had something they called &amp;#34;Victor Silvestre&amp;#34; but this stuff comes very close to the one I used in the seventies. I believe there is a &amp;#34;Pino Silvestre&amp;#34; available but would have to smell it first.</li>
    <li> I used Aqua di Selva about 25 years ago and it was my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrance after trying several other products such as Aqua di Parma, Boucheron and Bulgari to name a few. But when it was nearly impossible to find, I used Creed and some of the other brands. Recently I was elated to find it on Amazon.com and purchased it. My disappointment was, that even though the initial spray has a strong woodsy smell, there is a heavy undertone of alcohol. The fragrance lasts at best about three hours, under moderate activities in air conditioned environment. I believe that I received a genuine product and not a diluted fake that seem to permeate the internet. The price cannot be beat but quality control may be lacking. I will continue to occasionally use Aqua di Selva EDC, but it is no longer my main fragrance.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice product affordable , smells clean and fresh with a bit of spice (love it)&lt;br /&gt;I got exactly what I wanted out of this product and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this spray for 33 years.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I get it on line and this was the best price I could find.  Great fragrance for men.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a holiday gift along with other items, and the receiver was happy to get it.</li>
