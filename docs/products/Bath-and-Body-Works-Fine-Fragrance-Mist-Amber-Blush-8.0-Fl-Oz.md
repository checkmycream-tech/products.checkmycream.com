    <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance!! I was pleased with my purchase..</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells so good. And it came in 2 days! I was surprised</li>
    <li> Bath and Body Works no longer makes this scent which is why I stocked up and bought three of them! It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> Always been a favorite of mine. B&amp;B doesn&#x27;t sell this fragrance any more. Thank God for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, description is a little off saying its a 10oz. But its really an 8oz. Hence the four stars. Other than that, it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> It smells like scented pads/panty liners/tp. It was a good deal but the scent is kinda gross. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> my wife is addicted to bath and body works and i&#x27;m glad i was able to find it here just a little cheaper than the actual website.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure but I thought I was smelling alcohol the entire time but I had a chance to smell it from a distance It smelled better? It&#x27;s amazing I do wish the scent lingered on longer. I like it though</li>
    <li> My alltime favorite scent!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;This body spray smells really good!!!</li>
    <li> think refinement, sophistication, elegance, alluring, captivating...think amber blush</li>
    <li> It smells good. But it smells really girly. It smells like those really sweet scented lip gloss I had as a kid. It bring back memories. Great scent. but If you don&#x27;t want to smell super girly it might not be for you.</li>

    <li> Love the way it smells.  So fresh and delicious!</li>
    <li> The crystal is pretty, but doesn&#x27;t work well on my touchpad. I have to hit the leybosrd 3 or 4 times to enter in.my info. I&#x27;m better off using my fingers like before. But they are pretty.</li>
    <li> Love Bath &amp; Body Works Body Mists of all kinds, this one is GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with the fragrance that I had to order the spray.  It was reasonably priced. Love the bath and body products.</li>
