      <li>/&gt;Arrived without a cap, but I just re-used the old one I had.</li>

<li> This product does work well to plump up the hair, but it leaves my hair feeling very dry and it makes it feel straw-like to the touch.</li>
<li> Gives enough volume without the stiff feel.</li>
<li> It is a little sticky on your hands and transfers to the hairbrush handle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Joico whipping foam for a few years now.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to find in salons, so</li>
<li> It does not look bad</li>
<li> and it builds volume like crazy!!</li>

    <li> Excellent product that does what it claims</li>
    <li> I tried instead of Joico Joywhip. This is an ok product, but not as good as Joywhip.</li>
    <li> This is ok. I heard it was great for hair. I feel it is just ok. Have found other products that work better on my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair mousse!  I love the product.  Best moose ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joico whipping foam for a few years now. I have really curly hair and this moose dose a really good job at taming them! The power whip gives it extra hold which I really like. Great product! I&#x27;ve never been able to find another product to compare to this one!</li>
    <li> I have VERY fine hair and have problems with gels/foams/mousses leaving a residue on my hair or weighing it down.  This product I learned about from my mom&#x27;s hairdresser.  I liked it so much I ordered it on my own.  NOT disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Enjoying this product and thank you for your speedy service. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it would be and dispenser was kind of broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> I have used this mousse for about 10 years, new packaging is nice- same great product for my curls, I love this mousse!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Takes the work out of styling your hair. I would definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a little (or a lot) more body in your hair!!</li>
    <li> This is what I always  use  and  I love it and its  cheaper here</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year and it has been the best mousse.  I have used big sexy hair but I find this leaves my hair more manageable without becoming sticky.</li>
    <li> It was delivered promptly. I was very happy with the service and price.</li>
    <li> The best product for my fine hair</li>
    <li> I have used Joico Joiwhip for years, I used Joiwhip back when it was called I.C.E. Whip! And it was the only mousse that worked in my very long, curly and often frizzy hair. Then i found this product - the power whip by Joico! It&#x27;s AMAZING - a little goes a long way!! When it first goes on you might freak out and think it looks like its gonna make your hair sticky and clumpy but when it dries down it creates great body,not stiff, not frizzy and it also seems to make my hair look lighter in color than the Joiwhip does. I get WAY more compliments on my hair since switching to this product. I can only give it 5 stars because they don&#x27;t allow more, but I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Joico knows what it is doing in the hair care field.&lt;br /&gt;I couple of shots of this and my curls are kept in shape all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other brands, and none compare to this whip.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I hoped</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  Goes on thick and styles great!  I have very fine hair and it builds volume like crazy!!</li>
    <li> I love this product....always have.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly fine on my hair</li>
    <li> and I have tried a lot over the years! Talk about helmet head. It does not look bad but when I can&#x27;t place my sunglasses on my head without pulling my hair significantly to break to bond, there is a problem. I like some hold but this is unusable for me.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse, will be ordering more</li>
    <li> It does give your hair volume, but it is very sticky and that is not good for the way I style my hair. I end up pulling out a lot of strands and that is definitely not what I want. I ended up mixing it with another mousse. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I used to use gel, but am hooked on this stuff!  Has a nice, musk smell to it (light, but reminds me of driftwood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived without a cap, but I just re-used the old one I had.</li>
    <li> This mousse works well enough, but I will stick with the joiwhip next time I order. It is much thicker and helps with root lift more.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;no problems.</li>
    <li> a very good product,good hold but leaves hair soft. I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product to anyone who uses mousse for hold.</li>
    <li> Good product, good seller.</li>
    <li> Like the feel and hold for my hair as I have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Drys hair.</li>
    <li> The Joico Foam adds volume to my hair. It is a little sticky on your hands and transfers to the hairbrush handle. But I have learned to wash my hands before I start to style. My stylist uses this brand and that is what prompted my purchase.</li>
    <li> Creates body without stiffness or stickiness.  A bit pricey, but it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to find in salons, so it&#x27;s a good find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this product and it totally eliminates the need for hairspray for me.  My hair looks soft and stays right in place without the stickiness of hairspray.</li>
    <li> Sticky but really makes my hair curly and voluminous</li>
    <li> Gives enough volume without the stiff feel. It still allows for styling without falling flat. Light feel, not heavy in the hair.</li>
    <li> This product does work well to plump up the hair, but it leaves my hair feeling very dry and it makes it feel straw-like to the touch. I have shoulder length thicker hair that has a bit of a curl to it. I will use what is left of this can and go in search of something else.</li>
