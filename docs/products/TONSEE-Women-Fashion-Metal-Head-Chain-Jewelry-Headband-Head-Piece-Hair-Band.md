<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It looks great but doesn&#x27;t fit very well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay very easily and the hair on its own. But has nothing to do with the manufacture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap looking and my daughter didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Received item EXTREMELY late. Did not fit my head (only on my prop head for my wigs)&lt;br /&gt;Bad product but I used the metal for other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend if you&#x27;re ok with getting it late and have a fairly small head</li>
    <li> This is made too fit a child. It was way too small.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look nothing like it</li>
    <li> I love it. I have a big head, and it fits perfectly, sorry but I recommend this people who doesn&#x27;t fit this, to try it again, is really easy and really works. It has to be like that, other way could fall from your head.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Great piece.</li>
    <li> Unless you have a really small head, do not waste your money!! I purchased this item to wear to a function in December, waited a couple weeks for it to be delivered and was extremely disappointed to see that it did not even fit!!!! My head is not big, I would consider it average, Ive never had any problems with any headbands not fitting.  This is a first.</li>
    <li> a little confused on how to wear it. but still nice</li>
    <li> It was too small.  Fit my daughters head but not mine...</li>
    <li> it is reallllyyyyy pretty BUT DIDNT FIT unless you have a small head don&#x27;t buy this. However it did come almost two weeks earlier then estimated shipping date</li>
    <li> It was broken when I got it but even if wasn&#x27;t there is no way would have fit so I&#x27;m really dissapointed</li>
    <li> it is my assumption that those who claim this piece doesn&#x27;t fit may not be wearing it correctly. It is adjustable  and fits just fine. However, the piece can be a bit difficult  to wear. The chain to the side hang freely so the piece does not fit snuggly to the head. Basically, the middle chain balances on the top so don&#x27;t be surprised  if it slips every now and then.</li>
    <li> Very small best on a child&#x27;s head</li>
    <li> Nothing special.. Looks kinda cheap</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on yet...didn&#x27;t get a receipt either but it&#x27;s cool I still like it and I&#x27;ll wear it one day</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t big enough. Maybe i&#x27;ve got a big head. I don&#x27;t know, i was very bummed though.</li>
    <li> IT IS A CUTE HEADPEICE AND I LIKE THE SIMPLE LOOK. THE ONLY THING IS IT IS HARD TO KEEP IT IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU CAN&#x27;T MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH OR IT SLIDES OFF. I WILL TRY TO ADJUST MINE AGAIN, BUT OVERALL ITS CUTE.</li>
    <li> Broke while I was trying to put it on waste of my Money</li>
    <li> If you have the size of a childs head then this is perfect. Had to give to my little sister!</li>
    <li> Accidently ordered it but love it.</li>
    <li> Was broken ... And took forever to arrive</li>
    <li> Very pretty, felt of good quality but too small. Fits the head of maybe a 13 year old.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the way I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Quick Shipping ,,, Broken now</li>
    <li> This is just ok for me, not what I was looking for. Thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. It fits just like in the picture.</li>
    <li> It broke the first time I put it on.</li>
    <li> Love my head jewelry.</li>
    <li> like the style, but came broke..</li>
    <li> Everything I asked for</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture the head piece already turned colors when I received it not worth the money will never purchase hand bands off here again</li>
    <li> complete waste of time and money this take a hold month to ship</li>
    <li> Showed up broken and did not have a thicker chain to it to go down the hair part. Really small too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap.. It doesn’t last long.</li>
    <li> Not what&#x27;s on the picture</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!! And it&#x27;s adjustable!!!!</li>
    <li> I Love it, its lovely.::</li>
    <li> chains were broken on arrival. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful headdress! A little tight though.</li>
    <li> It broke , the first day I used it . it vwas a waste of money</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and it fits perfectly. It would be too small for my head.</li>
    <li> To small for an adult head.</li>
    <li> I love it. I love the way it fits on my head. I love the ways it looks on me its the best.I love it.</li>
    <li> My head jewelry arrive broken the claps hooks were broken</li>
    <li> doesnt fit my head way to small</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it no stars because it broke as soon as I got it....</li>
    <li> Did not fit and broke easily</li>
    <li> It was too small, flimsy chain- then again it wasn&#x27;t expensive so I can&#x27;t complain too much. Instantly broke.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and hard to fit on a head.</li>
    <li> did not stay together it was falling apart</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of not reading the reviews ahead of tIme. Literally just got this in the mail (after waiting a month to get it with NO tracking the entire time) and came straight to make a review. First, I read reviews of others and I agree, it&#x27;s TOO SMALL! Like, who&#x27;s head is this small? Is this children&#x27;s costume jewelry? Fortune for me, I make and alter jewelry so I made a few small changes and was able to &amp;#34;semi&amp;#34; correct it. However, the entire point of purchasing this was so I didn&#x27;t have to do it myself!!! Seemed like a steal for that price. Yeah, more like too good to be true. So, bottom line, if you got a peanut head or are crafty (and feel up to a challenge), go for it.</li>
    <li> Very small. Broke instantly. Didn&#x27;t sit on head right</li>
    <li> Looks elegant and fits well.</li>
    <li> So when i recieved my product and put it on it kept coming off so i put a bobbypin to keep it straight then when i went to adjust it, it ended up breaking the clipping part. Overall it was cute but not worth you money because theres to many problems with it unless you have a really small head</li>
    <li> This product is very cheap chain broke and I just clipped it to the clip but not good for peoPle with big heads</li>
    <li> Cute headband. Exactly what I thought it would be. Super cute and easy to wear. Over all I am happy with the headband. However, I am not happy at all with how long it took for this it arrive to my house. It took over a month. Then the seller did not provide any tracking number. So, I had no clue whether it was on it&#x27;s way or not. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I tried to put it on. Waisted time and money on this. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Was broken on arrival didn&#x27;t even get a cancel to wear it once!!!!</li>
    <li> Great headpiece. Nice accent piece.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a cute chain head dress</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small... it doesn&#x27;t fit on my head.</li>
    <li> It took over 2 weeks past the date to be delivered to my house and when I received it, I wore it once and the chains fell apart. Cheap.</li>
    <li> too small, would only fit a babies head. DO NOT BUY, definitely not worth it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice but it doesn&#x27;t fit as i expected it to small. I think it for small head.</li>
    <li> This is kind of small for my head, but maybe I just have a big head lol.  It is adjustable.</li>
    <li> This hair piece is cute BUT hard to wear. I don&#x27;t know if its just me since I&#x27;m new to this. But it looks just like the picture</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you see in the picture. If you ever wondered what one looks like on you...its cheap enough to get it just to see &amp; of you don&#x27;t like it, wait til you or a friend needs it to complete a Greek or Hindu goddess costume one day!</li>
    <li> I probably should have read the other reviews on here for this product.  It looks cute in the picture, but in reality it&#x27;s weird and basically a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Great buy and it looks awesome on me</li>
    <li> Cute nice quality chains but middle chain isnt straight it&#x27;s twisted and doesn&#x27;t lay flat.</li>
    <li> Somewhat too small but good service thank you</li>
    <li> Product is terrible. Does not look like the picture. It&#x27;s 5 strands of the same size gold chain, all tangled. No matter what way I try it on the middle piece is dangling over to a side and it looks cheap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all that.....</li>
    <li> I see the chain in pieces, and already broken.</li>
    <li> This was extremely small for my head &amp; from trying to figure it out. It broke. Delivery time was slow..I had actually forgot I ordered this until I recieved it. Very disappointing :/</li>
    <li> I loved this! Its great and you can also adjust it to your head size</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but don&#x27;t fit on my daughter head at all.</li>
    <li> Totally NOT worth it!! I bought it and didn&#x27;t fit me, I gave it to my 5year old sister and it didn&#x27;t even fit her. The material is really cheap.</li>
    <li> This did not fit  my hair well, and eventually burst!</li>
    <li> Cute but a little tight. Had one before and it broke.</li>
    <li> Impossible to keep on.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve read the reviews as we&#x27;ll they made it super super small its for a child between 6 to 10 seriously</li>
    <li> Was it wrong of me, as a middle-aged guy, to think that wearing one of these would work out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple answer: yes.</li>
    <li> broke the first time I tried it on.</li>
    <li> Worst thing I&#x27;ve bought head piece came broken. So upsetting</li>
    <li> cheaply made, but for the price it is a bargain</li>
    <li> It do fit my head!!! Don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> Small heads only!! I should have read the reviews, because it was a waist of my time and coins! 😨</li>
    <li> Looks great in the picture but the size is for children head circumstance- small child head size at that. Disappointed</li>
    <li> How you see it, fits fine</li>
    <li> It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sort of weird to adjust. Hair must be really flat unless u want to wear a bun... If you have a big head don&#x27;t buy this. Overall it works but the shipping sucks... 4 not 5 stars because of the shipping</li>
    <li> I like the metal chain but it took awhile to get</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even fit... piece of crap not worth it don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Nice jewelry and it affordable</li>
    <li> The chains broke when i tried to put in on for the first time.  not worth the few dollars to send back. ridiculously long delivery time (AMAZON needs to highlight that in the description - not tuck this info into the last buy screen!)  Just more junk!</li>
    <li> Came sooner than expected, looks exactly like pic shown great quality</li>
    <li> Total s*** for a child&#x27;s head</li>
    <li> Took a while to get hear and fits a little loose.</li>
    <li> Eh... The head chain is extremely cute but it&#x27;s a bit too small for my head..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a big head and this doesn&#x27;t look at all like the photo advertised!</li>
    <li> I love it, simple &amp; fun.... And so beautiful! I&#x27;ve gotten so compliments... And so affordable!</li>
    <li> horrible product. do not buy !!</li>
    <li> The chain was too thin and small. Cheep material and a east of money</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty but it seems like I have a big head. so haven&#x27;t really tried it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my daughters head and it broke as she was trying to put it on. Paid for something that she couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> Suppion has great customer service, they kept in contact to make sure you were satisfied with their merchandise.</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I tried it on , just horrible and disappointing</li>
    <li> Soon as I try to wear it it popped</li>
    <li> I feel like I have an average head. Atleast no one has told me otherwise. Cute on maybe a 7 yr old but will not fit an adult. VERY SMALL. Save your money and time.</li>
    <li> This cheap chain broke the first time I tried it on! Don&#x27;t waste ur money here!</li>
    <li> It was so cute but very fragile it broke</li>
    <li> I wear extensions and this just did not fit properly</li>
    <li> Too small  this made for kid.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money I tried to pit this on my head an it broke its very cheap</li>
    <li> Everything I order is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> The headband fits great it was a little complicated to get on but I finally got it other than that everything else was perfect.</li>
    <li> Put on once and broke :( literally wore  in 10 seconds  for  a picture.  Reordering  anyway because my 3 year old loves  Elephants.</li>
    <li> If u have a big head DO NOT BUY! it&#x27;s only for very small heads, sadly. 😢</li>
    <li> Too small. Don&#x27;t fit properly on my head. A waste of money</li>
    <li> This headband only works if your hair naturally parts straight down the middle.</li>
    <li> So simple and goes with everything. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. It broke when i tried to put it on my head. Don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> Took forever , was way to small to fit not worth it</li>
    <li> Its okay doesn&#x27;t really do well for me, guess my head it too big lol</li>
    <li> took forever to get here, tried it on and it wont even fit on my head. too small. and i feel like i have a small head already</li>
    <li> The head chain broke the very first time i tried to put it on! Do not buy it is terrible quality and way to small. Even if it didn&#x27;t break  it would be to small for anyone but an infant child to wear.</li>
    <li> I was very irritated . I&#x27;m not satisfied .</li>
    <li> Ok but small not enough chain hang</li>
