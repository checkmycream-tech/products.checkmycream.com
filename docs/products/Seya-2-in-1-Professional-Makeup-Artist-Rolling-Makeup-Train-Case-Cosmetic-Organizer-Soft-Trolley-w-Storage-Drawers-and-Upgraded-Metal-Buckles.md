      <li>I love this case!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this bag!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this case!</li>
      <li>This is amazing</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best hair and makeup case I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and this is an awesome kit.</li>
      <li>I use/leave the top kit at home where I leave all my supplies in and bulk items in.</li>
      <li>But since I&#x27;ve had it I mostly use the shoulder strap.</li>
      <li>I love this bag</li>
      <li>and my clients always compliment me on it, so they love it too.</li>
      <li>and BOTH kits come with shoulder handles which are SO comfortable and amazing, because lets face it</li>
      <li>This comes with 2 brush holders (which I don&#x27;t use because I have my brush belt that holds more.)</li>
      <li>I have gone through many cases because of wear and tear.</li>
      <li>I love that the drawers have a locking mechanism on them</li>
      <li>that made me extra happy!! :)</li>
      <li>The only way this could be the perfect kit is if the wheels were 360 wheels.</li>
      <li>The top part fits inside of a suitcase for easy travel.</li>
      <li>The Makeup case looks very nice and professional!</li>
      <li>so I was very impressed at how durable &amp; sturdy it is, how much you can fit in it &amp; also the quality of the wheels &amp; handle bc of how much they are pulling-</li>
      <li>This carries just the perfect amount of makeup and other products use for make up application on clients.</li>
      <li>the handle broke easily.</li>
      <li>As a full-time MUA I was in the market for a kit that was light, organized and most importantly LOOKED and said \\&quot;I am a PRO.\\</li>
      <li>but overall is a great makeup bag.</li>
      <li>Such a great makeup case.</li>
      <li>It’s a great purchase &amp; a total steal at this price!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some cases that felt cheap &amp;</li>
      <li>Its great for someone who wants their stuff very organised.</li>
      <li>Product shipped quick, great packing and it was pretty much everything the wife wanted and needed to fit all of her stuff.</li>
      <li>I can fit my large airbrush compressor in the top section &amp; there’s still room for all my palettes etc.  </li>
      <li>I give this product a 5 star because so far... I love it!  </li>
      <li>&quot; For the price you really can&#x27;t get a better kit.</li>
      <li>the quality is so good it will last for years.</li>
      <li>and I love the fact you can organize so much.</li>
      <li>Easy to travel with and very spacious</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own,  instead of just flopping over the back.</li>
      <li>We would have given it a five if the top had someway of staying open on</li>
      <li>It is a bit big and bulky however and takes up a lot of space in my car, but it&#x27;s just me in the car most of the time</li>
      <li>It is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
      <li>The top section is deep and holds, 4 eyeshadow pallets, 8 lip pallets, a curling iron, and my chunky/filled brush belt etc.</li>
      <li>so I had it in time for my first wedding of the season -</li>
      <li>Highly reccomend it!  </li>
      <li>so much room</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>I love the drawers because I can just pull them out and grab what I need verses having to pull out every package like other cases.</li>
      <li>Other than that I love it</li>
      <li>Way better than the other metal 2in one!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>So professional looking and very well organized.</li>
      <li>the top half is great for the hair products and accessories and the bottom half has a big compartment for bigger makeup stuff and drawers for smaller stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY professional looking</li>
      <li>The only thing is that the clips are kind of hard to clip on/off.</li>
      <li>&quot; The drawers are removable so you can remove them and work directly from them, rather than unpacking all your product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and makeup artist, and I do lots of traveling to my jobs.</li>
      <li>and I have soooo much room compared to my last last one tier train case.</li>
      <li>I received my case much sooner than the expected delivery date</li>
      <li>Nicer than expected and very durable.  </li>

<li> so I don&#x27;t know how durable it would be in the long run</li>
<li> I have been looking for one from a very long time</li>
<li> I think this case would make it easier to drag if it had 360 wheels on all four corners on the bottom...</li>
<li> plus so I was worried about the quality since this was about half the price</li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t like the typical makeup cases.</li>
<li> Although I do little room for improvement for example..</li>
<li> I made little partitions in a few of the drawers so my smaller/loose products don’t flop around.  </li>
<li> I like that it has the 6 drawer compartments for storing small things like makeup, hair clips, etc.  </li>
<li> I think that would make it less painful to roll the case.  </li>

    <li> Fits everything i need. Very well made. Highly reccomend it!  Cant beat the price. My friend got the same from a different place for almost 400$.</li>
    <li> This carries just the perfect amount of makeup and other products use for make up application on clients. The drawers lock so they don&#x27;t slide open. That&#x27;s the best feature</li>
    <li> The Makeup case looks very nice and professional! The only thing is that the clips are kind of hard to clip on/off. After that, very happy with this item</li>
    <li> Its a great product. I didnt want a makeup case with bags. I wanted something with drawers to keep my things organised especially while using then. It is exactly what i was looking for. the top half is great for the hair products and accessories and the bottom half has a big compartment for bigger makeup stuff and drawers for smaller stuff. Its great for someone who wants their stuff very organised. The outer part is cloth so I don&#x27;t know how durable it would be in the long run but overall is a great makeup bag. I have been looking for one from a very long time and I didn&#x27;t like the typical makeup cases. I love this one!!</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5 star because so far... I love it!  Although I do little room for improvement for example.. I think this case would make it easier to drag if it had 360 wheels on all four corners on the bottom... I think that would make it less painful to roll the case.  I like that it has the 6 drawer compartments for storing small things like makeup, hair clips, etc.  I would recommend this product to anyone in the beauty industry.</li>
    <li> Love my Makeup case! Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> I love this bag the quality is so good it will last for years. so much room and I love the fact you can organize so much.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Seya case!!!!! It fits everything with tons of space left. I love that the drawers have a locking mechanism on them so you dont have to worry about them flying open. This is amazing</li>
    <li> Loved it . So professional looking and very well organized. Easy to travel with and very spacious</li>
    <li> My only issue with this product is that I didn&#x27;t buy it SOONER! As a full-time MUA I was in the market for a kit that was light, organized and most importantly LOOKED and said \\&quot;I am a PRO.\\&quot; For the price you really can&#x27;t get a better kit. This comes with 2 brush holders (which I don&#x27;t use because I have my brush belt that holds more.) and BOTH kits come with shoulder handles which are SO comfortable and amazing, because lets face it, we&#x27;ve all had to lug these things up stairs. I use/leave the top kit at home where I leave all my supplies in and bulk items in. The bottom kit has 8 drawers which I categorized in as \\&quot;Primers, lashes, hair, SPX, powders, face, eyes, and supplies.\\&quot; The drawers are removable so you can remove them and work directly from them, rather than unpacking all your product. The top section is deep and holds, 4 eyeshadow pallets, 8 lip pallets, a curling iron, and my chunky/filled brush belt etc. The only way this could be the perfect kit is if the wheels were 360 wheels. But since I&#x27;ve had it I mostly use the shoulder strap. You will love this kit!</li>
    <li> Nicer than expected and very durable.  It was for my wife and she does make up for weddings and loves it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bag! It has helped me to stay organized. This is a mua&#x27;s dream!</li>
    <li> Used as a slot car case for traveling to events.  Lightweight, sturdy and rolls well.  We would have given it a five if the top had someway of staying open on it&#x27;s own,  instead of just flopping over the back.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case! I know some of them sell for $300/plus so I was worried about the quality since this was about half the price so I was very impressed at how durable &amp; sturdy it is, how much you can fit in it &amp; also the quality of the wheels &amp; handle bc of how much they are pulling- I&#x27;ve had some cases that felt cheap &amp; the handle broke easily. FYI- I made little partitions in a few of the drawers so my smaller/loose products don’t flop around.  I can fit my large airbrush compressor in the top section &amp; there’s still room for all my palettes etc.  It’s a great purchase &amp; a total steal at this price!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery also receives 5 stars- I received my case much sooner than the expected delivery date so I had it in time for my first wedding of the season - that made me extra happy!! :)</li>
    <li> Product shipped quick, great packing and it was pretty much everything the wife wanted and needed to fit all of her stuff.</li>
    <li> Such a great makeup case. Invest in this wonderful product so spacious and very organizable!  Way better than the other metal 2in one! You won&#x27;t great this product. Properly made</li>
    <li> Love this case! Just love it!! It&#x27;s the best case iv ever had!! If I was to nit pick I would say the only way you could improve this case would be to put 360 wheels on it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. It is outstanding quality!</li>
    <li> I love this case! It&#x27;s VERY professional looking and I have soooo much room compared to my last last one tier train case. This allows me to store all of my makeup and then some! It is a bit big and bulky however and takes up a lot of space in my car, but it&#x27;s just me in the car most of the time so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I also wish the wheels rotated when rolling. Other than that I love it and my clients always compliment me on it, so they love it too.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best hair and makeup case I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and makeup artist, and I do lots of traveling to my jobs. I have gone through many cases because of wear and tear. These are substantial and durable, plus hold everything I need. I&#x27;ve had my 2-in-1 case for several months, and I know it will last me a long time. I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and this is an awesome kit. I love the drawers because I can just pull them out and grab what I need verses having to pull out every package like other cases. The top part fits inside of a suitcase for easy travel.</li>
