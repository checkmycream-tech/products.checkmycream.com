<li> really long --if you take care of it &amp; put it back in the package and use alcohol to remove your glue and sanitize&lt;br /&gt;should be able to use at least 10 times if not more.</li>
<li> (extra long length).&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
<li> But, I found these lashes to be just a tad bit more difficult to put on compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> lighter coming are to other similar lash brand.</li>
<li> Red Cherry #DW is a little longer in length.</li>
<li> I use them till they die but usually they last a long time.</li>
<li> Shipping was faster than expected.</li>

    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;d ever bought from Red Cherry and they did not disappoint. These lashes are grade A high quality lashes for an unbeatable price. If you can&#x27;t afford MAC lashes these are a comparable dupe!</li>

    <li> I can wear one pair every day for weeks, and they still look beautiful! #43 is my every day pair. Just make sure to remove the glue each night and youre ready to wear again!</li>
    <li> Love that you can mix and match any lashes you want. I liked all the styles I chose. But, I found these lashes to be just a tad bit more difficult to put on compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m not crazy about the look of the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; either. They look and feel more synthetic than real. My favorite still are by Benefit. But, I would buy these again for the sake of the quantity you get for the price!</li>
    <li> I really am disappointed that you can&#x27;t get the DW ones with this...</li>
    <li> Sp greeeeat . They arey favvv</li>
    <li> Good service ......not my type of lashes. Way too long and big, I gave selected what seemed most natural but they are still way too dramatic for my taste...I&#x27;ve had better lashes.</li>
    <li> Great price and love the option to pick 10! Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Great deal on these great false lashes. I love the thin strip on them, it&#x27;s much easier to hide with liner than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried. And the lashes are beautiful. I love all of the different styles that I got. You can easily reuse each pair several times if you treat them well.</li>
    <li> 💋I just got my eyelashes and i love love love them so pretty cant wait to wear them all  😍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes! I have super sensitive eyes and as long as I trim them to where I don&#x27;t feel the edges, I&#x27;m fine all day. Sometimes eyelashes feel so heavy on my eyes, they start making me feel sleepy!! These are super light...even the dense ones. Try it...you will love them!</li>
    <li> I love these so much! I have several pairs of the more pricey Velour lashes and I will never go back to them. These are cheaper, more comfy, offer more variety, and are just an all around better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these lashes before and I love them! I got the exact ones I asked for and received them really fast! I would recommend this to anyone looking for well packaged, reusable lashes, great costumer service and speedy delivery!!</li>
    <li> First of all they came on time and came exactly how I ordered it. Love these lashes so natural, used the #DW this morning on a bride who don&#x27;t like makeup and she looked absolutely fabulous. ALso, I loved YONELAY services, I can&#x27;t believe they hand wrote a thank you note to me it felt so personalized. Thank you! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love theses lashes. Before I got these I only wore false lashes to parties and events now I wear them every day. Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s really easy and adds instant glam. My fave is DW and 747m for every day use.. Love love love</li>
    <li> I officially love red Cherry! The shipping came super fast and the product is amazing. I ordered:&lt;br /&gt;#41&lt;br /&gt;#73&lt;br /&gt;#605&lt;br /&gt;#110 (x2)&lt;br /&gt;#415 (x2)&lt;br /&gt;#600&lt;br /&gt;DEL&lt;br /&gt;WSP&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll include a picture of my favorite pair on and so far it is #110. It makes any look have a bit of extra glam! I will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> The ones i picked looked natural on the picture, but look like drag queens</li>
    <li> I love the eyelashes,but i just got #43,when i request #43 and #523 .half and half.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!! I ordered 5 different styles to try out. Most of them were a little long for my eyes, but the DW is PERFECT. I got these lashes extremely fast as well. I will definitely be ordering from this seller again.</li>
    <li> These are great lashes!  I have fun picking my lashes to meet my mood for the day!</li>
    <li> Quality of eyelashes is good. Many styles to choose from. Sometimes difficult to decided from pictures.</li>
    <li> Got everything I asked for,  but it took a while to arrive.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I really like these lashes they feel light you can barely know they are there&lt;br /&gt;They look amazing and easy to apply.  would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping. Very reasonably priced.</li>

    <li> I love this pack of eyelashes. If you are new to wearing them and not sure which ones look best on you this is definitely the way to go. The lashes are very well made and gives you the opportunity to try different styles. Wonderful fast shipping and great service.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. They are very light-weight -&amp;#62; you can&#x27;t even feel them on compared to the ones&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear (drugstore ones). I will re-purchase. I know the girls on youtube are raving about these &amp; bought for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I already gave some away to my friends to try.  Love them. Esp. #43 (my everyday lash), 747L (extra long length).&lt;br /&gt;Last really long --if you take care of it &amp; put it back in the package and use alcohol to remove your glue and sanitize&lt;br /&gt;should be able to use at least 10 times if not more. I use them till they die but usually they last a long time. I will lose them&lt;br /&gt;before they even wear out.</li>
    <li> I got what I wanted fast.</li>
    <li> Great deal excellent quality comparable to Mac.</li>
    <li> None of the ones I ordered looked good on...</li>
