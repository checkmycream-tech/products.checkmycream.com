      <li>I just love it!  </li>
      <li>have very fine silky hair which is great most of the time</li>
      <li>however the brush is amazing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always dreamed of having amazing teased/voluminous hair</li>
      <li>&amp; I didn&#x27;t have any luck getting any kind of volume with this teasing brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Honestly have not used this item yet - took along time to arrive for some reason.  </li>
      <li>Works good for giving hair more volume.</li>
      <li>then and i have super fine hair so this is perfect for me</li>
      <li>This styling brush may be good for fine hair, but not for mine.</li>
      <li>people try to show me how to tease it with a comb, I never was able to create a tease that stayed until this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use my teasing comb intially but this is great for touch ups and more gentle on the hair.  </li>
      <li>:) :) :) :) :) :)</li>
      <li>As many times as I&#x27;ve had</li>
      <li>this brush gives a softer looking hair do more than a teasing comb.</li>
      <li>When I was looking for a teasing brush, I looked at many of the comments on Amazon and decided for this one, regardless that the price was really more than I wanted to pay.  </li>
      <li>Its a great quality brush and will not break your hair as much.</li>
      <li>They both love them.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve it myself.  </li>
      <li>it breaks your hair and you have to do alot more teasing in order to get desired results.</li>
      <li>The new one is great.</li>
      <li>I like the natural boar bristles, as they are great for smoothing out tangles after backcombing.  </li>
      <li>Although I really try, I cannot get good results with it.  </li>
      <li>The puff is strong and durable as if you used hair spray.</li>
      <li>I was impressed and it cuts the time it takes to style my hair down.  </li>
      <li>Excellent brush, worth the price, more than expected!</li>
      <li>I use it 3-4 times a week for backcombing my fine hair.</li>
      <li>my hair is really fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, the brush quality seems fine</li>
      <li>On the bright side, it works okay as a space-saving travel brush--more compact than a bigger brush.</li>
      <li>I feel that I will enjoy this using this brush.  </li>
      <li>The Marilyn Teasing and Backcombing brush is so gentle on your hair and so effective.</li>
      <li>I have thinning hair on top and this brush, show in a demonstration on a TV program, has really helped and height and cover the thinning area on top of my head.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to get all of the teasing out without any damage.</li>
      <li>This brush gives you the perfect volume with little effort!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to use on the back top part of my hair to get rid of the little &amp;#34;butt crack&amp;#34; your hair sometimes makes and it adds a great lift with minimal,if any, damage to your hair.</li>
      <li>It is different from backcombing with a comb; causes static&lt;br /&gt;electricity in my hair, but does smooth out giving good fullness.</li>
      <li>Keep this in mind if you periodically clean your brush bristles of dust and buildup.</li>
      <li>This brush is the perfect combination - it allows you to do small sections but quickly adds height.</li>
      <li>and they were right!  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it teases my hair just right.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does in the picture, and I am pretty sure the red bristles are not boar.</li>
      <li>This is the exact teasing brush that my salon uses!</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I had hoped for!</li>
      <li>Just use with a little hairspray and my hair has looked great.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work perfect on my hair but my hair is thin.  </li>
      <li>I do think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>The bristles are too soft and I think a comb works better at teasing the hair.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it now that I have developed the technique.  </li>
      <li>And after I ordered it, I saw it featured and recommended in a very high fashion magazine!</li>
      <li>AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted in a teasing brush.  </li>
      <li>no matter how gentle I was when using them, but not this brush!  </li>
      <li>However, I have very thick hair and have been using a gool old fashioned teaser comb all these years, adn heard this is one of the best for teasing, for me, it just didnt do the trick.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good size-a little small, but truthfully, it&#x27;s nice because you can tease exactly what you want to with it.</li>
      <li>Really pleased with this sweet little brush that is well made.</li>
      <li>Amazon customer service kindly refunded me half of the product price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to section your hair and backcombing at the same time.</li>
      <li>A great little teasing comb for teasing up that snookie poof or creating those bumps or extra body you&#x27;ve been dying to wear.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This brush is fantastic, and I owe her a BIG Thank You.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a tease brush that would also part my hair.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for two months now and the bristles are still straight.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
      <li>Also, after teasing it so much, it was so easy to get my hair back to normal.</li>
      <li>I used it this weekend for the first time and I was able to tease my hair in less than 5 minutes and it stayed ALL NIGHT!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles are nice and stiff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does in the picture, and I am pretty sure the red bristles are not boar.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for creating a solid base of teased hair (the initial bulk), but you might want to use a rat tail comb for the top layers of hair. Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair as much with this brush as when I only use a comb. I&#x27;d recommend it, but not as a standalone tool.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this brush since it came out but the shipping was more than the brush in other sites. I ordered from Amazon and received one that was missing black paint. I called the Big Daddy and spoke to someone from her home(I won&#x27;t use names) what a doll.  She sent me a new one but my address came out wrong, she had a difficult time to accomodate me (with Fed Ex) but she did not give up. The new one is great. This brush is fantastic, and I owe her a BIG Thank You.</li>
    <li> It teases pretty decent, but the handle is not good for parting. I really wanted a tease brush that would also part my hair. I like this product and would recommend for anyone just looking to tease.</li>
    <li> Not as I expected. The backcombing does not hold well.  It was disappointing and I will probably not be using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these brushes as Christmas gifts for my daughters.  They both love them.  One has fine straight hair and the other has thicker medium-length hair.  The brush works great for both of them.  I would definately recommend this teasing brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, worth the price, more than expected! Very happy with this brush. Easy to section your hair and backcombing at the same time. The puff is strong and durable as if you used hair spray.</li>
    <li> I saw this brush in Ulta and thoght hmmm I wonder if it works so I went home looked it up on youtube and the next day I purchased this brush.  This brush creates major volume and my coworkers noticed I did something different.  I was impressed and it cuts the time it takes to style my hair down.  I have found I can also stretch out the times I have to shampoo my hair a week because it creates major volume.</li>
    <li> I feel that I will enjoy this using this brush.  It is different from backcombing with a comb; causes static&lt;br /&gt;electricity in my hair, but does smooth out giving good fullness.</li>
    <li> This little brush is well made and teases easily.  It&#x27;s super easy to get all of the teasing out without any damage.</li>
    <li> A great little teasing comb for teasing up that snookie poof or creating those bumps or extra body you&#x27;ve been dying to wear. It does an alright job, although I&#x27;m beginning to wonder why I didn&#x27;t just stick to a plain old rattail comb.. it seems to do the same thing and is a lot cheaper. I did notice this comb sheds a little bit here and there.. stiff little red boars hair bristles and of course they&#x27;re teased into your hair so it&#x27;s a P.I.T.A. to get them out...</li>
    <li> :(  First, the product title/description was wrong for what I received. The title says \\&quot;2 . . . Brushes.\\&quot; I only received one. Amazon customer service kindly refunded me half of the product price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the brush quality seems fine but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. Am I missing something? I&#x27;ve tried back-and-forth teasing and one-way backcombing. It teases no better than a normal comb or brush--worse even. I can&#x27;t get it to create any volume. Seriously, I don&#x27;t see why other people give it a better review. I would have returned it if my toddler hadn&#x27;t immediately bitten the handle. On the bright side, it works okay as a space-saving travel brush--more compact than a bigger brush. But even as a travel brush I use it only to brush my hair, not tease it.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair on top and this brush, show in a demonstration on a TV program, has really helped and height and cover the thinning area on top of my head.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work perfect on my hair but my hair is thin.  It does better than just a plain comb or brush.  I do think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you are a stylist (or novice) looking for the best teasing brush...this is the one!  Monroe brushes are the best!</li>
    <li> I think this brush does miracles! My hair is so thin and i always had problems with teasing my hair and giving it  volume that&#x27;ll last. I bought so many other brushes and their bristles will fall out, very poor quality. And teasing my hair with a teasing comb wasnt working at all... it breaks your hair and you have to do alot more teasing in order to get desired results. This brush gives you the perfect volume with little effort! Its a great quality brush and will not break your hair as much.This brush is shaped to tease as close as possible to the scalp and work your way up, you dont have to tease furosiously.  It does wat it says it&#x27;ll do,im very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser told me to always use a boar bristle brush to tease my thin, lifeless hair, and she was right.  It does a great job, and gives me the lift my hair needs.  And after I ordered it, I saw it featured and recommended in a very high fashion magazine!</li>
    <li> This is a great teaser! I&#x27;ve had it for two months now and the bristles are still straight. I use it 3-4 times a week for backcombing my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get this boar-bristle teasing brush to limit damage being done to my hair by plastic combs. It does a great job!</li>
    <li> There is not a lot to say about a brush except that it does what it is suppose to and I don&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This brush has exceeded my expectations. The color they sent me was not as pictured, it was must nicer with Black and Red. This brush does not catch or break my thick mixed ethnic hair. It is a wonderful brush for smoothing my hair- especially the short baby hair around my hair line. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like it, it made magic to my hair and I recieved 2 brushes  the one thing that disgusted me that it made from a boar hair  however the brush is amazing</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and have found it hard to add volume teasing with a comb or a regular brush. This brush is the perfect combination - it allows you to do small sections but quickly adds height. I have not had a problem with bristles breaking off (I have been using it several times a week for the last couple of months). I wish I had known about this brush sooner!</li>
    <li> Pros:  I like the natural boar bristles, as they are great for smoothing out tangles after backcombing.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple years and have no issues with losing bristles.  I also prefer the wood handle (opposed to plastic) in being somewhat eco-conscious.  The handle is slim and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room inside my work handbag.  Even if I don&#x27;t use it for teasing, I like to have it for touch ups at my scalp and ends throughout the day, because my large boar bristle is too big to tote around reasonably.  The handle is a perfect shape with indentations where your thumb would fit while teasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The black paint wears off eventually, especially if you get hair product on it.  When I disinfect and wash the bristles area, the black paint started running.  Keep this in mind if you periodically clean your brush bristles of dust and buildup.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab the hair to tease it</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted in a teasing brush.  Requires very few strokes and seems of high quality.  Very happy I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, barrel curly shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> After receiving this teasing brush, I am shocked by all the excellent reviews this product got.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine thin straight hair &amp; I didn&#x27;t have any luck getting any kind of volume with this teasing brush.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to deal with a return &amp; shipping charges, so I guess I wasted the $15.00 that I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;A hairdress friend of mine has a small metal teasing comb with tiny teeth that creates nice volume.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to look for a product like that. That is initally what I was going to do, but then I came across&lt;br /&gt;the great review on this one &amp; decided to try it, Oh well.....</li>
    <li> I have really fine babysoft hair that I have to tease nearly everyday to give it a little body. This comb cuts the time it usually takes me to do my hair with other teasing combs in half. So far I really like it. My only complaint is the the little red bristles seem to fall out quite a bit which is some what annoying when you have to pick them out of your hair before going anywhere. Other than that it works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is the exact teasing brush that my salon uses! I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for it! It is exactly what I had hoped for! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for Halloween in order to tease my hair to make it look all messy for my zombie costume. I had never teased my hair before, so I thought it would probably be a little hard, but it was super easy and my hair looked a hot mess. It was great. Also, after teasing it so much, it was so easy to get my hair back to normal. I had no problem with brushing it.</li>
    <li> This is your average teasing brush... Does exaclty what its suppose to do. I have real think hair and holy cow I can tease the crap out of it with this brush. It makes my &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; like 5 inches tall, haha.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot, i use it every now and then and i have super fine hair so this is perfect for me</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about teasing brushes, but this certainly does the trick-I lost mine and re-ordered the same one. So I&#x27;m happy with it! It&#x27;s a good size-a little small, but truthfully, it&#x27;s nice because you can tease exactly what you want to with it. To that end, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> this brush gives a softer looking hair do more than a teasing comb. Very satisfied with it. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> However, I have very thick hair and have been using a gool old fashioned teaser comb all these years, adn heard this is one of the best for teasing, for me, it just didnt do the trick.  Maybe my hair is just too thick, but it didnt really allow me to back comb, and kinda leaves a messy look.  Ill keep trying, but so far not for thick hair types.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A QUALITY BRUSH AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT. IT IS STURDY AND WILL LAST A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I love this little brush. I backcomb with it and it gives me volume and doesn&#x27;t look messy. Keeps my bangs off my forehead so when my forehead gets sweaty in the summer, my bangs don&#x27;t get wet. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It works great on my straight thin norwegian hair! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;:) :) :) :) :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Teases my hair very well and gently, although I do see some of the bristles come out in my hair sometimes, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for teasing or backcombing your hair.  I just love it!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr OZ, it is small, easy for travel and works for occasional back combing and picking of hair</li>
    <li> Works really well. Ive had a lot of trouble looking for a good teasing comb bc my hair is really fine but this works the best compared to others</li>
    <li> This brush works great for teasing and backcombing. The bristles are nice and stiff. Works good for giving hair more volume. The handle works great for parting hair also.</li>
    <li> It works great. I have fine hair and it teases my hair just right. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> A great product that&#x27;s very easy to use and works well to add volume to hair.  Just use with a little hairspray and my hair has looked great. My beauty routine is definitely a little easier with this product!</li>
    <li> This brush is what was promised (I saw it on Dr. Oz), however you still tease your hair only slightly less than you would with a comb.  Don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a teasing brush, I looked at many of the comments on Amazon and decided for this one, regardless that the price was really more than I wanted to pay.  Although I really try, I cannot get good results with it.  My hair is rather coarse, and the bristles of the brush are too tight to get a good tease.  This styling brush may be good for fine hair, but not for mine.</li>
    <li> I always found teasing brushes to be really rough on my hair no matter how gentle I was when using them, but not this brush!  I have long fine hair, and although I don&#x27;t tease my hair often, I totally would with this brush. The Marilyn Teasing and Backcombing brush is so gentle on your hair and so effective. I would never use another teasing brush, this is it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this brush!</li>
    <li> Honestly have not used this item yet - took along time to arrive for some reason.  Although, packaging was good.</li>
    <li> This brush does not do what I wanted it to do. When I tease my hair with a comb it has some height to it but this brush did not do what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> I use my teasing comb intially but this is great for touch ups and more gentle on the hair.  The company was great I got it from.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not in the right position to tease your hair, very disappointed in this product. Did not work.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too soft and I think a comb works better at teasing the hair.  The brush is well made and can be a decent alternative if you&#x27;d rather not use a comb.</li>
    <li> You do not have to move the brush up and down to tease which damages the hair.  You only have to slide down the hair shaft once and pull away.  Absolutely love it now that I have developed the technique.  Will never us a regular comb again.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always dreamed of having amazing teased/voluminous hair but I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve it myself.  As many times as I&#x27;ve had people try to show me how to tease it with a comb, I never was able to create a tease that stayed until this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching a few videos online about teasing I decided to invest in this brush as I was told this would create a tease with little effort and less hair damage and they were right!  I used it this weekend for the first time and I was able to tease my hair in less than 5 minutes and it stayed ALL NIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine silky hair which is great most of the time but not when you want body and this brush was a great fix .  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product!!!!!  Works like a charm!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This teasing brush works well but after I&#x27;d ordered it I saw a similar one at Target for half the price.  The thing that got to me was that it took almost a month to arrive.  I don&#x27;t blame Amazon as it looks like the problem was with the seller but...a MONTH?</li>
    <li> After seeing this on Dr. Oz I had to have it.  It&#x27;s great to use on the back top part of my hair to get rid of the little &amp;#34;butt crack&amp;#34; your hair sometimes makes and it adds a great lift with minimal,if any, damage to your hair. It smooths down your hair as well.  Really pleased with this sweet little brush that is well made.</li>
