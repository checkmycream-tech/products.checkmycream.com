      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is just so silky on the face and reminds me of the potions I concocted with rose petals as a child in my wendy house tucked away in our shrubbery.</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s a good thing--I love it.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that the NINA MONTEE Exfoliating Cleanser is my favorite beauty product of all time.  </li>
      <li>Great product, gentle on the skin, yet effective.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and the pump bottle is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I use every morning and evening, and while it is great for getting off the toughest make-up, it is also very gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>Since I started using it my skin feels so much better.</li>
      <li>My skin is softer, smoother and more even-toned.</li>
      <li>and I am glad that I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle on the skin, yet does a great job exfoliating.</li>
      <li>So many products claim to -</li>
      <li>When used in conjunction with Nina Montee&#x27;s non-oily moisturizer, my skin has never been better.</li>
      <li>It has potent Alpha Hydroxy acid (AHA) that removes brown spots and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>My mother and sisters now use it and love it.</li>
      <li>It cleans deep within your pores and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and flawless!!</li>
      <li>I really love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this cleanser is that is doesn&#x27;t have an overly perfumy smell.</li>
      <li>It is very effective and also very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I had been putting day cream, night cream on my face and neck 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year; however, on talking to a nurse practitioner that told me for a man of my age, &amp;#34;you have beautiful skin&amp;#34;, and told her and a Dermatologist MD that I used creams 24-7, he told me to give my skin a break, and to scrub my face with the Nina Montee and use astringent, or alcohol to go over my face and neck making sure that my face is good and clean, and do it only before going to bed.</li>
      <li>Nina Montee&#x27;s Exfoliating Cleanser is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve tried for a number of reasons: it didn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin, it smells great, makes my face feel clean, and it exfoliates my face is a light and gentle way.</li>
      <li>I bought the cleanser to complement the moisturizer, and I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with both of these products so far!</li>
      <li>(and most important)</li>
      <li>Nina Montee offers both great quality and price.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It makes the skin very smooth and of course clean.</li>
      <li>The pump bottle makes it easy to use in the shower.</li>
      <li>And I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it</li>
      <li>I am so happy with the price and size--8 oz bottle, I know it will last a good long time and not only make my skin feel great but won&#x27;t put a dent in my budget!</li>
      <li>I really like this cleanser because it really does a great job at exfoliating my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels smooth and refreshed each time I use it.  </li>
      <li>It just feels so fresh on your skins and as if it is made of silk thread which of course it is not because what I love is</li>
      <li>I would highly recomend this product!!!!</li>
      <li>It has a lovely subtle smell but the best bit is just how your face feels when you rinse it off....</li>
      <li>The Arnica is simply the best wash for sensitive skin makeup wearers.  </li>
      <li>This exfoliating cleanser works very well with my skin making it very smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>I have been on a long search for a perfect cleanser for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>For best results I use this cleanser with NINA MONTEE Corrective Moisturizing Complex, and my face literally glows.</li>
      <li>I know that sounds kind of like a commercial, but it&#x27;s true!  </li>
      <li>The moisturizer leaves my face nice and smooth and moisturized, not dry or greasy.</li>
      <li>My skin feels fresh and clean every time I use this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I have tried many facial cleansers before, and this one is definitely the best one so far!</li>
      <li>It feels like it is gently getting off all the grease, oil, and make-up from the day, leaveing me feeling fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>It is a gentle cleanser with a granulated texture that lightly exfoliates my skin while cleansing it.  </li>
      <li>My skin always feels fresh after using it and it gets rid of any irritation or bacteria that build up on my skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I have a vivid imagination or maybe this is just a product that makes your skin feel very special.</li>
      <li>It leaves the skin feeling clean and ready to apply the face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I had been using Aqua Glycolic Scrub for a long time and it is really good; however, stumbled on NINA MONTEE FACIAL SCRUB having many positive reviews and thought I would try it.</li>
      <li>This has improved skin tremendously, and has made my face and neck look so very vibrant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been few days since I started using it, and so far so good!</li>
      <li>Finally, a reasonably priced product that works!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great match to the Moisturizing Complex</li>
      <li>It is gentle on the skin and your pocketbook!</li>
      <li>The NM Exfoliating Cleanser, however, really knocks out those pore issues!  </li>
      <li>At night, if I have worn makeup throughout the day, I use the Arnica face wash first (to remove the makeup), and follow it with the NM Exfoliating</li>
      <li>After just 3 months of using it every day my skin has really changed!  </li>
      <li>A small amount yields surprising results.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It cleans my makeup off really well.</li>
      <li>but, this one really does</li>
      <li>I would really recommend it.</li>
      <li>Nina Montee Face cleanser and moisturizer are the real deal.</li>
      <li>I really like this cleanser</li>
      <li>(I had never ordered beauty products online before), but I really like this face soap.</li>
      <li>It really does take off your make up without drying your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It deep cleans and the high AHA does a fabulous job of removing flakes and peeling skin</li>
      <li>I used a cleanser that comes with Clarisonic Mia device for the fast few months, but when I ran out, I start using Nina cleanser, and I like it better.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended to everyone.</li>
      <li>It left my skin feeling fresh and new.</li>
      <li>The exfoliating cleanser isn&#x27;t too rough and it really helps get rid of makeup and leaves my skin clear and clean.</li>
      <li>My skin has a new brightness and tone</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I could live without it</li>
      <li>- feels very natural.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ... this product does what it claims to do.  If one uses long wearing makeup, or waterproof, you may want to use this cleanser with another.  I do.  I wash with NM Exfoliating Cleanser, and then follow it with an Arnica Face Wash (either Priana or Credentials), in the morning.  At night, if I have worn makeup throughout the day, I use the Arnica face wash first (to remove the makeup), and follow it with the NM Exfoliating Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NM wash will remove the makeup, if you don&#x27;t want to have an extra cleanser - with some effort and extra washes.  It&#x27;s, also, a bit tough on the eyes - where the Arnica wash is not tough on anything!  The Arnica is simply the best wash for sensitive skin makeup wearers.  The NM Exfoliating Cleanser, however, really knocks out those pore issues!  So many products claim to - but, this one really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 years old, with hyper sensitive and oily skin (however, the oil production of my face is slowing a bit).  This wash seems to, perhaps, affect my sensitivities a bit - except when I follow it with the Arnica face wash, which washes away any potential irritants.  Having said that, my skin is quite clear, and my pores cleaned and shrinking, for reals.  I can&#x27;t believe it - a simple couple of products which do what they say they do... Nina Montee Face cleanser and moisturizer are the real deal.</li>
    <li> Nina Montee Exfoliating Cleanser is a great face wash that I started using after my teenager&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it to help his acne. The doctor said the gentle daily exfoliation could help reduce my wrinkles and sun damage as well - and it did!  I highly recommend this product for both mature skin like mine and young troubled skin like my son&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product works great!! It cleans deep within your pores and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and flawless!! You should definitely try it out!!</li>
    <li> After just 3 months of using it every day my skin has really changed!  I know that sounds kind of like a commercial, but it&#x27;s true!  My skin has a new brightness and tone and I don&#x27;t even need to use foundation anymore (something I could never imagine living without before).</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser, I usually just scrub my face with wash cloth or soft face brush to remove the dead layers of skin on top, but I was always wondering if I&#x27;m doing in too hard and possibly damaging my skin. I tried this cleanser because it said it was exfoliating and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It really works, it removed the dead skin cells very well and it was not harsh or drying in any way. I also see the difference in the size of my pores too, they look a lot smaller since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It is gentle on the skin, yet does a great job exfoliating. My skin glows after using this product. I only started using it recently, but ever since I started my friends are seeing the difference.</li>
    <li> My neighbor introduced me to Nina Montee products. I was skeptical at first (I had never ordered beauty products online before), but I really like this face soap. Here&#x27;s what I like about it: No strong fragrance. 2. The pump bottle makes it easy to use in the shower. 3. (and most important) it cleared up my skin like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used. I have had tiny pimples on my forehead for years. It wasn&#x27;t serious acne, but it was persistent. Since I started using this face soap the blemishes have cleared up and the tiny scars that were all over my forehead have also healed. I am totally happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend. The price is great from all the things it does. It really does take off your make up without drying your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been few days since I started using it, and so far so good! It says exfoliating, but it does not contain those small beads to scrape off your dead skin, but it is actually really gentle.&lt;br /&gt;For this price, I think it is a great bargain. It can compare to come of the expensive skin care products (and I&#x27;ve been using expensive stuff!).</li>
    <li> This is a really awesome cleanser! I was looking for something that would be strong enough to thoroughly remove all my makeup at the end if the day, but at the same time be gentle on my skin so that it doesn&#x27;t leave it dry and dehydrated..well, I&#x27;m happy to say that Nina Montee exfoliating cleanser delivered! I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  It feels like it is gently getting off all the grease, oil, and make-up from the day, leaveing me feeling fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> This cleanser exfoliates the dead cells and leave my skin smooth and without brown spots. Bingo!  I didn&#x27;t know that this was possible, but it works and my skin never once got irritated, red or flaky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this amazing cleanser/exfoliator for years! It took care of all the things I used to hate on my face (tiny bumps, acne, dark spots, enlarged pores).  In fact, it has helped me save a ton of money over the years because I can often skip my monthly facials.  My girlfriends are using it as well and they love it!  My friend used to buy it at her dermatologist&#x27;s office in California and had to send it to Boston for me but now I&#x27;m happy I can order my own Nina Montee products from Amazon! (I also use their Corrective Moisturizing Complex.)</li>
    <li> I bought the cleanser to complement the moisturizer, and I was not disappointed! Great product, gentle on the skin, yet effective. My skin looks and feels smooth and refreshed each time I use it.  I used a cleanser that comes with Clarisonic Mia device for the fast few months, but when I ran out, I start using Nina cleanser, and I like it better. I willl definitely continue to use it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Nina Montee&#x27;s Exfoliating Cleanser is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve tried for a number of reasons: it didn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin, it smells great, makes my face feel clean, and it exfoliates my face is a light and gentle way. Being a big bottle, I can tell this exfoliating face cleanser will go a long way. That&#x27;s a good thing--I love it.</li>
    <li> Finally, a reasonably priced product that works! Convenient and unpretentious. A small amount yields surprising results. All in one cleanser and exfoliator.....my skin is so happy!</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser because it really does a great job at exfoliating my skin. It seems to have shrunk my pores as well. It makes the skin very smooth and of course clean. I would really recommend it. In combination with the cream it does wonders. You won&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> The Nina Montee Exfoliating Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other exfoliating cleansers. It leaves the skin feeling clean and ready to apply the face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I had been using Aqua Glycolic Scrub for a long time and it is really good; however, stumbled on NINA MONTEE FACIAL SCRUB having many positive reviews and thought I would try it. This is an amazing product. &amp;#34;AMAZIMNG&amp;#34; with &#x27;sunblock&#x27; and acids that will literally go deep in the pores of the skin, removing dead skin, and rejuvenates. This has improved skin tremendously, and has made my face and neck look so very vibrant. *I had been putting day cream, night cream on my face and neck 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year; however, on talking to a nurse practitioner that told me for a man of my age, &amp;#34;you have beautiful skin&amp;#34;, and told her and a Dermatologist MD that I used creams 24-7, he told me to give my skin a break, and to scrub my face with the Nina Montee and use astringent, or alcohol to go over my face and neck making sure that my face is good and clean, and do it only before going to bed. Why? You need to let your skin breathe and allow your natural oil to come out. I started doing this and it&#x27;s amazing. I hope you can understand what I just wrote, and hope you will try this great scrub. NINA MONTEE</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser. I first got it at the Montanya Spa in Orange County (a great place!) where I used a gift certificate for my birthday. The beautician recommended it for my sensitive skin. I can definitely say that Nina Montee Exfoliating Cleanser did not dry out my skin. It cleans my makeup off really well.</li>
    <li> I have tried many facial cleansers before, and this one is definitely the best one so far! I use every morning and evening, and while it is great for getting off the toughest make-up, it is also very gentle on my skin. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Initially, I was hesitant to use a daily exfoliating cleanser. However, after trying Nina Montee&#x27;s cleanser I was convince it was good idea. It cleans throughly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.  When used in conjunction with Nina Montee&#x27;s non-oily moisturizer, my skin has never been better. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best exfoliating cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommended to everyone. Since I started using it my skin feels so much better. My mother and sisters now use it and love it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product does what it claims to do: it thoroughly cleans my skin while the Alpha Hydroxy Acid gently removes the dead cells. My skin feels fresh and clean every time I use this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This product blew me away! I have dark, normal to oily skin, but this cleanser keeps my skin sparkling! It deep cleans and the high AHA does a fabulous job of removing flakes and peeling skin so I don&#x27;t have to use a scrub. My skin is softer, smoother and more even-toned. No other glycolic cleanser even comes close!</li>
    <li> I loved the cleanser! It left my skin feeling fresh and new. While using it you can feel the exfiliating bits doing their work! In combination with Nina Montee moisturiser my skin felt suple and so young. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Nina Montee skin-care products, and I have been using them for the past 10 years.  I can honestly say that the NINA MONTEE Exfoliating Cleanser is my favorite beauty product of all time.  I don&#x27;t think I could live without it and I am glad that I don&#x27;t have to.  It is a gentle cleanser with a granulated texture that lightly exfoliates my skin while cleansing it.  My skin always feels fresh after using it and it gets rid of any irritation or bacteria that build up on my skin.  My other favorite product is the NINA MONTEE Corrective Moisturizing Complex. It has potent Alpha Hydroxy acid (AHA) that removes brown spots and wrinkles.  It is very effective and also very moisturizing.  It is an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; cream, it combines a moisturizer, sunscreen and bleaching agents.  These two products make my beauty regiment very simple. The results are immediate and my skin looks and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a soap and water on the face girl now I have kids demanding my attention so when my husband treated me to this along with the moisturiser, boy did I notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is just so silky on the face and reminds me of the potions I concocted with rose petals as a child in my wendy house tucked away in our shrubbery. It just feels so fresh on your skins and as if it is made of silk thread which of course it is not because what I love is it is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS or made in silk worm sweat shops that give you a frisson of guilt every time you look at the product. It has a lovely subtle smell but the best bit is just how your face feels when you rinse it off....like you have been kissed by the most delicate and fragrant snails from the fairy gardens.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have a vivid imagination or maybe this is just a product that makes your skin feel very special. I think my days of soap and water may be behind me now.[[ASIN:B009K1EG1O NINA MONTEE Exfoliating Cleanser, 8 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great for sensitive skin.  I love the way it smells and the pump bottle is very easy to use.  It is gentle on the skin and your pocketbook!</li>
    <li> I have been on a long search for a perfect cleanser for my sensitive skin. I have dry, sensitive skin, and this cleanser has worked wonders for my face. For best results I use this cleanser with NINA MONTEE Corrective Moisturizing Complex, and my face literally glows. I am in love with this cleanser! Absolutely perfect product!</li>
    <li> Nina Montee offers both great quality and price. I have sensitive skin and this cleanser worked well for my ski - not harsh at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this cleanser is that is doesn&#x27;t have an overly perfumy smell. It cleans without overdrying my skin, and works great.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product--there are soooo many face cleansers to choose from that sometimes its overwhelming. I am so happy with the price and size--8 oz bottle, I know it will last a good long time and not only make my skin feel great but won&#x27;t put a dent in my budget! It&#x27;s a great match to the Moisturizing Complex [[ASIN:B009JBJSCC NINA MONTEE Corrective Moisturizing Complex SPF 15, 2 oz]]</li>
    <li> I am in my mid thirties and still have random minor breakouts. I can&#x27;t use typical acne cleansers because they dry out my skin. This exfoliating cleanser works very well with my skin making it very smooth and clean. After using it just a few times, I could feel a difference in my skin. I would highly recomend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the corrective moisturizing complex and exfoliating cleanser and I&#x27;m really happy with both of these products so far! The moisturizer leaves my face nice and smooth and moisturized, not dry or greasy. And I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it - feels very natural. The exfoliating cleanser isn&#x27;t too rough and it really helps get rid of makeup and leaves my skin clear and clean.</li>
