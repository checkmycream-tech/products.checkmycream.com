    <li> it&#x27;s way to expensive for it&#x27;s low quality.</li>
    <li> This cologne does not smell like Baron. Very disappointed in this bottle. Returning it. I&#x27;m not paying $50 for this.</li>
    <li> Sooo happy I found it , use to buy in the&lt;br /&gt;80&#x27;s .</li>
    <li> My husband used this colongue when we were first married over 30 years ago and then we could not find it anymore.  This is great!!!  He is my 35 year old husband again!!!</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite but it arrived busted open and was spilled all over inside the box😞</li>
    <li> I buy this cologne since years ago and when I was really young. I would say 40 years. For some reason I lost it for some time because I think the company stopped making for a while. I love this brand because it is different to many and last longer on you that others. When you get close to others who know you, even the eyes closed, they will know it is you by the way it smells. Nice.</li>
    <li> Bad smell, almost sour. Don&#x27;t know if it is a knock off or not, but this is the second bottle that smells this way. Not happy!!</li>
    <li> This is a unique fragrance</li>
    <li> Forgot how yummy this smelled back in the day... and still smells the same... yummy!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son because he remembers the fragrance.  I checked it out and decided to keep it for myseld now I must order one for him. . . it never made it back into the box as a post christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I loved this cologne in the 1990&#x27;s and could not find it till just recently so I purchased it. Sorry the scent is not as lasting or as powerful. Can only guess there is not the same amounts of oil in it. Was disappointed. Package arrived in good shape and in timely fashion but product itself is inferior.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!  This is my FAVORITE cologne for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found The Baron in the 1970s -- I was 20-something -  and got my then boyfriend to wear it -- yes, I&#x27;m female -- and I didn&#x27;t force him to wear it, but he liked it too, and then when all the other &#x27;girls&#x27; gave him lots of compliments about it, he liked it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Baron was originally made by Charles Revson company and has not been available since Revson stopped making it -- until this version by LTL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original &amp;#34;The Baron&amp;#34; cologne was very different from the other men&#x27;s cologne that were popular in the 1970s like Old Spice, English Leather or BRUT -- which actually made me ill and gave me a violent headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Baron is understated and not too sweet or overwhelming.  It has a clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Women love it and you&#x27;ll get lots of compliments because it is so different from other men&#x27;s fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the new version made by LTL Fragrances is exactly the same as the original that was made by Charles Revson, but if it is anything close -- TRY IT !</li>
