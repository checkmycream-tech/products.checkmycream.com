      <li>Shaving soap should lather up a lot better.    </li>
      <li>I look forward to hearing the comments I am sure to receive.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Shaving is now more enjoyable to him.</li>

      <li>The soap lathers nice and has a nice soft scent.</li>
      <li>Fantastic price.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic delivery</li>
      <li>The brush is soft but seems like it takes forever to get a good lather with it</li>
      <li>And I love the way it smells ;)</li>
      <li>Brings back the old barber shop shave and an enjoyable fragerance  Happy to find the old time enjoyment of that kind of shave</li>
      <li>This is a good quality shave set for such a low price,and the soap smells good.</li>
      <li>I just bought it to have an extra brush because the prize is really good.</li>
      <li>to quote Wikipedia:  \\&quot;Burma-Shave&#x27;s own roadside signs frequently ridiculed \\&quot;Grandpa&#x27;s old-fashioned shaving brush.\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The brush is nice and soft too.</li>
      <li>This kit is a perfect way to just slow down and put in the time to get a great feeling shave.    </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>and actually the replacement bars are right at the grocery store cheap and better scents than the original.</li>
      <li>For a few bucks, this is a great deal.  </li>
      <li>The tin, the mug, and the soap are a really nice extra bonus for me.</li>
      <li>The price is certainly right.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fail me -- the soap smelled nice, though wasn&#x27;t anything remarkable</li>
      <li>So far he is really liking it, and is shaving more.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for the speedy service.</li>
      <li>Was a little worried at first,because the brush was made of boar hair and not badger,but I have to say I was surprised at how good the brush preformed,holds the soap well and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I got this for my husband for Christmas, because he only shaves once a week, and I was hoping this would encourage him to shave more often.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how quickly I received my order.</li>
      <li>The bars last a long time ,make good lather</li>
      <li>the mug is nice but for me seems a little confining to make lather with, the brush handle bangs of the side when you try to make lather and if you don&#x27;t want to wake anyone up</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a sentiment, a feeling--this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>Product was everything and more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Don</li>
      <li>I was expecting a real shaving mug.</li>
      <li>I once had a similar Old Spice set many years ago, and remembered it fondly.</li>
      <li>The brush is quite rough compared to the Van Der Hagen one (though, admittedly, my Van Der Hagen brush fell off the handle after about six months), and it&#x27;s also a good bit smaller and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the soap as well.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
      <li>The mug is a classic that may one day hold coffee for me.</li>
      <li>The brush won&#x27;t last long, so if you are real brush and mug shaver, get a better product.  </li>
      <li>If your new to DE shaving learn how to use the brush and soap the right way, many web site&#x27;s well tell you how, there is a right and wrong way to use a brush.</li>
      <li>Based on the picture, I expected an old style tin which is the primary reason I ordered this.  </li>
      <li>Also, this doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the original Burma-Shave, other than having bought the brand:  </li>
      <li>The tin was an unexpected bonus as far as quality too!</li>
      <li>The mug should have been short and a little more rounded.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to complete this review.</li>
      <li>WOW......</li>
      <li>The soap leaves his skin soft.</li>
      <li>My husband has been bugging for a long time now about getting the old fashioned shave kit - I really surprised him with this one for Christmas - he absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>Great quality and price - and the nostalgic tin can container was a plus!</li>
      <li>If you are an old timer this will being back memories and as far as this Burma shave kit it is a good deal, I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong, been using mine every day with no complaints.   </li>
      <li>The mug is classy and hold pretty much and soap well and is deep and wide enough not to engulf your fingers in lather.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s a Christmas (can we still say that?) so I just briefly looked @ it. There is a dent in the can it all comes in. Not the end of the world but this vendor should be admonished,for not giving a D---.</li>
    <li> The price is certainly right.  The tin had a few little dents in it when it arrived.  It&#x27;s not a collector&#x27;s item so it was no big deal.</li>
    <li> The brush is quite rough compared to the Van Der Hagen one (though, admittedly, my Van Der Hagen brush fell off the handle after about six months), and it&#x27;s also a good bit smaller and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the soap as well.  (They&#x27;re about the same price; I&#x27;d go with the Van Der Hagen having tried both.)    Also, this doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the original Burma-Shave, other than having bought the brand:  to quote Wikipedia:  \\&quot;Burma-Shave&#x27;s own roadside signs frequently ridiculed \\&quot;Grandpa&#x27;s old-fashioned shaving brush.\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a good quality shave set for such a low price,and the soap smells good.Was a little worried at first,because the brush was made of boar hair and not badger,but I have to say I was surprised at how good the brush preformed,holds the soap well and goes on smooth.I love it.Shipping time took one week which was ok for me.Give it a try you can&#x60;t go wrong before there all gone.</li>
    <li> Product was everything and more than I expected.  I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set to look at.But the mug is only a coffee cup. I was expecting a real shaving mug. The mug should have been short and a little more rounded. Also the soap is of very low quality. It is nothing but face soap. Shaving soap should lather up a lot better.    The brush is very good and the tin box that the kit came in is very nice.    Over all I was a little disappointed and if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle I would have returned it and located a real shaving mug kit.    If you can find it, the Old Spice Mug and Brush are the best.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff. He hates to shave but tells all his friends about Burma Shave products. And I love the way it smells ;)</li>
    <li> When I saw an ad for the Burma shave mug and brush, I just knew I had to display it in the half bathroom in my home.  Not only did I receive the mug and brush, but soap and a little brochure with memories of the signs displayed along the routes I used to travel as a child.  And all in an attractive Burma Shave tin.  These items can be viewed almost immediately upon entering the room.  What a conversation piece!  I look forward to hearing the comments I am sure to receive.</li>
    <li> Based on the picture, I expected an old style tin which is the primary reason I ordered this.  The package is a thin cardboard box and the brush isn&#x27;t separately packaged.  It arrived quickly. This is part of a Christmas gift so I don&#x27;t know the brush or soap quality yet.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction. Excellent product. I don&#x27;t know how to complete this review. Is there any reason amazon.com and thousands of other web sites can&#x27;t get their heads together and come up with a standard method of review or feedback? Something on the order of starting automobiles. I shouldn&#x27;t have to be a computer expert or spend several minutes to understand what you&#x27;re asking of me.  Thanks, Don</li>
    <li> Incredible price! Fantastic delivery - it comes in it&#x27;s own presention metal box - and it works exactly as described! Both my husband and my step-father are proud owners and I am never going to tell them I made them so happy for $4.99 each! They even included the soap for the mug! The soap alone is $2.68 at the discount store. Great value for someone who wants a shaving mug, brush and soap.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the quality of the product and soap is wonderful. Shaving is now more enjoyable to him. The soap leaves his skin soft.</li>
    <li> When your father says how his dad shaved like that.    This kit is a perfect way to just slow down and put in the time to get a great feeling shave.    I&#x27;ve had this kit for almost a year and the soap is still good. For a guy like me who hangs around nerds with poor grooming standards, this kit makes you shave right. Believe me the ladies notice.</li>
    <li> For a few bucks, this is a great deal.  The brush won&#x27;t last long, so if you are real brush and mug shaver, get a better product.  If you are looking for a sentiment, a feeling--this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Very nice fine quality materials, eye appealing.  Will be used as display only.  Fantastic price.  I remember the sings along the highway years back. Burma-Shave.</li>
    <li> The soap lathers nice and has a nice soft scent. The brush is soft but seems like it takes forever to get a good lather with it and i wasn&#x27;t too inpressed the handle on it is hollow plastic. the mug is nice but for me seems a little confining to make lather with, the brush handle bangs of the side when you try to make lather and if you don&#x27;t want to wake anyone up it&#x27;s pretty loud. It is nice as a starter set and gives you the basics but i give you about 2 weeks till you start looking for better items to replace.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the shaving mug only so the other stuff was a bonus</li>
    <li> I just got this tin the other day and haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, but I&#x27;m really impressed by it.. I just bought it to have an extra brush because the prize is really good. The tin, the mug, and the soap are a really nice extra bonus for me. The soap smells really nice. The brush is nice and soft too. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another set for myself and a couple for gifts. They are really nice.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these kits (2 for my sons and 1 for me). I think the soap works great and actually the replacement bars are right at the grocery store cheap and better scents than the original. The bars last a long time ,make good lather and you don&#x27;t have to throw the can in the land fill after! Brush is MADE IN AMERICA..........WOW......by EverReady...like the battery.</li>
    <li> If you are an old timer this will being back memories and as far as this Burma shave kit it is a good deal, I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong, been using mine every day with no complaints.   If your new to DE shaving learn how to use the brush and soap the right way, many web site&#x27;s well tell you how, there is a right and wrong way to use a brush.</li>
    <li> The quality of the item was very good. I was surprised at how quickly I received my order. Thank you very much for the speedy service.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband on valentines day and he loves it !</li>
    <li> I bought this for giggles -- I once had a similar Old Spice set many years ago, and remembered it fondly. It didn&#x27;t fail me -- the soap smelled nice, though wasn&#x27;t anything remarkable (if you want remarkable, see Col Conk), the brush was surprisingly good -- my eldest son confiscated mine. The mug is a classic that may one day hold coffee for me. Fun, inexpensive, and a great intro into the art of shaving with a mug and brush!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, because he only shaves once a week, and I was hoping this would encourage him to shave more often. So far he is really liking it, and is shaving more. I&#x27;m liking it a lot. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product for my father and he just loves it! I mighht just have to buy one for myself to see what he&#x27;s talking about.</li>
    <li> i bought this for the novelty of it, i remember growing up seeing the last few of the burma shave signs along peoples farms, i think it was well after burma shave was gone. so i bought this just to see, honestly i like the set, but using shave soap just isnt for me, i like my gillette better</li>
    <li> My husband has been bugging for a long time now about getting the old fashioned shave kit - I really surprised him with this one for Christmas - he absolutely loves it! Great quality and price - and the nostalgic tin can container was a plus!</li>
    <li> Great mug, great soap too actually.  I re-knotted the brush with badger hair because the boars from Burma Shave just aren&#x27;t my favorite.  The mug is classy and hold pretty much and soap well and is deep and wide enough not to engulf your fingers in lather.  The tin was an unexpected bonus as far as quality too!</li>
    <li> Brings back the old barber shop shave and an enjoyable fragerance  Happy to find the old time enjoyment of that kind of shave</li>
