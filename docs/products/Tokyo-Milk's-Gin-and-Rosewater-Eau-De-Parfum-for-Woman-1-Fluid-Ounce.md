### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It has a wonderful citrus scent to it.</li>
      <li>THis is my favorite perfume ever!!!</li>
      <li>Great summmer/spring scent</li>
      <li>This perfume you can smell a lot of the GIN and ROSE!</li>
      <li>This has citrus top notes like those of a lemon tree flower bulbs, just like an awesome gin, you can smell all the orange zest, lemon flower notes...</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nice!</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find it available on Amazon - and at a lower price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and not too overpowering, perfect for summer.  </li>
      <li>Very overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I just kept thinking about how good it smelled, light, pleasant, sort of floral but sort of lemony</li>
      <li>However, if you want to smell like someone just slopped a G&amp;T on your dress and then walked through a bathroom with rose scented air freshener</li>
      <li>so glad that it was quick and easy!!!</li>
      <li>You can wear it alone or add some vanilla body spray for a more warm scent.</li>
      <li>I originally found this in  a boutique, and loved it but couldn&#x27;t afford it at the time.  </li>
      <li>so fresh and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I happened upon this perfume a while ago and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now my favorite scent to wear.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>but mostly the gin on the heavier side..</li>
      <li>They are two of my all time favorites and I cannot decide which I love more.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>A nice blend of scents...not overly sweet.  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful all year round.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really is lovely, and the name is fun, too, Gin and Rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mg</li>
      <li>Both scents are available as body lotions, as well (I use them, too.)</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this combination of scents is.</li>
      <li>I usually get the best price AND free shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very sweet fragrance, the floral is more understated, but it&#x27;s very pleasant and the scent lasts several hours with only one spritz.</li>
      <li>Unique and not cloying or too overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Such a nice clean scent!</li>
      <li>Timely delivery and quality product at more than reasonable price point.</li>
      <li>The rose is barely noticeable, but it does accentuate the citrus to that spring flowery garden.</li>
      <li>I bought this in florida where its very humid and a light scent goes along way.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny and if purchased via Amazon</li>
      <li>( I do not like flowery, overpowering scents, I prefer more natural scents).  </li>
      <li>It smells fresh and not too flowery</li>
      <li>smells very much like gin when you first spray it...</li>
      <li>more gin than rosewater overall.</li>
      <li>I had purchased it a few years ago in New Orleans and was so happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but they were all out of that particular scent in that line!  </li>
      <li>, I wish I had put the money I spent on this towards a good French perfume.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is so very fresh and light without being super subtle.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend both the perfume and this vendor.</li>
      <li>This is Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Number 12 and DEAD SEXY is number 06 -</li>
      <li>Gave an extra star for the pretty bottle.</li>
      <li>One young man wanted to get it for his Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
      <li>then that&#x27;s about all you are going to get, it does not evoke anything more clever and sadly just comes out as a romantic notion of a name for a perfume that does not live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>it is not very long lasting though.</li>

<li> I finally ordered some and was very disappointed as it does not last and lacks any depth</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to overpower the room with this...its subtle.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Love the scent.  Unique and not cloying or too overpowering.  A nice blend of scents...not overly sweet.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to overpower the room with this...its subtle.</li>
    <li> I came across this item by chance and tested it out on my wrist. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this combination of scents is. It&#x27;s a very sweet fragrance, the floral is more understated, but it&#x27;s very pleasant and the scent lasts several hours with only one spritz.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this scent. This is 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve purchased for her. Timely delivery and quality product at more than reasonable price point. Highly recommend both the perfume and this vendor.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, because I love the Tokyo milk dark collection, but I was sorely disappointed in this one :(. Smells like I just got done cleaning the bathroom, like orange glow or something. Very overwhelming. Yuck. Gave an extra star for the pretty bottle.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so very fresh and light without being super subtle.  I had purchased it a few years ago in New Orleans and was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I get loads of comment even from strangers.  One young man wanted to get it for his Mother&#x27;s Day gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is lovely, and the name is fun, too, Gin and Rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mg</li>
    <li> THis is my favorite perfume ever!!! Im so glad that it was quick and easy!!! Ill remember it for the next purchase!</li>
    <li> This perfume you can smell a lot of the GIN and ROSE! but mostly the gin on the heavier side.. I stopped using this perfume because of my allergy! But it&#x27;s nice! Tamara</li>
    <li> I bought this in florida where its very humid and a light scent goes along way.  This smells just like gin and roses, so delish!  And it does not attract bugs (bonus)  I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles.  Great summmer/spring scent</li>
    <li> Such a nice clean scent!</li>
    <li> an all season scent. so fresh and pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Number 12 and DEAD SEXY is number 06 - I alternate between the two and I can&#x27;t live without them! They are two of my all time favorites and I cannot decide which I love more. Both scents are available as body lotions, as well (I use them, too.) Worth every penny and if purchased via Amazon I usually get the best price AND free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It is wonderful all year round. It has a wonderful citrus scent to it. You can wear it alone or add some vanilla body spray for a more warm scent. I will wear this forever.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I originally found this in  a boutique, and loved it but couldn&#x27;t afford it at the time.  I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about it, so I broke down and ordered it here since I lived far from the boutique I found it in.  It smells fresh and not too flowery ( I do not like flowery, overpowering scents, I prefer more natural scents).  My boyfriend loves it as well, and always compliments me when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would be a fab scent. If you love a complex and expensive perfume sadly this is not it. Gin and Rosewater was on my perfume bucket list to try for a couple of years. I finally ordered some and was very disappointed as it does not last and lacks any depth, I wish I had put the money I spent on this towards a good French perfume. However, if you want to smell like someone just slopped a G&amp;T on your dress and then walked through a bathroom with rose scented air freshener then that&#x27;s about all you are going to get, it does not evoke anything more clever and sadly just comes out as a romantic notion of a name for a perfume that does not live up to the hype.</li>

It&#x27;s not quite heavy enough in winter, so if you want to wear it then I would suggest layering it over the scented lotion.  With that it lasts all day and into the night.</li>
    <li> smells very much like gin when you first spray it...more gin than rosewater overall. it is not very long lasting though.</li>
    <li> a third of an inch is GONE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This has citrus top notes like those of a lemon tree flower bulbs, just like an awesome gin, you can smell all the orange zest, lemon flower notes... The rose is barely noticeable, but it does accentuate the citrus to that spring flowery garden.</li>
    <li> I spritzed myself with a sampler in a little shop and the scent of this perfume kept haunting me as I continued to shop.  I had to go back and purchase it - but they were all out of that particular scent in that line!  I was so disappointed.  I just kept thinking about how good it smelled, light, pleasant, sort of floral but sort of lemony (I have no idea where the gin or the rosewater come in!)  I was very happy to find it available on Amazon - and at a lower price.  It&#x27;s now my favorite scent to wear.</li>
