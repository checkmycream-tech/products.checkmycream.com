    <li> Do not buy. False advertisement. Said the product would be 4.8 oz and when I got the item, it says 1.7 oz.  Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but I really like this!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer and immediately upon application, has a glow / tan appearance!!</li>
    <li> This stuff and their lytic tx literally saved my skin! I have breakouts due to sensitive skin rather than super oily skin and these products are very calming. They also seem to help fade scars or red spots from past breakouts.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on like silk. I love that the ingredients are natural and it has a light citrus scent. I went to the epionce website and found a dr. in town that sold this product for much less.</li>
    <li> Great Product but expensive.</li>
    <li> It came in exactly as described. Very excited to buy through Amazon. Very moisturizing lotion. Love it. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested Epionce lotion for me because I have sensitivity, uneven tone &amp; break outs on my skin.  I had used it for a couple years but the price kept going up so I stopped.  It had helped with my skin issues in the past and because I was able to buy at a reduced price I have gone back to it.  Within a month my skin just GLOWS &amp; I love it.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Fast service.  Product just as promised.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea which means delicate easily irritated skin. The Epionce product line is one of the few in a lifetime of products that never stings or causes systemic allergic or rash responses. The Renewal Facial Lotion is soothing and non-greasy.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Cannot rave about this facial lotion enough. I have my friends using it now.</li>
    <li> Not the oz that it said it was when purchasing</li>
    <li> I recently started using this line and have friends comment that I suddenly have &amp;#34;J Lo&amp;#34; skin.  The dermatologist&#x27;s office charged $30 dollars MORE than Amazon Prime so I am soooo happy to have found it here.  Amazing product line!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely thrilled that I could find this on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Discovered this at my doctor&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;Meets and exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Love it wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and will NOT change. 1 bottle lasted 8 months &amp; when I changed product, my face broke out. I use the lyric for acne &amp; the eye renewal and have had success with each product! I thought I would out grow &amp;#34;bad skin&amp;#34; but it runs in the family. Thanks to Epionce, my skin looks great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Epionce this year and really like this lotion.  My face has cystic breakouts and many of the medications dry my face out a lot.  I started using this and no more dry skin.  Any ever better is my skin isn&#x27;t oily either...just perfectly moisturized!  I ran out for a couple weeks and I could tell my skin was drier without it.  I plan to never run out again, although I might try the light formula since I do have sensitive skin.  I wish a bottle lasted longer...1 pump in the morning and 1 pump in the evening...but not a deal breaker.  I use this with the lytic cleanser, lytic cream, and toner.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Have you looked at the price? This cannot cost nearly 1k dollars. Has someone compared that with the actual value?</li>
