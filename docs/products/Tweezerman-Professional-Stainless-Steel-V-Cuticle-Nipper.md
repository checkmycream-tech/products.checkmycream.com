      <li>But like I said just figure them out and you will be happy you purchased them.</li>
      <li>this item was not made in China as I&#x27;ve learned over the years that the words &amp;#34;Good Quality&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; are never seen together in product reviews (although it would be welcome change if they were once in a while).</li>
      <li>Great idea, to have the nippers work like tweeers.  </li>

      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>Great tweezers-best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m planning to give it as gifts to all the females in my family.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>and they cutters come with a very nicely designed leatherette case.</li>
      <li>Great nippers and even used by my husband who has taken them as his own</li>

      <li>So far it was wonderful</li>
      <li>I bought a bargain one for home and since the Tweezerman is so much better, I threw it away and bought these.</li>
      <li>I love this tool.  </li>
      <li>this clipper works much better than scissors.  </li>
      <li>I get so many hang nails in the winter and ripping them off causes more damage and pain that nipping them.  </li>
      <li>Love the protective case it comes in too.  </li>
      <li>I like the shape of this cuticle nipper much more than the others I have seen.  </li>
      <li>These are better than any nippers I have ever used for self manicures/pedicures.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is just okay.  </li>
      <li>One of the best purchases I made last year.</li>
      <li>Am I glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Excellent quality, solid construction, easy to use.</li>
      <li>Top quality and easy to use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such an excellent tool that I was more than willing to pay $20+ for it.</li>
      <li>I have been impressed with my other Tweezerman products</li>
      <li>Easy to use and grip with one hand.  </li>
      <li>This is a very sharp wonderful product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Tweezerman implements.  </li>
      <li>I buy Tweezerman because their products never disappoint AND they sharpen for free.  </li>
      <li>These are fantastic, just like their tweezers.</li>
      <li>padded leather case has nice magnetic closure and just fancies up the whole shebang&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cuts precisely and close to skin without hurting.</li>
      <li>This thing does a fantastic job at clipping the cuticle.</li>
      <li>They are super easy to use and efficient.</li>
      <li>Just got the hang of it, it is very easy to cut too much.</li>
      <li>I really like them and find them very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It may take some practice to get used to using a clipper of this unique design, but I think it has it&#x27;s advantages for removing hangnails and split nails.</li>
      <li>they are sharp, the ends meet up perfectly, and they are quality stainless steel.</li>
      <li>Great item, delivered way before expected.</li>
      <li>this is so easy to use--i am honestly surprised more people don&#x27;t use this type of nipper.</li>
      <li>Stainless and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I have to hold it very far up front for the best leverage and still it doesn&#x27;t snip half the time.  </li>
      <li>I prefer my handled cuticle nipper for everyday use, but this one is great for travel or a purse.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s right there</li>
      <li>It feels like it should&#x27;ve been good quality, but exactly 3 months later the thing fell apart with normal use.</li>
      <li>Stays very sharp and does a good job.  </li>
      <li>I keep them handy to remove those dry cuticles I get living in the southwest.</li>
      <li>These are the best - and I mean THE BEST cuticle trimmers you can buy - and they are not that expensive!</li>
      <li>My thumbs aren&#x27;t very strong after carpal tunnel surgeries, so this may have a lot to do with this thing just not cutting when I depress the jaws.  </li>
      <li>So much better than any of the traditional ones I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
      <li>Like them BETTER than regular cuticle clippers.</li>
      <li>padded leather case is purple, not awful, but not my first choice of color&lt;br /&gt;4) not any easier to use with non-dominant hand than traditional nippers, despite claims of ergonomic design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re nice and sharp, too - just make sure you&#x27;ve positioned them properly!</li>
      <li>and easy to use with both right and left hands.</li>
      <li>I got it fast, with more than enough time to wrap it in time for Christmas</li>
      <li>They just are not sharp enough - I have more hangnails now than I ever had!</li>
      <li>However, well worth the effort as I now find  them more controllable and efficient than any other</li>
      <li>This one works just as good if not better.</li>
      <li>A pure joy to use as you can accurately and safely get the ragged cuticles without having a bloody misshap.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest raising the cuticles with another tool and using these only to snip as I have bled many times.</li>
      <li>They are very very sharp though and do a nice job once positioned correctly.</li>
      <li>Its amazing how just having the nipping end turned slightly makes a WORLD of a difference.</li>
      <li>Very well made and handles like a dream.</li>
      <li>Fast transaction, purchase to shipment received.</li>
      <li>The company that I purchased from offered blazing fast shipping</li>
      <li>I was very relieved to find</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I would not use these in place of nail clippers as they don&#x27;t seem to have as much &amp;#34;clipping power&amp;#34; (?)</li>
      <li>Nice and heavy quality stainless steel.</li>
      <li>I prefer the tweezer-like pinch approach more than the squeeze mechanism that other nippers employ.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic for hang nails, too, due to the nice sharp point.</li>
      <li>high quality stainless steel implement</li>
      <li>Glad to have a new one with a pink case.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have bought two of these as gifts, and I keep the mini version in my purse.  They are very easy to use with either hand.  I would not use these in place of nail clippers as they don&#x27;t seem to have as much &amp;#34;clipping power&amp;#34; (?) as regular clippers.  They are a more specialized tool, great for hangnails and cuticles.  Their shape allows for precision cutting - you can eliminate the entire hangnail without cutting surrounding skin.. They&#x27;re nice and sharp, too - just make sure you&#x27;ve positioned them properly!</li>
    <li> This thing does a fantastic job at clipping the cuticle. I thought it was going to somehow remove the dead skin on the nail, too, but as I discovered later you just apply cuticle remover to get that stuff off. This is fantastic for hang nails, too, due to the nice sharp point. I broke down a while ago and purchased Tweezerman tweezers, also a step up from the 12 dollar pair I had before. This company does a really good job w/precision instruments.</li>
    <li> As advertised! Fast transaction, purchase to shipment received.</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have the flimsy pieces that provide the spring load but get caught trying to put in or remove from my manicure case or are so sharp to my fingers. This is very sharp, but I&#x27;ve had to relearn how to set it to get it aligned properly with my cuticle so as to get the proper angle and amount of cuticle removed.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers-best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is the best!  These nippers work in the tiniest little corner of my fingernail.  I buy Tweezerman because their products never disappoint AND they sharpen for free.  I&#x27;ve sent several items to them for sharpening and appreciate extending the usefulness.</li>
    <li> I get so many hang nails in the winter and ripping them off causes more damage and pain that nipping them.  This tool has been a lifesaver this winter.  I think I trim at least 1 hang nail every few days.  Tweezerman has quality tools.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I made last year. Excellent quality, solid construction, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick and easy delivery!</li>
    <li> this clipper works much better than scissors.  It gets that hangnail or other item and clips it well. I have several of these, in different rooms so I know where to find them!</li>
    <li> So far it was wonderful and I wish I had known about it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to a friend as a gift.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It feels like it should&#x27;ve been good quality, but exactly 3 months later the thing fell apart with normal use.</li>
    <li> Take a little getting use to. I cut myself a time or two before I got the knack. However, well worth the effort as I now find  them more controllable and efficient than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Tweezerman implements.  I&#x27;m also the sort of girl who grows hangnails like nobody&#x27;s business, some I liken to trees, they&#x27;re so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this style nipper, thinking that it would enable me to get a cleaner cut in those harder to reach places right up against the nail plate, and I was sorely disappointed.  While this implement is sharp, the jaw is clunky and cumbersome, despite being 1/4 size.  It certainly does not enable me to reach anything that I couldn&#x27;t nip with the traditional style nippers, [[ASIN:B009BMFU6M Tweezerman Professional Rockhard Stainless Cuticle Nipper - 1/4 Jaw - -]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) compact size makes slipping it into a purse or toiletry kit easy&lt;br /&gt;2) padded leather case keeps jaw from hacking up stuff in said purse or toiletry kit&lt;br /&gt;3) padded leather case has nice magnetic closure and just fancies up the whole shebang&lt;br /&gt;4) jaw is sharp&lt;br /&gt;5) high quality stainless steel implement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) V-style does not confer any additional benefit ---&gt; misleading copy, \\&quot;Eases tension on nail.\\&quot; (Product Description)&lt;br /&gt;2) Clunky jaw may even make reaching tight spots MORE difficult&lt;br /&gt;3) padded leather case is purple, not awful, but not my first choice of color&lt;br /&gt;4) not any easier to use with non-dominant hand than traditional nippers, despite claims of ergonomic design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is just okay.  That was a bit disappointing to me, because the product description creates the expectation of an improvement on design as compared to tradition style nippers.  I do not recommend this to anyone who might be expecting this to outperform or be easier to use than other nippers.  However, I would recommend this item to someone who is looking for a compact nipper to carry in a purse or use for travel, as the case certainly makes carrying this sharp instrument safer, and its compact size is advantageous for travel.</li>
    <li> Great nippers and even used by my husband who has taken them as his own so I have to hunt them down when I need them.</li>
    <li> The perfect cuticle clippers.  Sharp and accurate.  Love the protective case it comes in too.  I keep them handy to remove those dry cuticles I get living in the southwest.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best tweezer nail snips ever. I&#x27;ve ordered several of these because I take them with me on trips. They are super easy to use and efficient. I do however end up losing them because I keep taking them with.</li>
    <li> Good product. I had one that I bought from CoverGirl before but they stopped making it. This one works just as good if not better. Would get it again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these! My purse was stolen &amp; I needed to get a replacement ASAP. Great tool!</li>
    <li> Super sharp and not as scary-looking as a normal cuticle nipper. Nice and heavy quality stainless steel. I prefer the tweezer-like pinch approach more than the squeeze mechanism that other nippers employ. I find the skin around my nails heals much faster when using this than my old standby: teeth. Who would&#x27;ve thought? It gets right into the little nooks and crannies where hangnails start. Nip them (pun intended) in the bud before they peel more or worse, get infected. Infections, bad. Tweezerman V-Cuticle Nipper, good.</li>
    <li> Great item, delivered way before expected.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Happened to lose mine.  I was so happy to be able to replace it.  I also like leather case.  It cuts precisely and close to skin without hurting.</li>
    <li> This is the best cuticle trimmer ever. I hate the other stye, traditional. These are one of a kind. I lost my old pair and got these immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tweezeman nippers for 20 years. It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve used these nippers, but they do take a lot of tension off of your hand. It takes a while to get used to, but you still have a lot of control with the nippers</li>
    <li> A pure joy to use as you can accurately and safely get the ragged cuticles without having a bloody misshap. Stainless and easy to clean. Very sharp and much easier to control than the other types.</li>
    <li> It may take some practice to get used to using a clipper of this unique design, but I think it has it&#x27;s advantages for removing hangnails and split nails. I was very relieved to find this item was not made in China as I&#x27;ve learned over the years that the words &amp;#34;Good Quality&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; are never seen together in product reviews (although it would be welcome change if they were once in a while). Although a bit pricey, this purchase will get you a good quality item.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic, just like their tweezers. Strong and sturdy, they have no problems clipping in the hard to get corners of my nailbeds.</li>
    <li> I love this cuticle nipper... Have to be careful when cutting because is very very sharp...&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m planning to give it as gifts to all the females in my family.&lt;br /&gt;The best I had.</li>
    <li> Everthing that I have purchased has been great!  I purchased this for a man that I worked with and he loves these. Thanks.</li>
    <li> i cannot use regular nippers; my hands just don&#x27;t work that way. this is so easy to use--i am honestly surprised more people don&#x27;t use this type of nipper. they are sharp, the ends meet up perfectly, and they are quality stainless steel. i owned my first pair for 10 years; i only replaced it because i lost it.</li>
    <li> The V-shaped cutting edges should be thinner for more precise trimming.</li>
    <li> I am used to the scissor style and find these harder to maneuver.  They are very very sharp though and do a nice job once positioned correctly.</li>
    <li> Top quality and easy to use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s larger than I expected, but other than that, I love it!  Will get around to buying one to keep in my purse; this one stays in my pen case, so when I&#x27;m working it&#x27;s right there and I don&#x27;t get tempted to bite.  Seems to be working; they&#x27;re looking better and all I&#x27;ve done is put this where it&#x27;s handy.</li>
    <li> The best cuticle cutter out there!</li>
    <li> These are the best - and I mean THE BEST cuticle trimmers you can buy - and they are not that expensive!</li>
    <li> I prefer my handled cuticle nipper for everyday use, but this one is great for travel or a purse. It is a little bigger than I expected, but they still do a good job of trimming close and they are sharp enough for a clean cut.</li>
    <li> these were awful - not precision at all!!! and the seller (Payless Beauty) wouldn&#x27;t let me return them! so mad :( total waste of money</li>
    <li> These are better than any nippers I have ever used for self manicures/pedicures. They give great control and are very sharp; with the normal type (I bought some here on Amazon for over 20$ a few weeks ago and I have to practically yank the skin off). Get them, perfect.</li>
    <li> I have a serious problem with cuticles, I hate them and I cut them almost daily. I typically use slant edge clippers but they are very hard to come by and when you do find them they are not very sharp.  These are so sharp! They do in fact cut your cuticles perfectly. I highly suggest raising the cuticles with another tool and using these only to snip as I have bled many times. Just got the hang of it, it is very easy to cut too much. But like I said just figure them out and you will be happy you purchased them.</li>
    <li> I had gotten one of these at a Sally beauty supply on clearance for $2. It&#x27;s such an excellent tool that I was more than willing to pay $20+ for it. It is awesome for cutting hangnails and other small annoying pieces of skin around your nails. I got it fast, with more than enough time to wrap it in time for Christmas</li>
    <li> Convenient to help me STOP ripping my hang nails ... I use this instead to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; my cuticles and I notice a difference. Bought a second one to have one for work bag and one for non-work bag.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these nippers! They are great! Its amazing how just having the nipping end turned slightly makes a WORLD of a difference. Over the past few years I have bought about 6 pair because when a pair gets misplaced I have no patience for picking away with the other shaped ones. I haven even gone as far as giving these as gifts. They are life changing!</li>
    <li> Good well made brand.</li>
    <li> Could be sharper.  Blades do not cut like I was told they would.</li>
    <li> Great.  Have gotten 3, 2 for gifts!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for keeping gnarly cuticles under control. Very sharp for precise nipping (just be careful that you don&#x27;t catch any live skin!) and easy to use with both right and left hands. I got a less-than-stellar manicure recently and later used these nippers to fix it! I also like that they come with a case so they don&#x27;t poke me when digging around in my makeup bag. Great value product!</li>
    <li> We live on Anegada - an island in the Caribbean. The island is covered with sandspurs (we call it buzzer grass here). You get the barbed burrs on you and the barbed tip breaks off, leaving a painful little spear in your skin. Tweezerman to the rescue. Twezerman will get them out, even when broken off flush with your skin.</li>
    <li> i had purchased this item previously, our daughter tried mine and wanted to take them home.  i said &#x27;no&#x27;, and ordered this for her.</li>
    <li> Very well made and handles like a dream. I own 3. The 1st has lasted for years.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I would never have bought these on my own, but they came as part of a pedicure kit. They just are not sharp enough - I have more hangnails now than I ever had!</li>
    <li> I like the shape of this cuticle nipper much more than the others I have seen.  Easy to use and grip with one hand.  Stays very sharp and does a good job.  I would recommend this nipper.</li>
    <li> I have to write this based on my experience.  My thumbs aren&#x27;t very strong after carpal tunnel surgeries, so this may have a lot to do with this thing just not cutting when I depress the jaws.  I have to hold it very far up front for the best leverage and still it doesn&#x27;t snip half the time.  Disappointed, I had hoped it would work better.</li>
    <li> This is my second pair of cutters.  I keep one in the office and one at home.  I bought a bargain one for home and since the Tweezerman is so much better, I threw it away and bought these.</li>
    <li> Like them BETTER than regular cuticle clippers.</li>
    <li> I love this tool.  I keep it in my purse and use it often for cuticle maintenance.  I lost a prior one and was heartbroken.  Glad to have a new one with a pink case.</li>
    <li> Why an excellent surprise these have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old, faithful, pair of Revlon cuticle clippers finally were dull enough to be foolish to use anymore. I went looking for a new pair and happened upon these. The style was different, but. I have been impressed with my other Tweezerman products so I thought that I would give them a try. Boy! Am I glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp (as they should be!), and the unique cutting action is so much more comfortable to use than my old standard design pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert! The company that I purchased from offered blazing fast shipping and they cutters come with a very nicely designed leatherette case. Mine was even purple, though you have no color choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> So much better than any of the traditional ones I&#x27;ve owned.  Will never use any other.</li>
    <li> Be careful! This is a very sharp wonderful product</li>
    <li> Great idea, to have the nippers work like tweeers.  You can get the tiniest hangnail or cuticle with these.  I really like them and find them very easy to use.  I do keep them in a leather porch as they are very sharp..</li>
