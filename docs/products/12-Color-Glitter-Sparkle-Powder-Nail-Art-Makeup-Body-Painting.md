<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Extremely  fast in shipping.  Daughter used and loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived a week sooner than expected. I love the color variations however, some of the jars a have less glitter than others.</li>
    <li> I would give negative stars if it was possible!!! I wasted my money because It was all thrown in the packaging and the vast majority of them were not sealed correctly and completely empited out!!</li>
    <li> Got a few of the same colors. Box came cracked, and the glitter was everywhere. But the mix was pretty, and the glitter goes a long way</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s less but still it looks good on nails.</li>
    <li> I did not find it useful it did not work 4the shimmer it also makes your skin itch I do not recamend this product It took 4 ever to get here too!!!!</li>
    <li> when i do my fake nails i dip the tip of my nail into the glitter pot and it makes a really nice tip and but i would make sure that you put a top coat over it to make the glitter stay</li>
    <li> These glitters were dirt cheap and they are gorgeous. Ive been using them to accent my eye shadows for holiday parties and a few times for fancy dinners. Ive also used them on my nails. They are tiny but they are only a few dollars and for the purpose of eyeshadow and nail accents, will last a good amount of time and there are 12 different colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect addition to the homemade lip gloss my elementary age students made.</li>
    <li> Very nice, good size. The colors are a little off but still pretty.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves and will be suprised at Christmas would recommend for young to middle age for entertainment. I love this!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry,i thought i was buying glitter.When the package arrived the little bottles was almost empty! Very not happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Pros;&lt;br /&gt;- Arrived much quicker than estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;- Cute reusable miniature containers...dunno what I&#x27;ll be able to use them for. Hmm, maybe my nose rings. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;- I liked 4 out of the 12 colors; electric blue, pink, violet and purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;- 8 colors were ugly.&lt;br /&gt;- I got duplicates of some colors. Such as 4 containers of an ugly off-gold.&lt;br /&gt;- THERE&#x27;S NO SILVER!&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s any ugly poop brown color and a terrible puke yellow.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 containers are only 45% full while the other 7 are only about 30% full. I&#x27;m guessing they sent duplicate colors incase you want to do all fingers in the same color. Too bad the duplicated colors are the ugly ones. Don&#x27;t think for a minute the pretty pink will be enough to do every finger.&lt;br /&gt;- TINY containers!&lt;br /&gt;- Before putting them away, go through and make sure all lids are tight. Quite a few of mine weren&#x27;t screwed on completely.&lt;br /&gt;OK, I&#x27;m tired of complaining and talking about $3 nail glitter. Basically...you&#x27;re getting what you paid for. Don&#x27;t expect much, but it&#x27;ll get the job done for some cute summer shine!&lt;br /&gt;I would only purchase these again to throw in goodie bags for a kids birthday party or something.</li>
    <li> Can barely see the color after applying the glitter. Definitely not as bright as I expected. I&#x27;d spend a little more for a better glitter if I hadn&#x27;t already opened this to test it.</li>
    <li> This glitter is to thick for glitter tattoos. They wash off almost completely by the second day. Not a great thing.</li>
    <li> I use this glitter on my nails instead of polish and I get lots of compliments.  It&#x27;s a fun alternative to polish.</li>
    <li> Glitters are too large and they are a little deceiving. It states that they are powder and used for body painting. I used them for glitter tattoos and the glitter came off wishing a day or 2 due to the large size of the glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glitter containers are not filled enough. Some are half full while others are 2/3rds full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glitter color is nice and colorful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for paper art.</li>
    <li> I used these with glitter tattoos at an educational fair and they were a HIT!  They were a great buy!</li>
    <li> I used this as glitter for makeup and it was very shimmery in a great rainbow of light!</li>
    <li> threw away was no good for what i wanted to give my granddaughter, i thought i was getting a kit to use this or something with instructions</li>
    <li> I gave these with the stencil tattoos to two nine year olds ... they loved it. made a great stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> Each container had barely anything in it. Most of them spilled out so there wasn&#x27;t much. The colors are very pretty but I received duplicates. If you want glitter, DO NOT BUY THIS. I recommend you buy this one. This one came in great packaging with 0 duplicates. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087O4XKE/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8</li>
    <li> i love it thank you so much,i plan to use them for cosplaying so ya thanks agen i love them there perfect</li>
    <li> I LOVE GLITTER, and these glitters were all beautiful colors and I had no spills :) I would recommend. And Id buy again</li>
    <li> Sister loves all nail items and these are nice for little extras you can&#x27;t find everywhere.  Nice and different for nails.</li>
    <li> This goes along with the other body art stuff we bought for our daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She is having lots of fun applying them.  This glitter goes on really easy with the other body art items we bought for her.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and they stick very well. It is also a great way to add to your collection and not spend a large amount of money. Well worth it and it will keep the kids busy for hours.</li>
    <li> There were only two of the colors that are displayed within the picture. I wish it would have been a little more descriptive about that. But it wasn&#x27;t... Plus they are tiny containers of glitter. It was fine. But there were two or three of the exact same colors.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that the powder was for nail art.  Thought I could use it for glitter tattoo!!!  Didn&#x27;t want to try it on the skin in case my kids break out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s glitter....pretty hard to get it wrong...</li>
    <li> package looks small but goes a long way</li>
    <li> colors are terrific and their so versatile from eyes to nails to any cosmetic fix I use these, I love it!</li>
    <li> I used it for glitter tattoo, works perfectly. nice colors.</li>
    <li> We use it for shimmer not our nails. It is the best invention of uses. I would recommend this to all</li>
    <li> Got this to go along with Shimmer tattoo kit that came with 3 colors. These look really nice on. The colors pop! Daughter loves doing these when friends come over. We just use the brushes that came with her kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nails to use with my gel kit. I used it for the first time last night and was very pleased with the out come. My only complaint is that the containers are so small so there is not a lot of product but I am only using it on two fingers at a time so this is fine for me. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Small but it&#x27;s good enough quality</li>
    <li> The containers didn&#x27;t contain a whole lot of glitter and some of the colors were more powder than glitter.  I bought these in addition to the Shimmer Glitter Tattoos for my daughter and she was upset that the light purple and pink did not show up at all on her skin (these two had very little glitter and more of just a colored powder which disappeared once the glue absorbed into it).  I&#x27;m sure it works better for nail art but I do not recommend it for body art.  I am also glad I didn&#x27;t pay to much or I would have really been upset.</li>
    <li> I have not gotten a chance to use them but if they are like others I have purchased then we will like them.</li>
    <li> i thought i could of used this as makeup but theres way too much chemicals in it i dont wanna take the risk so now its just sitting around collecting dust who want it..you can have it lol</li>
    <li> I highly reccomend the product. You need glue and stencils if you want to do glitter tattoos. This glitter is beautiful, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The vials were barely filled and the glitter colors were bland instead of bright and fabulous.</li>
    <li> Still haven&#x27;t even gotten them in the mail it&#x27;s been over 2 weeks !</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re perfect!  I wanted them for my nails and for my eye makeup enhancement.  They came in quite quickly and in the cutest little box! I love them!!  Definitely pleased with everything: )</li>
    <li> I thought this was well worth the money.  The glitter is very fine so you may have to use more of it.  The buyer sent me an email that it may take more time to get it because it was from overseas.  I thought that was nice of them to do, but it came within a week.</li>
    <li> All of the colors were different. The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about it was that the container that holds the glitter was very small resulting in very little glitter. Other than that it came quicker then the delivery date and i&#x27;ve used them on myself and 3 of my friends so far.</li>
    <li> Does not come with all the colors</li>
    <li> Great value.  Grand daughters loved it</li>
    <li> Useful for makeup eyeshadow, lip glitter, nail glitter. I love the shades. Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> The glitter stated that it would be perfect for glitter tattoos, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It clumped up and was not vibrant at all.  It also doesn&#x27;t contain the same amount in all colors.  Absolute rip off!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works very well. Inexpensive and children love it as well as adults. It&#x27;s a lot of fun for all ages and it&#x27;s not very messy which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> recomended lots of colors. good size containers.the lids screw on the container. my daughter loves this set. will buy again</li>
    <li> I used the glitter on my eyes and it was great. Looked amazing and everyone wanted to know where I got them. I tried to use them for nails but you have to mix it with the powder for gel and I don&#x27;t have that yet. Seller did good on the shipping and communicated well every step of the way.</li>
    <li> love the item. I will be ordering more! The only thing that I dont like it that some of them have more then the others. BUT it is still a great deal</li>
    <li> Very nice person to deal with and great product. There are enough colors to do lots of glitter tattoos at an upcoming party.</li>
    <li> The glitter is easy to use, stays on all day without any problems, the colors were brighter then the advertised picture. But that wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice &amp; we&#x27;ve been using it to supplement another shimmer tattoo set that we have ... Works great!</li>
    <li> Nice colors and the price was right.  The glitter was shipped in a timely fashion.  The variety of colors is very nice.  Introducing this line to my friends.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty and it is very sparkly.  It is a very fine glitter and the containers are pretty small but I think it is a good buy.</li>
    <li> No silver an multiples of the same color. Overall OK.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use with glitter stencil tattoos for a kid&#x27;s event. It is NOT glitter! It is hundreds of times larger than glitter. It is to coarse to use for tattoos, it just clumps and doesn&#x27;t spead evenly. I bought \\&quot;poof\\&quot; bottles to apply the glitter, this product is too large to come out the spout.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money buying from this company; they do not use honesty in their description.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 boxes of glitter and they came to me pretty much empty!! Such a  huge disappointment especially since the shipping took soo long!! Terrible how little product is in the containers! Unacceptable and a complete rip off!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and a good seller.  My daughter loves it.  The glitter gives the tattoos a nice shinny finish.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got this produce the other day and the sparkles were too large for my nails. Very nice colors though, will have to use it for something else</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find this on Amazon. I started a girls spa party business and thought this would be perfect for the glitter tattoos for the girls. Turns out each case comes almost empty. There&#x27;s enough glitter for maybe 1-2 small tattoos in each container. Its like they sent me samples of each color. Very disappointed, can&#x27;t really do much with this.</li>
    <li> Been using them with my make up looks!!! Love them!!</li>
    <li> Barely has glitter inside but ehh</li>
    <li> Order these and received them a lot sooner than I expected which is always nice but I was quickly disappointed when I opened the package and seen that there was hardly any hlitter. Practically empty !</li>
    <li> In one of the questions above it says that you do need the glue for this glitter. What glue would this be so I kniw the correct kind to buy. I&#x27;ve never used this kind of glitter before so I&#x27;m not exactly sure and don&#x27;t want to waste money on the wrong thing.&lt;br /&gt;- Chelsea</li>
    <li> The colors are all very nice and shinny. I use the glitters over my eyeshadow to make them super shiny and people have told me that they look cool. Of course i got glitter glue to hold the glitter. The containers are small, a little bigger than a quarter. I&#x27;m not sure if this is okay to be applied near the eyes but i do it. I know it says nail and body painting glitter.</li>
    <li> I had read other reviews that said that there wasn&#x27;t as much product in some containers as others...no big deal I thought.  If one is full and another is 3/4 full, not a dealbreaker.  However, some of these are almost empty.  These were to be part of a gift and I don&#x27;t have any time to order something else.  I&#x27;m glad they are being given to a kid, because I&#x27;d be embarrassed if they were for a teen or adult.  I&#x27;m not sure what the quality is like.....looks very similar to the glitter that came with the glitter tattoo set I bought as part of the gift. Only you know....looking like it&#x27;s been used 15 times.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been really, truly let down by a product and agreed with the negative reviews I read.</li>
    <li> got almost none of the colours from the picture. and to top it off, got 3 of the same colours twice! did not really have a problem with empty containers and little product others had but was disappointed in the colous that was sent, because i ordered those colours for a specific use.</li>
