      <li>:)   </li>

      <li>/&gt;I was nervous buying this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use them.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good quality razor hair styling kit!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly, this was a gift.  </li>
      <li>Its pretty amazing</li>
      <li>order also came with a discreet black carrying case that is perfectly sized for all of the pieces.</li>
      <li>well *fine tuning*</li>
      <li>but it is fine for my use.</li>
      <li>so I can get an accurate picture of what is coming off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a hairstylist by profession, just someone who is cheap and hates paying money to take my toddlers for a haircut.</li>
      <li>(LOL BIG mistake.</li>
      <li>The blade is easy to clean and store.</li>
      <li>I received these today, all in fantastic condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>great for in between neck trims, the combs were and extra bonus</li>
      <li>/&gt;There were no instructions, but it&#x27;s not something so important</li>
      <li>Cut almost as good as a professional one I tried it a couple times and I like it</li>
      <li>As you can see from the picture, the 1 first (already on the comb) is very fine.</li>
      <li>Great for minor trims in between haircuts.  </li>
      <li>It can, when the blades are fresh, take off huge clumps of hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The quality of the blades and the styling tool are great for the price, I really expected to pay 2x what I paid here at Amazon for something of this quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to use and far better than the one I had by Weck.  </li>
      <li>It is compact enough that it fits easily into the top drawer of my vanity for easy access.</li>
      <li>i wasnt too happy with that, and the razor wasnt that sharp.</li>
      <li>The third has the widest teeth and most spaced and would be used for more choppier cuts.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most beauty schools do not teach how to get a great &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; cut hair style,as they don&#x27;t know how to use them...at least in my part of the country.</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>Funny, but as much as I like the razor and guards, I was really impressed with the 2 large combs that were included in this set, and use one daily!</li>
      <li>styling tool itself is solid/sturdy and feels like a good weight in your hand, easily folding in half to cover/protect you (and the blade) when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>This tool is easy to use to cut my children&#x27;s hair and helps avoid that straight line cut.</li>
      <li>This is far better than the one I have been using.  </li>
      <li>This was worth the money.</li>
      <li>I rarely get my hair cut in the salon.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as I expected.  Would not recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with it so far.  </li>
      <li>However, the blades were super sharp and cut a nice side swept bang.</li>
      <li>Looks great, but nowhere near as sharp as it could or should be.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I love to grow my hair long</li>
      <li>Love the 2 combs, they are hard and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>This works great on wet hair, but it pulls if you try to use it on dry hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very thick hair and this thing is great for adding texture to my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a well valued product that works much better with wet hair.</li>
      <li>it worked really well</li>
      <li>but it should work very well.</li>
      <li>It works very well on her fur and reduces my time using clippers.  </li>
      <li>Obviously, I am not a hair stylist, but a cheap grad student, so directions would be helpful.</li>
      <li>It also creates a beautiful choppy look by starting from the top, and gently gliding the razor down to the ends.</li>
      <li>have an old version and this is very much like it.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to hold your hair at odd angles, let it fall, and hope that it looks okay.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>For the price, with all the various options is worth the price.</li>
      <li>The product itself comes with a black pouch that contained two fine, plastic combs, a box full of 5 replacement blades, and a second, red pouch contained the razor comb (which reminded me very much of Sweeney Todd.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing my hair pretty short now</li>
      <li>In fact, when I first swung it open, I began singing \\&quot;My Friends\\&quot; to it.)</li>
      <li>However, as nervous as I was, I was also very excited and anxious to cut and put some layers into my hair...</li>
      <li>This item is okay for very small areas only, not for a whole head, unless you have all day!</li>
      <li>The extra blades really help.</li>
      <li>Every professional (and the &amp;#34;do</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with instructions but I figured out how to put it together. Its pretty amazing and I love it. </li>
    <li> Its a little lighr and cheapade&lt;br /&gt; But will wprk.</li>
    <li> Honestly I bought this for the guards but the razor is nice it&#x27;s really tight as well as changing out the guard...</li>
    <li> In addition to extra blades and choices in thickness of cutting shields, this tool does a great job at shaping the hair.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a mat cutter for grooming my dog.  It works very well on her fur and reduces my time using clippers.  It looks like it may rust if left damp or dirty, so take care of it and keep it very clean.  I&#x27;m satisfied because it&#x27;s great for my purpose.  My only ding is that it seems a little loose in hand.  Next time, I will buy a non folding one.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  OK, now for some laughs. Our cat has very long hair.  I use this to keep his hair around his butt short.  No more cling-ons!</li>
    <li> i purchased this to soften the ends of my blunt hair cut.  I use the widest set comb and just comb it a few times through about the last 1.5 inches of my hair when it is dry.  I had tried to get my hair stylist for years to soften the ends of the blunt cut she gives me but she never seemed to understand what I was talking about or do it.  With this kit I can just do it myself.  I suggest doing iit when you hair is dry so you can stop combing as soon as you see the softness level you like.  If you do it when your hair is wet you may over do it.</li>
    <li> Does what its advertised to do, and with a bit of practice you too will be at least thinning your hair, if not giving yourself $200 razor cuts! Funny, but as much as I like the razor and guards, I was really impressed with the 2 large combs that were included in this set, and use one daily!</li>
    <li> i really liked the fact that they included 2 combs and 5 replacement razors. the metal on my razor was a bit scratched as if it had been pre-owned. i wasnt too happy with that, and the razor wasnt that sharp. its sharp enough to last about 3 haircuts.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, this was a gift.  My mother loves it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really works and thins out heavy hair. I gave one to my best friend and she loves it to.</li>
    <li> Good hair cutting tool</li>
    <li> I rarely get my hair cut in the salon.  I&#x27;m wearing my hair pretty short now so I bought this to help with some texture and making cutting my hair go faster.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with it so far.  FYI, don&#x27;t cut it on dry hair!  OUCH!</li>
    <li> I received these today, all in fantastic condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous buying this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use them. I watched ONE video on how to cut hair with the razor, and my hair turned out amazing and beautiful. It wasn&#x27;t hard for me to get used to, It took me less than a minute to figure out how to switch out the razor guards. In my experience, the razor didn&#x27;t yank my hair while I was cutting with dry hair, which I was kind of nervous about also. It&#x27;s GREAT for thinning hair, and layering hair. It also creates a beautiful choppy look by starting from the top, and gently gliding the razor down to the ends. If you put too much pressure while doing it, though, you&#x27;ll completely cut it off, so be careful if you want the choppy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no instructions, but it&#x27;s not something so important I&#x27;d deduct a star for. The product arrived in a timely manner, the product itself is good quality, works perfectly. It deserves 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the 2 combs, they are hard and easy to handle. The extra blades really help. I think it is going to last me a while.</li>
    <li> Having no experience with using a razor it is hard for me to use but for someone that has a little experience it has all the attachments and it all fits together nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hairstylist by profession, just someone who is cheap and hates paying money to take my toddlers for a haircut. This tool is easy to use to cut my children&#x27;s hair and helps avoid that straight line cut. I&#x27;m very happy with it and the price</li>
    <li> This looks just like the one my favorite cosmetologist uses on my hair.  Great for minor trims in between haircuts.  I&#x27;m looking forward to learning to use it on others&#x27; hair as we&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this thing is great for adding texture to my hair. I use it every time I cut my hair.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it yet but it should work very well. have an old version and this is very much like it. I think the shipping is a little much. But couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This works great on wet hair, but it pulls if you try to use it on dry hair.  Was a bit of a challenge figuring out how to put it together but once I got it all was well.  (No instructions were included)</li>
    <li> It is a very nice set. Worked well. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> Great for touching up hairstyles!</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove knots in my long haired cat&#x27;s fur. It does the job with out danger of cutting the skin as with just a blade.</li>
    <li> Good razor works fine. I little cheapy but it is fine for my use.</li>
    <li> always wanted to be able to razor my own hair and you couldn&#x27;t beat the price for all this came with. the quality was fantastic and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> BROKE THE SECOND TIME I USED IT WHEN A SCREW KEEPING THE SIZE HEADS IN PLACE FELL OUT.  UNABLE TO REPLACE IT.  DIDN&#x27;T USE IT FOR THE SECOND TIME UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETURN IT.</li>
    <li> FINALLY got the cut that I&#x27;ve wanted for so long, and all by myself, too! After watching several tutorials on razor comb cutting on YouTube, I finally felt ready to cut my own hair. I was kind of nervous...what if I messed up? Eek! However, as nervous as I was, I was also very excited and anxious to cut and put some layers into my hair...and I did it. :)   THE PRODUCT:  The product itself comes with a black pouch that contained two fine, plastic combs, a box full of 5 replacement blades, and a second, red pouch contained the razor comb (which reminded me very much of Sweeney Todd. In fact, when I first swung it open, I began singing \\&quot;My Friends\\&quot; to it.) and 3 guards. As you can see from the picture, the 1 first (already on the comb) is very fine. The second, the spaces between the teeth and blade were a little more wide and spaced out. The third has the widest teeth and most spaced and would be used for more choppier cuts. Basically, the finer the teeth, the cleaner the cut. The bigger the teeth, the choppier the cut.  CUTTING TECHNIQUE/TIPS:  First, let me suggest you divide your hair into parts before cutting. That is, take a hair scrunchie of some sort, and part your hair in layers. I divided mine into three equal(ish) part, leaving the bottom layer and longest layer alone. Then I untied my top layer and snipped until I it hit until it was even with my chin.   Next, I undo the second layer which I cut till it&#x27;s even to my shoulder.  Thirdly, I looked at my hair, switch guards to the one of the widest teeth and went back to chop off random pieces in my layers for a choppier look and well *fine tuning* my fringe.  I took it very VERY slow, cutting little by little until things looked right. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so great about this product: you&#x27;re basically just sculpting your hair as you&#x27;re looking into the mirror. You don&#x27;t have to hold your hair at odd angles, let it fall, and hope that it looks okay. Just cut cut cut with the razor comb. I might even be so bold as to say that it&#x27;s harder rather than easier to mess this up, so long as you&#x27;re ALWAYS gliding the comb parallel to your hair as opposed running it through like a regular comb (LOL BIG mistake. You&#x27;ll CHOP all your hair off if you do that, silly willy).  FINAL IMPRESSIONS:  I am so happy with this product! My hair looks great! People have asked me where I&#x27;ve gotten it cut and that&#x27;s a great confidence booster. The price is a steal for something so wonderful! :) I&#x27;m so very glad I got this product.   *NOTE: I suggest you watch some tutorials online to build up your confidence and know-how before attempting to cut your (or anyone else&#x27;s) hair! Good luck!</li>
    <li> This was worth the money. I would second another review I read about no directions. The kit came with one blade already inserted, but I have no idea how to put another in, and to that point, I have no idea why I would need to use the other ones (i.e. I don&#x27;t know the difference) Obviously, I am not a hair stylist, but a cheap grad student, so directions would be helpful. However, the blades were super sharp and cut a nice side swept bang. The additional combs were helpful too!</li>
    <li> I watched a few YouTube videos on how to use hair razors. My main reason for buying this product was to thin out my hair. I love to grow my hair long but it is so thick that is can actually give me headaches in the summer. This product allows me to thin out my hair a little while maintaining the length.It is easy to use. I usually start about half way down my head and take a little hair off all around. I do this with dry hair so I can get an accurate picture of what is coming off.</li>
    <li> This is far better than the one I have been using.  The various &amp;#34;shields&amp;#34; in different sizes is a plus !  Easy to use and far better than the one I had by Weck.  I highly recommend this. For the price, with all the various options is worth the price. I wish the beauty shops would have this type.  Since I am a licensed cosmotoligist and instructor, I can use it myself.  Unfortunately, most beauty schools do not teach how to get a great &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; cut hair style,as they don&#x27;t know how to use them...at least in my part of the country. Every professional (and the &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; gal/guy) should learn.) There are video instructions on the internet which demonstrate the use..</li>
    <li> As the item description promised, my order arrived with 1 styling razor (blade/guard/tool), 2 extra guards (allowing for varying cut styles), 5 replacement blades, and 2 8-1/2&amp;#34; combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the blades and the styling tool are great for the price, I really expected to pay 2x what I paid here at Amazon for something of this quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styling tool itself is solid/sturdy and feels like a good weight in your hand, easily folding in half to cover/protect you (and the blade) when you&#x27;re done. One reviewer said it seemed like theirs may have arrived used so I carefully inspected all pieces and did not find any scratches, defects or stray hair on any of the tools included in my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order also came with a discreet black carrying case that is perfectly sized for all of the pieces. It is compact enough that it fits easily into the top drawer of my vanity for easy access. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good quality razor hair styling kit!</li>
    <li> great for in between neck trims, the combs were and extra bonus</li>
    <li> This is a great haircutting tool. I use this tool for thinning and layering my own locks. The product itself comes with extra razors, combs, and a pouch along with the additional guards. The steel hasn&#x27;t rusted or even tarnished for me even though I keep it in a humid environment. The blade is easy to clean and store. Alcohol and WD-40 work great for maintenance. I like that it folds for safety purposes. It feels great in the hands, and the design is great. I haven&#x27;t slipped or injured myself with it so far. I have nothing bad to say about this product. I even use it on my pets to remove matted fur.</li>
    <li> This is a dangerous tool! The blade can slip out of the guard and cut the _hit out of you so fast it is scary</li>
    <li> still trying to learn how to use this accessory. nice product. kinda like a razor thinner for hair,</li>
    <li> Cut almost as good as a professional one I tried it a couple times and I like it</li>
    <li> great job in between haircuts</li>
    <li> Looks great, but nowhere near as sharp as it could or should be.  This item is okay for very small areas only, not for a whole head, unless you have all day!</li>
    <li> Great value. Well made. Nice case. The two combs included are the nicest combs I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This is a well valued product that works much better with wet hair. Be careful, though. It can, when the blades are fresh, take off huge clumps of hair. Need to develop a &amp;#34;parallel&amp;#34; stroke technique to even the cut.</li>
    <li> I tried it on my husband- it worked really well</li>
    <li> wife uses it she loves it</li>
    <li> great I do not pay for haircuts</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> This product works well for trimming up your own layers but I recommend REALLY practicing with this product and not getting too cut happy.  If you start to get frustrated you might just have to walk away from the mirror and come back after some time has passed to start fresh.</li>
