<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item delivered on time and was as described!</li>
    <li> Love the flavor. I brush twice a day with a SoniCare brush. Fantastic results within the first week.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste so much I literally spent my birthday money on it. Of course i&#x27;m a dental student...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for months and months, probably close to a year now... I love it as a toothpaste.  It&#x27;s a good price, the feeling is fresh and clean, and it isn&#x27;t too chalky when I&#x27;m rinsing.  The only problem with this product is the whitening aspect.  I don&#x27;t think it does much at all, definitely not the \\&quot;3 shades whiter\\&quot; that it promises.  I don&#x27;t see a difference, but maybe if you use the other 3d white products, it&#x27;ll help.  I only use the toothpaste, which promises whiteness, and doesn&#x27;t fully deliver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nut about my teeth. I recently quit smoking and needed fluoride in my paste after a visit to my dentist. After a week of brushing AND using ACT flouride my teeth are better than ever. The ACT doesn&#x27;t do anything to whiten so I definitely see the #D Crest working it&#x27;s magic!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the only toothpaste I now buy. I saw a noticeable difference in my teeth after using it for one week. I love how it makes my teeth sparkle and how it makes my breathe so fresh. 2 thumbs way up for this product!! Whitens, cleans and freshens, what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Before I started using my new toothpaste, I took a picture of my teeth. I brushed them for 2 weeks, every morning, and every night. In the mirror my teeth did look whiter, like someone scraped the yellowing off. But to make sure I took a picture. When I compared them, I was shocked! My teeth were a whole shade brighter! THANKS CREST!</li>
    <li> maybe doesn&#x27;t do lightening fast whitening, but it works great, and buying the subscribe and save two pack is terribly convenient!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve seen much better results from my natural toothpastes</li>
    <li> I feel like this is one of the best toothpastes out there!</li>
    <li> I choose this toothpaste because of the whitening effect.  It truly does what it says it will do and I would purchase this product again. I recommend Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Radiant Mint Toothpaste to anyone who likes white teeth and and cavity protection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean fresh feeling after you brush and it&#x27;s great as a tooth paste ONLY.  I bought this after seeing reviews on YouTube, I thought this would do much more for my &#x27;smile&#x27;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly now after approx a month and a half of use at least twice a day, I see no real notable difference in the whiteness of my teeth, not sure why, as I have been really checking and sometimes brushed three times a day, used a whole tube already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is, I don&#x27;t feel that the enamel is getting damaged in any way, so will keep on using it and will keep you posted if any results appear....</li>
    <li> Well this is nice toothpaste, great taste and certainly seems to clean well, does it whiten your teeth, well I have to say I do have fairly white teeth anyway, are my teeth whiter, can&#x27;t say I have noticed a difference but in saying that, I like the toothpaste so I will continue to buy it regardless.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than local stores and still the same product. Don&#x27;t know how well the whitening claim is as I have yet to really notice whiter teeth after couple months of use (probably dependent on what you drink: coffee, coke zero).</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain! I don&#x27;t know if it makes my teeth 3D clean but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is good and a good deal.</li>
    <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Children-Families-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1622127269/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418769206&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;understanding+children+and+families+with+autism+spectrum+disorders</li>
    <li> I have so many problems with this toothpaste I don&#x27;t even know where to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll first start off by saying that for awhile I have been using Crest Pro-Health. I just switched to the 3D white because it was on sale. I never had a problem with the Pro-Health, but the 3D White? NO WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for three weeks, but lately I&#x27;ve been noticing that it leaves a supremely god-awful taste in my mouth. It&#x27;s horrific, and it lasts for at least two days. It makes me ill to my stomach to use this toothpaste. At first I thought it was due to my mouthwash (the alcohol free brand I purchased at Walmart, which I threw away), but I used this toothpaste before I did my oil pulling this morning and used Listerine as a mouthwash instead, and all day my stomach has been upset and queasy, and I have a foul, almost metallic taste in my mouth that won&#x27;t go away. My mouth also feels very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also made my gums incredibly sore and irritated. I was wondering why they felt so sensitive, and lo and behold, its the toothpaste. The very first time I used this paste, I noticed that it has an ESPECIALLY rough look to it, like the paste itself looks gritty. This can&#x27;t possibly be good for your teeth. I don&#x27;t have this problem with the gel toothpastes that Crest produces, and I NEVER had an issue with using Colgate Optic White. I LOVED Optic White and used it for years. I&#x27;ll be going back to it and throwing away this tube. It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    <li> This was a really great proudct it help me out alot i give this proudct two thumbs up Buy it.</li>
    <li> Ok product. Does not get teeth as white as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I have used this toothpaste for a few months now and have noticeably whiter teeth. It tastes very good, the cap stays clean, and it is a great price for whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Uncle Bobby B always needs to have his teeth squeaky clean and pearly white for the ladies every day !</li>
    <li> Truly from taste to functionality this toothpaste does all I can ask for and more. I am very difficult to please with toothpaste, not a huge fan of gel, and was tired of the one i&#x27;d been using for years. Can&#x27;t suggest it higher.</li>
    <li> about a year and half ago, my sister gave me 2 tubes of this stuff to try while I was abroad. I used this toothpaste almost every day during my trip (About 4/7days a week for 6 months). I felt like my teeth did become whiter but I was also using another whitening product. With exception to the first couple of weeks I was abroad, I suffered from these sores on the sides of my mouth that kept cracking and bleeding.  I had no idea what was causing them. I tried all sorts of creams and oils but nothing made them go away. After I came back to the US i stopped using this toothpaste and later tried a cream for eczema. The sores healed quickly with every application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I felt like my teeth were very stained so I looked into some new tooth whitening products and I remembered this toothpaste and wanted to give it another try. I bought this two pack from Target and it&#x27;s been between 1-2 weeks since I started using it and the sides of my mouth are starting to crack again. I&#x27;ve been applying my eczema cream to the area but since I&#x27;ve been brushing with this toothpaste twice a day I think it&#x27;s been canceling any effects of the cream. There has been no other changes to my routine other than this toothpaste so this has to be the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so relieved to finally find out what caused these painful cracks to appear. At the same time I&#x27;m so blown away that it was as simple as the toothpaste I was using. Not once did I think it was the toothpaste! I kept thinking it was something in the foreign country that my body was not accepting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been taking pictures of my teeth to check the whiteness. So far, my teeth look no different. I won&#x27;t be using this product any longer so I won&#x27;t know if it works with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it may be a coincidence, but after I changed my toothpaste some of my teeth have been feeling sore.</li>
    <li> good toothpaste, already knew that, just purchase online this time.</li>
    <li> Crest 3d white toothpaste works very well I must say. There are alot of good tooth pastes out there but this one works very..and i mean very well. But after all any toothpaste works very well if you just brush very well 3 times plus a day.</li>
    <li> I buy this toothpaste all the time and was so happy to find this on amazon.  The price is incredible compared to the store!  This toothpaste helps keep my teeth clean and white.  I really think that it helps to take stains off teeth and you don&#x27;t have to use some expensive whitening system.  This works!  This is a staple item in my household and we all love it and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> now i can actually enjoy brushing my teeth</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t check the picture and thought it was a twin-pack of 11oz each. Turns out 5.8oz each. At this price, it&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to the 6-pack that Amazon are offering. Bleh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But great toothpaste though. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really love this toothpaste, but it&#x27;s kinda pricey so I can never bring myself to buy it in stores. I saw this deal (with amazon prime) and bought it before you can say white teeth.</li>
    <li> Good! Nicely whiten teeth. Thank you. This was all purchases. I&#x27;m fine quality satisfaction. Reasonable price. Megbízhaató sell quality products.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the whiteness in my teeth after using this toothpaste for months.</li>
    <li> Depending on how yellow your teeth is from the start, this product really lightens it in a week timing. However, if your teeth was really yellow and just needs that extra push then I recommend purchasing the Crest 3D White Professional Effects Strips, too.</li>
    <li> Usually I switch toothpaste brands every time I need a new tube but I did not need to this time. This toothpaste has the right feel to it and does a great job of cleaning. It is slightly abrasive but not too abrasive. The mint flavor is not overpowering or underwhelming. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; marketing term as this product really is not going to whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> Not that good of a buy should of looked around first</li>
    <li> Ive used probably 10 bottles of this stuff and whilst I cannot see a whiter smile I know that my smoking and eating habits of recent have not made my teeth more yellow. So maybe this stuff does whiten but I am too busy trying to yellow them so it equals out. It can leave you pretty thirsty as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for a quality item. Will definitely buy again to save myself more money in the long run. A+++++</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite a while and it seems to help keep my teeth stain free.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity or anything. It just tastes bad if you have really bad morning breath but I guess it&#x27;s a good thing it means it&#x27;s killing the germs and really freshening up that breath but I would like to look forward to brushing my teeth, not think oh yuck this is worse than robotussion and I need to use it. It does work and it makes your teeth shine more than anything</li>
    <li> Great stuff -- really does whiten and your breath stays fresh for quite a long time after using.</li>
    <li> i bought 10 pics from this toothpaste cos i live i Saudi Arabia and this product very awesome good result and thick</li>
    <li> Really whitens my teeth in a couple days without the sensitivity problem I have with strips.</li>
    <li> I love the taste and smell to this toothpaste. The price is great and I would not go saying it leaves your teeth bright white, however it does its job</li>
    <li> I love this item.  It works well, It tastes great.  It is a good price. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste made my teeth about half a shade to a shade whiter, but it didn&#x27;t really do much. My teeth aren&lt;br /&gt;t sunshine yellow, but they aren&#x27;t angel white either. It does a good job at cleaning, doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, foams up good. But if you&#x27;re looking for a toothpaste that&#x27;s going to make your teeth pearly white this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to determine how well these whiten my teeth. However, since I don&#x27;t have any problems with sensitivity, I have no complaints. Just started using Crest White Strips a couple of days ago. Hopefully, this toothpaste will help maintain my whiter, brighter smile.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about with this product. None. Nada. I love it. It was cheap. It came with two. I use it every day, and I see a difference. A HUGE difference.</li>
    <li> While I like the toothpaste and used it for quite some time, I ended up changing to prohealth as this one is more geared towards whitening. With all the different lines, I didn&#x27;t realize that all of them didnt have a baseline of preventing cavities, etc.</li>
    <li> Works great and I got it for a great price here on Amazon.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> For the price it is a great deal, I use buy another high priced brand but found this brand works just as well and is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I tend to stick with Crest toothpastes because I like to believe in the whitening powers they claim to have; however, I don&#x27;t ever really notice a difference. My teeth aren&#x27;t getting worse, but I do actively brush twice a day and floss/mouthwash. As for the taste, it is subtle yet refreshing. I am not a fan of overpowering toothpaste tastes, so this falls nicely into a range that is acceptable to me. The tubes also last quite a while (even after they seem empty!). Great value buying them on here as opposed to a tube at a time at the store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste alright!  And fine toothpaste too, it tastes like toothpaste and it seems to leave the mouth more or less cleaner than it was before brushing teeth.  Seems to function as a cleaning agent, in such a way that the teeth become clean and the bad breath goes away.  My teeth don&#x27;t seem to be white yet however</li>
    <li> Great price for Crest toothpaste. After two weeks of using this toothpaste, my teeth were two shades whiter! :D Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It lists a twin pack of 11.6 oz but in reality it is a total of 11.6 oz which isn&#x27;t a very good deal for this product....</li>
    <li> This is a double pack, so you really get your money&#x27;s worth. I like this Crest product because the taste isn&#x27;t too severe and it&#x27;s not too abrasive on my teeth, but is a great whitening agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Excellant toothpaste and a great value.</li>
    <li> The whitening part is no joke and it works, but this as a cleaning toothpaste is average at best. I use Colgate in the morning and Crest whitening at night to balance it out. Overall impressed with the whitening results.</li>
    <li> I am a big black tea drinker and my teeth suffer terribly for it. I have tried a lot of toothpaste&#x27;s and even pointless (and painful) whitening treatments that claimed to work, but didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it one month and even though I STILL drink black tea, my teeth actually look white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is awesome as well. It actually tastes like a sweet, minty hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this toothpaste is the high cost.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works but it doesn&#x27;t feel strong enough. I like my toothpaste to have the strong sensation but this one does not.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Not too thick, it has beads or something in it that leave you feeling so fresh as if you brushed and used mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Went o a health fair and a dentist recommended this toothpaste -- it has been almost a year since I switched.  Teeth are whiter and refreshed!  Would definately recommend</li>
    <li> I am delighted that I ordered it. This is the first time, but I did not regret to order this product.</li>
    <li> There is nothing quite special with this product, but also no cons as well, I&#x27;d like to buy this again if possible.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a great deal and it wasn&#x27;t.  11.5 ounces TOTAL and not per individual tube.  This makes this not a great deal.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> The quality of the tube was subpar, it looked damaged. I sent it back as the product was expiring in a month.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best toothpaste I have ever used. It really gets your teeth clean and sparkling, and leaves your breath smelling fresh for hours. It also has definitely helped whiten my teeth. I had a tooth in the back of my mouth that was irritating me and seemed like it was a potential cavity. After using this for a week, my tooth is no longer irritating me and this is no sign of any cavities. I let my mom try some and now she is ordering this for herself. I would recommend using this toothpaste with the crest 3d mouthwash, which is another fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Whitening power is excellent. Works wonders with the rest of the Crest 3D White Vivid toothpaste line.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;C.P.</li>
    <li> ALways love the crest 3d white.  Have been using crest since I was a kid. Love it. It works, JUst make sure you use it twice a day!</li>
    <li> Bought the item and it came on time. My dad likes it because of the taste along with the fact that it whitens (not a lot but you can see a difference) teeth.</li>
    <li> Ok, its a decent toothpaste for sure. I only use it here and there, because when I tell you what else I use it for, you&#x27;ll get why. I had always used regular toothpaste to gently clean jewelry, and for many years it&#x27;s worked out fine. (never use on pearls or opals!) When I used this particular brand, it brightened up my silver like nothing I had ever used before! I mean, my silver that was heavily tarnished and dirty, came out like almost new! The evidence of that was all over my fingers. It seemed to literally eat whatever was on it right off. It didnt seem to harm the silver though. Then i began to wonder....what it was doing to my teeth? I just couldn&#x27;t use it as regular toothpaste anymore after that, unfortunately. On occasion, ok, but not every day.</li>
    <li> only been using this product for a few weeks and have seen noticeable results. i took before/after pictures so thats how i know it works. not a dramatic difference but definitely works</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I thought it was a better deal than I could find in my local stores.... It turned out that the price is almost the same.  As far as the product itself, I love this toothpaste.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean and the whitening effects are actually noticeable.  Great toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Two packs are always better than single packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth seem whiter, and hopefully more cavity resistant.</li>
    <li> My teeth have noticeably whitened in the 6 months I&#x27;ve been using this product.  Also, no unpleasant aftertaste as with some others.</li>
    <li> Great tooth paste, at a good price, I don&#x27;t really see any whitening difference, but this is the same with all whitening toothpastes for me. I get through subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t even have to worry about ordering it. I like the taste because it&#x27;s not too sweet and just minty enough.</li>
    <li> I had been using this toothpaste for awhile and started getting cuts and tears in my gums. At first I thought I bit my gums in my sleep or something and that it just wasn&#x27;t healing. Then I thought maybe it was from something else, or I had a vitamin deficiency... I started taking a multivitamin and it seemed to be getting better, but then it came back again - the same cuts in my gums... So then I started thinking about what had changed recently... and I realized it could be the toothpaste. I did a search online and found a lot of people complaining about allergic reactions to this toothpaste.... so I decided to stop using it. Within 16 hours the cuts in my gums have become noticeably better and my whole mouth just feels less irritated. I can&#x27;t believe it. I would NOT recommend this toothpaste to anyone! I understand it is an allergic reaction of some sort (not sure to what), but with so many reports of this, and with so many other toothpastes to choose from... why would you risk that?? Plus even if it doesn&#x27;t irritate you immediately, who knows what else those chemicals are doing, what if you accidentally swallowed some and it irritates elsewhere? Anyway... I&#x27;m done with this stuff! No thank you!</li>
    <li> It does cleans and freshens like you&#x27;d expect toothpaste to do. Not sure what else I can really say.. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> It tastes good and leaves my teeth feeling great after; so overall I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review about toothpaste, but.....this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  I love how smooth and clean my teeth feel after brushing, which I do at least twice a day.  I&#x27;ve never had that with any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  I will stick with this one, for sure.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any real whitening effect, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.  I occasionally use the whitening strips for that anyway.  Try this, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Use this product daily.  It is the best toothpaste I have used.  I would recommend this product.  It definitely whitens your teeth.</li>
    <li> I started seeing a difference in whiteness in just a few uses. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, very happy with whitening/cleaning. We alternate with Crest 3D White Luxe Glamorous White Vibrant Mint Flavor Whitening Toothpaste.  Don&#x27;t expect dramatic results overnight, but we find these two toothpastes help maintain whitening achieved through the whitening &amp;#34;strips&amp;#34; also available.</li>
    <li> For me it seems like any other toothpaste but if you want to whiten your teeth then get white strips. Those work great and you are good with just buying one or two packs.</li>
    <li> Great tooth paste, gives you a nice clean feeling, and leaves your teeth nice and white</li>
    <li> Overall experience while brushing is good. You may be surprised the difference it makes when you use a good paste. You cannot go wrong unless you do not like the taste or flavor for this.</li>
    <li> There were no reviews on this Crest 3D, so I was somewhat reluctant to buy it at first.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon reviews are my first stop before buying almost anything these days - almost a religion to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth. From experience, I found that most whitening toothpaste hurts my teeth - but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about Crest 3D:&lt;br /&gt;- very reasonably priced (2 pack at about $3.50 ea)&lt;br /&gt;- leaves your mouth full of mint freshness&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;- has a flip cap (not screw on)&lt;br /&gt;- stands straight up on your counter due to big flat flip cap&lt;br /&gt;- the hybrid gel/paste is a very good blend for those who like either&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot vouch for its whitening ability as of yet, but even if it does nothing at all, I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my review has helped you,&lt;br /&gt;Jeff</li>
    <li> This whitening toothpaste works wonderfully!  It lifts stains easily, and continually whitens teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about six-months, and have seen great improvements.</li>
    <li> Any toothpaste that claims to whiten teeth is a sham in my opinion.  Same with this product.  Do not expect much if any difference in the whiteness of your teeth, let alone 3D WHITE!!!  Whatever that is.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but it&#x27;s toothpaste and it works.  Fresh breath, clean teeth, let&#x27;s celebrate.  Crest never lets me down.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. Nice double pack helps save a little cash. Put it in on subscribe and save for automatic delivery and I save even more $.</li>
    <li> I needed to see my dentist for a long overdue teeth cleaning, but the dental assistant told me he was booked for three months!  I went ahead and booked the appointment, but in the meantime I bought a tooth whitening toothpaste as she recommended.  I went to my drugstore and bought the Crest 3D.  I didn&#x27;t expect much for an expensive toothpaste.  I was shocked to see that this really works!  I just can&#x27;t believe it!  I haven&#x27;t even been using it that long, but already I see a whitening of my teeth!  I am sold!  I came on amazon, and I&#x27;m glad to see I can buy it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame it got two poor reviews because of the price.  Folks should review the product quality, which in this case is awesome.  Oh and the two poor reviews that bemoaned the price should realize I paid $3.99 for one tube at my local drugstore.  So the price on amazon is great, if you do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommended if you want whiter teeth.  This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations and was delivered on time. It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> Tastes good and my teeth feel clean. As for its whitening capabilities, I&#x27;m less certain, but it makes the teeth feel good, and ultimately that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for in a toothpaste.</li>
    <li> i use this product for my teeth, and i really like it my teeth became very white since i use this product.</li>
    <li> Seen some whitening over the last few weeks. Not bad. It works as intended. Pair it with an electric toothbrush/mouthwash and you&#x27;ll have stepped up your oral game!</li>
    <li> This helps keep your teeth white, and can help improve the shade if used regular. My teeth are pretty white and I smoke.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay doesn&#x27;t work miracles. But fresh taste and minty smell. Currently being sold in asda (UK) for £2. Bargain</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about a year now and have really seen a difference in the color of my teeth.  I also like that the flavor is minty, without being too overwhelming.  Amazon has one of the best prices that I have found on this product as well, when bought in the multi-pack size.</li>
    <li> My daughter actually asked if I had done something to my teeth, not knowing I started using this toothpaste. My husband had tried the competing brand but said it tasted bad, and it didn&#x27;t whiten, so he has also switched to this one. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it, if you have sensitive teeth, which I do.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  About time to order more!</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of toothpaste for around 4 months and I was really happy, because my teeth indeed look whiter! Yet, I recently had my annual dental check and my dentist discouraged the use of it. He claims how it&#x27;s has been damaging my gums, since it&#x27;s too abrasive. Plus, using it daily weakness the surface of the teeth as well. Oh, well...I guess I&#x27;ll go back to my old Crest toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is by far the BEST toothpaste I have used in over 40 years. It actually does exactly what it says it does and even more. For the first time in a very long while my wife told me my teeth was squeaky clean and the tar on the top left corner was almost gone. I will surely recommend this toothpaste to as many people as possible.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. My husband even raves about it. It leaves your mouth feeling so clean and fresh and the teeth whitening is unbelievable. I will never buy another kind of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Works especially well with electric toothbrushes. It&#x27;s very dense so you don&#x27;t need a lot. Not much else to say, it&#x27;s just toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Expires in October and its a twin pack</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially the price!  This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen around and it works very well.</li>
    <li> TEETH STARTED TO ACHE AFTER USING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the problem was my previous whitener polish</li>
    <li> So far so good. Since I also do other treathment with my teeth, and my teeth geting whiter, but I am not whether it can be owe to this. Anyway, good one to buy with reasonable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of &#x27;whitening&#x27; toothpastes with no effect. At this point I thought it was a marketing gimmick and I usually avoid them because they usually use some pseudo-irritant chemical as a whitener. I bought Crest 3D white because it was the first toothpaste I saw at Costco. Of course I had to buy 4 (Costco). Well I&#x27;m one tube in and I have to say that my teeth are the whitest they&#x27;ve ever been. I&#x27;ve used tons of white strips in the past, and this tube of toothpaste has had an effect equivalent to 2-3 packs of white strips. I&#x27;m impressed. No tooth or gum irritation and no cavities either. I use a sonicare so it&#x27;s possible that this has some had some sort of effect as well? However, I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and only since I bought this toothpaste a couple months ago have I experienced whitening.[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, buy this is you want your teeth whiter and an effective toothpaste. Make sure you also floss once a day. I also STRONGLY recommend a Sonicare after buying one. It cleans my teeth a level beyond what a non-vibrating toothbrush could do. There was a layer of plaque that was always present before.</li>
    <li> This product gives a great clean feeling for the entire day and makes your mouth minty fresh for hours. Is not too intense and is safe for dental work.</li>
    <li> I prefer the hard bottles but really like this kind of teeth whitening minty tooth paste. Makes my teeth feel clean. Unlike sensodyn where my teeth still feel gross after.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this toothpaste helps with whitening. Those blue beads are supposed to be bad for you... No wonder why my gums were bleeding a lot. Ugh I paid a lot for it so I guess I&#x27;ll just use it to restore headlights LOL</li>
    <li> It whitens well but it tastes bad and doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling cleansed and fresh. I won&#x27;t order this again but I have no problem trying other Crest varieties.</li>
    <li> No good at this price you may get cheaper at major chains, if you take into consideration shipping charges is not worth it.</li>
    <li> They work pretty well, and it&#x27;s nice to have them delivered</li>
    <li> I love brushing my teeth now. And my teeth are actually whiter like Crest promises. I will continue to buy this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I now have teeth like before the invention of coffee and red wine.  I look like a two legged Similidon.</li>
    <li> I like the product...feels good in your mouth. Leaves you&#x27;re mouth clean with out that &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34; feeling of some toothpastes. I only gave it 3 stars because both tubes came unsealed...meaning No little foil cap over the opening which leaves you thinking it could have been tampered with. I would have returned them for that reason, but my kids charged in when they saw the Amazon box and had already opened them and squeezed them out to test before I got to it myself. (Darn kids...don&#x27;t they know better?) Plus we haven&#x27;t seen that much Whitening after a month of use...but the little granules in the paste clean your teeth well...so for this month....it&#x27;ll do. Normally, we alternate between an enamel restoring toothpaste with whiteners and one for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the value. Nothing special about this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, great value and ordered online making it easier for me to do other things.</li>
    <li> very good . I like it very much .  a nice one.  i will buy one more next time , good</li>
    <li> Been using this toothpaste for about a week and has done very slight whitening, but it sure has scratched up my teeth.  Going to switch back to my old toothpaste.  The  bottom of my molars feel like they are scuffed up, not slick like before</li>
    <li> Have been using this, and it does seem to help whiten my teeth some without causing any sensitivity!  I wish it would do more, but it may just be my teeth...</li>
    <li> This is really good tooth paste. I&#x27;ve always used Crest in one form or another &amp; this is a really good one.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s a two pack and it forms a good lather while brushing. I guess time will tell if any whitening occurs. Smells good, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have to say the reason I bought this item was the deal I got on Amazon. I bough this item for my husband since I can not use whitening toothpaste. He loved it and asked me if I could buy it again after he went through these tubes...I would call that a success.</li>
    <li> Good but not great job of whitening teeth. Even after many months of use it has only whiten my teeth about one or two levels. Best for maintaining already whitened teeth.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for little over two weeks and as of yet, I haven&#x27;t seen any stark changes within the brightness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> love this tooth paste.. cheap and comes in a two pack. you cant go wrong with this. I will repurchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I wanted more of a toothpaste cleaning type. Not bad though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month already and my teeth look exactly the same as before. The only difference is that it makes my teeth ache a little bit.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet, but the taste isn&#x27;t as bad as my old one</li>
    <li> I bought these with a coupon, getting my final price down to $4.97.  The price is double that at my local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I must share with the world how AMAZING this toothpaste is. I used it for a year now and honestly I can&#x27;t brush with anything else now. It definitely whitens your teeth and gives you a clean fresh mouth feeling. I had to stay at a family members house and actually regret not bring my toothpaste, because what they had just didn&#x27;t cut it. After you have tried the best there is not going back. PLEASE IF YOU WONDER TO BUY THIS...DO IT! You will not be sorry...it&#x27;s a great toothpaste. It must be good ...look at me I&#x27;m writing a review about a TOOTHPASTE...it&#x27;s just that good! :)</li>
    <li> they need shades. people stop me in the street and ask me to close my mouth because they keep walking into stuff. recommended.</li>
    <li> I have big, prominent teeth and a large smile, so it&#x27;s important for my teeth to be fairly white. That said, I can&#x27;t justify dropping money on Whitestrips or similar products that will inevitably eat away at the surface of my enamel and make it so that I have to dedicate a portion of my day looking like the cheshire cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now while I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke cigarettes, I do drink tea and red wine on occasion, so theoretically there should be some staining going on. In fact, when my boyfriend buys the cheap brand at the dollar store (without the grit), I do notice a bit of a difference. The formula of 3D White makes it so that my teeth stay white to the point that several people ask me if I&#x27;ve had them whitened. I always recommend it.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t use this toothpaste. This toothpaste is way too abrasive and can least to tooth abrasion and tooth sensitivity. I am a dentist and I can tell which of my patients use this because I&#x27;m constantly pulling the little plastics balls out of their gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a terrible product. I you want your teeth white then use a set of bleaching trays (good god don&#x27;t use lemon juice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr E.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D has a vibrant minty taste &amp; makes my mouth feel fresh &amp; clean. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to determine if it makes my teeth whiter but I do like this toothpaste &amp; will purchase again</li>
    <li> All the hype about this toothpaste is just that hype, it does not work, I have been using it for a month and there was no difference from regular toothpaste</li>
    <li> I really have seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth since we started using this toothpaste. It&#x27;s not an overnight difference--it&#x27;s taken a few months--but it really does seem to work, if just a little bit. Tastes good too.</li>
    <li> this tooth paste worked so well on my teeth, i felt like i could see Stars in the mirror, i saw a reflection of clean and that was sparkly bright. breath is so fresh i walk down the street after brushing going OOOH WEE!!  it tastes so good and feels so  great.</li>
    <li> Crest 3-white really works! I noticed a difference in my daughter&#x27;s teeth! They whiten quick! A definite buy and worth the money!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works well, I&#x27;m not sure my teeth changed shades using this and the mouthwash twice a day, but my teeth did feel clean at least.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Easy to squeeze tube and  has an easy open top. Top is attached so you never have to worry about loosing it!</li>
    <li> This 3D White is good but I really can&#x27;t see a whitening effect.  To be sure, such a thing is hard to judge on oneself.</li>
    <li> i really like this product so far and i like that the lid is attached so i am not constantly having to find it .  i will have to wait to see about the whitening as i am a heavy coffee drinker and coffee does stain the teeth.</li>
    <li> i like the way my mouth feels after brushing with this toothpaste. its cleaner than others. however after almost a whole tube i dont notice my teeth any whiter</li>
    <li> Hopefully this helps get rid of my stains from drinking coffee for the last 20 years....</li>
    <li> Helps with coffee stains. I drink a lot of dark roast black coffee and this toothpaste really helps keep my teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> It is crest, what u expect？</li>
    <li> I have to say, I have been using this toothpaste for a good 6 months now, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased! I have seen reviews that say it unpleasant tasting, or hurts your teeth. I have semi-sensitive teeth, and I&#x27;m very picky about taste. This product tastes like any minty toothpaste. It also is not painful to your teeth, unless you don&#x27;t brush properly, which has nothing to do with the toothpaste! It definitely whitens and I would recommend it for whitening and long term use.</li>
    <li> Just tried the toothpaste and like it.  Not sure I&#x27;ve noticed much difference yet, but it feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Teeth look white-er but after using it for 3 years my teeth became sensitive so i needed to swich to other kind. I still use it but not every day:)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t any enamel left on my teeth and some exposed nerves, so my teeth are pretty sensitive.  I can use this toothpaste with no problems.  A thought to consider: any time I change toothpaste I do it gradually, as I get a cold if I make the change suddenly.</li>
    <li> I can already see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste it whitens your teeth without destroying the enamel on your teeth. This double pack cost just $1 more than what you will pay for a single tube at a chain store.</li>
    <li> I hate going out to buy toothpaste, soap, toilet paper, etc., so even if this wasn&#x27;t great stuff I would be happy I didn&#x27;t have to go shopping for it.  Fortunately, this is good stuff.  Tastes good, cleans, and probably actually whitens too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good toothpaste, it&#x27;s crest.. haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening. i buy crest where i can find the best price. the auto delivery is the best.</li>
    <li> Wish there was more in this tube.&lt;br /&gt;Works well. I feel it&#x27;s a little too pricey. Toothpaste is toothpaste. Will probably not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product pack was a gift to a very honest friend, so I&#x27;m quite sure that I&#x27;ll get feedback from recipient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asked quite a bit how often I whiten my teeth. Truth is, it&#x27;s been about 6 or 7 years. I&#x27;ve used this stuff since I first saw it, and I&#x27;ve been using Crest since I was a kid. My teeth are white despite drinking coffee, having chewed tobacco and smoked in mass amounts. Doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all either, like the whitening process did.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this product, becuase there are a lot of blue small staff in this toothpaste, so it has very big chance go into your gingiva</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. After a good brushing, your teeth feel smooth and your breath is clean and fresh. Remember to brush your tongue, since there are grooves and ridges on your tongue that trap bacteria. If you don&#x27;t keep your tongue clean, eventually you get a build-up of foul-smelling goo that even clean teeth can&#x27;t hide.</li>
    <li> We only use crest 3d white in our house. We have perfect teeth from this tooth paste. Our dentist loves us.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. I love it, my mouth feels so clean</li>
    <li> great product and price. fast delivery</li>
    <li> My mouth has never felt cleaner, highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> Leaves my teeth feeling so fresh and sparkling white, I love it!</li>
    <li> Min love the taste and texture of the toothpaste.  But the toothpaste cap breaks too easily and you can&#x27;t close it properly.  Them you get a dried out toothpaste opening and pretty soon you can only get a small line of paste that you know just past over dried clumpy toothpaste. Gross, right?  Also the crystals leave a film on the sink that is very difficult to scrub off.</li>
    <li> After a few uses I could see a visible difference in the color of my teeth and am enjoying the results</li>
    <li> It made my teeth a bit whiter then before but I have only been using it for a week so I&#x27;m expecting more improvement soon but other then that it&#x27;s a good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Having a college student that lives thousands of miles away, in a dorm &amp; without transportation...this was a lifesaver.  It is cheaper to order from Amazon &amp; have shipped than for me to purchase &amp; mail myself.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste always see results in the first week of using it. People always ask my secret. I drink coffee (4 cups) a day pretty much and still have very bright, white, smile!</li>
    <li> I love it, I&#x27;ve only used it for two days ,I brush my teeth twice a day and never feel good about my teeth but with this product I had results immediately, my teeth feel fresh and look a little whitter already.</li>
    <li> Subscribe and save item. One of my kid&#x27;s really likes this toothpaste and it works well for them. He has used the whole whitening series and has had great success at a fraction of what professional tooth whitening would have been.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste really work.  I just start using this toothpaste recently and really notice the different.  I was using Colgate before and it doesn&#x27;t whiten my teeth as Crest 3D.  The only problem is that it could make my teeth a little sensitive sometimes.  I alternate this toothpaste in the morning and a different toothpaste at night.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White has been a very effective part of my overall Whitening strategy, but is not my only tool to get whiter teeth. The toothpaste alone will get your teeth a little whiter, but won&#x27;t get you all. I use this product in cycles, basically in-between my other whitening regimen. This means I brush with this at night 3 days in a row, then stop using this product for 3 days, then start again. I do this for 2 weeks straight until my teeth are to my desired whiteness level, and then stop using the product completely until my teeth start to go down from what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the days that I do not use this product, I use [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC This whitening gel]]. If any of you are using this product, or similar whitening products, you&#x27;ll know how powerful they are, and know why it&#x27;s not good to use the toothpaste and the gel at the same time. The toothpaste itself has abrasives so it&#x27;s only good to use as a supplement to true teeth whitening systems like the one I linked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products supplement each other very well, and the aforementioned cautions aside, using Crest 3D White toothpaste along with the whitening gel has made my teeth very (movie-star) white. You just need to make sure to cycle the use of both products otherwise your teeth will get very sensitive!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this review helps.</li>
    <li> no one has told me my breath smells bad which is cool i guess.  not sure what they mean by 3d white.  My teeth have always been 3d.  but yea it kinda whitens them too.</li>
    <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
    <li> The flavor is awesome as well. It actually tastes like a sweet, minty hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this toothpaste is the high cost.</li>
    <li> I used to love this toothpaste until I found out that those little blue specs were actually useless pieces of micro-plastics (polyethylene) and that those little blue pieces of plastic can get stuck in the edges around your gums. P&amp;G has said they&#x27;re working on removing them in the next 6 months to year and a half... but until then I&#x27;m definitely staying away. either way, it got me thinking about what other chemicals they have in here that can&#x27;t be good for me.</li>
    <li> Great option to conquer the everyday things (coffee ...) that stains the teeth and not harsh as some baking soda alternative. Even the kids love it and the whitening effect though not drastic is noticeable.</li>
    <li> I used this for over a year, tried others &amp; go right back to Crest 3D vivid white. No burning, sensitivity or sore mouth/lips.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my smile look better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my teeth but I do like the clean feeling it gives. I do think I will order again</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 3 years and just love it. You will see a difference if you keep on using it</li>
    <li> Love this product does everything its suppose to works great</li>
    <li> great toothpaste - try it - you will more than likely become a Crest fan for life</li>
    <li> Microplastic particles lodging in our gums, sticking to our sink, washing down the drain into the river and ocean. Awesome product, P&amp;G. How much of this stuff do you think we&#x27;re consuming? Microplastics have attractive properties to other toxins in the environment, so they become ultra-toxic and are then consumed by animals, which are then consumed by other animals. What the heck are we doing, humans?!</li>
    <li> Make you wanna bite a lip and get some tongue.</li>
    <li> To straight shoot this one: Taste is good. Teeth are whiter. No issues with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never use another toothpaste after this one.</li>
    <li> I am a habitual coffee drinker, at least 1 cup a day but often times it is more.  One of the unfortunate side effects of drinking lots of coffee is that it tends to stain your teeth, while more or less harmless, it does not look very nice. After about a month or so of using Crest 3D White the stains were noticeably less, and after using it long term they are gone altogether.  This will not get you the artificial bright white look you get from a professional teeth whitening or the strips, however it definitely makes your teeth look much brighter and healthier than they would without using this.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend, and the price on Amazon is great too, a little bit cheaper than buying in the store.</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve used ... and I&#x27;ve even tried the really expensive stuff. It good to use for just a general toothpaste too--your teeth will feel very clean. My dentist said it was fine to use. I noticed a few comments where people mentioned it makes teeth rough, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> any crest 3D is great for my husband who smokes</li>
    <li> It really does whiten your teeth after a few uses. I love the taste as I don&#x27;t like super spicy toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of whitening toothpastes and this is by far my favorite one yet. I had been using Aquafresh extreme clean and that helped but it seemed to get to a certain point and then stopped whitening them. I still wanted my teeth to be a bit brighter and whiter so I decided to try this. I was not disappointed! Just after a few weeks I could see results and now my teeth are finally the shade I wanted them. I will continue to use this product to maintain the whiteness. Be patient as the results are NOT overnight. Give it a few weeks and you will see noticeable results. My sister even commented on how much whiter my teeth look and she had no idea I was using a whitening toothpaste. I would recommend and I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> only toothpaste i use for white teeth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for some time. It does the trick and taste good to.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a great fresh minty taste that lasts a while, just what I&#x27;ve been searching for, have only used it a couple of times, so can&#x27;t testify to its whitening abilities. I bought it for its fresh taste, the fact that it whitens too, is even better. It is too expensive here though, I&#x27;ve seen it for less elsewhere</li>
    <li> doing the job I thought it would!</li>
    <li> i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since March 2014. I am on my 4th tube. I have adopted a good brushing, floss, pick &amp; scaler and lastly natural listerine rinsing regiment before I go to bed. Just tooth brushing and listerine when I wake up. I use an electronic toothbrush. A dental hygenist informed me that I had a few 4s and 5s in the tooth pocket measurements before the start of using this tooth paste. You want those numbers as low as possible. If they are too high, bacteria can flood in and cause harm to the health of your gums. The more your gums recede, the less anchorage a tooth has. 6 months later, I am back for my dental checkup. No cavities. The hygenist was impressed with my improvement. She commented that she doesn&#x27;t usually see this much improvement. I told her about my toothpaste change, flossing, pick and scaling everyday before bed. She also said that some people&#x27;s gums don&#x27;t respond well(inflammation?) to the tartar-control ingredient in toothpastes. This could be an additional reason for my improvement. I don&#x27;t believe this toothpaste I&#x27;m reviewing has a tartar-control feature. I mainly bought this product to help whiten my teeth. I feel it has. I am smiling with teeth alot more. I feel good and that is what&#x27;s important. So my tooth pocket measurements have been reduced drastically. My gums do not bleed regularly anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLUE BEADS: I have seen a blue bead or two left over when I use the pick on my teeth. None have become &amp;#34;lodged&amp;#34; in my gum. Of course I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see it right? Feel it? Maybe as an article described. Combined with my pick, the gums are as clear as I can get them. The hygenist had no mention of finding blue beads while cleaning my teeth. Would she have told me? I will ask next time about it in Janurary 2015(next appt.) and update this review if need be. If users of this product have deep pre-existing tooth pockets or periodontitis, then those blue beads can get stuck I&#x27;m sure. Take care of them gums. What Igather from the articles I read about these plastic beads are that the real danger is what these do to the environment. The beads go down the drain, pass through water filtration into ocean, fish eat beads and we eat fish. That&#x27;s just one example. It&#x27;s great news that the company is going to remove the beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not here to discredit any people&#x27;s qualms about these blue beads in this toothpaste. I am expressing my positive experience. It&#x27;s like food/retail reviews. People that have negative experiences are more likely to leave feedback than people with positive ones. It&#x27;s not well balanced. Anyway, I hope this review wasn&#x27;t too long. I think I covered all I wanted to. Have a nice day.</li>
    <li> Deployed to Afghanistan it&#x27;s hard to get this stuff. I use it at home and it&#x27;s always whitened my teeth noticably within a week.</li>
    <li> Leaves your mouth feeling nice and clean.  Fresh breath, and not a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling like other toothpastes.  Just a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> While the toothpaste didn&#x27;t burn my gums like some reviewers reported, it really didn&#x27;t seem to work any better or worse than the normal Crest toothpaste we use already.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for a long time and since we found it on Amazon it was nice to get a good price for this great product and  have it delivered right to my door.  Will be ordering again when needed.</li>
    <li> Tastes good, leaves breath fresh, and whitens teeth. Does not make teeth sensitive. A good compliment to whitening strips. Could also be used for maintenance after teeth whitening</li>
    <li> As i told you before the 3 d white  was a good b product and for the price it was very good.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a savings, but it&#x27;s convenient. Never noticed any toothpaste to actually noticeably whiten my teeth. No exception here.</li>
    <li> I do love this toothpaste. I bought it when I purchased my sonicare. It works well but I try to limit it&#x27;s use since the ingredients are harsh. I personally would recommend using it 3x a week. I use another natural toothpaste rest of the week.</li>
    <li> I was tired of looking in the mirror and seeing those tell-tale, dingy coffee stains left behind from my everyday java fixation.  My old standby, Ultra Brite, just wasn&#x27;t doing its job.  Getting older, thinking it was time for something a bit stronger, decided to give Crest 3D White Vivid Toothpaste a try.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a few weeks, but have noticed a significant improvement in my smile ... &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> Crest 3D is far from my first foray into a whitening toothpaste.  I have tried several kinds in the past including ones from Colgate, Toms, and even other Crests brands.  I have to confess that to a degree all of them have been successful in whitening my teeth.  But since using a toothpaste to brighten ones smile is by far the easiest way to a regular whitening program, I have always enjoyed trying new brands.  I picked up this Crest 3D about month ago locally.  Not only is it the best whitening paste I have ever tried, but I also like the tube itself.  It has a wide flat cap on it so its easy to store conveniently on end, and the paste itself is very fluid, thus it flows well and is easy to cover the brush with, sparing us much of the usual mess.  But where this stuff really takes off is in its performance.  It just flat out works very well in whitening ones teeth with regular use.  I saw a considerable difference in just one week, and continue to see further brightening a month down the road with it.  This toothpaste taste just fine, (though a little strong till you get used to it), and I have felt no irritation of the gums with it whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any Crest brand of toothpaste is easy to find locally for most.  But if you enjoy ordering from the comfort of your own home, or just need a little something more to qualify for free shipping, I highly recommend this two pack here on Amazon.  I paid more than half of the current price for one tube locally, and that was without the convenience of it being shipped to my home.  Great toothpaste and a solid deal here.  Highly recommended... : )</li>
    <li> Seems to be working as stated!  My daughter is using it too, and likes the taste and consistency, which is usually a problem!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste 2 weeks ago and ever since I have had mouth sores.  This happened the last time I used Crest; my entire mouth filled with sores.  After some research I realize that this is common with Crest products.  I will never buy anything Crest again.</li>
    <li> Gives you a bright and white smile....within the first week you can tell the difference of before and after!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening in my teeth!  But at least it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible like other whitening toothpastes.  Cheers!</li>
    <li> this is a very good product, yes I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only this for a few years and often get asked if I bleach my teeth.  My dentist even told me that when he bleaches patients&#x27; teeth, he tries to get them to my color.  I don&#x27;t have any sensitivity, and the price is great from Amazon with Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste that really does whiten my teeth and has removed staining. Good sized tubes of toothpaste. Good value. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste seems to work pretty good. I have to get back to using it because I normally use toothpaste that helps with tooth-sensitivity. So some days I don&#x27;t always use this. But when I do use it, it seems to do the job after a few days of use. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> this tooth paste works quite good and the taste and smell is good too. I think I will buy the similar one.</li>
    <li> I am a brand name shopper and always use Crest toothpaste.  Whenever a new Crest product isi introduced, I try it and decide if I like it more than the current Crest toothpaste I am using.  This Vivid White is a winner and I&#x27;ve ordered it more than once.  Try it for yourself.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Radiant Mint...&lt;br /&gt; good  product&lt;br /&gt;i like its its really  like what they say</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great. The price is a little high but it worst it. It helps to make your teeth much whiter and cleaner.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste looks great, And tastes great. Leaves me feeling clean and minty fresh! I&#x27;ve also noticed my teeth whitening a little bit after only a week&#x27;s use! I love it, Its nice when a product makes a monotonous thing better.</li>
    <li> really works i bought the oral b toothbrush electric and that thing with this this stuff is the bomb diggity bomb boogy woogy</li>
    <li> I sweat by this toothpaste! I noticed that after about a month of using Crest 3d that my teeth were whiter and I was getting compliments from my friends and family.  I have also noticed that this toothpaste does help remove surface stains that have built up throughout the day from coffee, tea, or acidic foods! I am a coffee drinker, and when I have ran out of the Crest 3d and had to use an alternative, or when I have wanted to try another product for whatever reason, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are more yellow and not as shiny and bright when I use the Crest 3D.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t turn my teeth white and it doesn&#x27;t taste good!  Now I have to use up two of them.</li>
    <li> I like it, it cleans and I like the flavor. The top cap is flat so you can store it upside down, less waste when its near empty. Buying it on Amazon is great because the subscription price is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using crest 3d vivid tooth paste for a while. but for some unknown reason they changed the toothpaste I was using. the one I used to use had some kind of crystals that just made it feel like my teeth were getting cleaner, might of been just a mental thing, but I loved it. and now I can&#x27;t find one to come close. now this toothpaste gets the job done, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the color of my teeth but I&#x27;m not looking for that. but it gets the job done, my teeth are clean and my breath is fresh and it&#x27;s a double pack for the price of one...can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the shipment and this product. The taste is so good my kids are brushing longer and three time a day.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will.  Whitens better than others while leaving a pleasant, but not overpowering, taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I got this because I was running low on supply, and it works great, cant say my teeth are getting much whiter, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> reorder love this toothpaste</li>
    <li> Feels fine on my teeth, pleasant taste, does not feel &amp;#34;gritty,&amp;#34; but rather feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no toothpaste expert, but I have asked a couple of different dentists - they most often recommend, at least to me, that the specific brand of toothpaste doesn&#x27;t make so much difference as whether or not people brush their teeth in the first place!  So I brush mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only have to brush the ones you want to KEEP, right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they consistently recommend fluoride in toothpaste, and sometimes fluoride rinses, as well, so I use them both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest almost forever. I have tried different brands, flavors and formulas from natural to scientifically enhanced. But I keep coming back this Crest. I was a little apprehensive about the radiant mint flavor, since I recently tried a Baking Soda and Peroxide from Brand-X, with a mild mint flavor. I thought I would get used to the &#x27;tingle&#x27;, but it was more unbearable than whatever benefits it could ever provide. I read a review that this Crest, Radiant Mint was fine once you begin using it, and it&#x27;s true, I hardly notice the tingle.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth haven&#x27;t become a dozen shades whiter after only a week of brushing, but it does maintain the brightness and shine. I do not plan on entering my face in any whitest teeth competition, or of being capable or repelling insects with my breath ....... I just like my teeth to look and feel clean and this Crest does exactly that.</li>
    <li> I hate going from Duane Reade to Duane Reade just to hunt for this toothpaste. Its my favorite toothpaste out there. I have no captivities and a pearly white smile thanks to Crest 3D white.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this toothpaste my mouth smells fresh and clean. This is one of the best toothpaste on the market.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! Again, don&#x27;t expect immediate results.</li>
    <li> in australia we dont have these but... having research on teeth whitening.. these toothpaste does the job. im a loyal customer to this brand in terms of teeth products now..</li>
    <li> Just fit the glass canister set and looks nice.</li>
    <li> Fine as a normal toothpaste, no whitening as far as I could tell.</li>
    <li> This product does a pretty good job.  I doesn&#x27;t whiten so much, but keeps my teeth from becoming discolored as I drink lots of coffee.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I started using Crest 3D White &amp; I can see a difference. My teeth are noticeably whiter and my mouth feels clean&amp;fresh afterward.</li>
    <li> makes your teeth feel much cleaner.my family loves it.it feels like a good cleaning after a visit from your dentist.</li>
    <li> If you drink coffee, and or wine, this would not work for you.  I am just saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee and wine, especially coffee stains your teeth like no tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you in your late 20s and older, it pretty much has nothing to do with Crest 3D White or your vices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dentin in your teeth is deteriorating.  That is simply the reality of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may need professional consultation, and not Crest 3D whitening.  This product does make your teeth more sensitive, but not to the point where every food item you eat, hot or cold, is unbearable.  That may have to do with your lack of visits to the dentist and overall oral health care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush your teeth 2-3 times a day with or without 3D whitening, floss, and you should be okay.</li>
    <li> This is an easy way to purchase necessities.&lt;br /&gt;Crest is the best</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my mouth and teeth feel so clean. It hasn&#x27;t really whitened my veneers, but my natural teeth are definitely showing a difference.</li>
    <li> I sometimes find big flakes of hardened paste when brushing. Feels like brushing with an urinal cake, considering the taste and smell. Makes me retch in my stomach when I think about it, but barring that image from my mind, I managed to fully use up the toothpaste and the results have been either very gradual, or non-existent. I was expecting some results I could notice. My teeth still look very much like the \\&quot;before\\&quot; pics in many of the whitening ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to work, but the enamel on my teeth is relatively clear still and the dentin underneath is the same color it&#x27;s always been. Figured it at least would whiten the enamel, but it doesn&#x27;t make such claims. I guess I&#x27;m not the ideal user, since I don&#x27;t do anything that would stain my teeth (coffee, smoke, etc.), as this just appears to be a non-ADA accepted abrasive paste that is designed to work harder to remove surface stains. All considered, I&#x27;m avoiding this from now on.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and product is as described.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works as advertised.  My teeth got whiter after using it for a few months.  I am very pleased with the outcome.  Tastes like normal toothpaste.  It is not gritty at all.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D is one of the first whitening tooth paste I have tried. I was very skeptical to try it at first since I’ve never tried to get whitening results from a tooth paste but after using it I was not disappointed.  Since trying it I have noticed a real difference. Finding a toothpaste that brightens my smile is by far the cheapest and easiest way to keep my teeth pearly white. I am not someone who enjoys having to go through the different brands of tooth paste to find the best one that works so I was really happy that my first choice worked out really well. Not only is it the best whitening paste I have ever tried, but I also like that it is a Crest product which makes it a lot safer for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month ago I went the dentists and my dentist told me that Crest was the best product for my sensitive gums. All the other products irritated my mouth, so finding this was great. It’s also easier to use than other whitening products and by far a lot safer.  I saw a difference in just one week, and continue to see further brightening a couple of weeks after use. What’s even better is that the taste is not too bad either. You can find it anywhere but I found it easier just to order it online from the convenience of my home. For the price it’s a great deal, so I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> sure, mint is a good flavor, but this is more like a way too strong mint, and it feels \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; for hours after, if you like your mouth to be stinging with mint for that long, and you have to wonder what did the scientists in the chemistry lab do to this stuff to make it feel \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; for that long.  All too often we learn later of the bad side effects of these types of creations.  Also, another reviewer had some good points about it being too abrasive, and an LA Times article about all that.</li>
    <li> the size is a bit smaller than i expected but I really liked the taste and feel after I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!~</li>
    <li> I buy this product very frequently and I am very glad with the results. Tastes good and you have a very good feeling after using it. I recomend...</li>
    <li> I like the way this toothpaste feels when you brush it. It feels minty and refreshing. It feels like I ate a mint or something.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It whitems the teeth, but also cleans the teeth very well!!!!  Good buy.</li>
    <li> After using the Crst 3rd White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Toothpaste after only week, I can see the difference in the color of my teeth. This product is truly amazing.  The yellow is gradually disappearing.  I have had no sensitivity using this toothpaste.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to improve the look of their teeth, especially when they smile.</li>
    <li> The only toothpate product that has promised that my teeth will be whitened- and that has delivered on that promise. Within just a couple of weeks there was a marked difference. Plus my mouth just feels clean overall. I haven&#x27;t used another toothpaste since, and when I do, it just feels bad.</li>
    <li> part of my whitening &#x27;system&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;seems to work&lt;br /&gt;get on sale only</li>
    <li> The flavor of this toothpaste is mild enough to finally get my daughter to use REAL toothpaste (at age 11). We actually tried it for the first time at my sisters during a family get together. My daughter liked it so much that my sister gave her the rest of the tube, after that I started to by it for our household. I assume it works well to whiten. But just getting my family brushing with a real toothpaste works for me.</li>
    <li> the price is good and I wish to buy some different type of toothpaste for latter used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you very much.</li>
    <li> ~ ~ UPDATED AFTER 4 DAYS OF USE:&lt;br /&gt;I have used this 3D White toothpaste for 4 days in a row and also did some research. PLEASE USE THIS PASTE WITH CAUTION. I have found the Journal of Clinical Dentistry and L.A. Times have done a clinical study (in 2011) on the abrasiveness of this 3D White toothpaste along with 25 other name brand whitening toothpaste (google &#x27;The Healthy Skeptic Whitening toothpastes a bright idea?&#x27; for the article) The study have found that this 3D White toothpaste has a RDA (Relative Dentin Abrasion) of above 200 which is considered to be &#x27;potentially damaging to dentin&#x27; (dentin is the layer beneath your enamel). Normal regular toothpaste has RDA of well below 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to use this toothpaste for about a few days (like I have) and then only use it every 2 days interval or perhaps only use 3D White on special occasions. All other times, use a regular toothpaste with ADA (American Dental Association) seal. I would also like to note that this 3D White toothpaste does NOT have any bleaching effects like the white strips do since the toothpaste only use the &#x27;abrasives&#x27; to &#x27;polish&#x27; out the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, please use it with caution and avoid using it 24/7. I wanted to share this review since I think many like me is worry about this kind of stuff. Once you have damage to your enamel or dentin, you will never get them back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you for reading. if you felt this review is helpful, it would be nice have comments below. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I have yellow tinted teeth and am neither a smoker or coffee drinker. I had gotten some minor stains from the Crest Alcohol-free mouthwash but that&#x27;s a different story. So I got this 3D White toothpaste. This toothpaste really works in whitening! Well so far, I have just finished 1 brushing, and my teeth got noticeably whiter and a little bit shinier (may due to the polishing ingredient- see label on the box). I have read some reviews saying that this may cause gum sensitivities and it indeed did to me but in a very very minor extent. Before using this toothpaste, I used the Crest Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda toothpaste which has the &#x27;burn feeling&#x27; a lot more than this 3D White toothpaste. The cap is very flimsy as mentioned in other reviews. I will update this when I use this more.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this stuff. It really worked. I used it every single day for two months and could tell a huge difference in my tooth color. I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity issues at all, but I do cycle on and off of this toothpaste because I&#x27;m worried about how abrasive it may be.</li>
    <li> one of the best brightening toothpastes on the market today!</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;I am nuts about brushing my teeth,, fresh breath and this spring I met my dream guy, he said it was MY Smile!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only tooth paste I will use..:-))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you crest!!</li>
    <li> Well, I found out the hard way that I must be allergic to this. It made my gums peel! Like, globs of skin or whatever your gums are made of were coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo I decided to stick with my Sensodyne &amp; gave this to my boyfriend, who has had no problem with it and says his teeth seem whiter.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does help whiten my teeth and the flavor is not to strong or anything. One of the good pastes I used so far.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is a little flat.  It doesn&#x27;t compare to other toothpastes from the standpoint of becoming foamy... sounds weird, but if you try it, you will know what I mean.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference in whitening.  Like Optic White better and Colgate.</li>
    <li> It is very good chocolate as I am used to taste it from Germany.  As a German I should know. Monika</li>
    <li> great value for the price. It&#x27;s Crest so you know it&#x27;s a good product that will help whiten your teeth and keep your mouth clean.</li>
    <li> Great paste and convenient good price don&#x27;t worry about running out ever now. I have not noticed a difference in my teeth but people tell me my teeth are white and I drink coffee and red wine.</li>
    <li> tastes good and it works i notice a difference after about a month.  Try it with the whitestrips too, show off your smile</li>
    <li> My teeth literally felt after dentist clean after using Crest 3D vivid white and my breath smelled do minty fresh.  Tastes amazing and I&#x27;ve even noticed a slight difference in the shade of my teeth</li>
    <li> I am very happy with buying this crest tooth paste. Clearly, it makes brushing teeth in the morning a enjoyable experience</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moV3DZ5AEMT7E7]]I&#x27;ve been always dreaming to have white teeth - American smile like American dream is really popular, guys. I&#x27;m Ukrainian but with this toothpaste I feel I&#x27;m on my way..!</li>
    <li> been using for years, people always tell me my teeth are too white , ( no such thing)</li>
    <li> Well, i can assure you the whitening part works great! A while back we switched to Toms of Maine - after a few months of using it, I noticed that my teeth started to get stains (from all the coffee and tea i drink maybe?). I switched to this toothpaste instead - after just one tube I can clearly see the difference. About 70% of the stains I got while using Tom&#x27;s were now gone. The taste of this toothpaste is quite pleasant as well. Can&#x27;t really explain it buy some toothpastes to me taste like throw-up and others have a way too strong mint flavor. This one has a good balance of mint flavor. I placed this item on my Subscribe and Save as it is now my regular tooth paste.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Radiant Mint Toothpaste&amp;#34; for a month, but I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet. I will continue to use it for 2 more months and then if it doesn&#x27;t do the job that it supposed to do then I will have to look for an alternative tooth paste.</li>
    <li> I noticed that this is a good way to preserve teeth that have already been bleached. I like the soft mint flavor, somewhat soft mint flavor and how there are little scrubbers in the paste that clean my teeth. I can&#x27;t use this everyday because I&#x27;ll get canker sores. Brushing with Crest gives me canker sores at least once a month anyway. So I use a toothpaste without sodium laurel sulfate normally but I&#x27;ll use this maybe for a few weeks or a month before switching back to my normal paste just to help preserve white teeth.</li>
    <li> After using the Crest White Luxe Glamorous White toothpaste while on holiday in Canada/USA I was so disappointed when I returned home to New Zealand and couldn&#x27;t buy it here.  I ordered and paid for expensive delivery costs to New Zealand and will contine to do so just so we don&#x27;t run out.  I use the Glamorous White and my husband prefers this product; he has no particular reason-just likes the feel of this one.  This product has whitened his teeth and made a noticeable difference from the first use.</li>
    <li> its my first time using this 3DWhite tooth paste so far I like it,  seams like it cleans well, I havent seen major change but it look like it wil do what it claims, I will came back and add more as I notice changes</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, but I do agree with other reviewers about you may get a little sensitivity issue with this, that is why I use it twice a week to maintain white teeth, I tried using it every day and I got the same sensitivity issue as well, so I stopped the sensitivity issue with only using it twice a week instead of everyday. I use the colgate total the other days, but it does whiten your teeth really good for a toothpaste. One of the better ones I have come across</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past.  I stopped using it for 6 months, and went for a dental cleaning, and my doctor was disappointed how stained my teeth were.  So I went back to it.</li>
    <li> good toothpaste. I receive natural color of teeth and taste of freshness. I advise all. You will remain are happy. Conveniently the cover opens. It is possible to put vertically. Excellent tooth Pasto and the thought-over design. I derive pleasure and comfort.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothpaste and it has added brightness to my teeth.  I was thinking about getting them whitened, but there is no need.  It takes getting to the second tube before you will clearly notice a difference but there is one.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say, works as expected, just want to rate it with stars and move on to something else.  So...</li>
    <li> After trying several other toothpastes, I decided that this is the brand we will always use in our house. It tastes good and I think it actually helps whiten!</li>
    <li> Takes time, but it&#x27;s maintaining the off-white colour I&#x27;ve got after using the strips. Need to use it twice daily.</li>
    <li> $3.99 per tube at the grocery store or $5.49 for two tubes on amazon.... I&#x27;ll take those saving any day (or every two months like I have setup with subscribe and save!)</li>
    <li> Nice minty smell and leaves your mouth refreshed. Used with the other 3D products they improve your smile a lot.</li>
    <li> I kept forgetting toothpaste and finally ordered it on Amazon. It came all by itself. I guess this is the future of retail for sure. I have not seen this particular flavor in our supermarket and glad I ordered it. I do see a difference in my teeth, probably because it has removed coffee stains.</li>
    <li> Found out the little blue specs are very small plastic. Won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
    <li> So far so good; awaiting results. Hopeful it will help whiten teeth some (coffee drinker) also like tea. Will see how effective this is.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a toothpaste that whitens and cleans, this is the product for you. I will never use another brand or type of toothpaste after using this product.</li>
    <li> Great taste, leaves behind fresh breath.  Makes my teeth and my mouth feel clean and refreshed.  No unpleasant aftertaste like some other toothpastes leave.  Lvoe the two pack.</li>
    <li> This is a valuable purchase from Amazon, because it&#x27;s $1 cheaper than local grocery stores. Thanks Amazon! Great buy! ~~~</li>
    <li> Flavor of this is better than I expected - reminds me of scope toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Only half way through the tube, so cannot tell if it makes a difference in teeth whiteness.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but most best-in-class teeth-whitening toothpastes are not cheap. Without adding whitening strips to me routine, this toothpaste does a decently well job at keeping my teeth looking white and healthy.</li>
    <li> This stuff really makes your teeth whiter. I felt a bit of mild sensitivity she. I started using it but that went away with time. Very good toothpaste</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste for for current price. Used for the first time and has been satifactory effect. One can use it for longer effects</li>
    <li> i have almost finished a whole tube now and i can say that it really leaves my teeth feeling clean</li>
    <li> great product ill order again next time:) very well said :))) i like the taste :)) feels clean everytime i brush my teeth ..but make it a little lesser price.. :))</li>
    <li> Have always used Crest products and enjoy the whitening capabilities that this product offers.</li>
    <li> It really does not taste good, but I might be picky.I guess i will sit here quietly with my two tubes until I can get a different type.</li>
    <li> Yayyy, sodium flouride is awesome!!! No triclosan in this product which is a friggin pesticide and may be linked to health problems and is currently under investigation.  Also this is a great price for this product.  The taste isn&#x27;t as good as some other products, but you get used to it really faste and you can be happy that it is cheap, effective and probably contains less carcinogens than other toothpastes (I&#x27;m basing that on the active ingredients label...I don&#x27;t even want to think about the effects of all the inactive ingredients like titanium dioxide, etc).  Take what I say with a grain of salt, you should know I&#x27;m a raging hypochondriac.</li>
    <li> It does whiten your teeth - not as much as you&#x27;d like but it does to it a bit. I notice a difference. I went with the toothpaste because its a safer and less abrasive alternative and approach. If you have sensitive teeth, and you prefer a less aggressive method then I highly recommend it - plus its a good economical option! I actually brush my teeth more often now! I love it!</li>
    <li> It has good (pretty) packaging and I like the taste. Very clean tasting and the 2-pack is a good value.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste-- perfectly minty and whitens subtly! Always leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh! Great buy and great price.</li>
    <li> I am a big coffee drinker and my teeth suffer terribly for it. I have tried a lot of toothpaste&#x27;s and even pointless (and painful) whitening treatments that claimed to work, but didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was suggested by my dentist. Well, his main suggestion was for me to stop drinking so much coffee but that&#x27;s not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four weeks and even though I STILL drink coffee, my teeth actually look white!&lt;br /&gt;How this is done, I have no idea. Going with magic here folks. My teeth don&#x27;t hurt after using this product and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use multiple times on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is awesome as well. It actually tastes like a sweet, minty hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this toothpaste is the high cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I brush my teeth three times a day. In the morning, at work after my three cups of coffee and lunch, and in the evening before bed. After about two weeks of consistent brushing, I saw an improvement. After four weeks, I can&#x27;t believe how white my teeth look.</li>
    <li> As someone with slightly sensitive teeth, whitening can be an issue, so I opted for the toothpaste instead of the white strips. I use it twice a day and I&#x27;m a heavy iced tea drinker. I genuinely saw results in just a few days. Mind you, I don&#x27;t have a glowing Hollywood smile -yet- but I see improvement, and expect to see a lot more over time. If you&#x27;re the type who brushes more than twice a day, you might see better results even sooner.</li>
    <li> I generally buy this one whenever its on sale. I am a heavy coffee drinker and my teeth are really white and not stained. I also tie this in with some teeth whitening mouth wash. It has little beads in the toothpaste which I suppose would give a deeper clean when brushing. I feel in comparison to other brands out there or your basic toothpaste that is slightly cheaper, you don&#x27;t get as good of a brushing as you do with this product. I continue to buy it on sale and not on sale, that is how much I back this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now. the price is good but then it went up two dollars and made it not worth the purchase</li>
    <li> Even my wife loves this toothpaste and she is extremely picky in this regard.  Just the right amount of texture... a bit like very creamy baking soda... the taste is clean and crisp and minty and makes your breath great.  Now she&#x27;s taken my tube so I&#x27;ll have to buy more...  and I will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who is obsessed with how her teeth look.  I always want my teeth to be whiter and this is the ONLY toothpaste I will use.  It really does bring out the white,</li>
    <li> I wrote a review about 2 weeks after I first bought this and gave a much better review at that time.  Since then, I&#x27;ve continued using this product with so-so results.  While it does seem to whiten your teeth somewhat, the effect doesn&#x27;t last long if you quit using it regularly; which I am hesitant to do since several people have commented on its abrasiveness.  It does seem more abrasive than regular toothpaste to me, although not that much but why risk it.  If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting whiteness, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> If you have some light to moderate staining around your teeth get this tooth paste. Buy it and use it everyday twice a day and those stains will disappear in no time.</li>
    <li> really whitens my teeth</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful product</li>
    <li> My teeth were yellow &#x3D;( I dont drink coffee or anything like that but they were obviously yellow. I have been using this toothpaste for about 1-2 months now. My teeth are definetly white but in the crevices they are still yellow. Ive tried scrubbing more in there and flossing and what not and noting seems to work. I need to have my teeth cleaned so i dont know if that is when or not but this stuff works!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only tooth paste I have been using for about a year. I also use the whitening strips with this and even though I have not had a cleaning in a year because I&#x27;m deployed overseas, it had maintained my teeth very white. Before bed leaves your mouth fresh. Great product, can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S COME TO ME UNSEAL BRAND NEW ALSO EXPIRATION  DATE UNTIL 2015. IT&#x27;S JUST A TOOTHPASTE SAVE TIME GO TO THE STORE GET IT. I USE IT THIS IS SECOND TIME BUY THIS ORDER FROM AMAZON. THE PRICE IS FAIR .</li>
    <li> We use this product all the time.  I love the having it shipped to my home.  Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> I like this Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Radiant Mint Toothpaste. I have brought twice and will buy more.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a toothpaste which helps keep your teeth white and your breath fresh... Would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> Found what I wanted and got it.  It&#x27;s what I was looking for and got just that without any complaints.</li>
    <li> I tried out so may different Toothpaste and this is the one I was looking for!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a good mint taste in the mouth, it maked the teeth white after few days of using, its very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and for this price you cant go wrong</li>
    <li> The toothpaste works great.. may slightly whiten my smile, although the results are nothing to write home about..&lt;br /&gt;I have just resorted to using it like an everyday toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Will buy again!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Yet another example of buying in quantity from Amazon. Very convenient, and probably cheaper than retail stores.</li>
    <li> My son noticed that my teeth were whiter after using this for only a week.  I am sad that it was taken off of subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see that my teeth have coffee stain...this product really removed all the stains and keep my teeth clean. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the color code is red...but I guess you do need some chemicals to remove the coffee stain effectively.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few years, and several folks have asked me if I get my teeth whitened by my dentist.  It doesn&#x27;t give you that crazy TV show host kind of white teeth, but it will definitely lighten them up a few shades.  I love this stuff.  The tube stands up on its own, so it doesn&#x27;t take up as much space on your bathroom shelf as the flimsy &amp;#34;lay me on my side&amp;#34; other tubes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality brand that&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Being a senior in years, non smoker, seldom drinks coffee but became concerned about the&lt;br /&gt;dullness and discoloration of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has beautiful white teeth, so I asked her for her toothpaste brand. .....&lt;br /&gt;This is it, Crest 3D line!&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks I noticed a remarkable improvement in brightness. I will continue to use Crest 3D products and would recommend this product to anyone who would like whiter  looking teeth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste. I will order another when my are done. you can totally see the improvement within a week or two.!</li>
    <li> Has been our brand for a good 10-12 years and has never failed us.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good.  Not quite sure if it&#x27;s working or not but the I like the fact that it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Crest 3d has a nice minty taste, but not so strong that it stings.  And I like the idea that I can be fighting cavities and whitening my teeth at the same time.</li>
    <li> I used to use the pro health ones..but they were too &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;destroyed&amp;#34; my taste buds. this one is simply perfect.</li>
    <li> Seems to work okay but, don&#x27;t see any great breakthroughs in terms of whiteness.  Perhaps, my expectations are&lt;br /&gt;unrealistic so must consider that,  too.</li>
    <li> yes, my teeth were whitened by this toothpaste. people always ask me if I had my teeth whitened and I tell them to just buy this toothpaste. It does the job. My teeth are sensitive to whitening products but this doesn&#x27;t make them sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have always used Crest toothpaste, but I was surprised to see that this is the best whitener yet. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste! good quality and value! The taste isn&#x27;t too strong for the children. The don&#x27;t mind it compared to the bubble gum or watermelon flavor!</li>
    <li> Gets teeth white. The taste is not that fantastic,but not horrible. I will def order this again in the future.</li>
    <li> you wanna smoke, chew and drink coffee all day and ...and want white teeth ? Then buy this your teeth willl turn white! highly recommended</li>
    <li> While I mostly enjoyed this toothpaste, it&#x27;s recently come attention that Crest uses tiny plastic beads (polyethylene) which are both a risk to your dental hygiene (getting stuck in your gums) and also very environmentally unfriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again until the plastic microbeads are removed.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is one of the ones that contain the tiny blue plastic beads that will lodge in your gums and wreak havoc on your mouth. Similarly I used the one with the &amp;#34;breath strips&amp;#34; a while back and they were actually little plastic squares which lodged in my gums. I switched to this and lo and behold it has the same polyethylene bits in it too. They are including this stuff for color and to sell more toothpaste. Ive since switched to a natural brand of toothpaste and will never go back to crest or colgate. They owe me for a painful trip to the dentist where they had to dislodge the plastic crap out of my gums. Never again</li>
    <li> Went in for my cleaning and my hygienist all of a sudden said &amp;#34;Are you using Crest toothpaste?&amp;#34;  At first I thought that she must have had a good nose from having been in so many mouths... but then she said she knew because she found little blue specks in my gums and in between my teeth from this toothpaste!  They are essentially plastic and are not dissolved by water, normal bodily acid, etc. I had only been using this particular toothpaste for a few days and she had noticed... I just spent a fair bit of money to get some work done on my teeth including a deep cleaning so the thought of little bits of plastic getting stuck in my mouth made me feel sick to my stomach... Will try not to think about how long I had been using other Crest toothpaste which may or may not have had this same problem... regardless of whether or not it does get stuck in your mouth, I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much of this is being consumed and is not getting properly digested.  I may not take the best care of myself or make the best health decisions all of the time but this seems like a no-brainer, the toothpaste is going straight into the bin.  Its a shame because it seemed to have made my teeth a bit whiter, but its not worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned... Switching to Colgate.</li>
    <li> A word about FLUORIDE - there are various forms.  The naturally-occuring is calcium fluoride.  No forms of fluoride benefit your teeth, but calcium fluoride is the least harmful form.  I started using baking soda and coconut oil, and it made my teeth and mouth feel a whole lot better than regular toothpaste. Yellowing of teeth has more to do with nutrition and what&#x27;s going on inside your body than external factors.  Swishing with activated charcoal helps to whiten teeth. Some facts about fluoride:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluorideis used in most toothpastes, mouthwashes, dental varnish, dental preparations and nutritional supplements. This same form of fluoride is used as an insecticide and pesticide, as a preservative in glues, as a growth inhibitor for bacteria, fungi and mold. Sodium fluoride is also used in making steel and aluminum products. Added to molten metal, sodium fluoride creates a more uniform metal. Other industrial uses for sodium fluoride include glass frosting and wood preservatives. Sodium Fluoride is also used in the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) is commonly used for water fluoridation.  This form of fluoride is a toxic liquid by-product, acquired by scrubbing the chimney stacks of phosphate fertilizer manufacture. Other names for it are hexafluorosilicic, hexafluosilicic, hydrofluosilicic, and silicofluoric acid.  The CDC approximates that 95% of our water is fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid. ([...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) is primarily added to public drinking water as a fluoridation agent. This same compound is also used as an insecticide and a wood preservative.  It is a classified hazardous waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture which, if not put into our drinking water, must be disposed of at hazardous waste facilities.  Other names for it are Sodium Fluosilicate and Sodium Silica Fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride was used in German concentration camps to sterilize the prisoners and make them docile.</li>
    <li> Great product I normally buy retail however it was super cheap hear so super deal get it while you can</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over 2 years now. I do have to admit, it prevents your teeth from staining. However, I&#x27;ve started to drink coffee everyday, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It scrapes your teeth! - I feel like it thins out your enamel, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m feeling the scratchy surface of my teeth :(&lt;br /&gt;2) If you drink coffee/tea/dark soda this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t help. It only works if you&#x27;re not drinking any of the dark drinks.</li>
    <li> I have always used Creat and the 3D is great. If you want whiter teeth that are healthy and strong, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Crest 3D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a while now and I wouldn&#x27;t switch to anything else unless a SUPER DUPER 3D + would be put on the shelves. If you haven&#x27;t tried it...... Definitely worth the extra buck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste every single day for about 2 months now, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening at all.</li>
    <li> very good indeed. i hope to buy it over and over again. it makes a very good job and it&#x27;s kind smooth.</li>
    <li> my dentist found little blue specs in my teeth from this toothpaste. She told me the blue flecks are non degradable plastic that can get caught in your gums. never using again!</li>
    <li> lots of tooth paste for a good value. If you&#x27;ve used it consistently like I have it doesn&#x27;t have any more whitening to give you, you&#x27;d need to upgrade to one of their newer/stronger brands. I use with mouthwash to help reduce plaque.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST TOOTH PASTE I HAVE EVER USED!! I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY TEETH IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...  SAVED ME ALOT OF TRIPS TO MY DENTIST TOO.. WORKS AS IT SAYS. I WOULD RECOMMEND..</li>
    <li> toothpaste. what can i say? Makes my mouth feel fresh! i have yet to use this product long enough to notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Great value, and this toothpaste really does remove stains from teeth.</li>
    <li> It has a great taste and keeps your teeth looking great.</li>
    <li> love this product and by it for my grown children to have them and their families use also. Works very nicely and taste and feels wonderful on the mouth.</li>
    <li> Tastes good, gives my teeth a nice shine. No complaints. The two pack has lasted me many months and I will probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love the taste of it; it feels refreshing. But as yet see no whitening.  Have been using a few weeks.</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY LIGHTENS YOUR TEETH.</li>
    <li> Good toohpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like this  this toothpaste. It does make your teeth look more white and the minty taste is wonderful. I highly recommend this to all!!</li>
    <li> added this toothpaste to my subscription.  I really like it but its no longer available.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the strong minty flavor of this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for those extremely sticklers for feeling clean and smelling clean sensitives!&lt;br /&gt;THIS HAS BECOME MY NEW LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;Got a stinky breath husband?? Get him this!  You won&#x27;t regret :)&lt;br /&gt;This is what I&#x27;ve been waiting for all along.&lt;br /&gt;Got it on a deal for less than $5, but $5.36 after tax so it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be back for more but will need to stalk it on a deal. Will buy on the normal cost if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I regret not stocking more before.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually tried it out yet, need to finish off my current toothpaste. My review is strictly on price and value. I know these go for more in the supermarkets so I think I made out just fine.</li>
    <li> The tooth paste has a great texture, leaves your teeth feeling smooth and your mouth feeling fresh. The only toothpaste product that has promised that my teeth will be whitened- and that has delivered on that promise. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Im always sceptical when it comes to  toothpaste, i thought this was just another toothpaste saying whitening but doesnt whiten, but this actually works and quite well. Just need to use it consistently and you will results. I started seeing my results in about 3 weeks, my teeth we&#x27;re whiter.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much</li>
    <li> This toothpaste definitely whitens your teeth.  Without question.  I also love colgate Optic White, but that tends to dry your mouth out a bit.</li>
    <li> Good so far but not sure what is the whitening effect. It&#x27;s like a regular toothpaste to me. Very fresh</li>
    <li> Works as advertised when used regularly, nice flavor and foaming action...seems to remove most daily stains and leave a good flavor in you mouth.</li>
    <li> gift for my girlfriend she likes it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for almost 2 months and I can see a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. It doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity (to me) and I enjoy the way it makes my whole mouth feel after brushing. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this product for the past few weeks and I love it. It really does whiten your teeth at first I thought it was another gimmick, but its the real deal. I brush my teeth in the morning and night and pair this up with rembrandt deeply white whitening mouthwash, my teeth are finally beautiful and white and I&#x27;m not afraid to smile. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I am picky when it comes to toothpaste, and I love this kind!  Great addition to the order I already had in my basket, looking forward to purchasing more health products on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deal. I love buying in bulk because you can get such great prices for everyday items.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great.  I will not go back to using anything else now.  Cavity filling costs about $140 each at the dentist office.  I have two more I need to have filled, due to inability to get dental services for quite some time.  Anything that can prevent you from having to have a cavity filled is great, since your teeth are meant to last you a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this Crest 3D White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Radiant Mint Toothpaste!  I can&#x27;t tell you how many tubes of my old 2D toothpaste I&#x27;ve lost because I&#x27;d put medicine cabinet facing edge-on!  But no more--in fact, my only real complaint is that I sometimes get headaches from those goofy glasses I have to wear while brushing.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for maintaining a white smile.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and the wallet loves it coming with subscriptions</li>
    <li> Crest - the only toothpate I buy!&lt;br /&gt;What can we say about Crest?  It&#x27;s the best!  In the East, or the West!  You&#x27;ve tried the rest, now take off that vest, don&#x27;t be a pest, and be my guest!  Try Crest!</li>
    <li> I still prefer crest as my daily toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans and keep my teeth white at all times.&lt;br /&gt;Love the mint smell after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy when I finish up this 2 tube :)</li>
    <li> Love Crest toothpaste</li>
    <li> it works fine. Considering the price and the quality, It is a good product. However, I didn&#x27;t see anything special for this comparing other Crest tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with being able to stock up and buy multipack of items. Sure the bathroom has extra boxes of toothpaste lying around, but I won&#x27;t be running out for a while to come.</li>
    <li> I think my teeth are getting whiter already</li>
    <li> I used to think that colgate was the top brand but i think its kinda like apple and microsoft. These days apple is way in the lead kinda like CREST!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste!! Definitely helps whiten my teeth</li>
    <li> I bought this elsewhere for an amazing deal, but the price regularly would be better here on Amazon! I have used it once so far, this morning. Wow! I can tell a difference already, even if it&#x27;s just smoother and not really whiter they definitely look different. This is great. My sister has been using it since she found it and her teeth are amazingly white even after she admitted to me she only brushed every other day with it! Great results and great price here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! I have always been a Crest kid and have tried different types of Crest over the years but this is my current favorite.  It still whitens your teeth even for those avid coffee and tea drinkers like me. Its got a nice clean minty flavor too.  The blue crest mouth wash is also great but liquids are cheaper in stores like Target than online.  This deal is better than what I found at wholesalers like BJs.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Repeat buyer and glad I can get it at such a great deal.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> love this toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know what i did without this kind back in the day....&lt;br /&gt;but luckily we live in this area so go buy this!</li>
    <li> Love the taste of this toothpaste.  Don&#x27;t really think it is making my teeth any whiter but I do drink a lot of coffee so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help the situation.</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth feel great and so polished -- when I use it with the mouth rinse.  And it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> WELL I JUST STARTED USEING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS SO I HAVE&#x27;NT SEEN ANY DIFFERENTS YET IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME  I DO BELIEVE FOR THIS PRODUCT TO WORK ON MY TEETHTO GET MY TEETH WHITE ,I WILL BE KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE WHITEING OF MY TEETH, I DO BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, GO BUY THIS PRODUCT YES SIR!!!!!!! ITS GOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!</li>
    <li> The rampant use of teeth whitening products wasn&#x27;t something I was ready to subscribe to, but, the world changes, and you have to change with it.  This product helps to maintain teeth whiteness against things like coffee and red wine (I drink quite a bit of both) in between using the Crest 3D strips.</li>
    <li> I have used this product four times.  FOUR.  TIMES.  Since using it, my gums have become painful and swollen, especially when I floss.  I&#x27;m going to quit using this product IMMEDIATELY.  Hopefully my mouth will return to normal!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean &amp; I noticed they looked  brighter within days!  Works so much better than the Optic White!</li>
