      <li>These are the best eyeshadow/liner i have ever received besides the nyx brand one that are much more expensive!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like them because of the price and the pigmentation, but I really can&#x27;t settle for something that&#x27;s greasy and crease so easily.</li>
      <li>and of course she loves the set very much .</li>
      <li>You must use a primer first to prevent creasing.  </li>
      <li>plus fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I personally haven&#x27;t tried them so that&#x27;s about all I can comment on it :-)</li>
      <li>I had to make a line on the back of my hand with the two shades touching in order to truly see the differences in their colors from one another.</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and last all day long.</li>
      <li>and they paint it very well</li>
      <li>This product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>Very versatile product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what these are made of but they go on really greasy.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant, but you can easily blend them to be more subtle depending on how much you put on.</li>
      <li>so so so much works great for dramatic make up bc</li>
      <li>the colors are so vibrant</li>
      <li>I have fair skin (not pale white) and the colors stand out and are subtle as well depending on how much you use.</li>
      <li>The pencils have a slightly creamy texture that applies easily, and can be blended with a brush or finger if a user so chooses.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to have a couple pastel shades (white, pink, etc) in the mix, but overall this bundle is a deal that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>I really wish there was a white one</li>
      <li>They are about 4 inches long , maybe a little more.</li>
      <li>They have nice big tips (think big crayon tips they make for little kids, not the regular size crayons) )</li>

<li> They have nice big tips (think big crayon tips they make for little kids, not the regular size crayons) )</li>
<li> The set comes with 12 different colors (and the other reviewer is correct, 2 of them are nearly indistinguishable silver colors), for just $16.50 and Prime shipping.  </li>
<li> Only expect to use the color on the tip that you see in picture, too much package, too little product!  </li>
<li> These are extremely long lasting.  </li>
<li> I think as long as you know how to use this product, it will work well for you as well.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a total mess and unwearable.</li>
<li> The other is a lighter silver, like a gray, without the metallic coloring</li>
<li> I get to work at 6 AM and am usually there until 3:30 PM - and this shadow lasted the entire time and them some!  </li>
<li> that the other has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the liners yet, but will update this if I feel like the products performance does not meet my expectations.</li>
<li> it is also very wet</li>
<li> I already have very oily eyelids, and these are just worse!</li>
<li> One is a dark silver, about the color of a dime.</li>
<li> I am not into melting them down and putting into pots.  </li>
<li> These pencils come to less than $1.50 each.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was really hoping that the pots and pans or the cottage cheese liners would be white, but I was sadly disappointed.</li>
<li> but I already have a thin white one that works well</li>
<li> you can toss a couple in your everyday makeup bag and not have it overwhelmed by their size.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I used heavy duty eye primer underneath these liners, and that still didn&#x27;t help set the colors.</li>
<li> These are plain greasy!</li>
<li> I usually buy them from Avon, but lately they&#x27;ve been increasing in price, decreasing in quality, and have fewer and fewer color choices.  </li>
<li> It is hard to tell from the picture, but both of these shades are silver.</li>
<li> Well, they are both true, but the quality is terrible!</li>
<li> I gave this product a try however the quality of the items is poor.</li>
<li> I just hate the waste when they have to be sharpened.  </li>
<li> I pencil hurt your eyes or it don&#x27;t write which gets my mad</li>

    <li> wears off and transfers easily!  Cannot sharpen, nor, does it twist up. Only expect to use the color on the tip that you see in picture, too much package, too little product!  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girlfriend a while back and of course she loves the set very much . I personally haven&#x27;t tried them so that&#x27;s about all I can comment on it :-)</li>
    <li> beautiful product&lt;br /&gt;very cute pencils and they paint it very well&lt;br /&gt;I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I use it oftenly&lt;br /&gt;I will bought it again</li>
    <li> I am a fashion journalist and have to look the part every time I go out. These pencils work both as eyeliners and cream -based eye colors. They are easy to use and blend very well!</li>
    <li> was there fine print saying they couldn&#x27;t be sharpened? if so, then i missed it and would never have bought them. all you get is whats on the tip. it is also very wet so it creases in your eye after about 5 minutes. will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I prefer eye shadow pencils, but haven&#x27;t found them in stores. I usually buy them from Avon, but lately they&#x27;ve been increasing in price, decreasing in quality, and have fewer and fewer color choices.  I decided to check Amazon and came across this bundle.  The set comes with 12 different colors (and the other reviewer is correct, 2 of them are nearly indistinguishable silver colors), for just $16.50 and Prime shipping.  The mix is cool and warm with a couple shades of blue, gold, bronze, purple and more.  The comparable Avon shadow pencils are between $4 and $6 EACH and don&#x27;t offer as many color varities. These pencils come to less than $1.50 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest plus, though, is the quality.  These are extremely long lasting.  I get to work at 6 AM and am usually there until 3:30 PM - and this shadow lasted the entire time and them some!  I have never tried such a long-lasting shadow (powder or pencil).  Not only did it last, but the color didn&#x27;t fade. The pencils have a slightly creamy texture that applies easily, and can be blended with a brush or finger if a user so chooses. I would have liked to have a couple pastel shades (white, pink, etc) in the mix, but overall this bundle is a deal that can&#x27;t be beat. I will look for more this seller.</li>
    <li> Perfect for when I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time in the mirror or I also use it as a great eyeliner base for my eyeshadow.  Very versatile product.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a try however the quality of the items is poor. That means the color vanishes in about 1 hr after you apply and if you touch it it is all gone. The color doesnt stick at all. Returning the product...</li>
    <li> These pencils work alright.  I just hate the waste when they have to be sharpened.  I am not into melting them down and putting into pots.  I wanted to try these but still like the powder eye shadows better.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and how the glide on smoothly and stay on all day! The colors are vibrant, but you can easily blend them to be more subtle depending on how much you put on.</li>
    <li> Love all the pretty colors, very good eye shadow, goes on smoothly and does not wear off, love this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the amazing price and the comments on how pigmented they are. Well, they are both true, but the quality is terrible! I don&#x27;t know what these are made of but they go on really greasy. There is a difference between creamy and greasy. These are plain greasy! They are super pigmented and swatch great on the back of my hands, but not on my eyelids. I already have very oily eyelids, and these are just worse! I used heavy duty eye primer underneath these liners, and that still didn&#x27;t help set the colors. I also used powder eyeshadows on top of these liners as well as makeup sealers. Nothing helped! I think they might be great for face painting or something just temporary but definitely not for everyday/evening/party/regular usage. Like I said, they are greasy and crease right after you put them on! I really wanted to like them because of the price and the pigmentation, but I really can&#x27;t settle for something that&#x27;s greasy and crease so easily.</li>
    <li> I bought these liners because i like to use a colored liner that matches my eye shadow on the bottom of my eye to help my eyes appear wider. I was really hoping that the pots and pans or the cottage cheese liners would be white, but I was sadly disappointed. It is hard to tell from the picture, but both of these shades are silver. They are VERY similar. I had to make a line on the back of my hand with the two shades touching in order to truly see the differences in their colors from one another. One is a dark silver, about the color of a dime. The other is a lighter silver, like a gray, without the metallic coloring that the other has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the liners yet, but will update this if I feel like the products performance does not meet my expectations. Thus far I am happy though. The liners I tested on my hand seemed smooth and applied easily.</li>
    <li> Received these two weeks ago and I love them. They go on creamy and stay on all day. Very easy to blend and I also like to mix in some shadow to create a deeper depth. I have fair skin (not pale white) and the colors stand out and are subtle as well depending on how much you use. I really wish there was a white one but I already have a thin white one that works well so no big loss. I feel they are well worth it to purchase and they came on time. The boxed set kind of reminds you of a colored pencil box you would find in the store. They are about 4 inches long , maybe a little more. They have nice big tips (think big crayon tips they make for little kids, not the regular size crayons) ) you can toss a couple in your everyday makeup bag and not have it overwhelmed by their size. I am very please and will be checking out more bundle monster items.</li>
    <li> Love them just need to be more pigment that&#x27;s ll will order again when out</li>
    <li> These eye pencils are amazing! They look great, they last all day....and the colors are fantastic! They are a great price a must have!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like them at all I pencil hurt your eyes or it don&#x27;t write which gets my mad I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for them but I would never order it again</li>
    <li> A very nice set of pencils. I love the color options. This product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> I just love these pencils.  You must use a primer first to prevent creasing.  The colors are bright and last all day long.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because it seemed like a great deal for the amount of product. I wanted to like them, but every time I wear them, the color gets oily and moves around my eyelid. The color gets sheer on the lid and the color bunches in the crease. It&#x27;s a total mess and unwearable. The NYX eyeshadow pencils are slightly more expensive, but get those instead because the color will stay in place.</li>
    <li> Love these pencils the colors are bright and smooth love it so so so much works great for dramatic make up bc the colors are so vibrant</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I think as long as you know how to use this product, it will work well for you as well.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my granddaughter - she loves color so very appropriate for her to use. the end</li>
    <li> The colors are so pigmented! I love them :) I am saving up my money to but more of these!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best eyeshadow/liner i have ever received besides the nyx brand one that are much more expensive! I would defiantly recommend these to anyone interested! plus fast shipping!</li>
