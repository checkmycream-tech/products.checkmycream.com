### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is delicious.</li>
      <li>want to note that, this isn&#x27;t the best product for waxing legs.</li>
      <li>Sugaring is great!</li>
      <li>:-D</li>
      <li>Practice will make perfect with this, but i am officially converted.  </li>
      <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
      <li>Still a great deal though!</li>
      <li>Love this product!!!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Love this product!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are no chemicals and not tested on animals so ethically very good</li>
      <li>but it was great for my legs.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>This is great for beginners who want to see if sugar waxing is something they want to get in to.</li>
      <li>Lol</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fabulous product at a great price</li>
      <li>What I liked best was that they product is easy to wash off with water if it gets stuck to my leg skin.</li>
      <li>Alright, but not as amazing as it was reported to be.</li>
      <li>My legs and arms feel amazing</li>
      <li>So you kinda on your own unless you find a video tutorial on youtube.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started making my own for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I love this product I have tried all kinds of do it yourself waxing kits and this exceeds all the popular brands by miles.  </li>
      <li>My homemade sugar recipe worked better.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this product.</li>
      <li>Also the Gigi wax on amazon works way better than the sugaring.</li>
      <li>It is best if it is like taffy and still the same color as in the container.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok, so this was an intersting experience.  </li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m sure any vegans looking at this have already clicked away because they read the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I also watched many videos on line and there was no finger kneeding done by anywone.</li>
      <li>just wish the shipping was included to make this a great value or twice as much sugaring</li>
      <li>Over all I was impressed, but over multiple uses, the sugar paste became crystalized and was not as sticky or efficient as before.  </li>
      <li>it still ok.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Nice convenience and water clean up.</li>
      <li>perfect thanks so much!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note it is best if you trim long hair, so that it is basically the length of a grain of rice.</li>
      <li>This product is great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t mind the learning curve, then this might be a great alternative to getting professionally waxed.</li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any ingrown hairs (which I always have when waxing my legs) and my skin felt great</li>
      <li>It grips good and really grabs all the hair.</li>
      <li>I am very inexperienced but it went great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Easy to heat up, just pop in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use ..</li>
      <li>It takes a little getting use to doing it yourself but it works great and the hair removal lasts a couple weeks!  </li>
      <li>If you want hair remover that leaves your skin silky smooth and moisturised</li>
      <li>However skin feels fantastic after it.</li>
      <li>again the product is fabulous</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the results, would definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
      <li>well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this product thinking I had found the hair removal miracle product.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting to have some difficulty with the product initially, but it was pretty easy to use and had great results.</li>
      <li>This wax leaves my skin super smooth ....</li>
      <li>Super easy to clean up, rinses right off with water.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>This did not remove a layer of skin and all was nice and soft when i was done.  </li>
      <li>P.S: I also liked that this natural method was used in ancient Egypt.</li>
      <li>I really did get more than I was expecting with this stuff.</li>
      <li>I bought this product after doing much research and reading about sugaring and how it&#x27;s better than waxing.</li>
      <li>it becomes very sticky and hurts more upon removal.</li>
      <li>the product says to warm in your hands for no less then three minutes.  </li>
      <li>I perform Brazilian waxes on myself and this was pretty easy to use.</li>
      <li>All natural, so great for people with sensitive skin like me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It is best for smaller areas like unarms, hands, feet, facial hair, bikini area,</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona and started using it on a pretty warm day, but sitting under a ceiling fan did the trick.</li>
      <li>I figured it out pretty quickly and used it, and everything went smoothly.</li>
      <li>The DVD was very helpful, and if you still had questions, customer service was very nice and got back to me ASAP.</li>
      <li>(I am a very avid researcher on basically anything I buy).</li>
      <li>I have yet to try it in the bikini area, but so far works best on small areas with both fine and course hair.  </li>
      <li>I will absolutely be buying this again and again!!</li>
      <li>Me + waxing &#x3D; an absolute no, no!!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>And it was my first time!</li>
      <li>I do recommend a soothing product if you have sensitive skin, but the irritation was never worse than razor burn, so it is still better!</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use, easy to clean up afterwards and lastly its cheaper than going to get waxed!  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I need a candle to melt a little bit, but still a great product.</li>
      <li>After watching the videos (in which they didn&#x27;t warm the product in their hands and did not let it turn creamy white)</li>
      <li>Once I mastered my own technice, I removed dang near all of my hair down there and am very pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>As amazing as it is to be able to order a product and do the procedure yourself at home is, there really are some things that are best done (at least the first few times) by a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an Esthetician and had tried many other products but this ones is really good and better than any other sugaring in the market .</li>
      <li>I could never the right consistency or heat</li>
      <li>So easy to use, relatively pain free</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>It is really good for weak hair.but if you have more stronger hair somewhere</li>
      <li>The sugaring mixture was easy to deal with... not messy at all.</li>
      <li>For the first time ever I did a Brazilian wax myself at home using the sugaring about 24 hours ago.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to shaving or waxing after this :)</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing this product again:) \\&quot;</li>
      <li>My skin looked much better with regular shaving!!!</li>
      <li>The product is consistent with what I have used at the salon.  </li>
      <li>It really does just wash with water!</li>
      <li>still haven&#x27;t did my whole leg but will keep trying to get it right</li>
      <li>I eventually rewarmed the sugar for 15 more seconds and applied it with a large applicator (waxing stick)applied it in opposite direction of hair grown, rubbed it in direction of hairgrowth, waited 5-10 seconds and then used the flickign method (in direction of hair growth) to remove it...and</li>
      <li>Also nothing tells you how much to work with, at first I just grabbed a pinch.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t continue using this on my legs because my legs had already becoming so bruised, it looks like someone kicked my legs several times.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, very quickly removed my mustache and a few stray course</li>
      <li>I thought, sure why don&#x27;t I try it, what do I have to loose?</li>
      <li>I was a little nervous about trying sugaring, but the cd was fantastic, giving detailed instructions.</li>
      <li>I was really dubious about purchasing a sugaring product, but after reading reviews and watching lots of videos, I decided to try Cocojojo&#x27;s Cleopatra Egyptian Sugar Wax.</li>
      <li>This product works really well.  </li>
      <li>I followed the directions but could never get any real hair removal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my 2nd time ordering this wax and after carefully reading the instructions and watching a few YouTube videos I was able to wax myself better this time. Not as messy as the last time and a lot faster. You can also save money by making the product yourself. I haven&#x27;t done it bc I&#x27;m lazy but one day I plan to try the recipe.</li>
    <li> This product works really well.  I have used it on my arms and some of the hairs have never come back.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t catch the hair without using strips and melting it</li>
    <li> Contains honey! Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re a vegan! Although I&#x27;m sure any vegans looking at this have already clicked away because they read the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I ordered one jar of this to start since I&#x27;ve never used sugar wax. It took me time and a lot of wax to get the hang of it, but once I did, it worked, and for the first time in my life, my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t break out-it actually felt healthier! Can&#x27;t wait to wear my bikini, and I just ordered the larger pack of several jars. P.S: I also liked that this natural method was used in ancient Egypt.</li>
    <li> I am a very inexperienced waxer. For quite some time I have been getting a Brazilian wax by a professional. I recently quit going due to getting severe ingrown hairs. This has never been an issue for me when I shaved. I might get a couple of them throughout the year but never multiple ones that are so bad that in order to get the ingrown hair out I literally ended up cutting my skin trying to tweeze it out because it was a couple of layers down in my skin. My skin has looked awful with the ingrown hairs and red bumps!!! My skin looked much better with regular shaving!!! I had recently came upon sugaring. I was very intrigued by it and did a lot of research (I am a very avid researcher on basically anything I buy). For the first time ever I did a Brazilian wax myself at home using the sugaring about 24 hours ago. So far so good! It is still a little painful but not near as bad as regular waxing. I could not do a regular Brazilian wax on myself at home but I can with the sugaring wax method! I am very inexperienced but it went great! And it was my first time! Its too early to tell if it will cause ingrown hair issues like regular waxing but my skin definitely feels a lot better than it does after traditional waxing. My skin has been incredibly soft every since I have used it. Even after using witch hazel. I use witch hazel for a few days after waxing to help keep the pores cleaned out since they are open for about 48 hours after waxing.  Another benefit is the cleanup. It really does just wash with water! The main benefits for me are that I can do it myself in my own home, cleanup is easy, its less painful, will save me money from going to professional, but the main benefit I am hoping for is the eliminate the ingrown hairs that I got when waxed by a professional. Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> perfect thanks so much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much better than wax on your skin especially for sensitive areas such as your intimate areas. But may not remove all the hair. However skin feels fantastic after it.</li>
    <li> It worked but truley hurt like hell still haven&#x27;t did my whole leg but will keep trying to get it right</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. It grips good and really grabs all the hair. I only use my hands with the sugar and it really holds. Sometimes I need a candle to melt a little bit, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this sugar wax, but it is a bit expensive. I&#x27;ve started making my own for a fraction of the price. This is great for beginners who want to see if sugar waxing is something they want to get in to.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions but could never get any real hair removal. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy woman but know how to use this stuff or just don&#x27;t buy it. This product is great for people with sensitive skin. Usually, fragrance makes me break out but this product is unscented</li>
    <li> not recommended. sticky and sticky. at least easy to take off by water</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, honestly I expected that I could you it differently. I can&#x27;t use it in a regular classic way, but it still ok. However, I would not like to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It does not work! I tried it multiple times in different areas and it didn&#x27;t give ME any results. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Too complicated to bother with. After an unpleasant interaction with the seller/maker of this product I was even less willing to do all the work required for this product to function as promised. I need things to simply my life, not to complicate it. I&#x27;m throwing it away. Complete waste of money. In addition, the seller is extremely rude and his attitude and product completely suck!</li>
    <li> I am undecided on whether or not I really like this product. So I thought I would list the pros and cons for future purchaser info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Super easy to clean up, rinses right off with water.&lt;br /&gt;- All natural, so great for people with sensitive skin like me.&lt;br /&gt;- Alot less painful then regular waxing, feels like ripping off a bandaid (if you do it right).&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to heat up, just pop in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding upon hair removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Will take you time to figure out how to use.&lt;br /&gt;- About the same results as regular waxing, as far as how much hair removal per use and as far as after skin presentation.&lt;br /&gt;- Not great for large areas like your legs, unless previously know what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to note that, this isn&#x27;t the best product for waxing legs. Took me over 3 hours to wax the front of one leg! Maybe I am not doing something right, but that is kinda ridiculous! It is best for smaller areas like unarms, hands, feet, facial hair, bikini area, ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note it is best if you trim long hair, so that it is basically the length of a grain of rice. This way it doesn&#x27;t pull and become more painful when applying. Also nothing tells you how much to work with, at first I just grabbed a pinch. The container says to work it in your hands until it turns white. This is way to long and way to little of amount. You need about the size of a quarter for small areas. I would double or triple that for larger areas. When it starts turning white it becomes very sticky and hurts more upon removal. If you wait this long you will HAVE to use strips to remove it. It is best if it is like taffy and still the same color as in the container.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the learning curve, then this might be a great alternative to getting professionally waxed. I have yet to try it in the bikini area, but so far works best on small areas with both fine and course hair.  oh and FYI, there is no tutorial video, the video that comes with it... is a sales video for their products. So you kinda on your own unless you find a video tutorial on youtube.</li>
    <li> Sugaring is great! I was really dubious about purchasing a sugaring product, but after reading reviews and watching lots of videos, I decided to try Cocojojo&#x27;s Cleopatra Egyptian Sugar Wax. It was really frustrating at first, but the more I used it, the easier it got. However, I found that, to use the paste with my fingers, the easiest way was to not microwave it at all and just use it at room temperature. It was hard to work with at first, but it was the only way I got the white, taffy-like consistency. After that, only a small amount went a long way. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t figure this out until the container was almost empty, but I have ordered a large jar so I can perfect this technique. It is not as simple as 1, 2, 3, but well worth the trial-and-error to stop using razors and avoid the pain of traditional waxing. I do recommend a soothing product if you have sensitive skin, but the irritation was never worse than razor burn, so it is still better!</li>
    <li> Looking for an alternative to waxing my mustache, because I use retin a every night. Tried this cocojojo sugaring paste last night. Easy to use, very quickly removed my mustache and a few stray course hairs under my chin. I love it.  I found a few instruction videos on you tube that were helpful. I used the paste that needs to be worked in your hands for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> this thing hurts uggh</li>
    <li> This is the greatest.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the shipping was included to make this a great value or twice as much sugaring so I would only have to order once a year.&lt;br /&gt;But again the product is fabulous</li>
    <li> This works okay…. Over all I was impressed, but over multiple uses, the sugar paste became crystalized and was not as sticky or efficient as before.  Still a great deal though!</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed in this product because I sincerely thought it was going to work. Actually, let me re-phrase what I just wrote...it DID work but it did a bad job at doing that. I&#x27;ve had VERY sensitive legs my whole life and I have tried everything in the book to get rid of my coarse, dark hair. I bought this product after doing much research and reading about sugaring and how it&#x27;s better than waxing. Me + waxing &#x3D; an absolute no, no!! Every time I have every waxed, my legs have not only bruised (I mean black and blue) but also become irritated with red bumps for days. Every article, review, or website I read said that sugaring is much better because it&#x27;s less irritating and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair as waxing does. I thought, sure why don&#x27;t I try it, what do I have to loose? After doing almost both my legs I now have bruises again, irritated legs, and I STILL have hair on my legs! I grew my hair out for the past week in a half purposely knowing I was going to do this and even at that, this stuff didn&#x27;t get rid of everything. I couldn&#x27;t continue using this on my legs because my legs had already becoming so bruised, it looks like someone kicked my legs several times. I guess my coarse hair just doesn&#x27;t like this stuff!</li>
    <li> Have to get used to using it, had a mess at first, am getting better</li>
    <li> I had been going to someone for the past 6yrs to get sugared and decided to see if I could do it myself to try and save money.  This is exactly what I was looking for! It takes a little getting use to doing it yourself but it works great and the hair removal lasts a couple weeks!  I will absolutely be buying this again and again!!</li>
    <li> The product is consistent with what I have used at the salon.  Sadly, the hair removal method is not for inept!</li>
    <li> Nice convenience and water clean up. No real residue. Skin not irritated.</li>
    <li> Too messy didn&#x27;t work as planned either had to reheat over and over.</li>
    <li> This product has sold me on sugaring. I was a little nervous about trying sugaring, but the cd was fantastic, giving detailed instructions. The sugaring mixture was easy to deal with... not messy at all. Will order this brand again!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Love this product!!! I&#x27;m an Esthetician by trade and have been waxing for 9 years. I perform Brazilian waxes on myself and this was pretty easy to use. I will definitely be purchasing this product again:) \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love this product I have tried all kinds of do it yourself waxing kits and this exceeds all the popular brands by miles.  So easy to use, relatively pain free (it is a bikini wax after all!) well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I looked up a lot of info on sugaring and then researched brands and watched the videos I could find of cocojojo sugaring product demonstrations before I chose this brand and ordered. I really did get more than I was expecting with this stuff. I was expecting to have some difficulty with the product initially, but it was pretty easy to use and had great results. I live in Arizona and started using it on a pretty warm day, but sitting under a ceiling fan did the trick. It hurt a lot less than waxing, pulled up a lot more hair from the beginning  (so far less tweezing required) and also didn&#x27;t tear up skin when the same area was covered multiple times. So far I haven&#x27;t had any ingrown hairs (which I always have when waxing my legs) and my skin felt great afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I could not get this to work on my underarms, but it was more the overall angle, only having one hand to use at a time, and needing to use a mirror that was the problem, NOT the product itself. I&#x27;m only adding this in because I don&#x27;t know if most people realize how difficult to use a hair remover like this on that part of the body if untrained. As amazing as it is to be able to order a product and do the procedure yourself at home is, there really are some things that are best done (at least the first few times) by a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will DEFINITLY be ordering this again though. My legs and arms feel amazing and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to shaving or waxing after this :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this product. I&#x27;ve watched many videos, and it doesn&#x27;t look painful. but It&#x27;s so sticky looking that I was a bit tentative. As people have been mentioning, it was extremely less painful than waxing, and the results are pretty great! I don&#x27;t reccomend it for more sensative areas, like down there... but it was great for my legs. Prepare to spend quite a bit of time removing the hair, though. What I liked best was that they product is easy to wash off with water if it gets stuck to my leg skin. Very pleased with the results, would definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this was an intersting experience.  the product says to warm in your hands for no less then three minutes.  After watching the videos (in which they didn&#x27;t warm the product in their hands and did not let it turn creamy white) I altered the method of application. I also watched many videos on line and there was no finger kneeding done by anywone. I first just barely warm sugar kneeded it for 3 minutes and applied directly with my fingers, but it got too messy and i was struggling with it.  I eventually rewarmed the sugar for 15 more seconds and applied it with a large applicator (waxing stick)applied it in opposite direction of hair grown, rubbed it in direction of hairgrowth, waited 5-10 seconds and then used the flickign method (in direction of hair growth) to remove it...and voila it was way better and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, When i followed the \\&quot;folding direcitons\\&quot; in my hand it only got harder and harder to apply.  Once I mastered my own technice, I removed dang near all of my hair down there and am very pleased with the product.  No lasting bumps and tendernes for hours, unlike with waxing.  This did not remove a layer of skin and all was nice and soft when i was done.  Practice will make perfect with this, but i am officially converted.  Also clean up was a breaze, simply wash with water.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I&#x27;m an Esthetician and had tried many other products but this ones is really good and better than any other sugaring in the market . I will definitely be purchasing this product again</li>
    <li> The DVD was very helpful, and if you still had questions, customer service was very nice and got back to me ASAP. I figured it out pretty quickly and used it, and everything went smoothly. It was easy to apply and left my skin feeling smooth. I was surprised - there was no pain at all. It works great and I&#x27;m never going back to waxing or shaving again!</li>
    <li> If you want hair remover that leaves your skin silky smooth and moisturised then you need to try this&lt;br /&gt;There are no chemicals and not tested on animals so ethically very good&lt;br /&gt;The smell is delicious. Much better than the old chemical hair removers or traditional waxing strips&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and you need not  worry over allergic reactions&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous product at a great price</li>
    <li> My homemade sugar recipe worked better. Also the Gigi wax on amazon works way better than the sugaring. I burned myself both times with this sugar pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Alright, but not as amazing as it was reported to be.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little apprehensive when I purchased this product but after watching the video on u-tube, I felt re-assured.  This product is easy to use, easy to clean up afterwards and lastly its cheaper than going to get waxed!  The only downside is that its not the most idea for those hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> It is really good for weak hair.but if you have more stronger hair somewhere it is not gonna work.</li>
    <li> Incredibly harder to use than expected or advertised. I threw the rest of the bottle away after 2 attempts -- with friends helping! Lol</li>
    <li> I love this product :-D I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shaving.... This wax leaves my skin super smooth .... I waxed my armpit area and it is just amazing.and it&#x27;s easy to use ..</li>
    <li> not good- sticky and need wax strips. waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product thinking I had found the hair removal miracle product.  The shipping was fine nothing wrong with the packaging.  The dvd would not play on my iMac.  I could never the right consistency or heat so all it did was pull up some skin and/or leave a burn.  i will not be buying this product again.</li>
