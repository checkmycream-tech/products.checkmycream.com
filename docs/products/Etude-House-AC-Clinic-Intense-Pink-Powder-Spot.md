### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works wonderfully!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is the best overnight acne spot treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The perfect thing to use on whiteheads.</li>
      <li>I Love it!!!</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t seeing great results.  </li>
      <li>Good item and seller.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect acne treatments must give the best results quickly.</li>
      <li>nice product with good service</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>Now, here I am buying for my own.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice sample size though.</li>
      <li>It clears most bumps nicely in a day when you put the dots on your problem spots ^_^</li>
      <li>I love that they include another bottle for daytime use and a bag of cotton swaps (how nice is that?).</li>
      <li>Personally, I love the scent of this product as well; it smells like one of those herbal medicines.</li>
      <li>Ok this is probably my 5th time purchasing this item I have oily and acne prone skin</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>With this one, takes about 2-3 days if most of the product doesn&#x27;t get rubbed off on my pillow that night.</li>
      <li>the spot treatment is good, effective but gentle.</li>
      <li>This Ac clinic pink powder is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>The day time lighter powder can easily be covered by make up.</li>
      <li>The smell is kinda strong and medicated, but it wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>but I got the original version with this seller.</li>
      <li>He used this one for more than a year, then I got interested with this and started to use it.</li>
      <li>It feels very nice cool when you apply and let it dry.</li>
      <li>and it is really not bad</li>
      <li>I even got creative with it by putting it very lightly with a cotton ball under my makeup to cover my red hyper pigmentation.</li>
      <li>and I must say it works a little better than the Lioele one, which is quite surprising considering the price difference.</li>
      <li>The pink powder is amazing once I applied more to my pimple.  </li>
      <li>but it quickly goes off</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high price acne treatment products but they did not help out.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s acne benefits are worth 5 stars alone.</li>
      <li>This is a good little set...</li>
      <li>This one is exactly I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
      <li>If u have cyctic acne it will make it smaller and pain free in over night!</li>
      <li>Less messy and very effective!</li>
      <li>it finished so fast</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very thankful</li>
      <li>The nightime pink powder cleared or reduced so many blemishes.</li>
      <li>The water part didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me</li>
      <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
      <li>it pretty much matches my skin ones it drys and as long as you use a very thin layer under makeup you cant even tell and your skin looks flawless!!</li>
      <li>Better than Pro active!</li>
      <li>finally received the pink powder I had originally wanted and it works better than the Etude House AC clinic pink powder.</li>
      <li>I do not have experience of using the Intense Pink Powder Water -the smaller bottle for daylight-, but I will be giving a try since I have a fantastic experience of night ones.</li>
      <li>It smells a little like calamine lotion, and it can leave a bit of white/pink residue on your skin (but you can cover it up easily with makeup)</li>
      <li>I suffered from severe acne and this product, as well as the rest of the Etude House AC Clinic line, has completely cleared up my acne problems.</li>
      <li>It completely evens out my problem areas</li>
      <li>Normally, when I use the Lioele pink powder it would take about 4-5 days for the pimple to swell down significantly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between the &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; version of this product and the original</li>
      <li>This pink powder is really gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out also.</li>
      <li>I got the second one last week and keep using this until my face is clear.</li>

<li> Although new pimples still come but trust a few</li>

<li> For older skin, I am in my late 20s</li>
<li> Acne is noticeably smaller and dried up the next day.</li>
<li> I wish they sell the bigger version of pink powder cuz it&#x27;s too small</li>
<li> But this pink powder helps me to manage them!</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;ve been using Mizon&#x27;s AC pink spot product and it is a life-saver!</li>
<li> Careful if you shake the bottles!</li>
<li> I  do extensive reviews before buying any product usually.</li>
<li> Maybe slightly.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure about the other one though....</li>
<li> Have been using this for a few days</li>
<li> a little bit is all you need!</li>
<li> Not sure if it does anything for scars</li>
<li> I always got pimples on my face...almost everyday!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of the water is that comes with it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a magical but it has worked well on my skin.</li>
<li> usually like Etude House products</li>
<li> While I am using this product, I could see my nasty acnes that were devil red colored were cooled down when I apply this pink powder and next day, the acne got shrink its size and not feeling itch/sting anymore.</li>
<li> It is just hard to get ahold of.</li>
<li> I took a chance on this little miracle!!</li>
<li> The nighttime treatment cleared up one of those big, painful, under the skin pimples in 2 days!</li>
<li> It would be feeling little itchy or sting if your acne is those tempered nasty ones</li>

    <li> This product is just so-so. I had wanted a different pink powder spot treatment but couldn&#x27;t find one in the time I needed it so I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually like Etude House products but I think it is only targeting teen skin. For older skin, I am in my late 20s btw, it doesn&#x27;t seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally received the pink powder I had originally wanted and it works better than the Etude House AC clinic pink powder. The Etude House one didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all for me. However, I&#x27;ve been using Mizon&#x27;s AC pink spot product and it is a life-saver! For those around my age, I would use the Mizon one. Also, I like ENCA&#x27;s product. It is just hard to get ahold of.</li>
    <li> It clears most bumps nicely in a day when you put the dots on your problem spots ^_^</li>
    <li> The pink powder is amazing once I applied more to my pimple.  I wasn&#x27;t layering enough on so I wasn&#x27;t seeing great results.  The water part didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me but I used it anyways.</li>
    <li> Ok this is probably my 5th time purchasing this item I have oily and acne prone skin I always got pimples on my face...almost everyday! But this pink powder helps me to manage them! If u have cyctic acne it will make it smaller and pain free in over night! I&#x27;m not sure about the other one though....I wish they sell the bigger version of pink powder cuz it&#x27;s too small and I got tons of acne it finished so fast</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few days and I must say it works a little better than the Lioele one, which is quite surprising considering the price difference. Normally, when I use the Lioele pink powder it would take about 4-5 days for the pimple to swell down significantly. With this one, takes about 2-3 days if most of the product doesn&#x27;t get rubbed off on my pillow that night. I love that they include another bottle for daytime use and a bag of cotton swaps (how nice is that?). Anyway, for me I would definitely choose this Etude House one over Lioele&#x27;s any day.</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend. The nighttime treatment cleared up one of those big, painful, under the skin pimples in 2 days! It smells a little like calamine lotion, and it can leave a bit of white/pink residue on your skin (but you can cover it up easily with makeup) Careful if you shake the bottles!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t expect acne treatments must give the best results quickly. This one is exactly I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s not a magical but it has worked well on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried many high price acne treatment products but they did not help out. This pink powder is really gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out also. My skin has looked smoother than last two months. Although new pimples still come but trust a few and I feel confidence to go outside without makeup. I love it. I got the second one last week and keep using this until my face is clear.</li>
    <li> nice product with good service</li>
    <li> Amazing product. The nightime pink powder cleared or reduced so many blemishes. The day time lighter powder can easily be covered by make up.</li>
    <li> This Ac clinic pink powder is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;m very thankful I took a chance on this little miracle!! It works wonders it definitely takes care of those red problem spots!! I even got creative with it by putting it very lightly with a cotton ball under my makeup to cover my red hyper pigmentation. a little bit is all you need! It completely evens out my problem areas it pretty much matches my skin ones it drys and as long as you use a very thin layer under makeup you cant even tell and your skin looks flawless!! I Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my Chinese student.  It works wonderfully!!</li>
    <li> This is a good little set... the spot treatment is good, effective but gentle. I Just dab it on where I need it and go to bed. Reminds me of caladryl lotion but w salicylic acid.</li>
    <li> I  do extensive reviews before buying any product usually. I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews and they said this worked for them. I personally didn&#x27;t see a change in my scars nor acne. Maybe slightly. It&#x27;s a nice sample size though. The smell is kinda strong and medicated, but it wears off quickly. All in all I would say try it, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to.</li>
    <li> Better than Pro active! Less messy and very effective!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for acne because my younger brother was started to use this. He used this one for more than a year, then I got interested with this and started to use it. Now, here I am buying for my own. It feels very nice cool when you apply and let it dry. It would be feeling little itchy or sting if your acne is those tempered nasty ones but it quickly goes off and it is really not bad, it feels like the product works as medicine and it heals the spot. While I am using this product, I could see my nasty acnes that were devil red colored were cooled down when I apply this pink powder and next day, the acne got shrink its size and not feeling itch/sting anymore. Personally, I love the scent of this product as well; it smells like one of those herbal medicines. I do not have experience of using the Intense Pink Powder Water -the smaller bottle for daylight-, but I will be giving a try since I have a fantastic experience of night ones. I probably buy another one if I finishes with this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best overnight acne spot treatment I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s similar to the mario bedescu drying lotion but cheaper. Acne is noticeably smaller and dried up the next day. The perfect thing to use on whiteheads. Not sure if it does anything for scars but it&#x27;s acne benefits are worth 5 stars alone. I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of the water is that comes with it. I find it doesn&#x27;t really do anything. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between the &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; version of this product and the original but I got the original version with this seller. However this gets five stars from me!</li>
    <li> Good item and seller.</li>
    <li> I suffered from severe acne and this product, as well as the rest of the Etude House AC Clinic line, has completely cleared up my acne problems.</li>
