    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Muvazi for a year now, and I have been so pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen with my skin:  cleaner, softer, better moisturized, younger-looking skin. Love it! Thanks Muvazi!</li>
    <li> I have now almost completed these products from my first purchase.  My skin no longer feels dry and I think it looks so much better.  I love this product because of its natural ingredients, being a breast cancer survivor.  It is also simple to use which suits me well. I am hooked!  I highly recommend Muvazi Skin Care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Muvazi skin care for about two years.  They are high quality products and do the job.  I particularly like their moisterizer - it softens my skin like no other product.  And, the company has great service ... these folks care about their customers.  Best of all, I can easily order online from the comfort of my home.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many months now and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I really think it makes my skin smoother, softer and younger looking.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this product you should.  The company has many options and it can be set up to auto ship so you don&#x27;t have to worry about reordering.  Love this!</li>
    <li> I have been using Muvazi products for about a year.  Skin care product has always been important to me, and I have tried most of the top brands.  Muvazi Skin Care Set is the best I have ever used. I absolutely recommend this product to friends and family.  Both my daughters are using it and love it.&lt;br /&gt;Love Muvazi!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Made my skin feel clean and light and the eye cream made my eyes look brighter with the first application. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love Muvazi! It makes my skin fill great!  I will never buy another skin care product.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this! I have already noticed a big difference. I have taken good care of my skin over the years with using sunscreen, good skincare, etc., but I have noticed more wrinkling around my eyes and hollowness underneath. My skin type is normal/combination, but as I age I am noticing dryness mainly around my eye area. This helps me achieve a smoother look when putting on my makeup and diminishes the wrinkles. It also seems very hydrating. I have used it only a couple of times, so far, so I look forward to seeing it long-term results.</li>
    <li> I love this products! I would recommend to my friends and everyone. I have been using them just only 2 weeks and I can see a results that my skin looks younger.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have tried MANY different lines...some I have gotten decent results from but not good enough that I have not continued to look.  Most lines are just iffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 years old, grew up in FL and have some pretty significant lines/sun damage.  I have only been using this for about a 1 1/2 weeks but have felt I have liked the results so much so far that I wanted to write a review.  I will review again after some additional usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin which I blot nemerous times a day for the shine.  I have found since using this line that my skin seems much more balanced...I do not have nearly the shine (grease) which I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have seen a significant improvement in my crowsfeet.  They have seriously diminished!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love the eye cream!!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is very nice and the serum is heavenly scented and absorbs into the skin beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to see how things progress and will review later...but so far GRADE A results!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a high quality skincare then search no further.  MUVAZI is by far the best out there for the price.  My husband and I both use it and we were able to see some pretty amazing results with him around his eyes.  You will not be disappointed with the MUVAZI products and they have absolutely amazing customer service!!!</li>
    <li> Muvazi has made my skin look younger than ever!  The more I age, the more this product makes sense!  I feel and look 10 years younger and Muvazi has made that possible....keep up the great and amazing work.</li>
    <li> I have over 10 years of experience working in the prestige cosmetic/skincare industry.  I love high quality skin care products and I totally recognize their value.  I am 43 years old and I can happily say that I don&#x27;t look it.  I tried Muvazi on July 19th and I was totally \\&quot;Wowed\\&quot; by it.  First of all the packaging is lovely and I feel like I am doing something special for myself every time I use it (twice a day, every day!).  I have always been a cleanser &amp; toner girl, but I love the combination product with Muvazi.  The cleanser is so light and I have to say that I love the scent.  It is very subtle, but I love the slight oat scent that comes from the oat beta glucan.  The serum is light-weight and it absorbs very quickly.  I&#x27;ve never really found a serum that I just loved and I&#x27;ve tried many a top dollar serum over the years.  I actually feel like the serum is doing something!  My skin looks better than it has in a long time and it feels wonderful.  The instructions say to use 3 pumps of the serum.  I find 2 pumps to be plenty for my face &amp; throat.  Eye cream is my obsession and I will go without food before I will go without it.  The Muvazi eye cream is exquisite!  It is rich and decadent, yet not at all greasy.  It is wonderful at night and before makeup in the morning.  (It&#x27;s probably my favorite item if I had to chose one.)  My skin is pretty normal, but as I have gotten older, I find that I like a richer moisturizer.  The Muvazi cream is rich and very hydrating, but again, it is not at all greasy.  I love this!  I don&#x27;t want my face to shine after I apply any moisturizing product.  So, I&#x27;ve used my Muvazi skin care system for 10 days now.  I had used my previous system for 10+ years.  My skin has not looked or felt this good in years!  I love it and I can&#x27;t stop telling people about it!  This is an amazing system and everyone I know is going to know about it.</li>
    <li> For years I have had trouble finding a product that worked well with my skin type (combination). I felt that with every product I used I was left feeling greasy or too dry. Muvazi has the perfect balance! My skin is moisturized without being too oily, pores are smaller, I have a more balanced tone, and my makeup looks better since my base is skin is healthier. A definite keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!!  I have been using Muvazi for about a month.  I was putting on make-up the other day and she told me that my skin looked really good recently.  Very healthy she told me.  The best part is that she had no idea I had switched my regimn to Muvazi!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the skin care set for a few months now &amp; I think it has helped the overall appearance of my skin. The most immediate thing I noticed was the smoothness of the pores on my nose.  Try it &amp; see if you notice a difference in the smoothness of your face.  Also, I have to be careful what I use around my eyes, &amp; this product has worked very well.  J.S.</li>
    <li> I have tried several anti aging products.  I gave this one 5 stars because out of all of them this one is my favorite. The face serum feels so refeshing and light. Someone at worked noticed my complexion was looking good !  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I first bought Muvazi over a year ago and will never use another product.&lt;br /&gt;Muvazi is a fresh drink of water for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I Love this line.  I love the smell of the face serum and the face cream. My skin is very sensitive to fragrances and I&#x27;ve had no problem at all using this product.  I find it moisturizes my skin without making it oily or greasy feeling.  I have noticed a definite difference in the firmness of my skin and the reduction of fine lines.  The only reason I gave it a four star is that I don&#x27;t like the smell of the face wash.</li>
    <li> MUVAZI is a great product, hands down.  The best part is that it does what you need it to do for your skin.  But a close second is that it uses great natural ingredients to do it.  So there is no worry about what you are putting on your skin, you just know it is going to be good for it.</li>
    <li> This product is not what I expected the cleanser is like foam water  make my skin so dry and the day cream smell bad I don&#x27;t trust in this product !:(</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say this product is TRULY an amazing product! I use it daily and and after using ProActive for many years.. this  product totally restored my skin back to a youthful beautiful glow. (I am almost 40!). I also have to say, that Muvazi IS the real deal! I have been using this product for over 2 years! For those of you that may think this product isn&#x27;t legit, I wanted to share with you something that might help put your mind at ease! I am a blessed enough to be and Artist and share my experiences as one, on my blog. I also teach online classes for a living and have over 20,000 blog readers who are just truly awesome! I do a lot of videos and many of my blog followers would  always commented on my face and how young I looked, so I decided to share with them the product I had been using that truly helped my face look that way! I wrote a blog post HERE (back in 2011), sharing my experience with this product). [...] AFter sharing that on my blog, hundreds of my customers then also tried Muvazi, and over the last 2 years I have received COUNTLESS emails from blog followers of mine, who RAVE about what Muvazi has done for their skin! Infact I recently wrote another blog post about it.. and MANY of those customers posted about their experience and how this awesome product has helped them! So for those who are skeptical about this wonderful product, you can verify this product, how long it&#x27;s been around and the amazing wonders it has done for hundreds of my followers.. on my blogs posts about Muvazi over the last 2 years (I have done 3 post total). Each time.. many many followers of mine, post their awesome reviews on how it&#x27;s changed their skin and their life. I can&#x27;t say enough GOOD things about this product! And while i did NOT buy it on amazon.. I have been using this product for 3 years and I won&#x27;t ever use Anything else! xoxox Christy Tomlinson [...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for about two years. I really like it, total facial cleaner/care. Easy, works great and I like  the Auto ship program. I don&#x27;t have to drive anywhere to get the product. Now they have even reduced the price on Auto ship product and added many options of how often you would like it sent. I found this product from an artsy gal on line that is related to someone in the Muvazi company. I do wish I would have been using this 10 years ago!</li>
    <li> I read about Muvazi about a month or so ago on a friend&#x27;s blog and decided to try it, basically 1) because my friend has lovely skin and (2)because of the very reasonable cost.  I bought my trial Muvazi from Amazon and the package arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been purchasing a very expensive eye cream from my dermatologist&#x27;s office (that&#x27;s \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; as in $100 for a small container) and hoped the Muvazi eye cream might work well enough to replace it.  If only the eye cream worked, I reasoned, I&#x27;d be ahead of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, I like the entire line of products and my skin is looking very smooth and clear.  I should mention that I am 62 years old and my skin is still somewhat oily.  I also have slight rosacea, so I certainly do not want to put anything on my skin that aggravates that condition.  I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the foaming cleanser, the Muvazi toner is quite soothing, even to my sensitive skin, and the moisturizer is non-greasy and light.  Best of all, I really do like the eye cream, so no more uber-expensive cream from the doctor&#x27;s office will be needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to break out with it and I think it&#x27;s because it seems so greasy, especially the night cream.  Not for oily prone skin!</li>
    <li> Muvazi is amazing!! I have tried a lot of other brands and most of them either irritated my skin because of the chemicals that were in them or I saw zero results. After a week of using Muvazi my fine lines diminished and my pores appear much smaller. I love that is is chemical and toxin free. I have been using this set for a year and will continue buying!!</li>
    <li> I really like this skin care line. I have definitely noticed a difference in fine lines around my eyes. It took a while though, it&#x27;s not a quick fix type of product. Their customer service is great. My only complaint would be that I always run out of the serum well before the other products. They really should double the size of the serum. The facial cleanser lasts the longest of all the products.</li>
    <li> I almost always read customer reviews before purchasing a new product so I especially appreciate Amazon for their review program.  I was in the market for a skin care set when I came across this one.  Wow, I thought, 40 ratings, all 5 stars!, this must be some seriously amazing stuff!  THEN I realized almost none of the reviews were marked \\&quot;Amazon Verified Purchase\\&quot; AND **they were all made within a few days of one another** AND this skin care set was the only review almost all 40 reviewers have ever made on Amazon.  You draw your on conclusion but it appears reviewers were asked by the skin care company to post a glowing, 5 star review.  If this is the case it defeats the entire purpose of Amazon&#x27;s review program making it pretty much worthless to potential customers who count on honest reviews before making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth so I felt compelled to bring it to the attention of the unaware before they depart with their hard earned money like I almost did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Well Folks, I don&#x27;t know how they did it but overnight MUVAZI somehow managed to go from 3 helpful votes to 72 helpful votes on the top review and added several unhelpful votes to my review in order to bump it off the first page. The owner then contacted me and accused me voting &#x27;unhelpful&#x27; on all their glowing reviews(the very thing they did). I guess they can&#x27;t believe others aren&#x27;t falling for the over-the-top reviews for their product. They also posted my full name and address on a public comment to my review which I have reported to Amazon. [Amazon has since removed for a violation]  I have also received harassing emails on a daily basis from not only the owner of MUVAZI but her sister. Further yet, they wrote numerous (20 or more) childish, untrue comments in the comment section of my review which I would not respond top so they would delete their comment and write another. This went on for weeks. Mavazi is probably the most unprofessional company I have come across here on Amazon.fessional company I have come across here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old, and have noticed my face changing. I see crows feet a couple of sun spots and white heads that don&#x27;t seem to go away, and my cheeks always feel dry. I have tried several other products but didn&#x27;t get any results. I have been using Muvazi for two weeks. Wow, my white heads are almost gone. my dry spots are no longer dry. This product really works, A++++. Even my boyfriend noticed, and I didn&#x27;t tell him I was using a new product. I highly recommend this product. Thank you Muvazi....</li>
    <li> Within a couple weeks of using this product, I noticed the fine lines around my eyes were reduced, as well as around my mouth.  This product is fragrance free, and I have very sensitive skin, and it caused no issues with me.  I will definitely continue using this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Muvazi anti aging skin care set and i&#x27;m very satisfied. I have combination skin with some acne marks. My skin is clearing nicely; marks are almost gone and skin tone is evening out.</li>
    <li> I am buying this product for almost three years. Simply- love it. It works for my dry aging skin.Thank you very much for it!!</li>
    <li> The serum is the star of this kit. The moisturizer is really thick almost like a night cream but absorbs quickly. Broke me out with those little puss-like bumps. The serum works. Smoothed my complexion tightened my skin. Both the serum and foaming soap ran out too quickly. The direction require 4 pumps of the soap and 2-3 pumps of serum, which I thought to be a bit much. I&#x27;m now using the moisturizer and eye cream which have no effect. I&#x27;m going back to my PTR power k eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for two weeks but it is really helping my skin! I am young and started this as a way to prevent aging as much as possible. The only slight wrinkle I have on my forehead has been improving since beginning Muvazi. Also, the smell is a very light oat scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It kind of reminds me of the scent of Aveeno. I have very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin and haven&#x27;t had an issue with this product. I have actually seen an improvement in the oiliness of my skin and my acne is improving! And you definitely don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product! A little bit goes a long way. Of course, everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I recommend giving Muvazi a try!</li>
    <li> Ok, I am actually not Matt but his wife:)  I was given this set as a gift from a dear friend.  She made radical claims about how much I would love this product and surprisingly I was not disappointed!  The night cream is so light and soothing it is fabulous!  My skin looks more radiant, smoother and feels softer after using this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was especially thrilled with the paraben free formula since I have had breast cancer and now try to avoid products with parabens and sulfates.  The price is also fabulous.  Amazing skin care for almost drugstore prices!  Go ahead make a little investment in yourself with this skincare set...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and love it!!  A lot of times with skin care it is so hard to tell how it will effect your skin and what the results will be.  I have to say I am very pleased with how it reacts with my skin.  No breakouts, I feel clean and not greasy, my face feels soft and subtle.  At first I was a little apprehensive about using this product, but now I am so glad that I took the leap and purchased them.  Thank Muvazi for coming up with a product that makes my skin feel soft and ageless!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST skin care line I have ever used!!! I&#x27;ve had acne most of my life and used Proactive which dried my skin out Horribly.  Ever since I switched to Muvazi not only does it keep my acne under control, but my skin feels SOOOO soft too!! Yeah for MUVAZI :)</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Muvazi in hopes of \\&quot;erasing\\&quot; the vertical lines above my lips.&lt;br /&gt;So here is what I noticed after 2 weeks of use:&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles around my eyes are hardly noticable anymore. The vertical lines above my lips have improved. All the products absorb instantly. They have a pleasant and light soapy, clean smell to them.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels moisturized all day. The Muvazi face wash does not dry out my skin as others do.&lt;br /&gt;When layering the products as advised, only very little of the serum, moisturizing cream and eye cream are needed or you might have some peeling of the moisturizers. So these products will definitely last.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed so far!&lt;br /&gt;I also should mention that the shipping was super fast. I could not believe how quickly I received my order.&lt;br /&gt;All in all my impression is that Muvazi sells wonderful products and that the company cares a lot about their customers.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this face care line.  Not greasy but very good mousturizer for faces of any condition. Try it !</li>
    <li> I sure didn&#x27;t like this much.  Certainly didn&#x27;t see in change in my skin and the products just didn&#x27;t feel all that nice on my skin.  I certainly will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using these products for a couple of years now with absolutely no problems.  It makes my face feel very clean and soft after using.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Your skin will look and feel wonderful. It is always shipped ASAP and they will answer any questions you have about . Cleanser feels great , with no greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Linda from Arkansas</li>
    <li> I know that there is no magic portion that will return my skin to its younger self. So my expectations of skin care products is that I hope to see small gradual improvement while the product is applied on daily basis as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several aspect are important to me:&lt;br /&gt;1. I want the the product have at least some effect to meet my realistic expectations&lt;br /&gt;2. Want them be scent free or as close to scent free as possible.&lt;br /&gt;3. I want the packaging as well as the product to look and feel good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MUVAZI Anti Aging Skin Care Set consists of 4 different products: a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a moisturizer, and a face serum. Each of the products met my requirements to a different degree so I below I describe and rank each of them separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ 5.5 oz MUVAZI Foaming Cleanser Toner&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the cleanser. The foam is dense and feels good on my skin. Once I wash it off the skin feels clean and taught. The cleanser has a scent. This scent is non-floral, the best description I can come up with is that it smells \\&quot;sweet\\&quot;. It does not smell bad, but I can&#x27;t say \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;. However when I wash my face the washing process removes most of the scent. I rank it as 4 star, \\&quot;good\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ 15 mL MUVAZI Oxygenic Eye Cream&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is rich and creamy. I spread the eye cream in a very thin layer and it absorbs quickly. It tingles (not unpleasantly) for a few minutes. The eye cream smells lemony, it is a very light scent and of all the MUVAZI products that have a scent I liked its smell the best. After twice a day use for several weeks I see a small improvement in small lines near my eyes. I rank it as 4.5 stars, \\&quot;very good\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ 50 mL MUVAZI Intra-Cellular Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;The intra-cell moisturize is a very rich cream, when I spread it very thinly in my face and neck it absorbs well. It is not greasy. It moisurizes well, and my fine lines look slightly less noticeable. It is close to unscented and is my favorite product in the set. I rank as 5 star, \\&quot;very good\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ 1 oz MUVAZI Hydrating Face Serum&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a thick liquid that hydrates the skin. It does a nice job moisturizing but its scent is quite strong. It is the same \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smell as the foaming cleanser and I have not become a fan of this scent. I cannot apply the serum before going to bed because the strong scent prevents me from falling asleep quickly. I rank it as 3 stars, \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product from Muzavi with a request for a brutally honest review. This review covers pluses and minuses of the product, and represent my brutally honest opinion. As I noted in my review I liked some products in the set better than others. I prefer unscented cosmetics and my main issues were related to the scent rather than the moisturizing effect. The product comes with \\&quot;100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE NO QUESTIONS ASKED\\&quot; policy. Since skin cosmetics are very individual different people are likely to react differently to the preparation and scents. I liked Muvazi products enough to say give them a try and if you don&#x27;t like them take Muvazi up on the 100% guarantee offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewe product in the set.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Muvazi products for over a year now (I buy directly from their website). I found out about them through an artist&#x27;s website and decided to give them a try. I&#x27;m getting older now (49) and am diligent about using eye creams and moisturizers on my face every morning and night. I used to always use Lancome products but I hate paying their high prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products:&lt;br /&gt;Foaming cleanser - I have never used a cleanser that foamed before, I always used cream based cleansers. This was a little different for me but now I use it in the shower on a soft, wet facial brush and I love it! I&#x27;m getting gentle exfoliation from the brush and this cleanser is good for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye cream - I&#x27;m a big believer in eye creams and have used them since my 20&#x27;s. This is very moisturizing but not heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serum -  I love facial serums and this one is no different! It makes my face feel soft and smooth and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer - moisturize moisturize, moisturize!!! I&#x27;ve always been big on moisturizing but I used to use non-oily lotions. Now that I&#x27;m older and living in Arizona, my skin is much drier and I need something more. I immediately apply the moisturizer after the serum because I noticed a few little balls if I let the serum dry too long. I don&#x27;t know if this is really the proper way to apply it but it seems to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Muvazi products are very good, especially for the price. They offer great customer service and are very friendly. Try them, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like them!</li>
    <li>  This is the second day of MUVAZI use, involving 3 separate applications. I used my Secura steamer to open my pores before washing with the face foam. The results on the second day are amazing. I  have been using natural products to take care of my skin since I was 13. I decided to use the MUVAZI skincare system now that I need a step up in my facial care. I am so glad I decided on MUVAZI to take that step.</li>
    <li> I have prolonged leaving this review because I hoped that over time my opinion would change.  When I first received the Muvazi I had high hopes.  I followed the recommended regimen and after about a week my usually clear skin began to break out.  After more patches of pimples (cheeks, jawline and forehead) cropped up I decided to replace the Muvazi facial cleanser with a different product I previously used. I want to make it understood that I have never had patches of acne on my face. When I was a teenager I would get one big, ugly zit every month...rarely anything worse. After two weeks I started to squeeze the pimples and yes...it only made them worse. So I began eliminating the remaining Muvazi products...the serum, then the moisturizer and finally the eye cream. My face would start to slowly clear up and I would use just the eye cream and my skin would get worse.  So I&#x27;ve stopped using Muvazi altogether and it seems like the pimples are slowly healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to mention that I am 52 years old and have been going thru menopause for several years now. I remember when my mother went thru menopause her face broke out. Maybe it is menopausal hormonal imbalance or maybe it is Muvazi?  If my face continues to break out, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> I have been using almost a month. Cleanser/ toner very good,serum excellent, moisturizer nourishing. Highly recommend. Not often a group effective with good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and I have used many products.. and I think this is one of my favorites, It all goes together well</li>
    <li> This company is fantastic, I called them twice with questions &amp; the customer service is exceptional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products for almost a week now, &amp; I absolutely love them!  The subtle changes in my skin for this short amount of time is beyond what I was expecting.  The only thing I did, was to use too much, these silky products are so pure, you only need a very small amount, talk about a welcome change. My skin type is pretty normal, but I would bet these products will create the same effect no matter what skin type someone has.  I have spent 10 times what these cost &amp; truly have not seen this much benefit!  Yea for Muvazi!</li>
    <li> Waste money.  Never recommend anyone.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try Muzavi. Being in my 30&#x27;s I wanted to amp up my skin care while using a product that was suitable for my sensitive/allergy prone skin (by that I mean I break out simply by trying new clothes on in the store). Upon opening Muzavi and smelling it I was disappointed by the lack of fresh scents as it was more of an old lotion smell. But determined to not waste money I tried it. After 2 days my nose began breaking out with pimples (not normal for me), then I started getting a large, painful pimple on my chin a few days later as well a faint, blotchy, slapped skin redness starting all over my face. After one week I went back to my oatmeal soap and Cetaphil and my skin cleared up within two days.</li>
    <li> I am a 37 year old mother of 5. And I have been using the Muvazi skin care line for almost two years. I absolutely love it. It has transformed my skin. Fine lines have diminished.  Acne scars are disappearing. The texture of my skin is so soft. And there is just an over all firmness and glow that I have never had before. My skin is somewhat sensitive and I have never had a problem with these products. I am just so happy with Muvazi!</li>
    <li> I received the package, well cushioned with bubble wrap, and it arrived a lot sooner than expected.  I tried the product as soon as it arrived and by first try the products left my skin soft, however it&#x27;s much to soon to say anything further.  I would like to know if this product has firming qualities, and is it for people over the age of 55yrs.</li>
    <li> While I didn&#x27;t receive the entire skin care set, I did receive the eye cream.  So far, so good!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams over the years (Mary Kay, Lancome, Estee Lauder, etc.), and for the money, this is a &amp;#34;best buy&amp;#34;.  I would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over a year now. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love it! In the past, I always felt after 3 months or so I need to change my facial products. Not with MUVAZI.  This product does all it says and more. Recently I started using it on my chest, you know, the over exposed sun chest, its amazing the difference.  Do not hesitate to buy this product! Don&#x27;t shy away because you&amp;#34;re not familiar with the name. It&#x27;s better than any high end product you buy at the counter of a fine retail store. I should know, Ive tried a lot of them. My only regret is I don&#x27;t have a before and after picture. Customer service you ask, they are always there, helpful and respond quickly. Well, I hope you try MUVAZI like I did. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  ~Julie</li>
    <li> At 55 years of age I have tried many different skin care systems. I started using Muvazi almost two years ago and it is by far the very best skin care system I have ever used and is now my skin care system for life! No need to try any others! It smells wonderful, goes on beautifully, and absorbs quickly. As far as the company itself goes, the website is easy to use, the shipping is speedy, and the staff is quick to respond and very nice to work with.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my skin. I am fifty eight years old. I have combination skin. Oily in some spots and dry in others. The cleansing foam and the night cream are the best. MUVAZI is awesome.  I am hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I love these products. I love this whole se especially the cleanser, the moisturer and nighlt serum. Wonderful forbthe skin!</li>
    <li> THE BEST!!! Love this product and would recommend to EVERYONE!  I won&#x27;t be without it.  I am on auto ship for the entire skin care line (and LOVE it all), but since I love this so much, I use it up before the others run out... so, thank goodness for Amazon so that I can order extras for a bit less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep offering it here for this GREAT price.&lt;br /&gt;:)sharon</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and excited to get the product.. I have acne and this product says it helps with your acne problem.. Once I get the product and use it I will check back with an update..</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of skin care ranging from very inexpensive to expensive.  As I get older my skin gets drier.  MUVAZI has helped tremendously.  Even through the winter I no longer have red flaking areas on my face.  Before I began using MUVAZI I noticed some fine lines around my eyes and wrinkles in my forehead.  The fine lines have almost disappeared and the wrinkles are smoothing out.  It&#x27;s affordable and best of all made from organic ingredients!!  I LOVE my MUVAZI!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this eye cream and moisturizer so it&#x27;s a bit premature to see results. But so far, I&#x27;m satisfied-- goes on smoothly and does the job. A little bit thicker than my previous eye cream and moisturizer but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  So far I&#x27;d say, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never cleansed you face with a foam cleanser then it might be a pleasant new experience for you. I have sensitive oily skin and it worked great to remove oil without stripping the skin of moisture. I used the hydrating serum and intra-cellular moisturizer for three days but had to stop using the moisturizer due to an undercurrent of irritation from the Retinyl Palmitate. The eye cream seemed fine although a week after using it I did have some small breakouts under my eye. Not sure if it is related to the cream. So I&#x27;d only recommend this box of products to people with normal or dry skin. It might not work for people with sensitive skin if they have any allergies to Retinyl Palmitate. Since I couldn&#x27;t use the moisturizer on my face anymore I tried it as a hand cream and it works very well. This box of products was sent to me for free to try out. This review is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Muvazi Skin Care Set for about 18 months and really love it.  It hasn&#x27;t made my wrinkles disappear or anything (I&#x27;m 62 so have a few), but it has definitely decreased the size of my pores and number of blackheads/whiteheads and keeps my skin soft without being greasy.  It goes on silky smooth, has a very, very slight scent (pleasant).  I use half the amount called for and it works beautifully.  I also like the auto-ship plan and receive my order every 60 days.  The price is very reasonable.  I will definitely continue to use Muvazi.</li>
    <li> I have been using this skin care line for months now and have seen dramatic results on my skin. Especially around the eye area. My skin is soft and young looking. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this line of skin care for over a year and love it. The cleanser is gentle enough for mature skin but still removes makeup without harsh ingredients. The moisturizer is very creamy and lasts all day.</li>
