      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>Recommend to anyone who loves and appreciates glitter and good quality nail polish!</li>
      <li>Definetly a great product.</li>
      <li>This color would look great as an accent nail or on all of them.</li>
      <li>This Polish looks really great over any gray polish.</li>
      <li>all in all a great deal and a great color.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and chic, sexy and playful.</li>
      <li>Used it through the holidays, but the color is so beautiful in the light, can&#x27;t wait to wear it in the sunshine!</li>
      <li>This was so much more beautiful in person than I could ever have imagined.</li>
      <li>LOVE this polish!</li>
      <li>I want more to choose from!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It looks even better in person!</li>
      <li>makes the best and colors so pretty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a jelly polish, so application can be kind of a pain, you just have to take your time and know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
      <li>you can have a solon of your own.</li>
      <li>Its a beautiful color and looks so nice on at first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great charcoal, silver, holographic and black glitter bomb polish, looks best layered but builds to opacity in 3 coats.</li>
      <li>I loved it and its earned a special spot on my shelf.</li>
      <li>I bought this polish sort of on an impulse after seeing one great picture of it, but I wish I&#x27;d looked at more swatches first.</li>
      <li>Its a nice top coat, but dries out very quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish and color.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay, but not what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>Got this in the mail and immediately tried it on, it looks like it&#x27;s more of a charcoal gray with silvery glitter in the pictures</li>
      <li>but it looks just like in the picture so after a couple of coats and patience you will love it on your nails</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be cute on toes too.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;) &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Cute nail polish.</li>
      <li>I get a feeling for they have it and more and this polish  from company</li>
      <li>I love this polish by itself and as a top coat.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this color and the china glaze brand.</li>
      <li>I love China Glaze polishes anyways, Some Like It</li>
      <li>Love Love Love this color.  </li>
      <li>Just add top coat and the colors shine</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>She very much enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift and the recipient loved it very much.</li>
      <li>Very pretty and with about two coats would be wearable on it&#x27;s own or on top of a darker color polish.</li>
      <li>Most glitter polishes devour topcoats, and this one is no exception, so if you want a brilliant glass-like shine, you&#x27;ll need multiple topcoat layers.</li>
      <li>But if you like the way it looks and don&#x27;t mind a bit of technical issues with it, I&#x27;d say this is a good purchase!</li>
      <li>Fun but glamorous color, I think perfect for going out to paint the night red.</li>
      <li>it chips REALLY easily, even with a topcoat applied.</li>
      <li>The photo is accurate, but it doesn&#x27;t quite do the sparkle justice.  </li>
      <li>Great seller, fast shipping, high quality product!</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful color, as long as ou do 3 or 4 coats, Or put it over a darker color.</li>
      <li>I had to clean off the bottle to even use it.</li>
      <li>This nail polish is fab, looks so good alone or layered over a solid color.</li>
      <li>Cool.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday wear or special occasions!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with entire experience.</li>
      <li>Very fun nail polish, lots of sparkles and a transparent smokey color with first coat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even worth</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that smooth its kind of rough.</li>
      <li>So far I have just used it on it&#x27;s own by applying two coats, but next I would like to try it as a top coat, applying just one coat over another color.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I love it :)</li>
      <li>It would probably look good over any other polish too!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but not as pretty as it looks  here.</li>
      <li>Soooo much glitter!</li>
      <li>Might submit a swatch later. :)</li>
      <li>Love how this looks on-silver with different sizes of glitter.</li>
      <li>Haute\\&quot; polish, and overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the way it looks on my nails.</li>
      <li>but the bigger chunks of glitter are actually more holographic and have a rainbowish coloration to them.</li>
      <li>overall i love nail polishes and give this a 3 start review.  </li>
      <li>This works well with any color nail polish, and really perks up any mani.  </li>
      <li>Also, because it&#x27;s thick and mostly glitter, it&#x27;s a huge pain to try and remove it, I went through so much scrubbing and remover trying to get it off.</li>
      <li>I have never had a polish chip off so fast in my life.</li>
      <li>Not very difficult to come off (being glitter and all).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty much exactly the same as Sally Hansen Gem Crush in Glitz Gal, which is cheaper.</li>
      <li>This item was completely unusable.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice dark grey with different sized glitters in it.</li>
      <li>The top color was chipped, the bottle was half full and the polish was thick and gooey.  </li>
      <li>Really like this, looks great by itself or layered over a DARK color, like black or dark grey.</li>
      <li>, jelly polishes seem to dry out and/or evaporate sooner than other kinds, so make sure you have polish thinnner on hand and keep the bottle tightly capped.</li>
      <li>I would recommend a light base color first to really make this polish pop!</li>
      <li>Also, shake the polish every so often so it doesn&#x27;t settle too much and get packed down into the bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this polish color and texture, a dark grey base with gritty sparkles (unfortunately, I won&#x27;t love taking it off!).</li>
      <li>A whole nail would chip off all at once or half a nail of polish.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this nail polish and color. Not very difficult to come off (being glitter and all). Could be worn alone or over a different color.</li>
    <li> I love this polish color and texture, a dark grey base with gritty sparkles (unfortunately, I won&#x27;t love taking it off!). It&#x27;s great for everyday wear or special occasions! Great seller, fast shipping, high quality product! I will definitely come back to this seller again, and probably this nail polish, too!</li>
    <li> This item was not packaged well. It was leaking all over the inside of the envelope when I opened it. I had to clean off the bottle to even use it.</li>
    <li> The product is exquisite! Love it. It&#x27;s beautiful and chic, sexy and playful. I want more to choose from! I am very pleased with entire experience. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Shiny sparkling glitter.  Wear it on gold or silver base coat and WALLAH you&#x27;re good to go. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Soooo much glitter! Fun but glamorous color, I think perfect for going out to paint the night red.</li>
    <li> Its a nice top coat, but dries out very quickly. I was disappointed when after only 2 weeks of being open it began to clump pretty badly.</li>
    <li> This was so much more beautiful in person than I could ever have imagined. I loved it and its earned a special spot on my shelf.</li>
    <li> If I need something I will go to Amazon and every brand and product I get a feeling for they have it and more and this polish  from company makes the best and colors so pretty you can have a solon of your own.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and the recipient loved it very much. Very beautiful and sparkly. I&#x27;m thinking about buying a bottle for myself.</li>
    <li> Very fun nail polish, lots of sparkles and a transparent smokey color with first coat. I would recommend a light base color first to really make this polish pop!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting. the picture doesn&#x27;t show it, but the glitter is rainbow instead of silver sparkles. it&#x27;s okay, but not what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> the nail polish is really thick so its messy when trying to apply  but it looks just like in the picture so after a couple of coats and patience you will love it on your nails</li>
    <li> ...it requires a lot of coats! overall i love nail polishes and give this a 3 start review.  &#x3D;) &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Really like this, looks great by itself or layered over a DARK color, like black or dark grey. It&#x27;s a jelly polish, so application can be kind of a pain, you just have to take your time and know what you&#x27;re doing. Most glitter polishes devour topcoats, and this one is no exception, so if you want a brilliant glass-like shine, you&#x27;ll need multiple topcoat layers. People hem and haw about that all the time, but that&#x27;s just the nature of glitter polishes. But I like this alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- for some reason, jelly polishes seem to dry out and/or evaporate sooner than other kinds, so make sure you have polish thinnner on hand and keep the bottle tightly capped. Do NOT pour remover into polish to thin it. Use polish thinner. Also, shake the polish every so often so it doesn&#x27;t settle too much and get packed down into the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this color.  Used it through the holidays, but the color is so beautiful in the light, can&#x27;t wait to wear it in the sunshine!</li>
    <li> I gave it to my best friend for Christmas. She very much enjoyed it. Good product. Thank you for this.</li>

    <li> I bought this polish sort of on an impulse after seeing one great picture of it, but I wish I&#x27;d looked at more swatches first. It&#x27;s pretty, but not as pretty as it looks  here. It&#x27;s also pretty much exactly the same as Sally Hansen Gem Crush in Glitz Gal, which is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this color and the china glaze brand. It deff needs 2 coats. I like to use a charcoal color as a base and top it with this so I don&#x27;t waste it. Just add top coat and the colors shine</li>
    <li> Cool. Hard to get off. I don&#x27;t use it often. I&#x27;ve made similar polish myself. It&#x27;s not that smooth its kind of rough.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color, as long as ou do 3 or 4 coats, Or put it over a darker color. It even works over white. Other than that I love it :)</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened to the polish that was delivered to me but it&#x27;s definitely defective or used.  The top color was chipped, the bottle was half full and the polish was thick and gooey.  This item was completely unusable.  It&#x27;s not even worth me paying the postage to return...when I may not even get a replacement or my money back since the company says &amp;#34;all says final&amp;#34;.  Hmn, maybe it&#x27;s a shady company, I don&#x27;t know.  I will not be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> I bought the \\&quot;Some Like It Haute\\&quot; polish, and overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the way it looks on my nails. Only a couple downsides to mention: it chips REALLY easily, even with a topcoat applied. Also, because it&#x27;s thick and mostly glitter, it&#x27;s a huge pain to try and remove it, I went through so much scrubbing and remover trying to get it off. But if you like the way it looks and don&#x27;t mind a bit of technical issues with it, I&#x27;d say this is a good purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great glitter nail polish!  So far I have just used it on it&#x27;s own by applying two coats, but next I would like to try it as a top coat, applying just one coat over another color.  The photo is accurate, but it doesn&#x27;t quite do the sparkle justice.  It looks even better in person!</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful color and looks so nice on at first. I have never had a polish chip off so fast in my life. A whole nail would chip off all at once or half a nail of polish. I got to rate it very low because of that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s best described as a grey base with dark grey and black glitter.  It also has a touch of multi glitter in it as we&#x27;ll.  all in all a great deal and a great color.</li>
    <li> Cute nail polish. Served it&#x27;s purpose! Very sparkley and was a secret santa gift for someonw who loves to paint her nails.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze polishes anyways, Some Like It Haute is no exception.  It&#x27;s a great charcoal, silver, holographic and black glitter bomb polish, looks best layered but builds to opacity in 3 coats.</li>
    <li> LOVE this polish! So do my daughters, so I have to hide it from them now. I love this polish by itself and as a top coat.</li>
