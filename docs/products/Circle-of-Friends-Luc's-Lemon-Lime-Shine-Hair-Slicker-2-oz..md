      <li>But I liked that it was a kid-safe product that wouldn&#x27;t leave an sticky residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for a fun looking hair-do, or to make some unruly hair stay in place.</li>
      <li>It spikes and/or holds his hair better than anything of my own I&#x27;ve tried on him.</li>
      <li>I think I would love it even more if it came in even more scents and colors!</li>
      <li>I love this product and have ended up using it.  </li>
      <li>Everything I looked at in the stores were $20 or more.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this for my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>My boys love this gel....</li>
      <li>A hair dresser had this product as she worked magic on her client&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, and it&#x27;s lighter than most gels.  </li>
      <li>ok I guess</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it online.</li>
      <li>My kid loved this the first time, as did I.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years and it works great for young kids.  </li>
      <li>my kids think it looks like slime, cool slime!</li>
      <li>It washed out easily.</li>
      <li>and it has a nice fresh lime scent that both my kids enjoy.</li>
      <li>Best hair product out there for little boys.</li>
      <li>Great lasting hold (almost too well at times)</li>
      <li>I was right, but it did make his hair look ADORABLE.</li>
      <li>This worked okay on my baby&#x27;s hair but it is very sticky after I use it.</li>
      <li>Now searching for something that works well and is more natural for kids.</li>
      <li>My 10 year old son says the product is okay.</li>
      <li>and it works great on both hair types to hold style&#x27;s in place without making their hair stiff</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from Bed Head to Monkey Wax, to Pantene, to Got2B etx.  </li>
      <li>It smells good, and lasts all day (except in extremely sweaty hot days).</li>
      <li>My grandson first started using this when he went for a haircut and the hairdresser recommended this product.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Maybe if he had a super full mane or massive head of hair</li>
      <li>I got this because of the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>It dries fast, which is great for young kids, and it holds firm.  </li>
      <li>and it holds very well.</li>
      <li>Plus it really does work for smoothing away flyaways.</li>
      <li>I have one son with stick straight hair and one with very wavy hair</li>
      <li>Both are hormon diruptors especially in young boys.</li>
      <li>I then tried wetting it down and combing through it...not a whole lot better.</li>
      <li>I love the slight lime smell too.</li>
      <li>My sons hair is short and should hold well, but it moved flat very quick.</li>
      <li>The lemon lime scent is nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>it dried super fast and kept my 2 year old&#x27;s hair just like I wanted it.</li>
      <li>It works for curly, straight, thick and fine hair.</li>
      <li>2.5 year old loves it.</li>
      <li>I used it to make my two-year old son Elvis for Halloween.</li>
      <li>It worked well on my 8 yr old son who has hard-to-manage hair.</li>
      <li>I now use it on my 7 month old son.</li>
      <li>The hair gel is a clear jelly lime green color with tiny sparkle flecks in it, very cool</li>
      <li>it no longer looks shiny (or wet) but it still holds pretty well.  </li>
      <li>But it really didnt hold for very long.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant but it does wear off quite fast, my only complaint is that for the price it really is a very small jar.</li>
      <li>My thirteen year old son uses this daily.  </li>
      <li>This is the only hair gel that will spike my three year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>It barely has a scent either.</li>
      <li>It also leaves a nice subtle sheen to the hair (not like a grease slick hair</li>

<li> they hold last a long time.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like it will last very long</li>
<li> DEFINITELY don&#x27;t use it dry.</li>

<li> I purchased this for my 21 month old son, since I was tired of using the adult hair products and texturizers that tend to make his hair feel sticky or built up with product- yuck!</li>
<li> It says you can use wet or dry.....</li>
<li> You can use it on wet or dry hair...</li>
<li> Bought it when he was one and still have like half of the tub left.</li>
<li> My sons dark hair ended up look greasy and flat after awhile.</li>
<li> We got our son&#x27;s hair cut for the first time at a local kids hair cutting shop, and they used this on him after he was all done.</li>
<li> a little goes a long way</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> But it contains questionable preservative, paraben, and I really don&#x27;t want to be putting that on my child&#x27;s head.</li>
<li> My son&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t look wet or stiff and he loves the lime smell.&lt;br</li>
<li> The jar is definitely small, but a little goes a long way-</li>
<li> I am the odd one on the reviews.</li>
<li> I mean I expected it to look wet, but it just looks greasy.</li>

    <li> I used it to make my two-year old son Elvis for Halloween. I didn&#x27;t want a product that would be &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; for my little guy&#x27;s hair, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to hold a pompadour in place for awhile. I was right, but it did make his hair look ADORABLE. But I liked that it was a kid-safe product that wouldn&#x27;t leave an sticky residue. It washed out easily.</li>
    <li> Love this gel..not sticky on hands and has great hold for my toddler&#x27;s hair.  I would definitely purchase again..a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> My boys love this gel....they hold last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair gel that will spike my three year old&#x27;s hair. It lasts all day and smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells good and holds all day. My son is in kindergarten and it holds from 7am till I wash it out at 6pm . Doesn&#x27;t seem like it will last very long but I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> My thirteen year old son uses this daily.  He says that it keeps his hair in place all day, makes it softer and smells good too.  I have used it and it is a very nice, light pomade with a great citrus scent.</li>
    <li> It worked well on my 8 yr old son who has hard-to-manage hair. But it contains questionable preservative, paraben, and I really don&#x27;t want to be putting that on my child&#x27;s head. Now searching for something that works well and is more natural for kids.</li>
    <li> This smells nice and feels good. But it really didnt hold for very long. My sons hair is short and should hold well, but it moved flat very quick.</li>
    <li> Luc&#x27;s Lemon Lime hair gel is great, and a great price.  Everything I looked at in the stores were $20 or more.  My grandson first started using this when he went for a haircut and the hairdresser recommended this product.  It&#x27;s great for a fun looking hair-do, or to make some unruly hair stay in place.</li>
    <li> This worked okay on my baby&#x27;s hair but it is very sticky after I use it. I have to thin it out with a little water.</li>
    <li> Love this gel! My son has very thick hair and it holds very well. It also smells wonderful! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> When I went to find a baby haircare product I had a really tough time. Thank goodness I searched here &amp; found this. Great lasting hold (almost too well at times) I love the slight lime smell too. Just wish I would have found it sooner</li>
    <li> Well, I am no hair dresser, but, this stuff just makes my sons hair look wet and dirty. Also doesnt hold it in place either. It barely has a scent either. I am the odd one on the reviews. I got this because of the positive reviews. Doesn&#x27;t work for my toe head. :(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake or become white.  I can get a brush through the hair while styling it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love it and it smells great!</li>
    <li> It just looks greasy and dirty....</li>
    <li> My kid loved this the first time, as did I.  But after the first time, the novelty wore off, and he complained about it feeling too sticky (even though I used a very tiny amount).  I love this product and have ended up using it.  I like the smell, and it&#x27;s lighter than most gels.  Plus it really does work for smoothing away flyaways.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 4yo son&#x27;s hair after they used it on him at the local Shear Madness salon. It spikes and/or holds his hair better than anything of my own I&#x27;ve tried on him. His hair really wants to grow forward, so to slick it over or stick it up takes something with a lot of hold. The lemon lime scent is nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Really happy that this styles my son&#x27;s hair well. He sports a mohawk. Its a pot of sticky paste and it smells good too! I like it that you can style and restyle as you work it through the hair.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Best hair product out there for little boys. It smells good, and lasts all day (except in extremely sweaty hot days). The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. The goo helps my sons coarse Latino hair stay spiked up!</li>
    <li> I have bought this for the raving reviews. Reading the ingredient I saw horrified that it was still containing Methylparaben and Propylparaben. Both are hormon diruptors especially in young boys. Needless to say it was an immediate return.&lt;br /&gt;For those who care to inform themselves, here is a simplified article:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on my son&#x27;s hair for years.  He&#x27;s almost 8 now, sports a mohawk and plays soccer.  We style his hair and the hold lasts even through his toughest games.  When styled for school, by 6pm it no longer looks shiny (or wet) but it still holds pretty well.  This stuff is amazing, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from Bed Head to Monkey Wax, to Pantene, to Got2B etx.  This is the best and the smells great.  Win win.</li>
    <li> I should have listen to the reviews. This is just a sticky mess I bought this from my 10 month old baby with thin and curly hair to keep his flyaways under control and it did not do the job at all,instead it was just sticky and hard to blend into the hair I do not recommend this for curly hair.</li>
    <li> A hair dresser had this product as she worked magic on her client&#x27;s hair.  I use it now for my kids.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 21 month old son, since I was tired of using the adult hair products and texturizers that tend to make his hair feel sticky or built up with product- yuck! This stuff is awesome, and doesn&#x27;t even leave sticky residue on your hands after you use it. It almost has a water feel to it after you&#x27;re done styling the hair and your rub your fingers/hands together; not something you need to go running to sink to wash off your hands after each use. It also leaves a nice subtle sheen to the hair (not like a grease slick hair do- gross), and it has a nice fresh lime scent that both my kids enjoy. The hair gel is a clear jelly lime green color with tiny sparkle flecks in it, very cool looking- my kids think it looks like slime, cool slime! I even use it on my 4yr old daughters hair to tame any flyaways. Love it! I think I would love it even more if it came in even more scents and colors!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after running out of my son&#x27;s regular gel that we use to spike his hair in the front. The jar is definitely small, but a little goes a long way- I&#x27;ll probably have this for months. The consistency is similar to a container of chapstick (think Carmex) so I just rub my finger in it in a circular motion and apply. My son&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t look wet or stiff and he loves the lime smell.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great for cowlicks and flyaways.</li>
    <li> Smells great and good hold. Takes like two washes to feel like its out though. 2.5 year old loves it. Bought it when he was one and still have like half of the tub left.</li>
    <li> I just used this stuff and it&#x27;s amazing, it dried super fast and kept my 2 year old&#x27;s hair just like I wanted it. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> My 10 year old son says the product is okay. It doesn&#x27;t spread well when he puts it in his hair.</li>
    <li> I used to get this from a local shop until they went out of business. I&#x27;m glad I found it online. I use it in my boys hair to make &amp;#34;spikey&#x27;s&amp;#34; and mohawk&#x27;s. I have one son with stick straight hair and one with very wavy hair and it works great on both hair types to hold style&#x27;s in place without making their hair stiff and  it doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes in their hair.</li>
    <li> YUCK YUCK YUCK!! It says you can use wet or dry.....DEFINITELY don&#x27;t use it dry. I could not comb through my sons hair without yanking his scalp. I then tried wetting it down and combing through it...not a whole lot better. Flexible yes, but sticky to the touch and gross looking. I mean I expected it to look wet, but it just looks greasy. I had to immediately wash my sons hair. Maybe if he had a super full mane or massive head of hair this would work well. I don&#x27;t know, but I would not buy it for myself again or someone else, to test it out.</li>
    <li> Feels tacky and doesn&#x27;t hold well for thicker Asian hair. My sons dark hair ended up look greasy and flat after awhile.</li>
    <li> We got our son&#x27;s hair cut for the first time at a local kids hair cutting shop, and they used this on him after he was all done. ITS AMAZING!! its not sticky, it dries in a timely manner, it smells like lemons( not over powering), and it doesnt sting his eyes when we wash it out. There isnt any flaking either. We will purchase this again, and again, and again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has curly hair and lots of it, it smells great and like others have said it&#x27;s not so sticky on your hands if you don&#x27;t over do it. The smell is pleasant but it does wear off quite fast, my only complaint is that for the price it really is a very small jar. I didn&#x27;t notice when purchasing that it was only 2oz, and when it arrived the first thing we said was that is so small for the price...but as for the product itself it works ok I guess</li>
    <li> Love this for my son&#x27;s hair.  We&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years and it works great for young kids.  It dries fast, which is great for young kids, and it holds firm.  I prefer this lime one over the purple circle of friends hair stuff.  This one holds firmer.</li>
    <li> Works great on babies and kids fly aways!&lt;br /&gt;Only smells like lemon lime for 5 mins...goes away.&lt;br /&gt;Smell not over barring.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. WORKS GREAT... I USE ON MY 8 MONTH OLDS FAUX HAULK.... DOESN&#x27;T SMELL BAD AND HOLDS ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and used to use this when I worked in a children&#x27;s salon. I love this stuff. It works for curly, straight, thick and fine hair. You can use it on wet or dry hair... 5 stars all the way. The smell is great too :D I now use it on my 7 month old son.</li>
