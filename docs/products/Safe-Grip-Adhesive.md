### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>But for my purposes, using it to apply the eyebrows, it is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>I love it!!!</li>
      <li>All Walker glues are exceptional and this is no exception to that!</li>
      <li>is great.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I found it..</li>
      <li>I cant say that this is a good hold by itself because I used it along with Supertape and skin protectant.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a good hold; or any hold at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing price for the quality.</li>
      <li>Works well for my needs and has amazing staying power..</li>
      <li>The best adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used thanks so much😘</li>
      <li>:) make sure you use rubbing alcohol around hairline before use for a better hold!</li>
      <li>(: love it</li>
      <li>The hold is great but seems a tad weaker than others at the very edges</li>
      <li>Love it ..</li>
      <li>Not so with the Safe Grip.</li>
      <li>Did not hold wig lace for more than 1 day.</li>
      <li>I have used this product since 2000 and I love it and the price and timely manner in which it is sent to you</li>
      <li>Be safe, not stupid.    </li>
      <li>and initially the hold was great.</li>
      <li>and I must say I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>( I use Brandywine wig Cleaner to clean my wigs.)</li>
      <li>I also clean my area with alcohol which helps when applying the lace wigs.</li>
      <li>quick shipping ..</li>
      <li>, we let it get tacky and it held petty good in the front, no so much in the back.</li>
      <li>However, life gives us obtstacles to see how well we get over things, right?</li>
      <li>I normally use tape to secure my lace but someone suggested I try this product</li>
      <li>Clean up is relative easy compared to others.</li>
      <li>It dries clear and The grip is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This glue is great as long as you don&#x27;t sweat or get it wet in anyway.</li>
      <li>Works very well</li>
      <li>This was everything that I expected from an adhesive depending on your skin chemistry you may have to put it on more than a couple of times.</li>
      <li>Holds for weeks at a time, dries fast and is orderless.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>So this glue is fine as long as you aren&#x27;t in heat.</li>
      <li>It claims to last two weeks, what a joke your lucky if it lasts two hours</li>
      <li>I was able to wear the unit for a little over 2 week before I needed to remove it.</li>
      <li>I simply used alcohol with a damp wash cloth and it came right off.</li>
      <li>That is a pretty big price increase.</li>
      <li>Got here early!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone knows of a better product for laying down the back of the hair.</li>
      <li>I like the fact it drys clear.</li>
      <li>Even though I don&#x27;t care much for the price increase, I will end up buying this product in the future.</li>
      <li>Not messy when applying -</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super messy</li>
      <li>I took it to the beautician who usually does my full laces</li>
      <li>I use Walker Safe Grip Adhesive to apply my false eyebrows, which are human hair on a soft gel backing.</li>
      <li>I found the glue to work ok, but it was slow to dry, so I had to let it set on the form for a bit and then put them into the ears.</li>
      <li>but after I blow dried the area it cleared right up...</li>
      <li>I used a Q-tip to apply several layers of the product (to a clean scalp allowing to dry a little in between layers) and the hold was everything!</li>
      <li>Allow first layer to dry and then apply a second, allow to get tacky, but a thin layer on lace...press down &amp; secure with a scarf and let glue set while sleeping.</li>

<li> This was also a little hard to clean out the lace fronts.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well, very greasy and hard to get off</li>
<li> My only complaint would be that the product turned white a little but during my first workout</li>
<li> This product should be in every beauty supply store because are choices are so limited..</li>
<li> so I sweat a little, and the glue turned white and my unit started moving around.</li>
<li> Not worth the money stick with what you know will work.</li>
<li> Apply thin layer to forehead, directly under your hairline.</li>
<li> After returning to the hotel I used the blow dryer to re-adhere the lace to my scalp and tied it down overnight</li>
<li> The downside is it&#x27;s a little gloopy.</li>
<li> Although this glue, like all Walker glues, is medical grade and skin-safe, it is NOT intended for false eyelashes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if would purchase this one again...     </li>
<li> Common sense must prevail here.</li>
<li> This stuff sucks as soon as you start sweating forget it.</li>
<li> Do not tug or pull for at least thirty minutes, if don&#x27;t have the opportunity to set overnight!</li>
<li> This product is messy and nasty</li>
<li> probably the worst glue I have used yet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have Alopecia Areata Universalis. This is a fancy way of saying I don&#x27;t have any hair. Bummer. However, life gives us obtstacles to see how well we get over things, right? I use Walker Safe Grip Adhesive to apply my false eyebrows, which are human hair on a soft gel backing. The glue that comes with the brows is pretty poor, as it caves completely with my oily skin. Not so with the Safe Grip. All Walker glues are exceptional and this is no exception to that! It is odorless, rinses with water but becomes water and oil resistant after it dries. It holds my eyebrows on for up to 5 days, but not with a death grip on my skin. Meaning, I can lift the brows and reposition them if I need to without needing an emergency room visit. (I have no idea how I&#x27;d explain bleeding eyebrows!)    I would recommend this glue to anyone using lace front wigs as well.     Word of caution. Although this glue, like all Walker glues, is medical grade and skin-safe, it is NOT intended for false eyelashes. Common sense must prevail here. The only glues to be used for eyelashes is eyelash glue. Be safe, not stupid.    But for my purposes, using it to apply the eyebrows, it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have attempted to use this adhesive twice to no avail.  It doesn&#x27;t give a good hold; or any hold at all.  I followed all the steps and I am definitely not a beginner when it comes to lace wigs, this adhesive just does not cut it.  Not worth the money stick with what you know will work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing price for the quality. It dries clear and The grip is fantastic. I had to srpay solvent to get it off. Last through sweaty activies. The downside is it&#x27;s a little gloopy.</li>
    <li> I bought this item March of last year. When I purchased this item, it was $4.90. That is a pretty big price increase. I took it to the beautician who usually does my full laces and we applied the glue, we let it get tacky and it held petty good in the front, no so much in the back. I use the tie knot spray prior to applying the glue. I also clean my area with alcohol which helps when applying the lace wigs. I don&#x27;t know if anyone knows of a better product for laying down the back of the hair. This was also a little hard to clean out the lace fronts.( I use Brandywine wig Cleaner to clean my wigs.) Even though I don&#x27;t care much for the price increase, I will end up buying this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since 2000 and I love it and the price and timely manner in which it is sent to you is great.</li>
    <li> Got here early! Works very well :) make sure you use rubbing alcohol around hairline before use for a better hold!(: love it</li>
    <li> I cant say that this is a good hold by itself because I used it along with Supertape and skin protectant. However I have had no lift and my wig is still even after a shower in place as it should be.</li>
    <li> Product work well....Tip: Apply thin layer to forehead, directly under your hairline. Allow first layer to dry and then apply a second, allow to get tacky, but a thin layer on lace...press down &amp; secure with a scarf and let glue set while sleeping. Do not tug or pull for at least thirty minutes, if don&#x27;t have the opportunity to set overnight!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a while. I am so happy I found it.. Works well for my needs and has amazing staying power..Love it ..quick shipping ..This product should be in every beauty supply store because are choices are so limited..&lt;br /&gt;also I like the fact it drys clear.</li>
    <li> Not messy when applying - however you MUST apply several coats in order for the glue to stick to the lace!</li>
    <li> ***UPDATE*** Used several layers (4 total) two days prior to my vacation and initially the hold was great. Immediately after hitting the beach the lace unit started to lift. After returning to the hotel I used the blow dryer to re-adhere the lace to my scalp and tied it down overnight but that didn&#x27;t work. The glue was tacky and started to turn an off white color... I&#x27;m not sure if would purchase this one again...     I normally use tape to secure my lace but someone suggested I try this product and I must say I&#x27;m not disappointed. I used a Q-tip to apply several layers of the product (to a clean scalp allowing to dry a little in between layers) and the hold was everything! I was able to wear the unit for a little over 2 week before I needed to remove it. Because the adhesive is water based, cleaning the product off my unit wasn&#x27;t a hassle. I simply used alcohol with a damp wash cloth and it came right off. My only complaint would be that the product turned white a little but during my first workout but after I blow dried the area it cleared right up... I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This glue is great as long as you don&#x27;t sweat or get it wet in anyway. I used it for work one day, and I&#x27;m outside in the heat so I sweat a little, and the glue turned white and my unit started moving around. So this glue is fine as long as you aren&#x27;t in heat.</li>
    <li> I like this product because there is no latex in it, and it&#x27;s bacteria resistant.  The hold is great but seems a tad weaker than others at the very edges but I often don&#x27;t layer the applications which could be the cause. Clean up is relative easy compared to others.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! The best adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used thanks so much😘</li>
    <li> Works very well. Better than expected. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is messy and nasty it doesn&#x27;t keep the wig on well I didn&#x27;t like this product at all</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well, very greasy and hard to get off</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks as soon as you start sweating forget it. It claims to last two weeks, what a joke your lucky if it lasts two hours it&#x27;s super messy probably the worst glue I have used yet.</li>
    <li> Did not hold wig lace for more than 1 day.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed it to stick Mole foam pads into my Schnauzer pups ears to get them to stand up after an ear crop. I found the glue to work ok, but it was slow to dry, so I had to let it set on the form for a bit and then put them into the ears. It did not work as well as I had hoped for the purpose I needed it for, and the forms came off soon after I put them on.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Holds for weeks at a time, dries fast and is orderless. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This was everything that I expected from an adhesive depending on your skin chemistry you may have to put it on more than a couple of times.</li>
