    <li> I bought this brush previously at my stylist and loved it but she never had another one in stock to buy.  When I saw them on Amazon I snapped it up.  Price was better than stylist&#x27;s  shop.  This brush is terrific for combing though wet hair (I have medium length) without pulling or breaking.</li>
    <li> These are the best!  I have been using these for 25 years.</li>
    <li> Had my brush like this one for @ 15 years..........it was @ 15.00 from the salon I went to back then. I did the happy Wiccan dance when I came across this item and was blown away at the price..........so much so I am buying 2.</li>
    <li> Just a handy little brush for everything.  I use it to get tangles out of wet hair, to &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; it in the morning, tease for a little lift, and quick styling.  It does it all.  It&#x27;s sturdy, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2 years later, it&#x27;s still good as new.  And all the little rubber &#x27;balls&#x27; on the ends of the bristles are still in place, to keep the brush from scratching your scalp.  Pretty impressive.  It sometimes gets jammed in a drawer, so I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s this durable.</li>
    <li> this brush really does add volume and does not cause static electricity...it travels well...it lasts long time...does not crush in hygiene bag...i have 4 of them...</li>
    <li> Great for teasing...friend&#x27;s Aunt tried hers one time and asked her to find one for her...so we did!&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for me and love it.</li>
    <li> Favorite brush for my fine hair!</li>
    <li> best hair brush I have ever owned. Detangles and styles with ease. I had one years ago and looked for a new one...finally found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I have very fine and little hair, so I bought it in the expectation that it would help to lift my do.  However, it has not done so.</li>
    <li> Excellent styling product.  Cricket NEVER disappoings</li>
    <li> I am extremely tender headed and this brush is the first one I have ever used that does and good job and actually feels good on your head.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I wish this brush came in more colors. Every family member likes this brush. I have used this brush for the last twenty years. I ordered several of them because I am afraid it will go away and I wont be able to find a new one.</li>
    <li> My sister has had one of these for 10 years and I&#x27;ve been looking for one.. finally thought to look on Amazon.  great brush.  volumizes well.  no static.  love it</li>
    <li> This brush does not pull hair at all...it glides through easily and gently.  My hair breaks off easily, so I really appreciate a brush that does not pull.  Good quality at a great price!</li>
    <li> I had an old one of these and thought I&#x27;d never find it again but I did here at Amazon. Great brush for my short curly hair. Volumizes without getting puffy.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this Brush, and it absolutely helps reduce static, and adds volume to my baby fine salt and pepper hair!!!!</li>
    <li> my family has used these brushes for years....one was left behind while traveling and I went to the store to replace it for them...only to find out you couldn&#x27;t just go out an buy one anywhere anymore...and no one was willing to give theirs up...so I was delighted to find this source to replace the lost one...walla ...now we all have our own again...</li>
    <li> We had one of these brushes for many years and lost it and it was our favorite brush. I then ordered two of them and now  we each have one. Best brush ever!</li>
