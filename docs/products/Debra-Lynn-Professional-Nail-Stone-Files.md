### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>I received my nail file in the best amount of time.</li>
      <li>I use the best products I can find.</li>
      <li>very good for the cuticles</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Not the best quality nail stone I&#x27;ve used, but it gets the job done for cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking for a finer grit to finish the ends of my nails after filing.</li>
      <li>Since I now do my own nails</li>
      <li>The description does not lie, however, so it was my own fault.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying many more.</li>
      <li>Love this for cuticles.  </li>
      <li>This item is perfect while it is small it needs to be to get in the corners of the cuticle good.</li>
      <li>Inconsistent and get grooves worn in them easily.</li>
      <li>This is a great nail file, especially if your nails are prone to splitting.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this nailfile very very much.</li>
      <li>I was amazed though, how it helps clean up my cuticles and helps keep them manageable.</li>
      <li>This is a nice long sturdy square stone with a medium fine texture.  </li>
      <li>It is quite slender at the tip which is nice to get close to the cuticle without actually damaging your nail.</li>
      <li>The bevelled tip makes it useful for removing excess cuticle and hangnails.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s exactly what it claims to be: a nail stone.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Experiment - first time I used it</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy</li>
      <li>Smaller than expected but does a good job.</li>
      <li>are thick nails, maybe good for toe nails.</li>
      <li>I find the pointed end great for doing pedicures when there is usually a lot of dead skin cells built up around the nail.  </li>
      <li>but if you want to clean it I recommend soaking it in alcohol for about half an hour to an hour rinsing it</li>
      <li>Eons ago when I had my nails done professionally, my manicurist used one of there.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived with bottom of blister pack clipped open but cleverly disguised with clear plastic, then placed in zip lock bag.</li>
      <li>Pretty rough texture.</li>
      <li>It is a very fine grit making it a poor choice for smoothing out nail ends after clipping them.</li>
      <li>It just made my thin nail edges more jagged and peeling.  </li>
      <li>proceed to gently exfoliate with this little stone it takes care of even the hardest cuticles.  </li>
      <li>I push back the cuticles a little with them and gently use back-and-forth motions to take off extra cuticle.  </li>

<li> The &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; emery boards don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> I was wanting the type that smooth thin nails, but this is too rough.  </li>
<li> Maybe that&#x27;s my fault but the packaging was decent, as 5 items came in the same box, but this item, it&#x27;s about 1/4 inch thick and 3 inches long to begin with.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as dense as the ones I get at the beauty store for a similar price, and is harder to use because of that.</li>
<li> I wore away a little of my nail, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal and will grow out, so it takes a few tries to get used to how much to do.  </li>
<li> well than letting it air dry.</li>
<li> A version 1/2 - 3/4\\&quot;  wide would be easier to handle and less likely to break.</li>
<li> Great for taming the cuticles - which for me get unruly and causing a vicious cycle of biting my fingers and torn cuticles.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t use traditional emery boards, they&#x27;re too harsh and make my brittle nails crumble.</li>
<li> The stone works well for quickly shaping and smoothing rough nail edges, but its narrow width makes it difficult to handle.</li>
<li> This small amount is enough to scrape and have the nail come off in layers.</li>
<li> I think this was a previously rejected item.</li>
<li> Not what I expected, small size</li>
<li> Poor quality - a thin stone (much thinner than my old one) and looks like it can be easily broken upon usage.</li>
<li> Narrow width also makes me fear I will snap the stone in half.</li>
<li> then waste of money</li>
<li> It&#x27;s extremely small compared to the photo.</li>
<li> It was looking very thin and fragile.</li>
<li> I continued to use it but got tired of working with the small pieces.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried several times, may be that it&#x27;s just user error.  :(  </li>
<li> The stone came broken, I had to return it without even a test.</li>
<li> One came broken</li>
<li> item arrived broken in 2 pieces.</li>
<li> Thin, AND not dense.  </li>
<li> Now that its broken, its useless.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed at the quality.</li>
<li> Kinda expensive too, for a teensy shaped rock...</li>

    <li> item arrived broken in 2 pieces. It&#x27;s extremely small compared to the photo. Maybe that&#x27;s my fault but the packaging was decent, as 5 items came in the same box, but this item, it&#x27;s about 1/4 inch thick and 3 inches long to begin with. Now that its broken, its useless.</li>
    <li> unless user error--i can&#x27;t get it to work. maybe it&#x27;s me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually owned another of these but it broke (they are fragile). I continued to use it but got tired of working with the small pieces. Here&#x27;s the thing - I can&#x27;t use traditional emery boards, they&#x27;re too harsh and make my brittle nails crumble. The &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; emery boards don&#x27;t last very long. This thing will last just about forever if you don&#x27;t drop it, like I&#x27;ve been known to do.</li>
    <li> Eons ago when I had my nails done professionally, my manicurist used one of there.  Since I now do my own nails I use the best products I can find.</li>
    <li> Pretty rough texture. Tears up my cuticles, which is the opposite of what I was trying to achieve.</li>
    <li> Extremely fragile.  Thin, AND not dense.  Inconsistent and get grooves worn in them easily.</li>
    <li> This is much smaller than the picture makes it seem. The description does not lie, however, so it was my own fault. It is a very fine grit making it a poor choice for smoothing out nail ends after clipping them. Kinda expensive too, for a teensy shaped rock...</li>
    <li> This is a nice long sturdy square stone with a medium fine texture.  I find the pointed end great for doing pedicures when there is usually a lot of dead skin cells built up around the nail.  Simply soak your feet or take a shower then proceed to gently exfoliate with this little stone it takes care of even the hardest cuticles.  You can simply rinse off any skin cells left on the stone but if you want to clean it I recommend soaking it in alcohol for about half an hour to an hour rinsing it well than letting it air dry.</li>
    <li> Great for taming the cuticles - which for me get unruly and causing a vicious cycle of biting my fingers and torn cuticles.  I watched a video on giving yourself manicures and found about these nail stone do-dads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use after soaking nails, dip in water and try it out.  I push back the cuticles a little with them and gently use back-and-forth motions to take off extra cuticle.  Experiment - first time I used it I wore away a little of my nail, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal and will grow out, so it takes a few tries to get used to how much to do.  I was amazed though, how it helps clean up my cuticles and helps keep them manageable.</li>
    <li> Because it&#x27;s exactly what it claims to be: a nail stone.  Works great.  This is like writing a review for a toothpick.</li>
    <li> The stone came broken, I had to return it without even a test. It was looking very thin and fragile.</li>
    <li> One came broken&lt;br /&gt;They are like glass substandard product should have been 99 cents&lt;br /&gt;Even then waste of money</li>
    <li> I was wanting the type that smooth thin nails, but this is too rough.  It would probably work well for gel are thick nails, maybe good for toe nails. It just made my thin nail edges more jagged and peeling.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve tried several times, may be that it&#x27;s just user error.  :(  Just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect while it is small it needs to be to get in the corners of the cuticle good. Very sturdy</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed at the quality. It&#x27;s not as dense as the ones I get at the beauty store for a similar price, and is harder to use because of that. I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long either.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality nail stone I&#x27;ve used, but it gets the job done for cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking for a finer grit to finish the ends of my nails after filing.</li>
    <li> Product is just what i appears. It is quite slender at the tip which is nice to get close to the cuticle without actually damaging your nail. I use it with ProLinc Cuticle eliminator.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, small size</li>
    <li> The stone works well for quickly shaping and smoothing rough nail edges, but its narrow width makes it difficult to handle. Narrow width also makes me fear I will snap the stone in half. A version 1/2 - 3/4\\&quot;  wide would be easier to handle and less likely to break. The bevelled tip makes it useful for removing excess cuticle and hangnails.</li>
    <li> Item arrived with bottom of blister pack clipped open but cleverly disguised with clear plastic, then placed in zip lock bag. As soon as I opened the bag, the nail stone fell out. I think this was a previously rejected item. Poor quality - a thin stone (much thinner than my old one) and looks like it can be easily broken upon usage.</li>
    <li> So for this to work, you do have to apply some degree of pressure and a scrubbing motion. This small amount is enough to scrape and have the nail come off in layers. I don&#x27;t appreciate that. I will stick to a plastic cuticle pusher.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail file, especially if your nails are prone to splitting.</li>
    <li> Smaller than photo but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. This is what the salon uses I went to.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but does a good job. About the size of one of those wood cutical sticks. But it does seem durable</li>
    <li> very good for the cuticles</li>
    <li> I received my nail file in the best amount of time. I enjoyed this nailfile very very much. I plan on buying many more. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Love this for cuticles.  I don&#x27;t even need to get a manicure anymore.  I always went back as my cuticles needed trimming, but I soak the stone and put lotion on my fingers, then push them back and file anything that&#x27;s hanging.  Great!</li>
