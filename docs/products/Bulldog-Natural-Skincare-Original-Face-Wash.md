      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but I don&#x27;t wash my face to smell the cleanser.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Although it is available on Amazon and their own website for sale, it was convenient to just go pick it up at Wholefoods (and it was on sale too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this face washer.</li>
      <li>it worked OK.  </li>

      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more than the facial cleansers you find in a place like Target, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra $2-4.</li>

      <li>So it looks like this is going to be a fairly economical product to use daily as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found my new cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I have tried different products and didn&#x27;t feel like this left me w/ a squeaky clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>It is light and a little like citrus, it&#x27;s just not my thing.</li>
      <li>First face wash I have ever used that actually cleans your face well AND does not dry it out leaving you feeling parched and flaky.</li>
      <li>It is a natural product which cleans well but does not dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>I have battled razor burn for years and after using the face wash and sensitive shave cream, I finally have some relief.</li>
      <li>Totally worth a try for guys looking for a quality product outside of the typical Nivea line-up in stores.</li>

<li> I enjoy this facewash, as it is not overly scented and seems to keep my face less oily without drying it out excessively.</li>
<li> The essential oils and green tea extract leave my skin feeling alive and refreshed after using it.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
<li> Additionally it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face during the winter months.</li>

<li> , it&#x27;s a little bit pricier than the typical face washes out there, but I think it&#x27;ll be hard to find this type of quality product at this price.</li>
<li> I recommend it as I have been using it for the past year</li>
<li> It gets rid of the dirt, but I have found my acne has gotten worse since I switched from a Neutrogena face wash to this.</li>
<li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>

    <li> Awesome Face Wash.  Its cleans my face extremely well and helps with complexction.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good natural face wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. It does not foam up that well which some might not like but it&#x27;s not a problem for me since it still gets the job done without a big lather.</li>
    <li> Having tried this face wash, my face has never felt cleaner. It is a natural product which cleans well but does not dry out your skin. My feels so good when I am finished cleaning. I have moderately oily skin and it has done very well in balancing my skin. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found my new cleanser.  The essential oils and green tea extract leave my skin feeling alive and refreshed after using it.  In short order, I think I&#x27;ll be converting to the full Bull Dog line!</li>
    <li> The only product my husband will use. Loves it!</li>
    <li> First face wash I have ever used that actually cleans your face well AND does not dry it out leaving you feeling parched and flaky. I have tried some other brands and they don&#x27;t seem to get the cleaning part done well and you have to use a lot. This product only requires a pea-sized amount on you fingers and it lathers ever so slightly and does the job. So it looks like this is going to be a fairly economical product to use daily as well. Beats the heck out of using soap for this aging guy&#x27;s face. Smells good too without leaving any scent after use.</li>
    <li> Anything from Bulldog is great! I have battled razor burn for years and after using the face wash and sensitive shave cream, I finally have some relief. I won&#x27;t use anything else now, you can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
    <li> Decent face wash. It gets rid of the dirt, but I have found my acne has gotten worse since I switched from a Neutrogena face wash to this. It smells pretty great though.</li>
    <li> After reading about Bulldog products from menshealth.com, I decided to give this guy a try. Although it is available on Amazon and their own website for sale, it was convenient to just go pick it up at Wholefoods (and it was on sale too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up both the Face Wash (daily use) and the Face Scrub (one/twice per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I really like the products. The scent is interestingly pleasant (if you&#x27;re big on how things smell, you should check it out at the stores before purchasing), the cleaning does well without leaving my skin too dry, and my skin feel felt like it was ready for my moisturizer (Kiehl&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it&#x27;s a little bit pricier than the typical face washes out there, but I think it&#x27;ll be hard to find this type of quality product at this price.</li>
    <li> I love this face washer. It cleans well and smells nice. I use it every morning and my skin feels great after using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I recommend it as I have been using it for the past year</li>
    <li> Great wash. Very refreshing and cleansing.</li>
    <li> I have not used face wash before, but since I started using this a bump that has been on my face for the past few months is starting to go away. The face wash also smells fresh and leaves me feeling refreshed.</li>

    <li> My husband was having some itching on his face - reason? used bath soap. Problem? Did not want to use a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s&amp;#34; face wash. Solution? Bulldog.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is a superb product. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but I don&#x27;t wash my face to smell the cleanser. It is light and a little like citrus, it&#x27;s just not my thing. It is still the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used and I am hooked.</li>
    <li> This product smells fantastic and is a great face wash. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever, for a mans face!</li>
    <li> it worked OK.  I have tried different products and didn&#x27;t feel like this left me w/ a squeaky clean feeling.  It smells nice though.  Also didn&#x27;t find that lathered particularly well.</li>

Totally worth a try for guys looking for a quality product outside of the typical Nivea line-up in stores.</li>
    <li> I understand its a gel and it will not be foamy but this immediately dries on the face. You need to rub face constantly with some water. Better alternatives available for the same price or less</li>
    <li> seems very water based. I like the product when using a buff brush. It doesnt seem to do much good without one</li>
    <li> Does a nice job cleaning my face. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
