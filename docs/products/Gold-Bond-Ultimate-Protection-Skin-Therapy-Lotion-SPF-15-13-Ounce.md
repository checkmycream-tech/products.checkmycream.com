      <li>smell is wonderful</li>
      <li>This is Gold Bonds best lotion</li>
      <li>This is a body lotion with SPF that both feels and smells great.</li>
      <li>Great lotion not greasy not smelly</li>
      <li>This product is great.  </li>
      <li>as a diabetic she can not use most skin products, but this is the best.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted a good moisturizer with sun protection.</li>
      <li>As even our kids say, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s good stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Great scent, non-greasy and light on the skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice creamy lotion that feels moisturizing on the skin.  </li>
      <li>and i liked the produce expect the cap being leaky.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on smooth and works very nice as a sunscreen, love it, as I tend to tan just by looking at the sun. :)</li>
      <li>It feels nice, spreads easily, and keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>This is a favorite and it has SPF 15.</li>
      <li>I have used this brand of lotion for many years.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>used to be able to order them online from Walmart</li>
      <li>As many said, can&#x27;t find a lotion with sunscreen in stores.</li>
      <li>Gold Bond has a nice, clean, herbal scent and leaves a healthy sheen on your skin.</li>
      <li>It smells good and it&#x27;s nice to be able to get sun protection while feeling soft and not greasy.</li>
      <li>This 15 SPF lotion is excellent all year long.</li>
      <li>Feels good, not greasy, and has the most amazing fresh natural scent.</li>
      <li>and they indeed confirmed that the lotion is discontinued.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it didn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell, but it has a light smell.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent, not the tropical, coconut smell that a lot of sunscreens have.</li>
      <li>So glad I finally found a good lotion with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Not sweet or flowery, just fresh and wonderful.</li>
      <li>The scent dissipates quickly, and is so light, it&#x27;s as close to unscented as it could be.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and go to school in Los Angeles and need to wear SPF everyday and now I can but without smelling like sunscreen!</li>
      <li>I use it all over (not on my face, although I probably could - just very fond of my tinted moisturizer) and it really sinks into my skin and most importantly does not leave any sticky residue.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Would buy again if I were to find it for a reasonable price again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this skin therapy lotion for years, and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It is always very soothing</li>
      <li>When I received my new bottles and used it for the first time, I was surprised by how much DIRT was attracted to my arms and legs while out mowing!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was the only lotion I used for the last four years, I absolutely love the SPF 15, my skin is protected all day in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>This is every bit as good as the more expensive moisturizing lotions, and will last a long time.</li>
      <li>It does what I want it to do..Keeps skin soft &amp; protects from the sun.</li>
      <li>My skin gets very dry in the winter and then when spring has sprung I need a really good moisturizer to hydrate that tired winter skin and sun protection too.</li>
      <li>My wife uses this product all the time and will use no other.</li>
      <li>i like goldbond in general</li>

<li> Gold Bond not only has a subtle fresh scent but it also absorbs well and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
<li> I have used this sunscreen lotion in the past and really liked it, but have been unable to find it locally.</li>
<li> Now it seems extra greasy and never really dries on your skin.</li>
<li> for my dry skin</li>
<li> As a guy, it&#x27;s tough to find a lotion that does not make you smell like a girl or is really greasy.  </li>
<li> Getting harder and harder to find.</li>
<li> Wished I had spent the money on another brand......</li>
<li> I just bought 4 bottles but they are harder and harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I like the SPF in it too as it&#x27;s hard to find regular lotions with an SPF.</li>
<li> Only complaint is I wish it did not irritate the eyes when it comes in contact with them.</li>
<li> I will not buy any other body lotion!</li>
<li> It is slightly herbal (?) to me.</li>
<li> I use it every day in the winter to protect my skin from the cold winter air outside, the dry, heated air inside, and the harmful effects of the sun.</li>
<li> I wear it on my hands and keep a small bottle in my car, too.</li>
<li> The lotion formula must have been changed, because this never happened while using it in the past.</li>
<li> I like this Gold Bond lotion because it is thick but it absorbs into the skin.</li>
<li> Hard to find that combination!</li>
<li> Sad Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer it in the subscribe and save anymore.</li>
<li> This lotion is nearly impossible to purchase in stores.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but just not my preference.</li>
<li> Too bad Gold Bond discontinued this lotion.</li>
<li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it is very annoying.</li>

    <li> I will not buy any other body lotion! I have very fair skin and go to school in Los Angeles and need to wear SPF everyday and now I can but without smelling like sunscreen! Gold Bond not only has a subtle fresh scent but it also absorbs well and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. The only place I can still get this lotion is amazon! They don&#x27;t sell it in MA or CA anymore, I did find it in IL still but I cannot switch to another lotion now that I&#x27;ve gotten hooked on this one!</li>
    <li> This is a nice creamy lotion that feels moisturizing on the skin.  I was hoping it didn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell, but it has a light smell.  I still like this lotion, but next time will try to find a lotion with SPF that has no smell whatsoever.</li>
    <li> It does what I want it to do..Keeps skin soft &amp; protects from the sun. I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this skin therapy lotion for years, and I really like it. I use it every day in the winter to protect my skin from the cold winter air outside, the dry, heated air inside, and the harmful effects of the sun. There&#x27;s not a lot of sun in the winter, but there is some, so this lotion with SPF 15 is just enough to protect my skin from further aging. It feels nice, spreads easily, and keeps my skin moisturized all day. It has a light scent, not the tropical, coconut smell that a lot of sunscreens have. The scent dissipates quickly, and is so light, it&#x27;s as close to unscented as it could be. Don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s inexpensive price fool you. This is every bit as good as the more expensive moisturizing lotions, and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Only complaint is I wish it did not irritate the eyes when it comes in contact with them.</li>
    <li> So glad I finally found a good lotion with sunscreen. As many said, can&#x27;t find a lotion with sunscreen in stores. The lotion goes on smooth and works very nice as a sunscreen, love it, as I tend to tan just by looking at the sun. :)</li>
    <li> As a guy, it&#x27;s tough to find a lotion that does not make you smell like a girl or is really greasy.  This Gold Bond does not do either and it has SPF 15 which is a bonus for daily use.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for awhile now. Feels good, not greasy, and has the most amazing fresh natural scent. Not sweet or flowery, just fresh and wonderful.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS! My wife uses this product all the time and will use no other. as a diabetic she can not use most skin products, but this is the best.</li>
    <li> Too bad Gold Bond discontinued this lotion. I just bought 4 bottles but they are harder and harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to order them online from Walmart but when they didn&#x27;t offer it anymore I contacted Gold Bond and they indeed confirmed that the lotion is discontinued. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the only lotion I used for the last four years, I absolutely love the SPF 15, my skin is protected all day in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s greasy at all. It just feels right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the lotion like I do... grab the last bottles (even if pricier) while the supply lasts.</li>
    <li> This lotion is nearly impossible to purchase in stores. Gold Bond has a nice, clean, herbal scent and leaves a healthy sheen on your skin. This 15 SPF lotion is excellent all year long. I wear it on my hands and keep a small bottle in my car, too. Our hands are constantly exposed to the sun when we drive and I believe this has prevented me from getting age spots on my hands!</li>
    <li> I really like this as an everyday all over body sunscreen.  Its not greasy, its is lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (for me) is the scent. It is slightly herbal (?) to me. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but just not my preference. I would prefer a non-scented or fruity fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase (because I like the product), even though I am not a fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> It is non-greasy, healing and stays on longer than the flowery smelling types.  As even our kids say, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s good stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use it every morning as part of my routine.  Great scent, non-greasy and light on the skin.  2nd bottle Ive used</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of lotion for many years. It is always very soothing</li>
    <li> i purchased it bc i like goldbond in general and i liked the produce expect the cap being leaky. it is very annoying.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gold Bond for years, but for some reason I cannot find the SPF 15 locally</li>
    <li> Best product in this catagory. Getting harder and harder to find. Thankfully I can still order here</li>
    <li> This is a favorite and it has SPF 15.</li>
    <li> This is Gold Bonds best lotion and I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in area stores??????</li>
    <li> This is a body lotion with SPF that both feels and smells great. Hard to find that combination! I hope they continue to make this product, because it took me YEARS to find one that I like!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a good moisturizer with sun protection. My skin gets very dry in the winter and then when spring has sprung I need a really good moisturizer to hydrate that tired winter skin and sun protection too. I use it all over (not on my face, although I probably could - just very fond of my tinted moisturizer) and it really sinks into my skin and most importantly does not leave any sticky residue.</li>

    <li> I have used this sunscreen lotion in the past and really liked it, but have been unable to find it locally. When I received my new bottles and used it for the first time, I was surprised by how much DIRT was attracted to my arms and legs while out mowing! I was covered in it! The lotion formula must have been changed, because this never happened while using it in the past. Now it seems extra greasy and never really dries on your skin. Wished I had spent the money on another brand......and I got four bottles of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this Gold Bond lotion because it is thick but it absorbs into the skin. I like the SPF in it too as it&#x27;s hard to find regular lotions with an SPF. Living in Texas I wear some form of sun screen daily, especially on my hands and arms.</li>
    <li> AWESOME---Like ALL GoldBond products!</li>
    <li> In an area where sunshine is prevalent, Gold Bond Ultimate Protection is a must.</li>
    <li> Great lotion not greasy not smelly&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my dry skin</li>
