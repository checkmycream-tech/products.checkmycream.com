      <li>I strongly recommend it to those who want a really wavy shiny hair</li>
      <li>We were so excited to get this curl press expecting to have the nice long spiral curls</li>
      <li>Love this, my daughter has extremely fine hair and these curls will last for 3 days!!</li>
      <li>I am going to try to use it one more time before I completely give up on it</li>
      <li>I do not find the curl press function useful.</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron Ive seen it used properly and it turns out beautiful however trying to use this yourself is not easy....</li>
      <li>and my hair is very straight.</li>
      <li>I have tried spiral curling stylers in the past that really did not deliver great curls, but this one is different.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Not only was it exactly what I ordered but it also got to my house faster then estimated... and considering that I live in Alaska, USA; where things are always later; it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>It has the spiral guide, check, ends clip, check....doing it on the back of your head yourself...not so easy.</li>
      <li>Just wish it was exactly the same as the original model.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very time consuming</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to offer as much space nor do the curls hold as well.</li>
      <li>By the way, I have layered straight hair with the longest length reaching below the chest area.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair looks really curly.</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>maybe suitable for little girls or those who have fine short to medium length hair not for me though</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;ve researched more on other products and bought Remington curling wand.</li>
      <li>That was fine by me, I think it&#x27;s cuter that way, but if you want your curls to go to your roots, and you have very long hair, then this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>This curling iron is decent, but often gets caught in my hair when I unroll it.</li>
      <li>I have long, soft hair that curls easily</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the spiral styler over the curl press.</li>
      <li>I started using this curling iron 5 years ago until it was covered in hair spray grime (my fault) and I needed a new one.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or what.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas!  </li>
      <li>It gave me sexy curly/wavy hair result in so much lesser time than expected!</li>

      <li>After a few tries - I was able to get a decent hairstyle.</li>
      <li>The curls are tight and last a long time, I would even recommend this product to a novice stylist,it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>

    <li> I thought curling my hair with this device would take me lesser time, but I was soooo wrong. It could only curl few strands of hair per roll! I was a bit upset because I brought this when I traveled to other country for a wedding party and I didn&#x27;t use it prior to that event; therefore, I never knew its performance beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;ve researched more on other products and bought Remington curling wand. And bam! It gave me sexy curly/wavy hair result in so much lesser time than expected! I recommend the Remington instead of this. By the way, I have layered straight hair with the longest length reaching below the chest area.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes! It has the spiral guide, check, ends clip, check....doing it on the back of your head yourself...not so easy. If you have help then its pretty good</li>
    <li> I purchase it for my wife birthday and she loves it.work out perfect.</li>
    <li> I dont use it, because I&#x27;m actually having a hard time trying to figure out how to use it! The hair goes in all types of direction, maybe I will get the hang of it watching a video</li>
    <li> good for very small jobs small strains of hair barrel size to small for those with long hair very tedious. maybe suitable for little girls or those who have fine short to medium length hair not for me though</li>
    <li> Love this, my daughter has extremely fine hair and these curls will last for 3 days!! Usually curls fall out of her hair after a half day.  I found that by putting hair wax in first and then curling it works like magic, and leaves beautiful spiral curls.  Would buy another.</li>
    <li> I have tried spiral curling stylers in the past that really did not deliver great curls, but this one is different.&lt;br /&gt;The iron makes great spirals, and the curls hold all day.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is decent, but often gets caught in my hair when I unroll it. My hair styles also don&#x27;t seem to stay for more than an hour. That may not be the curling iron, but I never had a problem with my old curling iron. I do not find the curl press function useful.</li>

    <li> I love this curling iron Ive seen it used properly and it turns out beautiful however trying to use this yourself is not easy....and I went to cosmetology school.</li>
    <li> So this on youtube.  LIked what it could do.  Does curl nicely.  Will use often.  Daughter likes it to.  Will be a staple for us both.</li>
    <li> This curler works absolutely perfect</li>
    <li> I started using this curling iron 5 years ago until it was covered in hair spray grime (my fault) and I needed a new one. For about $20, this is the best curling iron in my eyes! I use it for all kinds of occassions: prom, girls nights out, weddings, and I even plan on using it to curl my 2.5 feet of hair on my own wedding day in a year. I use it to do my friends hair as well. Two of my friends have had me order them their own because they love the results! I&#x27;m thinking about stocking up on these so that I&#x27;ll have them to last me throughout the rest of my life in case Conair decides to take it off the market.</li>
    <li> Maybe things have changed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have sworn I had this same Conair brand years ago, so imagine my excitement when I seen it on sale on Amazon. WRONG!!! I had such a hard time maneuvering these curlers - you would have thought I was practicing ballet in the mirror. After a few tries - I was able to get a decent hairstyle. I will probably just end up giving this away or donating it.</li>
    <li> This was my FAVE hair curler! Mine broke after having for several years. This became the replacement model. Doesn&#x27;t seem to offer as much space nor do the curls hold as well. Maybe the heat distribution is different in this model? Over all I am happy with it. Just wish it was exactly the same as the original model.</li>
    <li> Great for spiral curls!</li>
    <li> VERY VERY cute tool. I love it and I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all! ^_____^ it stays spiral even if i dont have a hair spray! and my hair is very straight. and usually curler irons don&#x27;t last long on my hair.</li>
    <li> This did not hold my hair correctly to curl it. Very disappointed and wishing I hadn&#x27;t wasted money on it.</li>
    <li> Fun to use and great curls, but for those with lots of hair, prepare to take hours to curl it all using this spiral iron. It&#x27;s a little difficult to use, but also only holds a very small amount of hair at a time to curl,  so in essence - takes a ridiculous amount of time to do curls all over your head. However, if you&#x27;re patient and willing to put in the time, the curls are amazing!</li>
    <li> makes absolutely beautiful curls, kinda takes awhile, but it is nice once you get the hang of how to work the item.  practice lots!</li>
    <li> Love these spiral curler</li>
    <li> It is the same as I was looking for! I strongly recommend it to those who want a really wavy shiny hair</li>
    <li> It was for my Granddaughter, and she loved it. I really have great luck with item I buy. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My hair was tangled in this, it was hard to use, and not worth the money.  I highly recommend the spiral styler over the curl press.</li>
    <li> I love it ! It works really great &amp; it didn&#x27;t take that long for it to come. The curls I had from it were perfect!</li>
    <li> not for long hair... I could not understand how to wind my hair (below shoulder length) around to get a good spiral.</li>
    <li> Pulls hairs occasionally but does the job for the price</li>
    <li> I have long, soft hair that curls easily and so do my daughters.  We were so excited to get this curl press expecting to have the nice long spiral curls but it doesn&#x27;t work well and what it does do takes forever.  I don&#x27;t know if it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough or what.  I am going to try to use it one more time before I completely give up on it but as for now it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This makes some really nice curls but it&#x27;s pretty tedious to roll the small strips of hair onto.  You have to use pretty small ribbons of hair or it doesnt work too well.  It&#x27;s very time consuming and I think if you use a regular small iron you can get basically the same effect.  If your looking for a fu new iron get a deep waver iron!  Gorgeous waves!</li>
    <li> It does not hold onto the hair properly. The hair keeps slipping out of clip before you can even twirl the hair up.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sons girlfriend cause she likes to do her hair-- she loves it and uses it all the time</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Makes your hair looks really curly. I use it mostly on my daughters hair. I recommend this for easy curls.</li>
    <li> Amazing curls once you get the hang of it. I am not able to curl my own hair  with it, but I use it on my daughters hair and get beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> This Iron makes great curls and so easy to use. Its a very good product and it&#x27;s at a fair price.</li>
    <li> It is literally the ONLY curler out there that curls my hair. The curls come out super cute, too! The only con is that for people with very long hair, like myself, you can&#x27;t curl very high, only the bottom half of your hair. That was fine by me, I think it&#x27;s cuter that way, but if you want your curls to go to your roots, and you have very long hair, then this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awesome!  My 8 year old daughter has really long hair.  The curls stay put!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I&#x27;ve had it for two months. The curls turn out amazing and it heats up really quickly.</li>
    <li> You can only curl a very small strand at a time which is time consuming. If you have long hair, takes even longer. I am a licensed stylist and definitely would not use again</li>
    <li> This curling iron makes fun spiral curls for my little girls. So cute and easy. They really love it too.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron that I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is extremely hard to curl, and with this iron, my hair can finally hold a curl.</li>
    <li> It is an ok product I just don&#x27;t like that it is to small so it will take forever to curl your hair! But the curls come out beautiful!</li>
    <li> It works really well I bought it about 3 years ago and it still works great I don&#x27;t use it often because it make really really tight curls</li>
    <li> The curls are tight and last a long time, I would even recommend this product to a novice stylist,it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought this last Christmas for my 12-year-old granddaughter who specifically asked for this particular one. Have had no complaints so I am supposing she is happy with it. She would have told me if she was not. We are states away and she had sent me a pix of how awful (she thought) her hair looked via the \\&quot;old\\&quot; curler she had, lol.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price! !!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas!  She LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it!!!  She has VERY long thick hair and it actually holds for a couple of days!  She used it on my other daughter who has thin long hair and her curls also stayed in for a couple of days.  She actually has people at school asking her what curling iron she used, (even her teacher.)!!!!!</li>
    <li> A bit too complicated to use. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t make those lovely hanging curls that you see on the box.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect curling iron for spiral effect! The iron keeps the hair tight and smooth, as a result perfect curls.</li>
